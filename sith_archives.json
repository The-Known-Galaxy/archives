{"name":"sith","categories":{"Order Information":{"articles":{"Monthly Events":{"content":"# Overview\nIn our order there are three different monthly events made to test your creativity, skill, and even your sense of style. Hosted monthly, each one of them guarantees a special title for the duration of the month, along with plenty of other interesting prizes. These events are known as “Lord of the Drip”, “Wrath of the Dark Lord” and “Artificer of the Dark Lord”.# About \"Lord of the Drip\"\nFirst hosted on the February 5th 2022 at 2 PM ET, by the Overlord of the Sphere of Laws & Justice Darth Havok, better known as OmegaVanquished. Today it still stands as a very appreciated and fun event that’s hosted monthly. Since its creation, Lord of the Drip has always been in the hands and jurisdiction of the Sphere of Laws & Justice. \nThe event consists of an outfit competition. There are three different “themes” the participants must base their outfits off of. The themes aren’t actually restricted to the Star Wars Universe: there may be themes like “Cyberpunk”, “Halloween” or even “Wild West”. The three themes remain completely secret until they are revealed throughout the event. \nThe event structure is usually as follows: it begins with all participants lining up and waiting for the event to start. The first theme is revealed, and all participants are given a countdown of usually 15 minutes to update their roblox avatar and build their outfit. As a result this obviously makes it pretty hard to participate in the event without a vast collection of roblox items or robux. Nevertheless, after the countdown ends all people respawn and line back up to be judged one by one by a team of 3-4 judges, usually L&J members, who shall give a 1 to 10 vote to the outfit. Then, the cycle is repeated for the second theme, and then for the third. In the end, all votes are summed up and the one who has obtained the highest score is crowned “Lord of the Drip”. \nThe winner receives a unique role in the Sith Order’s discord server, and before the rewrite, the title would also show in-game. Since the 3rd of April, first place in Lord of the Drip would also determine a prize of 1,000 robux, although after the 2nd of July, the prize was changed to 7,500 in-game credits for lightsaber hilt customization. \nAs of today, the most proficient participant to Lord of the Drip is Chilimeni, having gotten the first place in Lord of the Drip twice, being the only one to have done so. ChillPain is also a very proficient participant, having arrived at the podium three times in total. Additional users who won at least once are: JeruShiro, Gh0stOrigin, Skahtos, Vulcan_Volcano, and Youngboyboosie.\n\n# About “Wrath of the Dark Lord”\nFirst hosted on the February 12th 2022 at 4 PM ET, by the Overlord of the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy Darth Lividus, better known as TaitusTemenos, is one of the most competitive and difficult events hosted monthly. It is managed by Expansion & Diplomacy, although this doesn’t prevent the sphere’s members from participating.  \nThe event consists of a 1v1 elimination tournament. It is quite similar to The Jedi Order’s “Duelist of the Order”, or the event “Duelist of the Galaxy” in which both orders participate. The event is restricted to Adept+, regardless of sphere. All participants must register themselves about a day before the event. After the registrations close, the tournament brackets are organized and published, this way everyone can see who they’re going against before the event starts. The title of “Wrath of the Dark Lord'' actually originates from a special rank that existed in The Sith Order before Vermened became the Dark Lord, and signified being the second-in-command of the whole group. It used to be held by KentuckySquid. \nThe event per se is pretty simple. All participants join the game and wait for their turn to fight. When it comes, they enter the dueling area and fight a best-of-three duel to pass to the next stage. Those who pass advance to the next duel, and those who are defeated are eliminated. This continues until there are only two contenders: in which a final duel decides the true Wrath of the Dark Lord. The loser of the final duel occupies the second place, and the third place is defined by an extra duel between the two losers of the semi-finals. Of course this event has changed a lot throughout the months: map changes, combat system changes, new forms being added… There are plenty of variables, but this still remains a fairly accurate way to prove one’s proficiency in combat. \nThe winner receives a unique role in the Sith Order’s Discord server, and before the rewrite the title would also show in-game. Since the 11th of March, first place in Wrath of the Dark Lord would also determine a prize of 1,000 robux, although after the 25th of June, the prize was changed to 7,500 in-game credits for lightsaber hilt customization. Additional benefits of winning the tournament consist in being an honorary member of the Dark Lord’s Powerbase (although technically not in the Dark Council), and access to expanded boundaries on Dathomir. Not only that, but those on the podium often get a DC | Combat Proficiency accolade and some even gain access to the prized Advanced Combat Manual. \nAs of today the most proficient participant to Wrath of the Dark Lord is ChillPain, having gotten the first place in Wrath of the Dark Lord twice in a row. Vandradtica is also a very proficient participant, having arrived at the podium three times in total. Additional users who won at least once are: Esociety, Vesparum, keys14, and Chilimeni.\n\n# About “Artificer of the Dark Lord”\nFirst organized on the February 13th 2022, by the Overlord of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy Darth Praefectus, better known as xLiamint, is a more relaxing and laid-back event focused on creativity, and is organized by the Sphere of Sith Philosophy. \nThe event consists in a free submission of any creation, which is usually about the Sith Order: music, writing, art, edits, and more are all valid submissions. Once the event is announced, a channel in the discord opens for submissions, and after a week they are closed to be judged. After the first, second and third place submissions are decided upon by the Inner Circle of Sith Philosophy, they are announced. \nThe winner receives a unique role in the Sith Order’s Discord server, and before the rewrite, the title would also show in-game. Since the 11th of March, first place in Artificer of the Dark Lord would also determine a prize of 1,000 robux, as well as one month of Nitro Classic to the second place, although after the 10th of July the prize was changed to 7,500 in-game credits for lightsaber hilt customization. \nAs of today, the most proficient participant to Artificer of the Dark Lord is Aathic, having gotten the first place in Artificer of the Dark Lord twice. Brolion1 was also a very proficient participant, having arrived at the podium three times in total. Additional users who won at least once are: Stalechite, Stellarch, 6lkingpoint2, and HissingScorpion.\n\n","meta":{"index":5,"author":"Remalior","name":"Monthly Events","release_year":2022}},"Raids":{"content":"# Offensive Raids:\nOffensive raids are attacks against the Jedi planned by the Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy. Regularly hosted on Fridays, the raid will usually be announced 1-3 days before the actual event so people have time to prepare for the raid. Everyone gathers 15 minutes before the raid to make sure the plans are concise and everyone is on the same page. Occasionally, Ancient Knowledge will meet up and collaborate to pirate Jedi Archives. We all stand STS in front of the person commanding the raid and oftentimes we split up into 2 groups; a flanking group and a main force. Sometimes we set a group of people forward for a distraction. We rush in and start raiding, killing and gaining as much ground in the temple as possible. If Ancient Knowledge attends, we make a stop at the archives and start pirating articles and steal any information possible. Once everyone is done we exit the library and continue attacking until Jedi forces wear out. Then we all meet up and take a group photo. Then the raid is concluded.# Defensive Raids:\nA Defensive Raid occurs when the Jedi are attacking us and we must defend Dathomir. These raids consist of Jedi raids, JAT raids, and Temple Guard raids. Once an alert is made, we all get on that can and assist in the defense of  the temple. The most important task is to keep the Jedi out of the archives no matter the cost. The raid ends whenever all Jedi leave the Temple on Dathomir.\n\n# Flash Raids:\nFlash raids happen when there is an unplanned raid. They usually appear for two reasons; from a Jedi raid, or a pop-up raid. These raids are usually very simplistic and attendance for these raids aren't as high as defensive or offensive raids.\n\n","meta":{"index":6,"author":"Long_Guy27","name":"Raids","release_year":2022}},"Order Leadership":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Order Leadership team consists of the Dark Council, the Dark Lord’s Powerbase, and of course, the Dark Lord himself. Without this team, the Sith Order wouldn’t be able to function nor thrive as it has done during its lifetime. This leadership comprises various Darths that serve on the Dark Council and act as Overlords of the different Spheres of Influence within the Sith Order; the Powerbase serves to be powerful figures within the Sith Order that organize and act as the second command of the entirety of the Sith. All of those with these leadership positions are led by the Dark Lord of the Sith, the all-powerful figure that holds oversight of the Sith Order.# Overlord of Laws and Justice\nThe Overlord of Laws and Justice is one of the five Dark Councilors that govern the Sith Order and ensure its welfare. As the title implies, the Overlord of Laws and Justice holds supreme authority over the Sphere of Laws and Justice, a pillar of the Sith Order that holds the responsibility of managing law enforcement and a multitude of other judicial systems. ArgusOtto was the first to claim this position under the rule of Darth Validus.\n\n# Overlord of Sith Philosophy\nWithout a proper academy or training protocol, the Sith Order could not see the proper progression, training, and ascension of its Sith; hence the addition of a Sith Lord to the Order leadership to create these systems. The Overlord of Sith Philosophy runs the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and is responsible for its academic curriculum as well as all aspects related to such. Under the rule of Darth Validus, the Sith Order gained xLiamint as the first Overlord of Sith Philosophy.\n\n# Overlord of Expansion and Diplomacy\nAs with many of the spheres during Darth Validus’s initial reforms as the Dark Lord, Expansion of Diplomacy required a Dark Councilor to serve as its overseer and addition to the leadership team. This Overlord leads the Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy with great valor and acts as the commanding Sith Lord in the majority of the raids conducted against the Jedi. Darth Validus accepted KennaexMalvern as the first Overlord of Expansion and Diplomacy when the Order began to see a newer generation.\n\n# Will of the Dark Lord\nThe Will of the Dark Lord is one of two positions that reside within the Dark Lord’s Powerbase. This wise, quick-witted, and intelligent Sith Lord serves as the primary oversight of the Dark Council and its operations at the desire of the Dark Lord. It is a vital task of the Will to ensure quality and competence within the Dark Council as well as leading their congregations; however, the Will of the Dark Lord also partakes in other duties involving organization amongst the Sith Order’s systems and protocols as a whole. With this individual a part of the Dark Lord’s powerbase, fluency is established throughout the Sith. Reavion was the first to join the Darth Validus’s Powerbase as the Will of the Dark Lord.\n\n# The Dark Lord of the Sith\nThe Dark Lord of the Sith is the de-facto leader of the entire Sith Order. Only those with the greatest power, wisdom, and authoritative nature are able to be deemed the Dark Lord of the Sith. Fedlz was the first Dark Lord of the Sith and was later succeeded by Vermened, also known as Darth Validus.\n\n# Hand of the Dark Lord\nSimilar to the Will of the Dark Lord, the Hand of the Dark Lord is another Sith Lord that works on behalf of the Dark Lord as his Powerbase. The Hand holds immense valor and leadership, it is also because of some of these traits that this member of the Powerbase acts as the primary oversight of the Sith Honor Guard; a division devoted to the safety of the Dark Council, the Powerbase, and the Dark Lord himself. As such, The Hand of the Dark Lord ensures this expression of valor, power, and supremacy is conveyed to the rest of the Sith Order. Darth Validus invited the once Overlord of Expansion and Diplomacy: KennaexMalvern into his Powerbase to serve as the first Hand of the Dark Lord.\n\n# Retired Positions\nThe Sith Order had already seen the abolishment of many different roles within the Sith Order, but these eradications also existed within the Order leadership.\n\nCommandant of the Dark Honor Guard: The one who held this title was a Dark Councilor overseer of the Dark Honor Guard. Similar to the Hand of the Dark Lord, the Commandant handled the operations of the Dark Honor Guard, held a seat on the Dark Council, and also held a seat in the Order’s leadership. LucifersWrath was the first and only Commandant of the Dark Honor Guard under the rule of Darth Validus.\n\nOverlord of Ancient Knowledge: Yet another Sith Lord that occupied a seat within the Dark Council, the Overlord of Ancient Knowledge was the oversight of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, a pillar of the Sith Order that held responsibility for the Sith Archives and preservation of knowledge. This sphere of influence was also abolished following the ascension of Darth Reavion to the Dark Lord’s Powerbase. Before Darth Reavion’s advancement into the Powerbase, he held supreme control over the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge. Just like the Commandant of the Dark Honor Guard, Darth Reavion was the first and only Overlord of Ancient Knowledge.\n\nOverlord of Mysteries: Yet another Lord holding a Darth title that sits on the Dark Council which influences the Sith Order’s welfare, the Overlord of Mysteries was a newer introduction to the Order’s leadership after a few large-scale changes. This Sith Lord acts as oversight of the Sphere of Mysteries, all of its members following the command and desire of the Overlord of this sphere. Morsaki was the first to fill in for this newer position by order of Darth Validus.\n\nOverlord of Defense and Security: The Overlord of Defense and Security was another position established by Darth Validus within the Order leadership alongside the Overlord of Mysteries. This Dark Councilor holds responsibility for the Sphere of Defense and Security; ensuring that no hostile foreigners invade the Enclave. The Dark Lord chose to appoint reyrosky as the first Overlord of Defense and Security when the sphere first made itself known.\n\n","meta":{"index":4,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Order Leadership","release_year":2022}},"The Three Orders":{"content":"# Overview\nThe system known as “Three Orders” was based on the presence of three centralized Spheres of Influence, with one “Order” division under each - therefore, only three spheres with three Orders. This system was extremely similar to The Jedi Order’s three council system: \nThe Librarians’ Assembly manages the Jedi Archives and serves under the Council of First Knowledge, like the Order of the Loremaster managed the Sith Archives and served under the Sphere of Sith Philosophy. The Jedi Assault Team is an elite fighting division and serves under the Council of Reassignment, like the Order of the Immortal acted as an elite fighting division under the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy. \nThis system was around for about two months: from the initial Order of the Loremaster’s creation on the 5th of March to the removal of all Orders on the 8th of May. The three Orders were introduced in the following order: \n-Order of the Loremaster on the 5th of March\n-Order of the Oracle on the 18th of April\n-Order of the Immortal on the 19th of April \nWhilst all three were decommissioned on the same day.# About the Order of the Loremaster\nThe Order of the Loremaster was under the jurisdiction of Sith Philosophy and led by Chilimeni. It was a small organization with ranks and duties very similar to the ones of the current Ancient Knowledge. The sphere itself managed to deliver a good amount of articles weekly, although wasn’t very demanding to allow its members to focus both on the Order and the Sphere of Sith Philosophy at the same time. \nOther than some inactivity, the biggest issue of the division arose when the rank of “Sith Curator” was introduced in the Sphere of Sith Philosophy. It was the new Inquisitor specialization, which meant that if an Inquisitor wanted to advance in the Sphere of Sith Philosophy, the Inquisitor in question would’ve been forced to join the Order of the Loremaster as well. This caused many issues as many members simply wanted to host trainings and had no interest in article writing. Not only that, but the requirements to become a Sith Curator were also considerably difficult, leading to less Inquisitors wanting to advance in the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and a Curator shortage. To compensate for the shortage, later on, members outside of the Order of the Loremaster could contribute by writing articles as well. \nOverall it was a very open and functional division, although it suffered from understaffing and management issues by the Sphere of Sith Philosophy. Perhaps if re-introduced today with the larger number of members in the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and a different organization more similar to the Sith Academy, it could be functional, but it cannot be said with certainty.\n\n# About the Order of the Oracle\nThe Order of the Oracle was under the jurisdiction of Laws & Justice and led by Morsaki. Despite its short duration, it was a very united and tight-knit division: it had extremely passionate leaders and active high rankings; in particular, the sphere’s leader Morsaki, being the former Overlord of the disbanded Sphere of Mysteries, had great amounts of experience in the sector. It was said to be a much more hands-on division than the current Sphere of Mysteries, often being seen in-game rather than working in the backlines to gather info. Despite the passion put into it by its leaders though, the Order of the Oracle had severe issues regarding activity. The new members of the Order tended to lose interest in the Order over time, leaving it understaffed. There were also some communication issues, as the Order wished to communicate the found intel to the group as a whole, but had to go through the Sphere of Laws & Justice first as it was their jurisdiction. \nOverall, the Order of the Oracle was a small yet welcoming Order which is still remembered fondly by all of its members.\n\n# About the Order of the Immortal\nThe Order of the Immortal was under the jurisdiction of Expansion and Diplomacy and led by ChillPain. Defined by the leader himself as “A big family”, it was a fun and enjoyable division, although it had extremely strict entrance requirements. It began as a small division but gained members at a good pace over time. \nUnfortunately, by the time it had enough members to begin conducting major raids, the Orders were all shut down. The main issue of the division itself was how high the bar was set for its members: on average, when a tryout for this Order was hosted, out of 10 attendees only 1-2 passed. Although, those who passed truly were the finest duelist The Known Galaxy could offer at the time. Those who passed would also get personal lessons and the Advanced Combat Manual. \nAll things considered, the Order of the Immortal was a fun and extremely challenging division for the short while it existed. It is unlikely that this Order would return the same with the new combat system that’s less skill-based than it used to be, although Expansion & Diplomacy has already begun a Sith Immortal program to reintroduce elite fighting attachments again.\n\n# Analysis of the system\nFirst and foremost, the main reason this system was adopted in the first place was mainly to respond to the decommissioning of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, Sphere of Mysteries, and Sphere of Defense & Security. It is easily noticeable that the logos of the three orders are, in fact, the same ones as the three aforementioned spheres. \nSuch a system did have some substantial advantages: \n-High similarity to TJO’s council system, allowing members to transition between the orders seamlessly if needed. \n-Being able to divide the duties of each sphere more evenly. \nAlbeit, also some disadvantages: \n-The heavily centralized spheres still had an array of duties too wide to administer properly. \n-The fact that each Order was under the control of a single sphere greatly reduced its interaction with other spheres. \n\nWhilst not the greatest system, overall, it generated three communities which all shared three qualities: small size, high specialization, and above all always warm and familiar. \n-Remalior, Sith Loremaster\n\n","meta":{"index":3,"author":"Remalior","name":"The Three Orders","release_year":2022}},"Sith Accolades and Awards":{"content":"# Overview\nSith Accolades are a set of awards bestowed upon members of the Sith Order for their outstanding, noticeable, and prevalent performance in their daily responsibilities and tasks. These accolades serve to showcase explementary service within the Sith Order and act as a demonstration of one’s accomplishments as well as feats. The standard Dark Council Accolades are the primary awards granted via vote, these forms of recognition are:\n\nDC | Activity Accolade\nDC | Dark Knowledge Accolade\nDC | Combat Prowess Accolade\nDC | Leadership Accolade\n\nThere exists additional Sith Accolades that are held in higher esteem and considered prestigious:\n\nDC | Defender of The Order\nDL | The Dark Lord’s Favor# DC | Activity Accolade\nThe Activity Accolade is one of many standard DC Sith Accolades that is granted through a vote by the Dark Council. This accolade is given to those that show vigorous dedication in the form of activity within the Sith Order as a whole. Individuals granted this award comprise Sith who refused to halt their loyalty to the Sith Order. There are a few Sith that have received this accolade:\n\nGrypper: A Sith Knight in the Sith Order at the time and also a Sith Praefect of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy, the first ever to receive the Activity Accolade in the Sith Order.\n\nEscanorTemenos: The Sith Order’s first Sith Overseer following the beginning of Darth Validus’s rule, EscanorTemenos was awarded the activity accolade by the Dark Council for his role in building the first generations of Sith Knights.\n\n# DC | Dark Knowledge Accolade\nThe Dark Knowledge Accolade is yet another Sith Accolade bestowed upon members of the Sith Order by the Dark Council. As the title somewhat suggests, the Dark Knowledge Accolade is given to Sith who have shown immense erudition pertaining to the Sith and their philosophy, lore, and general history; usually granted to the Order’s best Archive writers. Just like other accolades, there are also a few Sith that have also been granted this award:\n\nSeko1111: Seko was an Adept and Sith Scholar, not only one of the beginning writers for the Sith Archives but also the very first to receive the Dark Knowledge Accolade for some of his notable entries: Mandalorian Wars, Meetra Surik, and Sorzus Syn.\n\nShadowKorbius: Beginning as an Adept within the Sith Order and Scribe of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, ShadowKorbius eventually ascended to Knighthood and was the second individual to be given the Dark Knowledge Accolade by the Dark Council for his vast prowess and dedication to the Sith Archives consisting of some notable entries: Darth Millennial, Darth Jadus, and Tuk’ata.\n\n# DC | Combat Prowess Accolade\nThe Combat Prowess Accolade is another Sith Accolade that resides within the Dark Council and as expected, is also granted by this same council. The Sith consists of many skilled beings by lightsaber combat, but only the most proficient and competent Sith in lightsaber to lightsaber battle are granted this award. A few Sith that hold or have held this award are:\n\nEsociety: A Sith Warrior and eventually a Sith Juggernaut in the Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy, nothing stood in Esociety’s way as he went on to demonstrate that he was a force to be reckoned with. A truly unstoppable Sith well deserving of his Combat Prowess Accolade.\n \nGrugNix and Vesparum: GrugNix, a Sith Inquisitor and Shaman of Defense and Security engaged in an intense battle with Sith Overseer Vesparum for the title of Wrath of the Dark Lord. With intense clashing from both individuals, the fight ended when Vesparum defeated GrugNix in the final round that would grant him victory. For their showcase of real blade mastery, both Sith were granted the Combat Prowess Accolade for such demonstrations.\n\n# DC | Leadership Accolade\nThe Leadership Accolade is another Sith Accolade among the standard set that is bestowed by the Dark Council. This mark of recognition entails quality leadership skills that stand out above the rest, only given to the most influential leaders of a Sphere of Influence or the Sith Order as a whole. Similar to many of the other accolades, there have also been many to receive this award:\n\nMorsaki: Morsaki, also entitled Darth Accipiter was yet another Darth of the Sith Order and prime leader of the Sphere of Laws and Justice when given the Leadership Accolade for outstanding efforts in rebuilding the Sith Enforcers and reforming the Sphere of Laws and Justice as a whole.\n\nAdhesiveMaple: AdhesiveMaple was a Sith Warrior and one of quite a few Sith Enforcers during the time in which he received this award. After realizing the void in his sphere, the Sith Warrior took the initiative and prepared to assist in rebuilding the sphere by providing an influx of members and even additional Sith Enforcers. For this, he was granted the Leadership Accolade.\n\n# DC | Defender of the Order\nDefender of the Order is a prestigious title that may only be granted via unanimous vote by the Dark Council, Powerbase, and the Dark Lord. This title is given to those deemed the best leaders and warriors of the Sith Order. Notable Sith that have received this title are:\n\nTaitusTemenos: TaitusTemenos otherwise known as Darth Lividus was a Darth of the Sith Order and influential leader of the Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy at the time of his appointment to Defender of the Order. For his explementary leadership, warrior status, and strong reputation within the Sith Order, Taitus was deemed the first Defender of the Order by the entirety of the Dark Council.\n\nChilimeni: Chilimeni, also recognized as Darth Zinwrath or the Sith Loremaster, was also a Darth of the Sith Order as well as a notable leader of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy when he received the title of Defender of the Order. By ensuring the well-being of the Sith Order as a whole and acting as a primary leader when the Jedi invaded the Enclave, Meni was granted Defender of the Order.\n\n# DL | The Dark Lord's Favor\nThe Dark Lord’s favor is considered a prestigious award within the Sith Order, only granted to members of the Sith Order by the Dark Lord himself. This award is given to those that the Dark Lord deems worthy to hold through whatever matters or conditions he deems satisfactory. There exists a few notable individuals to achieve the Dark Lord’s Favor:\n\nChampaaiTemenos: A Sith Lord that was the first to be bestowed this prestigious award by the Dark Lord for achieving great victory in the challenge provided by the Sith ruler himself which entailed killing the Chief Librarian. Following the confusion of this assassination due to the failure to identify who was the victor, ChampaaiTemenos battled with another Sith for the Dark Lord’s entertainment in which the Sith Lord emerged victoriously, thus the Dark Lord granting him this exalted award.\n\nValorisAshen: One of many Commanders of the Sith Honor Guard and Darths of the Sith Order, ValorisAshen was granted The Dark Lord’s Favor for his leadership within the Sith Honor Guard creating a golden age for the division.\n\n","meta":{"index":11,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Sith Accolades and Awards","release_year":2022}},"Trials of the Order":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Order's Trials are a set of challenges that you must complete before entering either the Knighthood trials or the Advanced Knights trials. When  completing those tasks, your education and  time spent will prove if you are worthy of taking the trials, passing them, and unlocking new ranks. Individuals who are ready to progress on and work hard towards their goals can be identified by the trials themselves. Even though our order only has two trials, they are harder than one another and are divided into two groups: the KT trials are for apprentices, while the ASK trials are for Knights who will be capable of advancing into their Advanced Knighthood. The two trials in our order can only be taken by the levels of Apprentice and Knight, though a current ASK may be exempt if they are moving to another sphere.  The trials of the order are a significant occasion for the whole organization because they allow us to identify potential Lords and Darths of Spheres by demonstrating how individuals can use their KT and ASK skills to manage on a Sphere of Influence.# Trials of the Sith\nThe Trials of the Sith, sometimes referred to as the Knighthood Trials, are a series of requirements that apprentices must achieve in order to advance to the rank of Sith Knight. The actual trials are divided into five sections: the Trial of Carnage, which requires the apprentice to demonstrate both writing and combat Lightsaber skills; the Trial of Corruption, which requires the applicant to write a detailed explanation of the significance of the sphere they are currently in and a task from a Lord+ of their sphere; the Trials of Madness, which challenges the apprentice with the demands of a four-day cooling-off period; and, most importantly, the four interview questions.   \n\nThe apprentice's final two trials are the Trials of Philosophy and the Trial of Vengeance. In the Trial of Philosophy, the apprentice must devote his time and effort to learning the Sith code, writing about it, and defining what it means to be a Sith. In the Trial of Vengeance, the apprentice must demonstrate his combat prowess by defeating a Jedi Knight+ while making sure to record the fight.\n\n# Trials of Advanced Knighthood\nThe Advanced Knighthood trials consist of only three trials, however you have numerous possibilities, as when you become an ASK, you must pick between becoming a Sith Inquisitor and a Sith Warrior.  Some may find the decision straightforward, but because we have 5 spheres of influence, we also have different trials for each sphere. Let us begin by describing the default trials for both Sith Inquisitor and Sith Warrior that a Sith Knight must complete. The first two trials are for the Sith Warrior rank, where the individual must hunt down an Advanced Jedi Knight+ and write a comparison of two lightsaber forms that are currently in game.   \n\nAdditionally, The Trial of Immortality is an advanced Warrior trial in which a person must remain alive and engage in 3v1 combat for 60 seconds without losing. The two prerequisite trials for a Sith Inquisitor are the Trials of Hatred, which requires the individual to murder a Jedi Master and document it while also elaborating on the significance of protecting the integrity of the Kaggath without allowing it to destroy the group's structure, community, and leadership. The Trial of Deception, which requires the Knight to demonstrate his cunning by coming up with a scheme that will deceive a Jedi Order official.   \n\nSpecifically, there are Trials of the Spheres of Influence that a Knight must pass before becoming an ASK. Let's start with the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge trials, where contestants must compare and contrast the Jedi and Sith creeds in addition to receiving sponsorship from the Sphere's Lord.  The second sphere would be the sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy, where a person is required to participate in three raids in addition to receiving a sponsorship from a Lord+, which is required for all other spheres that will be discussed.   \n\nThe third sphere is Laws and Justice, where an individual must come up with a suitable answer when the host presents them with a situation involving breaking the law. The fourth sphere is the Sphere of Mysteries, where a person has to finish two tasks and provide a synopsis of each one. The last sphere is the Sphere of Philosophy, where the participant is required to create a lesson plan based on the curriculum for one lesson as specified by the Sphere of Sith Philosophy's rules. \n\nThe Advanced Trials may appear straightforward at first glance, but they are actually rather challenging because they also include the Universal Trials, which required them to train for their Knighthood while also serving as a Knight for two weeks.\n\n# Conclusion\nTo sum up, the trials of the order are very important for progression in our order since they enable us to identify individuals who are deserving of progressing to higher ranks while also enjoying the process. Finally, the purpose of the trials of the order is to merely test and evaluate our knowledge, combative skills, and—perhaps most importantly—our capacity for learning.\n\n","meta":{"index":8,"author":"iMirones","name":"Trials of the Order","release_year":2023}},"Ceremonial Rally":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Ceremonial Rally is a event that happens every time at the end of the month. It is hosted by the Dark council, specifically the Overlords of spheres. There are lines that are sorted by spheres - the members must go in rank order within the line. Where present, each sphere's Overlord will be there and announce each member's name, giving them awards one by one. There are Dark Council marks and Prestigious recognition. For the Dark Council marks, you can get Mark of Activity, Combat Prowess, Mark of Dark Knowledge, Mark of Leadership or Mark of Loyalty. For the recognition rewards, you can get Defender of the Order and Dark Lord's Favor. If there are Lord promotions or major promotions, the Dark honor guards will go to the Dark Council chambers and set everything up so the people can enter. The Dark Council and Hand of the Dark Lord will start to line everyone up behind the doors of the chambers, proceeding with the ceremony that is set up and wait for someone to be announced.

These Inquisitors are well-enlightened in the Sith Tenets and stop at no cost to enforce them and teach them to their full extent.# Battle of Wits\nThe battle of Strength consisted of battles involving Powerbase versus Powerbase, however, it would also start with a traditional 1 vs 1 duel of 3 to see how the Participants did against each other without their possible help. Once the 1 vs 1 was complete the first point would be marked and the power bases would step up to attend a duel of 5 against each participant's loyal Disciples. After the intense battle, the last point of the Battle of Strength shall be awarded and the next Battle will commence.\n\n# Battle of Strength\nThe Battle of Wits consisted of Powerbase versus Powerbase with their knowledge in mind for this battle, The first stage of the Battle of Wits forced the Participants to showcase their ability to know the lore and history of their Order and answer a series of questions relating to their lore allowing only the committed and dedicated to the Sith to most likely succeed within this battle. The last battle and the decider of the Kaggath is the battle of the most knowledgeable of our very Dark Archives, containing questions related to the Sith Lore and our history of past knowledge, this Battle would determine who is the most knowledgeable of the Sith Lore and gain the final point to obtain victory in the Kaggath and either humiliate their opponent or replace them as a new leader of the Order.\n\n","meta":{"index":9,"author":"Redjaal","name":"Rite of Kaggath","release_year":2023}},"Order of the Loremaster":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Order of the Loremaster was a division formed from the Sphere of Philosophy, and held the duties of writing articles to expand the Sith Archives, along with the maintenance of said archives.# Rank Structure\nScholar\nThis rank was obtained by passing the entrance exam for the Order of the Loremaster, which could be attempted after attaining the rank of Knight in the main group.

Dark Councilors, the governing body of the Empire held complete responsibility and command over their respective sphere of influence. These power bases served to run the daily operations of The Sith Empire, each member displaying obedience to the councilor that regulated the sphere.# Foundation of the Spheres of Influence\nOccurring inside the date of 4980 BBY, the Sith Emperor Tenebrae restored the Sith Empire on the world of Dromund Kaas. In the early days of reformation, the Sith Emperor created the twelve spheres of influence, each one’s organization entrusted to the most loyal Dark Lords that followed in Tenebrae’s steps, known as the Dark Council. Upon doing so, the Sith Emperor would flee into hiding, seeking to expand his knowledge in order to achieve ultimate power. With the absence of the Sith Emperor, the Dark Council operated the Sith Empire’s day to day operations, holding supreme power over different portions of the Empire's organization such as the function of the Imperial Military, technological advancement, judicial systems, preservation/enforcement of Sith philosophy, and more. Regardless of social class one was in or even the type of member within the Sith Empire, everyone under the control of the Empire answered to at least a single Dark Councilor. Whilst conflict was common among the different spheres, their Overlords were responsible for dealing with resolving the issues that may have arisen in their powerbase. However, in the future, the spheres of influence would see alteration.\n\n# Sphere of Laws and Justice\nThe Sphere of Laws and Justice was responsible for the administration of the judicial system in the Empire. This pyramid would control a multitude of justice branches and law enforcement, ensuring that the citizens of the Empire, along with enlisted members of the military and Sith Order were brought to proper justice by the law. As a product of their work, society in the Sith Empire remained undamaged. Darth Mortis, head of the sphere during this time sought to establish proper equity yet still adhere to Sith tradition and philosophy. This influential domain would see change under the rule of Empress Acina in 3636 BBY, when she decided to integrate Laws and Justice with the Sphere of Production and Logistics to create the Sphere of Civil Administration.\n\n# Sphere of Imperial Intelligence\nThe Sphere of Imperial Intelligence held oversight over the Ministry of Intelligence, a mainline division within the Empire. Consisting of other divisions like the Outreach Bureau, Operations Branch, and Imperial Intelligence. Likewise, this sphere was involved in matters of espionage, intelligence information, spy work, propaganda, manipulation, assassination, and all things related. Most of the sphere’s members operated in the shadows, even the most skilled non-force sensitive insiders being just as dangerous as the Sith, perhaps even more. Headed by Darth Jadus, a Dark Lord of the Sith who served on the Dark Council. He would spend most of his time providing work to the Outreach Bureau, letting the majority of his other power base function the other matters within the sphere. Just like many other spheres that would see alterations, Empress Acina later combined the Sphere of Imperial Intelligence with Expansion and Diplomacy to design the Sphere of Galactic Influence in 3636 BBY.\n\n# Sphere of Ancient Knowledge\nThe Sphere of Ancient Knowledge oversaw the protection, expansion, and preservation of all Sith history, artifacts, and general knowledge. Like other spheres, this powerbase also had control over a division, that division being known as the Imperial Reclamation Service. Naturally, this organization ran archeological expeditions in order to recover Sith artifacts and other forms of knowledge, including lifeforms. The pyramid had multiple leaders throughout its existence, three in total. Darth Arctis being the first overlord, then being succeeded by Darth Thanaton who would later be defeated in a Kaggath by Lord Kalig, a Sith Lord that ascended to the Dark Council, adopting the name of Darth Nox after the death of Thanaton. Under the rule of Empress Acina later in the days of the Empire, the pyramid would be unified with the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and Mysteries in order to create the Sphere of Sith Doctrine.\n\n# Sphere of Sith Philosophy\nThe Sphere of Sith Philosophy was entrusted with the enforcement of Sith tradition, including the Code of The Sith. Those that chose to pose a threat to the Sith’s principles of any kind would be excised by the Sphere of Sith Philosophy. Not only that, but this sector distributed anti-Jedi tradition and propaganda so that the Empire may remain unenlightened about anything related to the Light Side and its practices. Darth Aruk would act as oversight of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and would make it his destiny to destroy the Order of Revan, a cult that followed the teachings of Revan which included Light Side philosophy. Along with the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and Mysteries, the Sphere of Sith Philosophy would be reformed with these other two spheres to originate the Sphere of Sith Doctrine under Darth Acina’s reign as Sith Empress.\n\n# Sphere of Mysteries\nThe Sphere of Mysteries was tasked with the preservation of Imperial information and lore meant to remain confidential. Holocrons that contained secret material or documentation would be locked away, protected by the Sphere of Mysteries. The majority of the assassin forces that worked with the Empire served under this domain and likewise, were required to dispose of any targets that would be deemed as major threats to the Empire. Organizations such as the Red Legion, an Imperial unit within the Sith Empire responsible for assassination of its enemies. Even given the public description of the Sphere’s functionality, most people a part of the Empire were not aware of Mysteries accountability considering the sphere’s title of the most confidential and secretive out of all spheres of influence. During the ruling of the Sith Emperor, Darth Rictus wielded the province over the Sphere of Mysteries. Later down the line, the Sphere of Mysteries was merged with the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and Sith Philosophy to create the Sphere of Sith Doctrine.\n\n# Sphere of Biotic Science\nThe Sphere of Biotic Science concerned itself with all matters within the Empire related to disease control, augmentation, Sith alchemy, and the organic body as a whole. With the establishment of this sphere, another division would make itself known, this division being known as the Imperial Medical Corps assigned to treatment and other forms of medical care for Imperial forces. Individuals not of human or Sith Pureblood descent were discriminated against and the corps even assumed duties on active battlefields. The Imperial Science Bureau also worked under the Sphere of Biotic Science as a service obligated to do research and conduct a series of tests, genetic engineering, and experiments in order to advance science research as a whole. Alien Control was also another organization working under Biotic Science at the time and had the grueling task of instigating population control of any and all alien species that the Empire felt needed attention. Darth Archaron served as oversight of the Sphere of Biotic Science as it complimented the Dark Lord considering he himself decided to augment his own body with various cybernetics produced by his sphere. Seeing as the Sphere of Biotic Science worked alongside the Sphere of Technology, it is no surprise that during Empress Acina’s rule that both of these power bases were amalgamated to make the Sphere of Scientific Advancement.\n\n# Sphere of Technology\nThe Sphere of Technology managed all projects and work to construct cybernetics, military weaponry, superweapons, machinery, and other mechanisms that could be used by the Sith Empire. Similar to the other Spheres of Influence, the Sphere of Technology also had its fair share of divisions. The Imperial Corps of Engineers was a unit of the Empire’s best engineers to craft many apparatuses even in the midst of battle. Another sect under the Sphere of Technology was the Imperial Ordnance Acquisition, an organization tasked with the collection of scientific material such as blaster rifles for use against the Empire's opposition. In order for the Empire to have stable energy, the Imperial Power Bureau was enacted to deal with generators or any form of energy science. Darth Acina was the most notable overlord of this power base given that she eventually deemed herself as the Sith Empress. Being a sphere that dealt with technological advancement, the Sphere of Technology was well acquainted and affiliated with the Imperial Science Bureau that happened to serve under the Sphere of Biotic Science. Once other spheres were united to establish reformation among the Spheres of Influence with the ascension of Empress Acina, the Sphere of Biotic Science and Technology followed along.\n\n# Sphere of Production and Logistics\nThe Sphere of Production and Logistics acted as oversight of the Ministry of Logistics. Through this ministry, the sphere managed influential assets that were vital to the Empire’s functionality such as trade routes, resources, supply lines, and even slave populations. Being the most logistical sphere, it was provided with different organizations under the sphere’s command to properly organize its operations. The Imperial Citizenship Bureau was one of these organizations and managed all records of the citizens that resided within the Empire. Having to manage some forms of the economy, the Imperial Treasury Department was vital in the functionality of the Sphere of Production and Logistics. This department oversaw all Imperial pay stations and would even issue bounties upon those that decided to interfere with their operations. The leadership of the Sphere of Production and Logistics remained unchanged as Darth Vowrawn would make himself comfortable as its leader for all of its time. The Sphere of Laws and Justice and Production and Logistics unified during Acina’s term as Empress to devise the Sphere of Civil Administration.\n\n# Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy\nThe Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy was in charge of the expansion of the Empire’s frontiers and dealt with all matters related to diplomacy. Most of the work regarding diplomacy was left to the Imperial Diplomatic Service which was assigned to establish beneficial relationships and allies with the Sith Empire, ensuring that their allegiance remained. Under the leadership of Darth Ravage, more focus on military expansion as opposed to the political and diplomatic duties of the sphere. Expansion and Diplomacy eventually joined with the Sphere of Imperial Intelligence in order to enact the Sphere of Galactic Influence desired by Acina who took the throne after Vitiate’s scheme was revealed.\n\n# Sphere of Military Strategy\nThe Sphere of Military Strategy devised and controlled all strategic battle plans, strategy, and other operations pertaining to the Imperial Military. Just like the Sphere of Defense of The Empire and Military Offense, the Sphere of Military Strategy also had control over the Ministry of War but directly controlled the Imperial Consolidation Corps, a division responsible for ensuring security among newly acquired planets by the Empire. Its leader, Darth Decimus, would devise many strategies for plans of invasion, one of these invasions being known as the Invasion of Corellia. Given all the similarities and congregation between the sphere of Military Strategy, Military Offense, and Defense of The Empire, Empress Acina decided to unify all three spheres together to produce the Sphere of Military Command.\n\n# Sphere of Military Offense\nThe Sphere of Military Strategy established supremacy by leading the Imperial Military’s offensive operations against the Empire’s enemies through means of directory over military resources and strength. Imperial Military forces answered directly to the Ministry of War, another authority granted to Military Offense. This ministry was one of three branches of the governing body within the Empire, leading all matters related to war including control over the Imperial Navy, Army, High Command, and Reclamation Service. The most notable leader of this power base was Darth Baras who would be succeeded by a multitude of different Dark Lords of the Sith as the sphere continued. This office worked well alongside the Sphere of Military Strategy whose duties was to act as general advisors to offensive operations and battle planning devised by the Sphere of Military Offense. Due to this, Empress Acina would later combine the two spheres with the Sphere of Defense of The Empire to formulate the Sphere of Military Command given that all three spheres possessed control over the Ministry of War.\n\n# Sphere of Defense of The Empire\nThe Sphere of Defense the Empire made it known that no external or internal threats would arise outside or within the Empire. Given the responsibility of this pyramid, it worked closely with Imperial Intelligence forces to ensure none would pose danger to the politics and structure of the Sith Empire. The Ministry of War was shared with the Defense of the Empire just as it had been with the Sphere of Military Strategy and Offense. During all eras of its reign, Darth Marr acted as the power base's oversight, asserting his duties in order to preserve the Sith Empire from all those that were deemed as threats. After his death and with the establishment of reform at the hand of Empress Acina, the Sphere of Defense of the Empire joined with the Sphere of Military Strategy and Military Offense to construct the Sphere of Military Command.\n\n# Empress Acina's Reformation\nAfter the Eternal Empire of Zakuul exposed itself to attack both Empire and Republic forces in 3636 BBY, Darth Acina, one of the last surviving Dark Councilors chose to claim the throne within the Sith Empire thus deeming herself the Empress of the Sith. Some of her first acts of reconstructing the Sith Empire included merging the twelve spheres of influence into five different new spheres in 3630 BBY: the Sphere of Military Command, the Sphere of Galactic Influence, the Sphere of Civil Administration, the Sphere of Scientific Advancement, and the Sphere of Sith Doctrine. Her reasoning for doing so was to reduce the infighting among the Dark Council that was extremely prevalent during the existence of the twelve spheres of influence. With these changes, only five Dark Councilors were allowed to serve at a single time, each one acting as the overlord of one of these newly founded spheres. The majority of the previous members of the Dark Council that served before Acina’s ascension were either killed at the hands of the Eternal Empire or chose to exile themselves from the Sith Empire.\n\n# Sphere of Sith Doctrine\nThe Sphere of Sith Doctrine was formulated by Empress Acina by combining the Sphere of Mysteries, Sith Philosophy, and Ancient Knowledge. This power base was trusted with ensuring the preservation of all Sith knowledge whilst also enforcing the very tradition upheld by the Sith. Darth Anathel, a previous Sith Lord, advanced into the Dark Council making him the Head of the Sphere of Sith Doctrine.\n\n# Sphere of Scientific Advancement\nThe Sphere of Scientific Advancement was founded by merging the Sphere of Technology and the Sphere of Biotic Science at the discretion of Empress Acina. Naturally, this sphere was responsible for all matters related to scientific, technological, and biotic research, advancement, and projects to benefit the Sith Empire in any form. After the foundation of the power base, Darth Malora would be assigned as oversight up until her replacement Darth Savik took over due to Malora’s incompetence following the conflicts that had transpired on Ossus.\n\n# Sphere of Military Command\nThe Sphere of Military Command was yet another pyramid of the Sith Empire formed by Darth Acina by integrating the Sphere of Military Command, Military Offense, and Defense of the Empire upon her ascension to Empress of the Sith. Tasked with all offensive and defense strategies as well as military procedures, the Sphere of Military Command established the Empire’s true strength in the galaxy. Darth Korvos acted as oversight of the Sphere of Military Command during its time.\n\n# Sphere of Civil Administration\nThe Sphere of Civil Administration emerged as another power base within the Sith Empire after Empress Acina chose to fuse the Sphere of Laws and Justice, and the Sphere of Production and Logistics together. This power base concerned itself with managing weapon production, supply line management, and held administrative rule over internal law such as judicial systems pertaining to the Empire and its citizens. Its only known leader in history, Darth Vowrawn, dealt with all matters related to internal law enforcement and general supply production.\n\n# Sphere of Galactic Influence\nThe Sphere of Galactic Influence was another product of reformation of the spheres of influence under Empress Acina that was created by combining the Sphere of Imperial Intelligence and the Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy. This pyramid within the Sith Empire was trusted with gathering intelligence about internal and external threats to the Empire as well as assuming diplomatic responsibility in the name of the Sith Empire. Darth Xarion would stop at nothing to further expose any threats to the Sith Empire and establish diplomacy for the Empire considering his leadership status of the sphere during its existence in 3630 BBY.\n\n","meta":{"index":1,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Spheres of Influence","release_year":2022}}},"meta":{"name":"Order Information","index":11}},"Archaeological Studies":{"articles":{"Sword of Khashyun":{"content":"# Article\nThe Sword of Khashyun was an artifact that belonged to the Sith.

Marka Ragnos and Naga Sadow were known to have had possession of a Sith Spellbook. Sadow later handed the book in his possession over to his apprentice, Gav Daragon. Daragon studied the contents of the book during his time that he trained under Lord Sadow on Khar Shian.# Section 1\nThe Dark Lord of the Sith, Freedon Nadd, managed to transcribe a Sith spellbook. He even recorded the spells he performed with a holocron. Nadd’s holocron and other artifacts were later passed down to his direct descendant, King Ommin. As the ruler of Onderon, the king was able to master the powers from these artifacts that he was given and used them during his reign. In 3998 BBY, two aristocrats named Satal and Aleema Keto managed to obtain a Sith spellbook when they infiltrated the Museum of Dark Side Antiquities on Coruscant. However, the pair were unable to decipher the contents of the book, so they headed to Onderon to meet with King Ommin in hopes that he would assist them. They landed on Onderon and found King Ommin, and while there he gave Satal an amulet that would allow him to decipher the ancient Sith writings. King Ommin later died  during the Second Battle of Onderon. All of his treasures were given to Freedon Nadd and the Ketos.\n\n# Section 2\nAround 3,000 years later, a new Dark Lord of the Sith rose to power and gained possession of the spells.

Some time passed and Bane was taken to the tomb of Freedon Nadd, during his search for knowledge about the creation of holocrons. He was able to successfully infiltrate the chamber within the tomb that housed Nadd’s personal holocron. Bane studied the contents of holocron and found that there were spells for harnessing Sith sorcery inside. However, he was not accustomed to the ways of Sith sorcery, so he transcribed the data into a spellbook and later presented it to his apprentice Darth Zannah.\n\n","meta":{"index":29,"author":"ElysiaLValkyrie","name":"Sith Spellbook","release_year":2023}},"Morrigan Scrolls":{"content":"# Article\nThe Morrigan Scrolls contained Sith knowledge and tactics created around the Jedi Civil War and were written by Darth Malak in 3956 BBY prior to his death.

He wielded this saber until his final death on Yavin IV in 3637 BBY during the Revanite crisis.# Section 1\nIn 3954 BBY, shortly after the Jedi Civil War, Revan left the known galaxy, taking his saber with him as more of his lost memories started to return. During his discoverance of Dromund Kaas, he was taken captive by the pureblood Dark Council member Darth Nyriss and her apprentice Sith Lord Scourge, in the Emperor’s fortress. While he was captured, his saber was taken for months and was kept as a belonging, where he was additionally tortured by the captors trying to get information out of him. After three long years, Jedi Knight Meetra Surik came to rescue him, accompanied by the help of a treacherous Scourge. Altogether, they defeated Darth Nyriss and the saber was retrieved back.\n\n# Section 2\nRevan, Surik and Scourge stormed the Sith Emperor’s citadel, and after three years, Revan’s lightsaber was finally put to use again as it cut down an Imperial Guard before taking on the Sith Emperor himself. After Scourge betrayed and killed Surik, the assault failed, and Revan was eventually imprisoned and became the Emperor’s captive for three hundred years. During the Cold War, the Republic became aware of his imprisonment due to Surik’s Force ghost, who stayed with Revan his entire capture. In order to navigate through the Maelstrom, where Revan was held, they had to gain access to a Gree computer. A Republic strike team was sent to Taral V, in order to access that Gree computer, where they succeeded in tracking and freeing Revan. As time went on, Revan’s lightsaber changed to violet in demonstration of his connection to both the light and dark side of the Force, where he traveled to the Foundry–a massive space station within an asteroid, which was able to create a massive amount of droids in a short time. The lightsaber was put to use again when Revan had to defend the Foundry against an Imperial strike force, commanded by Darth Malgus who ordered the capture of the station and his demise. As Revan was killed during the assault, there was a part of him that still had the urge to survive, as his connection to the dark side would revitalize his body.

The rod was brown in color, one meter in length, and four centimeters in diameter. It was crooked on one end, while a blue shining light was on the other end. The Darkstaff was created to feed off the Force, however it was not imbued with the Force. All light near and around the staff was consumed, causing the staff to produce dark, smoky tendrils that absorbed the Force essence out of organic organisms. With enough Force essence, it had the power to destroy a planet. In case the Staff required protection, it could create a small barrier, within the barrier it was devoid of the Force. It could also teleport, but could not teleport within one kilometer of the Eye of the Sun, the opposite of the Darkstaff, an object imbued with the power of the light side. The Darkstaff was immune to all Force powers, including lightsaber attacks. It had the power to possess sentient lifeforms’ minds, allowing the Darkstaff to communicate, in which it had a raspy, darkened voice. Strangely, the Staff also had an ability allowing it to transform creatures into Sithspawn, dark side imbued mutations, like zombies.# Part II\nThe personality of the Darkstaff thrived on suffering, it’s primary goal being destruction and death. It was obsessed with the idea of gaining more and more power, it wanted to consume energy in particular, but it desired to consume the Force most of all. The Darkstaff was deceitful, it used others to achieve its personal goals, persuading them into thinking they would be achieving their own goals rather than helping the Darkstaff reach its goals instead. The staff would eventually warp the user’s mind. The Darkstaff believed itself as powerful, and even thought it had the right to end the lives of anyone they pleased, seeing the strong as making choices for the weak. The Darkstaff was unable to comprehend the ideals of compassion and self-sacrifice.\n\n# Part III\nMany thousands of years before the Clone Wars, a member of the Sith Order would create the Darkstaff, and it would eventually fall into the hands of the reformed Sith Empire, placing the artifact into storage aboard a space station by the name of the Arcanum. However, around 3639 BBY, the artifact would be stolen by the Sith Lord Tagriss, a Dread Lord follower of the rogue Sith known as the Dread Masters. Tagriss took the Staff to the Dread Guard’s Sanctum on Belsavis. Operatives loyal to both the Republic and the Empire would trace Tagriss back to Belsavis, where Dread Guardsman Varrow would encounter the operatives, utilizing the Darkstaff to fight them. The Darkstaff had granted Varrow immunity from many of their attacks and powers, however, he was unable to control the power of the Staff, resulting in his death. The Darkstaff would then vanish in a fiery blaze of an explosion, disappearing. Later, the Staff would be transported to a planet named Oblis, a part of the Cularin system, where the natives of Oblis, the Oblee will possess the artifact. However, the staff began to manipulate the Oblee, transforming them. It summoned shadow creatures, energy based beings that fed on the emotions of others. However, the Oblee saw these creatures as threats, and attempted to use the Darkstaff against them, powering a weapon that would force the creatures away from their planet, but the Darkstaff absorbed the power, inevitably resulting in the destruction of Oblis. Years later, the Darkstaff’s power would influence a Sith Lord named Darth Rivan to the Cularin System; he sought to control this power and obtain the Staff for himself. During a crucial fight against the Jedi Order, Rivan will gain possession of the Darkstaff, in which the staff will transport Rivan through a wormhole hundreds of years into the future, during the Ruusan Campaign.\n\n# Part IV\nAbout 31 BBY, a Force-Sensitive named Len Markus will travel to I-9 to seize the Darkstaff for himself. As Markus starts to leave the asteroid belt, a bolt of Force-lightning extending many kilometers long will be fired from Darth Rivan’s fortress on Almas. The bolt damaged the staff, resulting in Markus making a deal with Phylus Mon, where he would repair the staff. The artifact would regain most of its strength after being placed into the Crystal Pyramid, to feed upon Force essence. However, a group of agents called the Heroes of Cularin boarded Mon’s ship and destroyed the pyramid before the staff could repair itself completely. Then, the staff would return to Len Markus, who would then help the Darkstaff achieve a new goal: Destroy the Cularin system. Its plan was to consume the Eye of the Sun, then use the power consumed from the artifact to lay waste to the Cularin system entirely. As Markus began to learn the location of the Jedi-created artifact, he would bring the staff to the Ch’hala Heart Tree, where the artifact was hidden. However, they were stopped in their path as the Heroes of Cularin encountered them, ensuing a battle between them. One of the agents managed to channel the light side of the Force into the Sith artifact, resulting in its destruction, ending the threat that the Darkstaff posed towards the galaxy.\n\n","meta":{"index":31,"author":"TheReaperOfReality","name":"Darkstaff","release_year":2021}},"Rakatan Empire: Rise & Fall":{"content":"# Introduction\nRakatan Empire, otherwise referred to as The Infinite Empire or the Rakata Empire, was a vast dominion spanning across the galaxy. It was governed by the Rakata, a highly advanced species originating from Lehon, a planet located in the mysterious Unknown Regions. Using their advanced technology, the Rakata subdued and enslaved numerous other species across the galaxy. Their ancientness is such that even during “The Old Republic” era, they are regarded as little more than myth and legend.# Section 1\nWhen the Kwa, a Force-sensitive reptilian species native to the planet Dathomir, journeyed to Lehon, the ancestral home of the Rakata species, they assumed the role of benefactors to the Rakata. Imparting knowledge about the Force and bestowing advanced technology upon them, the Kwa sought to elevate their civilization. However, their goodwill turned to horror when they discovered the Rakata's cannibalistic tendencies and their rejection of the Kwa's teachings of balance in the Force. Instead, the Rakata embraced the dark side of the Force, combining their aggressive nature and lust for conquest with the advanced technology provided by the Kwa. With this formidable combination, the Rakata expanded their dominion beyond Lehon, embarking on a campaign of conquest across other worlds within the enigmatic Unknown Regions.\n\nClassified the Infinite Empire by the Rakata themselves, they set their sights on worlds abundant with the Force, overpowering their inhabitants upon conquest. Pioneering technology enabled them to manipulate fear and hatred within Force-sensitive individuals, utilizing enslaved Force users from conquered populations to power their warships and machinery. These slaves were captured within devices that converted their dark side emotions into energy, sustaining the Rakata's advancements and dominance.\nExpanding their influence into the Unknown Regions and beyond, the Empire reached into the eastern galaxy by 35,000 BBY. Among the worlds brought under their control was Kashyyyk, a lush forest planet. Here, the Rakata installed a terraforming computer to manipulate the planet's iconic wroshyr trees. However, in 33,598 BBY, communication with the computer was lost. Over two centuries later, the malfunction of the terraforming system caused a rapid and uncontrollable acceleration in the growth of the wroshyr trees.\n\n# Section 2\nAround 30,000 BBY, the Infinite Empire reached its height, connecting more than five hundred Force-abundant worlds across the galaxy. Amidst the absorption of Kwa territories, the Rakata ruthlessly conquered Dathomir, the Kwa's home planet. Fascinated by the colossal rancors indigenous to Dathomir, the Empire transported several of these creatures to Lehon as peculiarities. Subsequently, one rancor was introduced to the planet Gamorr integrating into the native Gamorreans' cultural mythology as a legendary creature.\nIn approximately 27,700 BBY, the Rakata stumbled upon the planet Korriban and encountered the Sith species. Initially, the Rakata demonstrated the technology of holocrons to the Sith king, Adas. However, Adas quickly discerned the Empire's true motives for conquest and rallied his people and were able to repel the Rakata from Korriban. Despite this setback, the Rakata succeeded in conquering numerous worlds in the region that would eventually be dubbed the Core Worlds, among them Coruscant, the ancestral home of the Human species.\n\nRelying heavily on Force-sensitive individuals to power their starships and drive their galactic conquest, the Rakata established a notorious reputation for their widespread practice of slavery, which not only underpinned their society but also served as a vital dependency. Additionally, they exploited a vast number of slaves as laborers to construct their most monumental achievements, such as the Star Forge—a colossal shipyard fueled by the energy harvested from stars.\n\nDuring the reign of the Infinite Empire, the Esh-kha species initiated a series of uprisings on several Rakatan slave worlds, prompting the Empire to launch a counterattack against them. Despite efforts by one Esh-kha, known as Hallow Voice, to appeal to the Rakata for mercy, negotiations were intentionally prolonged by the Rakata until they successfully subdued the Esh-kha and apprehended Hallow Voice. Subsequently, all members of the Esh-kha species were incarcerated within stasis vaults on Belsavis, effectively imprisoning the entire population. The Infinite Empire repurposed Belsavis into a prison world, utilizing stasis technology to confine monsters, warlords, and other formidable entities.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Force-powered technology of the Rakata, known as the Star Forge, had far-reaching consequences that ultimately triggered the collapse of the Infinite Empire. As the Star Forge tapped into the aggressive tendencies of its Rakatan creators, it generated dark side energies that corrupted them further. Over generations of galactic dominance, cracks began to form within the Empire. Widespread slave uprisings erupted along its borders, while various factions within the Empire vied for control, plunging Rakatan-controlled space into civil war. Already weakened by internal strife, the Rakata were blindsided by a devastating plague in 25,200 BBY, possibly engineered by one of the slave species. This lethal disease spread swiftly among the Rakata due to their genetic similarity, nearly wiping them out and dealing a crippling blow to the Infinite Empire. However, the worst was yet to come….\n\nA genetic mutation within the plague severed the Rakata's connection to and mastery over the Force. With Force-sensitive individuals dwindling, the Rakata found themselves unable to harness their own advanced technology effectively. Forced to rely on inferior alternatives, their dominion weakened. Sensing an opportunity, enslaved populations across numerous worlds rebelled against their weakened overlords. As member worlds like Korriban expelled their Rakatan rulers, the foundations of the Infinite Empire crumbled. In a desperate retreat, the devastated Rakata were left with no choice but to abandon their conquests and seek refuge in their homeworld.\n\nFactions on the Rakatan homeworld engaged in a bitter struggle for supremacy, igniting a devastating civil war that razed cities and reshaped the planet's surface into fragmented islands. The conflict nearly drove the Rakatan species to extinction, compelling the surviving remnants to seek refuge underground, where they regressed into primitive tribal societies. Among them, a group known as The Elders, descended from the priest sphere of the Infinite Empire, preserved the true history of their people's rise and fall. Over the ensuing centuries, the once-mighty Infinite Empire faded from memory, erased from the annals of galactic history by its former slaves. Its existence remained dormant until its rediscovery during the Jedi Civil War, millennia after the presumed extinction of the Rakata.\n\n","meta":{"index":62,"author":"mummytrie","name":"Rakatan Empire: Rise & Fall","release_year":2024}},"Mask of Viceroy Exim Panshard":{"content":"# Overview\nThe mask of Viceroy Exim Panshard was a Sith artifact that was made from meteoritic metal.

It was hidden in an underground temple beneath Mount Diligence. Later, it would be moved to another planet, whose surface was a bleak desert, called Skarpos. During the Republic Dark Age, with the cooperation of the Jedi Order many years later,  the University of Sanbra began preparations for a scientific exploration to locate and collect the helm. Learning about the existence of the helm after raiding Sanbra, a Sith Lord known as Odion would begin to become intrigued by its whereabouts.

In order to obtain his enemy’s amulet, Dreypa invented an Oubliette that would fall later into Pulsipher’s ownership, a Mandalorian Neo-Crusader who delivered the Sith Artifact to his laboratories within Jebble. Following the Mandalorian’s demise in 3963 BBY, a Padawan known as Zayne Carrick made it his own and suggested the Jedi Covenant Celeste Morne could be jailed within the Oubliette to stop the Rakghouls from following her orders, something that happened after they nullified her Talisman’s interference. In 3956, Darth Glovoc carried an Oubliette aboard the Dying Sun, but was intercepted during his visit to Nyriaan. Although he didn’t land in the location he wanted, he still placed himself in the Oubliette to preserve his life. \nAs this Sith Artifact changed ownership constantly, it became known as the Jebble Box for his discovery by Pulsipher on Jebble.

The element was first found on the planet of Makeb, an oceanic planet with gravitational levels below the standard. The odd gravity of Makeb was believed to be the cause of Isotope-5's gravitational and electromagnetic warping properties. The element was soon used for the development of weapons such as the Isotope-5 droid and more devastating blaster fire. The Hutt Cartel utilized the element to fight and rival the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire, although they were unable to fight both sides due to the Sith Empire sending in a small taskforce to seize the element or prevent the Hutt Cartel from utilizing it even further. Other properties of Isotope-5 was its lightness and how durable it is, the element was described as light as shimmersilk and even more durable than durasteel. Shimmersilk was mostly used for clothing and was incredibly light meanwhile, durasteel was used for armor like Mandalorian armor.

While most individuals who could utilize force empathy could glean into the most basic feelings of the individuals they used it on, a small number of force sensitive individuals were capable of pushing it much further, such as Anakin Skywalker, Darth Sidious, and Jaesa Willsaam. They could look past simple emotions and use the Force to understand the motivations, wishes, fears, desires and secrets. This made force empathy incredibly powerful; it could be used to manipulate anyone who was not Force sensitive without their knowing. Jaesa Willsaam had such an aptitude for Force empathy that she was able to predict how people were going to act and what they were going to do. Anakin demonstrated his skill in force empathy when detecting his mother’s pain, allowing him to locate her on Dantooine. Force empathy could also stretch beyond understanding a person. There was the potential for those particularly adept at force empathy to begin to use the force to control emotions, which could be disastrous if that power was placed in the wrong hands.

These storms were capable of shifting various objects across the longest of distances, containing so much power that the ability could reign havoc and destruction upon the surfaces of planets as well as any other structure, terrain, or objects in its vicinity. Not only that, but this power served to act as transport across the galaxy and time itself, providing users with the chance of advancing themselves throughout time. Only those that possessed an extreme mastery of area, control, and alteration of The Force could use this ability at their leisure but their control over the storms was extremely hindered. Force-sensitive beings that lacked the mastery to summon force storms through their will could turn to the usage of the Darkstaff, a Sith artifact with sentient nature able to create these same force storms that generated hyperspace wormholes.# Applications\nThe first usage of this riveting force prowess dates back to 1900 BBY when the Sith artifact known as the Darkstaff was constructed and used during the battle on Almas by Darth Rivan. This artifact wielded the power to create these wormholes in space through the usage of The Force. Once in the possession of Darth Rivan, the staff would begin to drain his Force energy and as a result, created a force storm that obliterated Rivan’s armies. Rivan on the other hand, who also fell victim to this maleficent phenomenon was forwarded further into the future where the Light and Darkness War took place between the Brotherhood of Darkness and Army of Light. Due to the rather unfortunate events that transpired, Darth Rivan would meet his demise at the hands of another force-sensitive being involved in the battle. For the next generations to come, the destructive ability would not be seen for quite a long period of time. It wasn’t until Darth Sidious devised a way to summon these wormholes entirely through means of his prowess in the Force. In 10 ABY, Sidious unleashed a series of storms across the galaxy within a multitude of star systems in order to transport Luke Skywalker, along with the rest of his rebellion to Sidious’s fortress on Byss. After sending out yet another storm to the Republic Fleet, his connection to the Dark Side was severed by Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa by using Light Side energy. Darth Sidious would ultimately lose control of the weapon of destruction he crafted and was engulfed by the storm which vanished moments after doing so. The whereabouts of everything that happened to be demolished by the storm were unknown. Within history, the only users of this ability were the Darkstaff, Darth Sidious, and his Dark Side Adepts.

During the battle, Engle threw his saber at a raider, before he could go get his weapon, the other raider fired at him and he was forced to deflect the shots with the ability.\n\n\nIn 22 BBY, Jedi Grand Master Yoda was fighting with Darth Tyranus in the hangar on the planet of Geonosis. Darth Tyranus fired a blast of Force lightning at Yoda. He deflected the blast back at him, only for him to use the Force to deflect the blast into the ceiling. On many occurrences, Yoda managed to retaliate force lightning with force deflection.\n\n\nSometime later, Ahsoka Tano confronted the Sith Lord Maul in the Grand Salon during the Siege of Mandalore. Lady Bo-Katan Kryze was with Ahsoka and charged at Maul while firing multiple blaster shots which he easily changed the direction of the blaster shots with the waves of his hand.\n\n\nIn 18 BBY during the Invasion of Mon Cala, the Sith Lord Darth Vader was fighting in the battle of Dac City.

Instead, Ergast made another and arguably more powerful ritual, which he named Force walking.# Description\nForce walking itself required incredible willpower but once a Sith bound a spirit to themselves, the effects were rewarding as they could draw upon the ghost for Force energy. However, Force walking had a catch. If a user bound a more unwilling ghost to themselves, the user could draw more power. But if the ghost was more willing, it could draw more from the user. Many Sith mastered this ritual and quickly rose to prominence, but also quickly faded into obscurity.\n\n# History\nOne person would defy this fate and become an incredibly powerful Dark Lord of the Sith, recognised and respected by many whether servants of the dark side or soldiers of the military. This person was told that he had a unique pull among ghosts by the spirit of his ancestor, one of the many contributing factors to how he would become a master at Force walking. In an attempt to gain as much power as possible to triumph Darth Thanaton,\n\nLord Kallig sought out how to bind Force spirits to himself, learning from the spirit of Ergast before binding his spirit. The Sith Lord would go on to take the spirits of Darth Andru, Kalatosh Zavros, and Horak Mul. But Ergast neglected to inform Lord Kallig that it was only possible to bind one spirit as any more would destroy a person's own self, which caused Kallig to seek out a cure on Belsavis and Voss before he was able to properly control his newly gained power. With the strength of four ancient Sith, Kallig won against his opponent and rose to the title of Darth Nox. It is unknown what happened to the spirits after they aided in the defeat of Thanaton. \nSome sources claim that they were set free.

Several Sith Lords, particularly those from earlier eras, used this ability to repeatedly evade death. They typically had a backup copy of themselves on hand in case their body were to change or expire. But if the person in some way failed to capture their target, they would have no more attempts and would be transported to Chaos, the Sith equivalent of Hell.# Section 1\nKarness Muur, a master of many forms of Sith alchemy, was among the first Sith Lords to learn this method and craft a talisman. There is only one documented instance of this talisman unsuccessfully possessing a victim entirely, Celeste Morne, but it could take possession of any other victim who wore it. When he died, he would transfer his spirit into the talisman and take on any victim who made contact with it.\n\nSith Emperor Vitiate had also perfected the ability, allowing him to live for more than a millennium by typically transferring portions of his essence to numerous victims throughout his life. If it became necessary, he also employed this power to independently manage his Voice and the Children of the Emperor. He was also capable of simultaneously controlling thousands of bodies. He captured most of the Imperial outposts and some of the Republic troops that gathered at Ziost during his onslaught in 3637 BBY, and after he depleted the planet's surface of life, he consumed their essences. \n\nExar Kun, the head of the Brotherhood of the Sith, refrained from using his power to possess bodies in favor of imprisoning his spirit inside a Massassi Temple on Yavin IV after his ally Ulic betrayed him during the Great Sith War. This kept him alive and driven to insanity for more than 4,000 years until his spirit was unintentionally let out and engaged in combat with the New Jedi Order. In the end, Luke Skywalker annihilated him utterly in 7 ABY.\n\n# Section 2\nWhen Darth Bane found the holocron of Darth Andeddu, an additional ancient Sith Lord with exceptional transfer skills, he became conscious of this power. During a confrontation with his apprentice Zannah, he believed that his pupil was too weak to take his place, and they proceeded with a duel. Fortunately, Zannah's Sith magic helped her overcome him. He suffered severe injuries, and through transfer, attempted to grasp her in an attempt to take control of her. She was able to evade his powers, though, and his spirit ultimately vanished into the void.\n\nDarth Plagueis, who mostly sought to remain immortal in his own body, had found this ability and was currently researching it to understand its power. However, he wanted to use it very carefully. Unfortunately, though, Plagueis was finally slain by his pupil, Sidious, before he got to use it.\n\nSidious, one of the last known Sith Lords to wield this talent and the most prominent in its use, survived the Battle of Endor following his first death at the hands of Anakin Skywalker in 4 ABY by transferring his spirit into a clone.

On a successful attempt, whatever they had said would be repeated by the target under a trance-like state before acting on what was suggested to them. The mind trick was not an omnipotent ability, ineffective on the strong-minded and certain species. For those who honed the ability enough, they could effectively use it without the gesture or even uttering the phrase.\n\nThe ability was at its highest potential even against those able to resist it when multiple Force wielders used it, such as when Mace Windu, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker simultaneously used it on Cad Bane to extract information out of him. However, it was a dangerous thing to attempt, as it could potentially destroy a person’s sanity if they resisted enough.\n\nDark side users developed a more convoluted technique of the mind trick, focusing into its telepathic uses to forcefully go through a person's mind and extract memories or information.

Both the Jedi and the Sith sought out Vergences and established shrines and temples on locations thought to be Vergences or nexuses while objects thought to be Vergences were used as talismans. The only known individual suspected of being a Vergence was quickly taken in by the Jedi Order.# Known Instances\nBoth the Sith Shrine in the Depths and the Jedi Temple on Coruscant were built around a Vergence known as the Sacred Spire.\n  \n       Other Jedi Temples built near Vergences include the Temple on Ilum, the Temple of Eedit, and the Temple on Lothal.\n\n\nSome Vergences that had a strong connection to the Dark Side of the Force are the Cave of Evil on Dagobah, the Sith Cave on Mustafar, the Mirror Cave on Ahch-To, the Well of the Dark Side, Korriban/Moraband as a whole, and the Valley of the Dark Lords.  \n\n       It is said that Mortis, the Chasm on Ushruu, and the Wellspring of Life are also Vergences.

After strenuous months of training with an opal Tasar crystal, a user could utilise it in battle. These stones were native to the planet Tasariq, and its people dumbfound about the exact powers they unlocked, some believing they had healing magic. The main perk of the power was enhanced intuition, which benefited a time of planning at the start of a battle. Notably, this skill was used in its Ta-Ree variant on the planet Kathol by the Ascendant, which sought to manipulate the Force with technology to eliminate the Sith. Still, it required them to master the Ta-Ree spells, Detect Life and Sense Danger, before learning Battle Sense. Due to its similar name, it was commonly mistaken for Battle Meditation during conflicts, which is a different ability that increased the mental will of allies while reducing that of its enemies.","meta":{"index":19,"author":"AnimatedEcrux","name":"Battle Sense","release_year":2023}},"Force Crush":{"content":"# Overview\nForce Crush was a Force ability that originated from the Dark Side of the Force, being a derivation of the ability known as Force Grip. Force Crush was known primarily for its violent form of usage and execution, barely being used by the Jedi, as only a bare few used this technique only against droids, however it was a common ability to be used by the Sith on every being. The way Force Crush was executed towards an objective was by first using the ability of Force Grip by lifting the target into the air using the Force, then the body of the target will begin to implode as it's being crushed by the Force while it is lifted in the air. This ability was most commonly used against droids specially for the Jedi, since it was more appealing to their code, however the Sith frequently used this technique not only on droids, but living beings as well since it bringed a lot of pain to the person suffering from said ability.\n\nThis ability was mostly used by the Jedis during the Clone Wars, since most of their enemies were battle droids, they usually didn't hesitate on using it since many of them didn't see the droids as living beings. It was also believed that Force Crush worked more easily on droids than on living beings since they were more fragile to crush than a person.","meta":{"index":28,"author":"bonniealfonsochica","name":"Force Crush","release_year":2023}},"Dopplegänger":{"content":"# Description\nA Force user could create an exact copy of themselves; the clone was known under the name of a Dopplegänger.

A Force Phantom is really similar to a Dopplegänger, but the difference between them is that the Force Phantom was more of a Dark Side ability, and the Force Phantom was something different than the user’s appearance. The Force Sensitive is able to control all acts of the Dopplegänger and even use the Force with him. The technology which is included in droids can detect a Dopplegänger. Some of the users of this technique were: Darth Tyranus, Jedi Master Yoda, Luke Skywalker and Xesh.","meta":{"index":29,"author":"ElMajestico","name":"Dopplegänger","release_year":2023}},"Shatterpoint":{"content":"# Introduction\nShatterpoints were a series of intricate fault lines within a person or object. Those highly disciplined in Force mastery or born with natural talent in the Force were able to sense these fault lines through the Force regardless of their allegiance, specifically noting actions that produced the makeup of what was presented before them. With this knowledge, users of this technique were capable of targeting the weaker points in order to “shatter” whatever challenged them.# Application\nThe ability to influence shatterpoints comes in the form of both physical objects and events. In a physical manner, a Force user could spectate an object through the usage of the Force and see the history of how the said object was constructed, more specifically, the weak points of the object. This would allow the user to shatter the object into multiple different pieces due to their ability to identify and alter the fault lines of an object, even the strongest materials known within the galaxy. Users were also capable of perceiving shatterpoints through different scenarios by using the Force to identify the different actions and people within them, taking note of how these factors came together to create a said scenario. Due to this, it was possible for one to see all the vulnerability represented through the actions that had transpired. From there, a decision could be made regarding what actions seen from the fault lines are the best ones to take in order to break the shatterpoint.\n\n# History\nUsage of this ability dates back to 3653 BBY during the Cold War, this power would be used by both Sith and Jedi throughout the war. Mace Windu, a Jedi Master during the Clone Wars that was most known for this technique, was able to see the different shatterpoints in Darth Sidious during their battle. He sensed the connection between Sidious and Anakin, recognizing the faults in their connection, that very shatterpoint being Sidious’s faith in Anakin. In other words, the weakness within Darth Sidious that Windu perceived through the Force was the foul chancellor’s trust in Anakin that would lead to his downfall.\n\n","meta":{"index":3,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Shatterpoint","release_year":2022}},"Force Fear":{"content":"# Introduction\nForce Fear is an aspect of the Force that is used by the Sith and the Jedi that has the tendency to the dark side.

The wielder that uses the Force Fear on the victim would strike into the victim’s deepest parts of the mind, drawing it out. This would cause the victim to shake uncontrollably, while the victim’s capabilities would be subject to degradation. The wielder could use the pure force of will, and this causes the victim to lose their courage, and if the victim cannot defend their mind, the effects of Force Fear would cause them to feel depression rapidly, with the ever growing of their hopelessness, and filling the victim with a sense of regret.\n\nForce Fear was then classified as an ability of the Dark Side, which is why the Sith and the Jedi that contained the tendency of the Dark side oftenly used it. However, the Jedi usually use this ability in order to diffuse an escalated situation.\n\nThis ability is basic compared to its advanced variants, Force horror and Force insanity. Force horror had an ability to cause multiple targets to enter into a catastrophic state of panic, with the full concentration of fear and more powerful compared to Force fear, with the victims finding it difficult to defend against unlike the Force fear. The another variant, Force insanity causes the multiple targets to be driven into agitated madness, degrading their state of mind as they descend into a complete helpless state, feeling nothing but full scale of hopelessness.\n\n","meta":{"index":40,"author":"ShineEpic","name":"Force Fear","release_year":2023}},"Force Choke":{"content":"# Introduction\nForce Choke was a very notable ability which was used mainly by users of the Dark Side or those who identified themselves as Sith. This ability was also known as “Force Grip”. This ability would allow the user to telekinetically choke the victim while usually making a clenched fist gesture. This was a quite advanced technique of telekinesis, which was most seen by the Sith or Dark Side users. On some occasions, Jedi or other light side Force Sensitives would use this technique, or other moves which were quite similar. Force Choke was relied on and fueled mainly from dark emotions such as hatred, anger, or fear. The more they were inclined on the dark side, the stronger the grip on the user was. Force Choke was such a powerful ability, that it could crush someone’s throat if wanted to, or stop airflow to the lungs. Users that were strong with this ability were able to make their victim levitate in the air, while choking them. Sometimes, this method was used as a torturing method, in order to gain information from their enemies, or to make someone obey the person who was choking them.# Combative Purposes\nDuring combat, the ability to Force Choke a victim would be very effective when fighting one-on-one. Most of the time a Sith would use the ability to make them fly towards their saber’s blade, killing them with it. Popular users who would use this method would be Asajj Ventress, in which she did this to a Clone Trooper during the Clone Wars. Whilst fighting a Force Sensitive who possessed a lightsaber, this could be used to make them start to choke, dropping their lightsaber in the process, which would make them quite vulnerable considering they would not have a weapon to defend themselves besides the Force. Some users were very strong with this ability that they could choke multiple victims at once, or even choke them from very far away.\n\n# Popular Users\nMany popular Sith used this method of telekinesis in order to defeat their opponents, or just to make them suffer. Some users who were shown to use this ability to a great level were Anakin Skywalker, who would later become Darth Vader. Darth Sidious, who would hold the role of the Emperor for a while. Supreme Leader Snoke, who was able to defeat a General who was part of the First Order from light years away, and many other popular duelists. There were also some Jedi who were shown to use the ability, such as Ahsoka Tano, the padawan of Anakin Skywalker whom she most likely learned this from. Barriss Offee, who was choking a prisoner, and it was blamed on Tano, making her leave the Jedi Order, and others who did it once or twice in their lifetime.\n\n","meta":{"index":2,"author":"OfficiallyMommy","name":"Force Choke","release_year":2022}},"Psychometry":{"content":"# Overview\nPsychometry, postcognition, tai vordrax, or telemetry, are all names to refer to the same thing, a Force mental power that made its user capable of perceiving the history about the object touched and the people that had surrounded it.# Description\nThis power made it so the user could view events as if they had been there at that moment. That included everything, even the emotions of those that had wielded the object before. The main disadvantage it had was that it was extremely easy to use in everyday used objects than in those objects that had only been used 2 or 3 times. It was a great skill for explorers as it helped with tracking, however during a battle it wasn’t useful as an opponent's position constantly changes. This power was extremely dangerous for wielders of the light side, as the usage of it in an object wielded by a dark side wielder could eventually make them fall into the dark side. However, as a dark Side wielder, it was a very strong power, enough to even be used in living things and tear their minds apart. The use of this technique on dead bodies was prohibited by the Jedi Council, as the emotions one had nearing his end likely paired with the dark side. It was even more extreme during the time of the Invasion of Naboo, where the Jedi Order had their position questioned and the dark side was strong making it extremely easy for Jedi to fall to it if they experienced strong emotions.

Darth Sidious was one of the most notable users who used this ability, showing a great example of how powerful his ability can be after he disabled the ships in the Citizen’s Fleet from a great distance.# Countering\nThis ability could be deflected and countered with a lightsaber or with the ability of Force deflection, but only for a short while. This was proved by Jedi Master Yoda using Force deflection to deflect it and Jedi Master Mace Windu and Rey deflecting Darth Sidious’ lightning. Because Rey deflected the dominance of his force lightning, it led Sidious to his demise. Even any personal energy shield could protect against the ability, such as the gurgan shields.\n\n# Prohibitions/variations\nAlthough Jedi could use it, using it was prohibited by the Jedi Order and its members. The ability had at least four color variations: blue, green, yellow, and red. Darth Sidious and other notable users like Rey, Snoke, and Darth Tyranus had the blue to purple variation which was the most common one.

The casters would make the victim relive all of their trauma, even if it was only a little. They soon realised that once someone had undergone such torture, they would have a very small but significant increase in efficiency and intelligence. This ability, due to its effect on people was called Torture by Chagrin.# History\nTorture by Chagrin was a Force ability that was used over the millennia by few Dark Side groups, including the Order of the Sith Lords. It consisted of mentally reaching into the victim's mind and forcing them to relive their worst memories. The victim would experience their most painful and embarrassing memories, causing them physical pain. This ability was used by Darth Wyyrlok III in his duel against Darth Krayt in the Battle of Yavin, and again by Darth Maladi and Cade Skywalker in the world of Wayland.\n\nDiscovered by the Sorcerer Rokur Gepta the subjects showed a slight increase in intelligence and efficiency after being tortured. He believed he could make Lando Calrissian last for several weeks before the gambler's mind finally snapped, and he died.

With this ability, you can create things such as Force Whirlwinds, and fogs. The Alter Environment manifestation needed a mastery of basic force abilities, such as Force pull and Force push, since it relied on them.# Description\nWith the Alter Environment force skill, you could manipulate temperatures. The temperature manipulation could be used in combat to freeze your enemies to death or light them on fire. You could also manipulate air pressure with this, which links this ability and the Force push together. With Alter Environment its user could manipulate lighting in a majestic way which could let anyone with this skill mastered win any fight. This ability may work on a larger scale too, those who are born strong with the force may use this ability to manipulate places, we could even say planets. That is what happened to Dromund Kaas, the Sith Emperor used this ability to corrupt its environment. This manifestation of the Force is a powerful power that could be used in monstrous ways to destroy, but with this, you can also create.

It was a barrier composed of Force energy and was used to block out destructive attacks. Because it belonged to the same branch of Telekinesis, it aligned to any Force user. This ability could also protect you from a poisonous gas because it couldn’t enter the barrier, once used in such a manner by Aayla Secura and Yoda. Darth Vader would also use this ability often to protect himself from environmental dangers such as falling remains of terrain, stopping seawater from swallowing him, holding back explosions, and blast fire. As said, this ability could hold out even explosions, shown once again by Kanan Jarrus using a force barrier to save his crew from dying by such a cause.\n\nWhile fleeing from the Fortress Inquisitorius on the planet Nur, Cere Junda used the ability to avert Darth Vader’s lightsaber from wounding her and Cal Kestis. He managed to wound a bit of the barrier until they escaped.\n\nIn 9 ABY, a member of Yoda’s species used the technique to defend and deflect a pressure wave of fire from an Incinerator trooper.\n\nIn 35 ABY, Kylo Ren used a version of this ability to stop a bowcaster bolt.

We could say that the most powerful user of Force Stealth was Darth Sidious, Sidious kept himself hidden with this ability which allowed him to not be detected by the Jedi High Council. Force Stealth is one of the reasons why Sidious didn’t get detected and why his plan did not fail.  It was used mostly during and after Order 66, where Jedi that survived the purge would use it to not get detected by the Galactic Empire’s forces.  A good example of this was Obi-Wan Kenobi. Kenobi was a Jedi Master who was one of the Jedi that survived the Great Jedi Purge and used Force stealth to keep himself hidden.

Maw after getting his lower body destroyed by Jedi Master Qu Rahn in a duel was able to move around, and fight using this technique. Even without his lower body, Maw remained a skilled duelist because he knew the technique of Force-flight.

This ability built on the foundations of the Force Push and amplified it to cover 360° around the user and to greater effect, staggering or knocking back anyone caught within the zone of attack. Unlike its basic counterpart, the Repulse manifested physically as a wave of distortion in the atmosphere akin to ripples in the air or a small sonic boom.# Application\nForce Repulse could be used both offensively and defensively, it can drive off multiple attackers in the event of one being surrounded or obliterate a squadron of fodder enemy forces given the intention of the user. Alternatively for an attack, one can hurtle vast amounts of debris or upturn the ground beneath them to uproot an opponent. No matter the technique at play both those adept in the Light or Dark can use this ability to great effect.\n\n# Practitioners\nSavage Opress - In 20 BBY Opress demonstrated this ability whilst attempting to flee Darth Tyrannus’ flagship after a failed assassination attempt, in his attempt he was met with heavy resistance from armed droids who surrounded him and opened fire, Savage attempted to defend against the assault, yet was unsuccessful and received multiple blaster wounds. All was not lost for Opress however, by tapping into his pain for strength Opress unleashed a Force Repulse and incapacitated the droids before fleeing and escaping on a nearby ship.\nStarkiller - The clone of deceased apprentice Galen Malek refined the Force Repulse over his training into a much more destructive force. Using his unimaginable power in the Force, Starkiller was able to reach a point where his repulse would disintegrate any organic matter and obliterate anything inorganic if he wished for it to be so.\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi - In 22 BBY Kenobi utilized a basic yet powerful version of the Force Repulse to obliterate the bounty hunter Durge from the inside after being absorbed by the bounty hunter in a final bid for victory.\n\n","meta":{"index":11,"author":"ard1974","name":"Force Repulse","release_year":2022}},"Battle Meditation":{"content":"# Overview\nBattle Meditation was a Force ability that was used to influence armies and fleets during conflicts, wars or battles.

Force nexuses were usually the consequence of an action, ones that usually involved being the final resting place of the bodies of Force wielders or being the place that tethered their spirits to the physical world. Members of both Sith and Jedi were well aware of the existence of nexuses, the former usually seeking to harness the energy there for themselves. It should be noted that if an item was left in a Force nexus and exposed to the energies in it, it would eventually be imbued with a special ability such as being able to withstand certain plasma-based Force abilities. It was possible that if the nexus was of a certain aspect of the Force like the dark side, the item that was empowered from the nexus would be unbearable for those who followed the light.# Notable examples\nKorriban, the original homeworld of the Sith species and its Valley of the Dark Lords was a powerful Force nexus of the dark side, mainly due to the innumerable amount of Sith Lords buried and entombed within it.\n\nIn Dagobah, there was a Force nexus known as the Dark Side Cave which was the final resting place of a powerful unnamed Dark Jedi. When he was struck down, his energies were absorbed into the cave which birthed a nexus strong in the dark side. Those who entered in search of answers would often experience visions that would either have them receive a great epiphany or be traumatised from the experience.\n\nIn Wild Space, close to the Unknown Regions, Odessen was a planet strong in both the dark and light sides of the Force, maintaining an equilibrium of both. It was the place that Grandmaster Satele Shan exiled herself to in repentance after the Eternal Empire dominated both the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.\n\nWhat many believe to have been the most powerful Force nexus in the history of the galaxy, the Valley of the Jedi was the site of a battle between the Brotherhood of Darkness and the Jedi Order with the support of the Republic. It had become a Force nexus due to the trapped souls of over a hundred Jedi and Sith as the result of Lord Kaan’s thought bomb detonating and confining them. It was a virtually inexhaustible well of power and Jerec, a Dark Jedi, engulfed some of the dormant energy and became nigh-godlike. However, he was killed by Kyle Katarn, a Jedi who would free the tormented trapped souls of the valley and allow them to finally rest.\n\n","meta":{"index":44,"author":"daedima","name":"Force Nexus","release_year":2022}},"Force Blast":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Force Blast is a Force Ability primarily used by the Sith and other Dark Side Users. The ability consists of projecting concentrated blasts of pure Dark Side Energy at whatever the user is aiming at. This tends to cause extreme amounts of damage to anyone or anything that it connects with. Using one’s hands as a point of projection, someone using the Force Blast would focus the concentrated Dark Side Energy into their hands and be able to throw it at their targets. Due to the immense power that pure Dark Side Energy has, the Force Blast would cause the user damage as well for the first few times that they used it. The damage would usually consist of burns to the hands but with no feeling of pain due to the amount of energy flowing through the user. The power of the Blast could be enhanced if the user was in possession of a Sith Amulet.# Origins and Notable Users\nThe origins of the Force Blast can be dated back to 3998 BBY(Before the Battle of Yavin) when Ommin, the King of planet Onderon at the time, used the ability to fight back against two Jedi Knights that were sent to free a Jedi Master from imprisonment. Catching the Jedi off guard with the unknown power, Ommin had the upper hand against the Jedi until one of the Jedi, Ulic Qel-Droma, sliced Ommin’s armature, an exoskeleton that Ommin used to move around. Without the exoskeleton, Ommin could no longer move and crumpled to the ground. Another user of the ability, Exar Kun, gained the ability to use the Force Blast when the spirit of Freedon Nadd guided Kun to a Sith Amulet. Exar Kun used the newly gained power to destroy Freedon Nadd's spirit. Even though the Force Blast had damaged Kun, Kun enjoyed the use of the power and would continue to use it commonly against his enemies. During the Second Battle of Empress Teta when Kun stormed the Krath Palace located in Cinnagar, Kun clashed with Sorceress Aleema Keto. Keto shot a Force Blast of her own at Kun. Kun blocked this and sent back an even stronger Force Blast that sent her across the room. As a Force Ghost, Kun would use the Force Blast ability to kill one of Luke Skywalker's younglings, Gantoris, for not turning to the Dark Side.\n\n","meta":{"index":5,"author":"60328","name":"Force Blast","release_year":2023}},"Force Corruptions":{"content":"# Overview\nForce corruption represents a profound and perilous aspect of the Force within the Star Wars universe.

In a broader sense, Tutaminis was the ability to absorb potentially harmful heat and energy sources through the user’s bare hands and diffuse it or channel it for another use. The ability was taught to more or less every Jedi during the days of the Galactic Republic and was expected to be perfected upon graduation from the academy, wielders of this ability developed the skills around it over a lifetime. In addition, it was not strictly for use by the Jedi; every force-sensitive organization practiced Tutaminis, including the Sith. While Tutaminis was usually used to absorb impact from blaster bolts or lightsaber blades, more advanced use of Tutaminis allowed the wielder to absorb other Force powers, such as Sith lightning (as famously demonstrated by Jedi Grandmaster Yoda), heat, and even microwave and electromagnetic radiation, such as gamma or alpha rays. Tutaminis users could also use the absorbed energy to heal their own wounds, describing the ability as a “non-harmful Force Drain”.","meta":{"index":36,"author":"KenjiVolt","name":"Tutaminis","release_year":2022}},"Cryokinesis":{"content":"# Overview\nCryokinesis was a force ability that allowed its user to draw heat away from an object, person, or organism, causing its temperature to drop rapidly and drastically. This arcane technique causes the heat vitality of the victim to suddenly rupture. The subject would become cold to the touch, shrouded in ice, and incredibly brittle.# Body\nDarth Bane’s teaching system was separated into 3 schools, or focal points. Body, the second school, encompasses the abilities that draw from the living Force. The premise of Body was to draw on the user’s own cells and then use that to alter or affect the physical structures of others. Most notable from this category was Force Lightning, Life Drain, etc. Darth Bane stated, “The demands of the Dark Side can ravage the flesh, but fortunately it is possible to balance the scales by siphoning life from another to bolster your own.”\n\n# Darth Bane\nCryokinesis is heavily aligned with the dark side of the force, in fact it is most likely exclusive to Sith. Darth Bane was one of the only Sith to ever master this ability, and not only that but he passed it onto future generations with his famous teachings. Unfortunately, Cryokinesis got lost somewhere in the swarm of generations. Regardless, Darth Bane made a comment on this specific ability, he described it as  “A siphoning of essence that leaches the life intensity from another, leaving behind a first-shrouded corpse”. The strange thing about this comment is the keyword leech. Although Cryokinesis, in a way, drains the life force of an individual, it doesn’t absorb another’s heat into your own body like most other Body teachings do. Cryokinesis is a means to completely ruin your victim, not to bolster your own vitality or strength. Also, unlike its name, Cryokinesis doesn’t allow you to manipulate ice or cold air from your fingertips, the power itself instead freezes another’s body from the inside.\n\n","meta":{"index":35,"author":"Wither117717","name":"Cryokinesis","release_year":2023}},"Dark Illusion":{"content":"# Overview\nDark Illusion was a power that grew from the dark side of the Force.

The user would then have to concentrate all of their energy into the bond so that they could compound the blood with Force Lightning.

This ability would make the opponent's mind clouded as well as the body stop in its tracks. With a powerful user and the right scenario it could be on the same level of power and utility as Force Affliction and Force Plague.# Variants\nForce affliction was a variant of Force Slow. This ability acted as a poison and began to gradually shut down bodily functions and individual components, in rare cases where the user is strong enough this gradual shutdown could progress to death.\n\nForce Plague was also a variant of Force Slow. This version built upon Force Affliction and made it more powerful.

This move was mostly used by the Jedi before the Galactic Empire arose, but it was also used by the Disciples of Twilight, a force-sensitive group of individuals stationed on the moon Dyspeth. The Force Cloak should not be confused with Force Blank, an ability which caused a Void in the force. This technique of Force Cloak was mainly practiced by force-sensitives ever since the old days of the Republic. Practitioners would photo-kinetically call to the force to bend light itself and even sound to render oneself invisible. This skill can come to people who are naturally strong with the force, trying to learn it through normal study can be a very difficult process though.

The speed of this degradation is so rapid that it seems to render the argument for life after death moot.# Details\nAll beings are afraid of oblivion. Every culture has written fables to assure themselves that death is not the end. Even the Jedi do this. Through midichlorians, they believe that they have a connection to the universe’s fundamental energies that others do not. Therefore, Darth Plagueis was reluctant to dismiss their histories too rapidly.\n  During the Great Sith War, Jedi combatants were said to have vanished at the moment of their deaths, with the cells of their bodies sublimating into energy. It must be noted that although many Darth have witnessed the death of Jedi, none of them have ever witnessed this phenomenon.\n  Some of these Jedi were said to have returned as pure consciousness, communicating specific and verifiable information to the living.

However, even when considering its advantages this ability would also be exploited by strong force users who sought to deceive and manipulate others.# History\nDuring the time of the Clone Wars, Darth Sidious and Darth Tyrannus would perform a dark ritual in hopes of breaking Jedi Grand Master Yoda’s will. Tyrannus and Yoda would have their bond restored however it proved too weak to break Yoda’s will. Sometime after the creation of the Galactic Empire and its significant rise to power, the young padawan Ezra Bridger would become psychically linked to Darth Maul which was a result of the merging of two holocrons.

It was in essence, a desperate and powerful attempt to turn the tide of a losing battle in most cases, but it could also be used to express triumph, such as when Exar Kun won his battle against the spirit of Freedon Nadd and let out an incredibly powerful Force scream, one so potent it could be heard light-years away.# Notable Users\nAlthough the ability is a staple for many dark side practitioners, one of the more significant ones who used it were Freedon Nadd, Exar Kun, the Sith triumvirate and Darths of the reconstituted Sith Empire like Darth Malgus or Darth Baras. In later eras, following the rule of two, Sith who particularly fixated on their rage used the ability well like Darth Maul.

This ability could do no physical damage to an opponent yet was highly effective at affecting an opponent's mental state by playing on one’s fears and regrets to temporarily incapacitate them with illusions.# Application\nThe application of this ability was very rare among the Sith, having only one historical usage. This was in part due to the high amount of power required to cast this ability and the requirements needed to do so. This, therefore, meant that less taxing and convenient techniques were more suitable and effective. For one, the target needed to have such regrets and losses in the first place for the technique to reach its full effect. Moreover, in its one historical usage, the technique was so complex that its practitioner required the assistance of numerous Force Spirits of deceased Dark Lords to be able to cast the ability. Furthermore, the nature of the ability renders it useless for close combat situations where the preparation of the very skill could result in being cut down before it is even being cast.\n\n# Practitioners\nThe first recorded usage of Corpse Vision was in 23 BBY by Darth Tyrannus who used the technique with the help of the fallen Sith Lords on Korriban to conjure visions to haunt the eight-strong Jedi team who were on the planet to hunt two infamous criminals. Tyrannus aimed to halt the Jedi to allow him to seize the opportunity to meet and ally with the two criminals. The ability in its use was a great success as it subjugated the entire Jedi force to visions in that some were unable to shake off without external help.

When the Emperor began to grow suspicions, Nyriss arranged for assassination attempts upon herself to draw away suspicion. Nyriss then led Lord Scourge, the Sith who the Emperor had selected to research, through a series of tests and manipulations to work out whether he could join the conspiracy, and she or he recruited him to their cause by showing Scourge the Emperor's ravaged homeworld of Nathema after the Sith Lord killed Xedrix. However, Scourge would betray the conspiracy to the Emperor four years later so as to free the captive Jedi Master Revan, as Scourge had joined forces with Revan's friend Meetra Surik in a shot to destroy the Emperor, furthermore as being dissatisfied with the conspiracy's unwillingness to act because of power plays and doublecrossing that preventing them from making any progress. The Sith ruler summoned the nine innocent Council members to his chambers while he dispatched the Imperial Guard to destroy the three conspirators, and he smoothly killed those nine because the Guard killed the three traitors and destroyed their power bases. Revan, Surik, and Scourge would fail in their attack, but the Emperor appointed twelve new members to the Council with the unspoken warning that traitors would receive the identical fate as Nyriss and therefore the others.\n\n","meta":{"index":25,"author":"Ruvjaal","name":"Dark Council","release_year":2022}},"Sith Spy":{"content":"# Overview\nSith spies were hidden observers throughout the Empire and beyond.

Normally, the Emperor's Wrath, Lord Scourge, would deal with the usurper, but as he had deserted his post to ally with the Hero of Tython, Servant One and Servant Two searched the Empire for a replacement in his stead. Out of the countless Sith they found, they chose Darth Baras's former Sith apprentice, whom the Darth chose to betray. This Sith was awarded the position of Emperor's Wrath and worked with the Hand to weaken Baras's powerbase so as to ultimately eliminate the threat posed by him.# The Middle\nAfter the Emperor's defeat at the hands of the Hero of Tython on Dromund Kaas, the Hand ordered the Imperial Guard to recover their master's true body and conceal it in a safe place while his weakened spirit recovered from the fight. The Hand maintained instant communication with the Wrath tasking them with unifying the Empire. The Hand was targeted by Dark Councilor Vowrawn, who went as far as interrogating a Servant, when the Sith discovered his friend; the Emperor's Wrath was being spied on. After the Wrath destroyed the Opticron droids, Servant One came personally to capture Darth Vowrawn and question the Wrath's loyalty. The Wrath wasn't fascinated by Servant One's ramblings therefore they severed their connection to the Hand and ultimately the Sith Emperor.\n\n# The End\nAfter the Invasion of Ziost, when the previous Sith Emperor shed his Sith identity and resumed his mantle of Valkorion (leader of the Eternal Empire) he decided that he had transcended his previous limitations and now did not require his Hand, Voice or Children. During the renewed galactic conflict, after the Meridian Complex battle, the now Emperor Vowrawn announced the reformation of the Emperor's Hand into the Hand of the Empire without the Dark Council's knowledge, finding the Hand best suited to house wartime activities by working autonomously rather than serving under individual Sith Lords. With the new development, Darth Rivix was appointed to the Hand of the Empire.\n\n","meta":{"index":1,"author":"Ruvjaal","name":"Emperor's Hand","release_year":2022}},"Sith Warrior":{"content":"# Introduction\nIn the vast and intricate tapestry of the Star Wars universe, few figures evoke as much fear and fascination as the Sith Warrior.

This council consisted of a total of ten Sith Lords that served as advisors to the Dark Lord of the Sith, reinforcing his will and establishing order among the Old Sith Empire. Each respective member of the Sith Council held influence over many different worlds within the galaxy but as a collective, they congregated to discuss matters pertaining to the Empire’s welfare.# History\nThis system within the Sith Empire was devised by the Dark Jedi that enslaved the Sith species during the Hundred Year Darkness in 6900 BBY. Part of their alterations to Sith tradition and society involved introducing the Sith Council to advise the Dark Lord of the Sith. The concept of the Shadow Hand, which was the second-in-command and usually the apprentice to the Dark Lord of the Sith continued to exist but the Sith Council took priority.\n\n\n\n\nMarka Ragnos and his Sith Council are the most notable individuals that partook in this form of government within the Sith Empire.

Following the death of Marka Ragnos, Ludo Kressh and Naga Sadow sought to succeed him. Kressh and Sadow would engage in many battles and other conflicts to determine the next Dark Lord of the Sith. Sadow eventually deceived the Sith Council by telling them the Galactic Republic intended to launch small-scale hit and run attacks on the Sith Empire. In respect to Sadow’s provided information, the majority of the Sith Council nominated him for the position of Dark Lord of the Sith. Ludo Kressh saw through the lies of Naga Sadow and invaded his fortress with two other Sith Lords to put a halt to his plans but failed miserably, granting Naga Sadow the title he desired.\n\n\nA few years after the Galactic Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY that resulted in the near decimation of the Sith Empire and the Sith as a whole, Lord Vitiate emerged to reform the Sith and establish a new Sith Empire. Vitiate managed to gather thousands of other Sith Lords on the world of Nathema through deception where he would then partake in a ritual known as the Ritual of Nathema to absorb the life essence of the planet and the other Lords to grant him immense power. After discovering the dark and ancient world of Dromund Kaas, the now proclaimed Emperor Vitiate created the Reconstituted Sith Empire, abolishing the Sith Council entirely. Given his title as Sith Emperor, he created the Dark Council to replace the Sith Council. Both concepts presented similarity, though the Dark Council consisted of a twelve-member council of Dark Lords of the Sith. Instead of confining specific duties to the organization as the Sith Council did, members of the Dark Council held control over different aspects of the Sith Empire by acting as overlords of their own powerbases known as the Spheres of Influence.\n\n","meta":{"index":7,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Sith Council","release_year":2022}},"Sith Hand":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe rank of Sith Hand was a title given to Darth Krayt’s personal executioners of his will in his One Sith or New Sith Order.

Unfortunately, the temple fell alongside its housing planet after the events of the Great Hyperspace War. \n\nThe Sith Emperor Vitiate later took control of Dromund Kaas and took the temple as his own in 4,980 BBY. He ordered his followers to expand on the structure, create more of his experiments inside, plus also bury his rivals prior. Vitiate then ordered the closure of the temple, concealing vengeful spirits and powerful artifacts in the process; until it was later reopened during the events of the Cold War. \n\nThe spirits within took control of the archaeologists and explorers, with the inspiration of Lord Kallig’s fury, and managed to become an uncontrollable site by both the Sith and Empire. The possessed beings were later cleansed by the Dark Honor Guard and Vitiate himself, and simultaneously defended the temple against an assault led by the Hero of Tython in 3,640 BBY. The battle forced the Emperor to collapse a large portion of the territory while also forcing his essence out of his body.# Layout\nLocated in Dromund Kaas, the Dark Temple was built atop a hill found West of Kaas City. Its main section was a large rectangular hall that extended into the mountains and was constructed of dark gray and black stone. The temple’s exterior contains a large obelisk found in the entrance arch, having a massive eye carved onto it that represented the Sith Emperor. The temple’s roof contained large horn-like structures and contained a few cracks that let light into the interior. \n\nSince the temple was deep inside the mountains, its interior housed various rooms and chambers that were open to the air, regardless of being inside caves. Its entrance was built as a grand processional approach, met with multiple staircases, walls, statues, and a large courtyard. The temple’s center was filled with large statues that were bowing, placed on each side of the courtyard looking towards the pathway.\n\nFurther inside the temple is a grand entrance that leads to a tall area that leads to a spiral of stairs. The stairs split into two after reaching their final destination in the main hall. This area contained two hallways with multiple statues in the center space bowing opposite the pillars they were located in. At the north of this hall was a giant statue of a Sith Pureblood staring at the ceiling with both his arms laid out. The hall had four different exits branching off from the chamber’s center. The eastern path housed a spiral staircase that led to the balcony. The northwest path was an entrance to the tunnels under the temple. The southern path led to the Temple’s reliquary, where Emperor Vitiate stored powerful artifacts, next to another path that leads to Lord Ergast’s shrine. \n\nBehind the Pureblood statue, there is a staircase that connects the first and second floors and has a door in the upper level that opens up to the Temple’s inner chambers. To its east lay another door into the Unquiet Chamber. The entirety of the Dark Temple was filled with a greenish light, with paved gray floors with ornamental structures drawn within. When the Emperor took over the Temple, he forced his followers to construct its interior to contain Dark Side energy, so it may serve as a powerful prison and a secure site for his artifacts.\n\n# Early History\nThe Dark Temple was built by Sith Lord Pharshol, his followers, and certain colonists of the Old Sith Empire. The colonists resided within the temple as it was one of the few man-made structures built on a jungle planet filled with hostile creatures. Shortly after its completion, Pharshol’s rival Vacuus and his followers–the Dark Path–infiltrated the Temple and attempted to capture Pharshol’s followers. Vacuus, Pharshol, his apprentice; along with many of their followers, perished in the battle and were buried within the Temple. When Aloysius Kallig died at the hands of Tulak Hord, he was also buried within the Dark Temple, and Lord Ergast followed him shortly thereafter.\n\nDromund Kaas later became abandoned but rediscovered during the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Wars in 4,980 BBY. Two decades later, the Sith Emperor of the newly established Empire was drawn into the Temple after hearing echoes of the Dark Side. With the help of Dread Master Brontes’ insight, the Emperor ordered an expansion to the Dark Temple, where he used this structure to contain the artifacts he created and the tombs of his enemies. The Emperor later ordered the closure of the Dark Temple, and it remained abandoned for thousands of years.\n\n# The Temple's Reopening\nDuring 3,643 BBY, a group of Sith took advantage of the Emperor’s absence during the Cold War and led an expedition that breached the gates of the Dark Temple. They unknowingly woke the spirit of the late Lord Kallig, who lashed his fury onto the trespassers and possessed the majority of the invaders. Not even the Dark Council was able to contain and punish the rogue Sith members as almost no one returned alive or as themselves.\n\n","meta":{"index":23,"author":"RavMalvern","name":"Dark Temple on Dromund Kaas","release_year":2022}},"Outer Rim Territories":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Outer Rim is the largest and least densely populated region of the galaxy, with most of it's inhabitants being scattered. The Outer Rim is home to notable planets such as Tatooine, Geonosis, Mustafar, and Korriban. The region is mostly run by crime organizations such as the Hutt Cartel, with them even having their own space called the \"Hutt Cartel\". The Outer Rim's sheer size made full control over it by a faction impossible as the resources and manpower required would reach billions. Rebellions were also prone in the region as the difference between the Core Worlds and Outer Rim planets was major to the point citizens would resent and spark rebellions. Although parts of the Outer Rim were colonized by factions such as the Republic and Empire, controlling the colonized planets was tough. Pirates and smugglers plagued the Outer Rims as there were little to no patrol forces in the region; sometimes, even the pirates hijack unsuspecting transport fleets because hiding in the Outer Rims was easy. During the Clone Wars, the Outer Rim was contested by the Republic and Confederation due to the number of resources on some planets. This soon made the Outer Rims a staging ground for war, with most wars such as the Cold War mostly taking place in the Outer Rims.

Because of this, the students preferred to use the Force to kill, making them some of the deadliest assassins across the galaxy.# Sections One\nDuring the Clone Wars, various Sith met up at the ruins of the academy, including Darth Maul and his brother, Savage Opress. While this was happening, a Jedi managed to infiltrate the area in search of pieces of a holocron. The holocron was used to open the door to the academy. By opening the door he was able to access the area where the Sith were gathered and slaughtered a group of Sith Acolytes and then killed four training droids.

This capital city was located on Ziost atop a high cliff, constructed with gray granite, expanding to an area so large that it covered even the surface of the planet leading down to the icy caves within the lower levels. This ancient site would see many different reconstructions as well as be affiliated with different Sith organizations throughout history.# History\nAfter the fall of Sith King Adas in 27,700 BBY, the remainder of his loyal followers continued to spread his tradition of the Sith and its culture by abandoning Korriban to rebuild the species in his name. The priest caste of the Sith known as the Kissai acted as the oversight of this reformation and with enough time and effort, the sect developed the Sith Citadel on Ziost. Korriban was abandoned as the capital of the Sith and Ziost succeeded it to become the newer capital to establish Sith domination and power. \n\n\n\nThe Sith continued to thrive in their newer setting even throughout millennia. Ziost remained untouched by foreigners until the arrival of the Dark Jedi exiles in 6900 BBY on Korriban. This historical event was known as the Hundred-Year Darkness and the key figure Ajunta Pall alongside the rest of his Jen’jidai adherents enslaved the Sith species and formed a newer Sith Empire under their rule. Seeking to expand their power, Ajunta Pall eventually took control of Ziost as well, the Sith Citadel capital also going into his ownership. Tradition and culture did not remain as the only alteration by Pall, the Citadel quickly followed to his will, allowing the capital to expand, become a large city, provide congregational chambers for the Sith Council, as well as transform into the newer capital of the Sith Empire.\n\n\n\nFollowing the defeat and near destruction of the Sith as a whole in the Great Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY, Ziost was abandoned as well as other major worlds governed by the Sith. It wasn’t until the later years that a newer ruler of the Sith known as Lord Vitiate proclaimed himself as the Sith Emperor after forming a reconstituted Sith Empire and leading the remainder of the Sith to the hidden world known as Dromund Kaas. There, Vitiate deemed Dromund Kaas as the newer capital of the Sith, in addition to constructing a newer citadel. As a result, Ziost remained abandoned and its capital status was revoked.\n\n\nMany years later in 3680 BBY, the Sith Empire established by Emperor Vitiate conducted the Invasion of Ziost in an attempt to recolonize the world and its contents. The Sith Empire was quite successful in its efforts and did indeed manage to reclaim Ziost; however, they decided to create a newer capital city over top of the Citadel known as New Adasta as opposed to restoring the Ziost Citadel. Despite the valor given to claim Ziost once more, Vitiate used a similar ritual to the one he did on the planet Nathema to once again absorb the life essence of the inhabitants of Ziost along with any other forms of life to further empower himself. This sequence of events caused the Ziost Citadel to remain abandoned for eternity, never again seeking reconstruction.\n\n","meta":{"index":7,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Sith Citadel on Ziost","release_year":2022}},"Wild Space":{"content":"# Overview\nWild Space was the name given to the separation of the galaxy from the Unknown Regions.

According to surveys made by a pirate vessel, named Jynni’s Virtue, the valley stretched for at least a hundred kilometers or more, and at one point the canyon's floor was as deep as twelve hundred meters. Its walls were lined with tombs, similar to that of the Valley of the Dark Lords, and was covered with, what was hypothesized to be, runes of protective Sith magic. What made the valley additionally noteworthy was the containment of the tomb of a notable Sith King, Dathka Graush. Dathka Graush was a pure-blooded male Sith sorcerer born on the planet Korriban about seven thousand years before the Battle of Yavin.

Underneath it, a platform lowered visitors down into the ground, where the main portion of the Citadel was. It is known to have housed the Sith Throne Room and a laboratory and had a large hallway with many ancient statues of Sith Lords. The Throne Room housed the Throne of the Sith which sat across from a large amphitheater. The laboratory was filled with machines dedicated to cloning and bioengineering. Amongst these machines were vats filled with nutrient-rich fluid to house the cloned bodies of Snoke, which were used as bodies by Darth Sidious.# Activity Within the Citadel\nThe Citadel was originally used by the Sith for rituals and meetings, however, it became the center for Sith activity during the reign of Darth Sidious as Galactic Emperor. The Sith Eternal Cult named the Citadel their headquarters and began to experiment with cloning and extending the lifespan of Darth Sidious, the goal being to make his lifespan indefinite. Using the cloning technology Sidious and the Sith Eternal created soldiers called the Sith Eternal Guard, who were stationed on Exegol. These soldiers were little more than an experiment in cloning and were later killed by Vader when he discovered the Citadel. The Sith Eternal built up the Sith Army on Exegol, conscripting their children into it and, during the reign of the First Order, kidnapping children from the First Order’s training program to become members of the Sith Army. Further cloning experiments lead to the creation of a regular human clone who was set free. He would go on to father a Force-sensitive daughter, Rey. \n\nAfter his death, Darth Sidious was resurrected on Exegol and began to prepare it to be the place from which he would rule his new Sith Empire, constructing a throne room to house the Throne of the Sith. Sidious also improved the ancient Sith shipyard and created the Final Order, a massive fleet of Xyston-class Star Destroyers. This fleet was supposed to be used to take over the Galaxy and establish a new Sith Empire. \n\nThe Citadel was eventually discovered by Kylo Ren who journeyed to it to kill Sidious but was persuaded to instead hunt down Rey Palpatine in exchange for control over the forces of the Final Order.

Once Surik and her companions met with Kelborn, a companion of Surik’s, Jedi Master Keria recognized that the Sith were on the moon of Dxun. Master Keria would counsel action against the Sith. Before Surik headed to help the loyalist of Queen Talia she would charge three of your companions with stopping the Sith.

Usually referred to as the ‘’graveyard of the Sith’’. It was situated in the Valley of Dark Lords in which a lot of tombs were made especially for feared and strong Sith Lords to be resting peacefully in. It used to be at the rear side of the valley.# Description\nThe Temple could be described as a massive stone structure. In the main part of the Temple was the Hall of Judgment, which held an indefinite number of deceased Sith Lords, which all remained fully untouched, thanks to the guardians and the tomb raiders of the dark side of the Force. Tuk’ata hounds were the sole guardians of the tombs, rendering grave robbers and tomb-raiders useless against their defenses, which contributed to the bodies being in perfect state as well.\n\n# History\n‘’Krath Holy Crusade’’\n\nIn 3396 BBY, a Jedi Apprentice named Exar Kun was guided into Korriban and entered the Temple, where he got tricked by the spirit that was guiding him into embracing the dark side of the Force after the destruction of the great crystal.\n\nSith Empire\n\nThe Temple has been forgotten ever since the visit of the Jedi Apprentice, for a long time. The Sith Empire occasionally held the planet, but its main use was for the Sith Academy. However, they had to move to the front of the complex, as it was deemed inhabitable due to the unstable structuring.\n\nGalactic Republic\n\nIn 23 BBY, a squad of Jedi, composed of Jedi Knights and their padawans, with their leader being Obi-Wan Kenobi, invaded the temple as they were in pursuit of two very wanted criminals within the galaxy, Granta Omega and Jenna Zan Arbor. When they entered the temple, they were met with a strong, indistinguishable presence, as if it were a Sith Lord. He didn’t realize it for a while, but later on, it was proven to be Darth Tyranus, another formidable Darth within the Sith. He was the exact opposite of the former Jedi Master Dooku, given to his altered ego. Anakin Skywalker was on the mission as well, as he glimpsed the black-hooded Sith Lord.\nKenobi was terrified at the thought of how many people had been trapped here by their desires after hard work and training. He felt everyone’s deaths, meanwhile, Anakin Skywalker, when he was just 18 years old, experienced a strange feeling, as if it was from the dark side. From his feet to his head, it was slowly rising. It was described as a traumatizing feeling as if his very nerves were about to split in half.\n\n","meta":{"index":49,"author":"GamerNoob1007","name":"Sith  Temple on Korriban","release_year":2023}},"Maw":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Maw, also referred to as the Maw Cluster, was an unstable and almost non-navigational cluster of black holes located near the well known planet called Kessel. Despite being a group of black holes, the Maw was visible to the naked eye due to the ionizing gasses that the Maw drew into it.\n\nThe cluster's stability and integrity were a mystery, however, with some theorizing that rather than it being a normal clustering of black holes it was instead a construct of an advanced alien civilization. Sometime around 44 ABY the New Jedi Order had learned from the Thuruht hive that the purpose of the Maw was that it acted as a prison for a Dark Side entity known as Abeloth, also known as the Mother. \n\nThe origins and creation of the Maw can be traced to Thuruht and other Killik hives. To help with keeping Abeloth locked away, the entities known as the Son and Daughter helped by not only joining with the hivemind but by directing the Killiks in creating both the Centerpoint Station and the Sinkhole Station. The purpose of Centerpoint was to create the Maw while the Sinkhole would maintain it from within.# Description\nThe Maw was a cluster of black holes located within the Kessel Sector, which was located in the Outer Rim Territories, and was nestled at the center of the Maw Nebulae. The Maw was visible to the naked eye due to ionizing gasses that the Maw drew towards it, which helped with it being categorized as one of the many Wonders of the Galaxy.\n\nBecause of the intense gravity projected by the cluster of black holes, the entire Kessel System was slowly drawn into the Maw as a consequence. The integrity of the Maw, however, was a mystery to most. Some believed it was held together due to careful construction by an advanced alien civilization rather than it being a result of the normal clustering of black holes.\n\nThe area surrounding the Maw was infamous for its strong gravitational forces and vast amounts of radiation and plasma that saturated it. Any ship that neared the Maw’s edge would have parts of it pulled off. Because of this hazard that turned most civilian shuttles away, smugglers and criminals would primarily use it as a shortcut past the Kessel Run, a roughly 20-parsecs route they would also use.\n\n# History\nEons before the Battle of Yavin, a group of entities called The Ones would use a station they constructed called Centrepoint Station to help create the Maw while another station they also constructed called Sinkhole Station would help to maintain its integrity from within it, as such helping to keep the Dark Side entity Abeloth locked away inside the Maw.\n\nSometime during the Xim Wars, a number of warships from Xim’s Empire would be forced to retreat to Kessel, where several of the warships were lost to the Maw.\n\nDuring the Imperial Era, the Maw was being used as the site of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's Maw Installation, where the Death Star Prototype and most of the First Death Star was built in secret, although it was completed later at the planet Despayre. \n\nTarkin theorized that the Maws' near-impossible accessibility matched with its remoteness made it the perfect spot to hide the project from the public eye. However, the installation was in reality located within a safe zone inside of the cluster which was discovered just before the start of the project.\n\nA planetoid near the Maw was also used as the site of an Imperial Detention Centre which would be the target of an assault by the Rebel Alliance’s famous Rogue Squadron after the Battle of Hoth somewhere around 3 ABY, during which a number of prisoners housed there escaped and the prison would be destroyed.\n\nThe Maw would also be the location of which an infamous superweapon, known as the Sun Crusher, would be constructed, but it would also be the place where the superweapon would also be destroyed. Its destruction was a result of being sent into one of the black holes inside the Maw. Other notable superweapons built inside the Maw were the World Devastators, the Tarkin, the Iconic Ring Ship, and the Galaxy Gun.\n\nPost-Galactic Civil War, during the Yuuzhan Vong War, Lando Calrissian would sponsor the construction of a space station called Shelter within the Maw, also helping with its construction was the remains of the prior Maw Installation, as a refuge for Jedi Knights. Shelter would be located at the very heart of the Maw and at one point would house the wartime generation of Jedi Padawans along with surviving Jedi Praxeum students.\n\nAround 43 ABY, Luke Skywalker along with his son Ben Skywalker would visit the Maw during their journey to discover why Jacen Solo fell to the Dark Side. Within the Maw, they would discover the Sinkhole Station along with the Mind Walkers, Force-Sensitives who resided within the Sinkhole Station and were capable of separating their minds from their bodies using the Force.\n\nIn 44 ABY, during the New Jedi Order’s conflict with the entity Abeloth, who was imprisoned inside the Maw, the Order would learn from the Thuruht hive that the Maw was created by Thuruht and other Killik hives to serve as a prison for Abeloth, also known as the Mother.\n\n","meta":{"index":48,"author":"BoarGrills","name":"Maw","release_year":2023}},"Citadel":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Citadel, also referred to as Citadel Station, served as a prison on Lola Sayu. The station was originally constructed by the Galactic Republic to detain renegade Jedi, however, it fell into the hands of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. At that time, Osi Sobeck assumed the role of warden. Among the captives in the citadel were Jedi Master Even Piell and Captain Wilhuff Tarkin, along with several other officers. These individuals were subjected to interrogation with the goal of seeking out the coordinates of the Nexus hyperspace route. A group of Jedi and clone troopers managed to successfully rescue them, although requiring assistance from the Republic fleet after their escape route was destroyed. In the subsequent Imperial era, the Citadel harboured a Separatist holdout.# History\nDesigned in 522 BBY, its primary purpose was to hold rogue or dark Jedi. In fact, a rogue Jedi was imprisoned there around 520 BBY. There were rumours among the Jedi that the Citadel housed a correctional unit specifically designed for Jedi with foresight abilities. Fearing that Jedi Padawan Sifo-Dyas would be imprisoned there due to his worsening Force visions, Jedi Master Lene Kostana withheld information from the Jedi Council. However, the Jedi Archives contained outdated information on the Citadel's layout during the Clone Wars.\n\n# Clone Wars\nBy the time of the Clone Wars the Citadel was taken control of by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. It was run by Osi Sobeck who took the role of warden. Under Sobeck's control, the Citadel became known as the Confederacy's most isolated prison that kept only the most dangerous prisoners. The prison was protected by a great amount of droids, and it had giant fields of electromines.\n\nIn 20 BBY, Jedi General Even Piell was captured. Piell was tortured for information about the Nexus Route. The Jedi Council sent a team led by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. After the team froze themselves to pass the life-form scanners that were set up by the Separatist fleet guarding the planet, they landed just outside the Citadel. They started to climb a cliff full of electromines, but clone trooper “Charger” fell down and hit one of the mines, letting the Confederacy know they were there. The team ended up getting in the prison and rescued Piell and his Officers.\n\nWhen they were to meet up with the other team that consisted of R2-D2 and reprogrammed Separatist battle droids, a fight started on the landing pad. ARC trooper \"Echo\" was thought to be dead when a droid commando blew up the Team’s shuttle. When the Jedi tried to escape, a team of anoobas and droids led by Sobeck ambushed them. General Piell was hardly injured by an anooba, but Piell managed to tell half of the Nexus Route to Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano before dying. Sobeck was  killed by Ahsoka Tano while trying to throw Tarkin into a pool of lava. The group managed to reach the meeting point where a ship came and retrieved them.\n\n","meta":{"index":47,"author":"Karrykaren","name":"Citadel","release_year":2023}},"Centerpoint station":{"content":"# Introduction\nSituated at the heart of the Corellian system, this colossal construct holds an esteemed place in the annals of galactic history and stands as a testament to the advanced technology of its creators.# Section 1\nCenterpoint Station's origins remain in mystery, a relic from a distant era predating recorded history. According to the annals of the Corellian system, it is believed to have been built by an ancient and enigmatic civilization known as the Celestials. This advanced species was renowned for its exceptional technological prowess and significantly shaped the galaxy.\n\n# Section 2\nOne of the most awe-inspiring features of Centerpoint Station is its incomprehensible power. The station can manipulate gravity on a scale unimaginable to contemporary science. Centerpoint has the ability to influence celestial bodies, including entire star systems. It accomplishes this through an intricate network of repulsor lifts and tractor beams. It is capable of moving planets and triggering celestial phenomena such as supernovae.\n\n# Section 3\nThe gravitational manipulation capabilities of Centerpoint Station are harnessed through a series of colossal repulsor lift arrays and tractor-beam emitters, strategically positioned throughout the station. These advanced technologies function in concert, enabling precise control over celestial bodies within a vast radius.\n\n# Section 4\nThe awe-inspiring capabilities of Centerpoint Station have not only fascinated scholars but have also fueled strife and contention throughout galactic history. Numerous factions have sought to control the station, recognizing the immense strategic advantage it could provide. This has led to epic conflicts and skirmishes, some of which reshaped galactic politics.\n\n# Section 5\nAs the centuries have passed, Centerpoint Station has become a symbol of both wonder and caution.

The Death Star was operated by none other than Grand Moff Tarkin who was a smart Moff and a serious problem for all who opposed him on the battlefield.# Structure\nThe Death Star had many tactical advantages such as being an indestructible machine of destruction, and near-impenetrable to enemy fleets. This structure was able to be used as a massive defensive base for the many empire soldiers running the Death Star. It had many operating systems such as a sector for each commanding title, such as general, security, military, command, service, and technical. It also had a general store location which acted as a gathering for citizens to come in and sell or buy on the Death Star. The Death Star was 120 km in diameter and had a trench in the middle of the weapon that was 503 km and was the main operating part for the fleet, the trench would act as an operating system for the tractor beams, the fleet, and the many soldiers that would be ready for an attack should a curious, unauthorized, civilian decided to enter with a clearance. The Death Star had but one main weapon attached to the top of the station, a very large blaster that was powered by ion engines and was attached to 123 hyperdrive field generators to create an ultimate blaster that is capable of destroying entire planets.\n\n# History\nThe Death Star did not start with a simple creation of blueprints, the Empire was unfortunately not smart enough to plan such an idea, this was originally planned by a man called Raith Sienar who make the idea and blueprints for the Death Star, however, he would find the plans useless and have many flaws. Raith would send his plans to his closest friend Wilhuf Tarkin who would deliver the plans to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and would be considered impressed by the plans. The schematics would end up being taken into work by the geonosians who were amazing scientists, they would look to perfect the plans and make them into a working system as the plans were incomplete. During the time of the battle of Geonosis, the Clones that were made by Darth Sidious would be released by the Jedi to help them raid Geonosis and make sure their intentions are taken care of. The outline for the Death Star would be safe from the Jedi clutches and would be delivered personally by Darth Tyranus to his mentor Darth Sidious. This act of desperation would make sure that the now completed plans are kept from the Jedi and to make sure that once Darth Sidious’ plans were so, the Galaxy would finally witness the Death Star and fear at its marvelous showcase.

The Sinkholes usually contained four individual layers, composed of settlements by the local inhabitants. Surface layers would primarily contain hangers and supplies for incoming and outgoing cargo ships, as well as pilots. The lower layers primarily housed citizens of the planet and served as shelter from the harsh conditions of the planet’s surface. The lowest layer of the sinkholes were primarily used for mining. The Pau’ans and Utai harvested minerals from the waters, grottoes, and pools that were located in the lowest Mining Level.# Additional Sections\nThe Utapau Sinkholes were originally caused by Utapau’s complex tidal waves due to the number of moons. These caused abnormally large tidal waves in the ocean, which resulted in groundquakes that ultimately collapsed sections of the surface into subterranean sinkholes, which then became known as the Utapau Sinkholes.

Two small moons also orbited the planet and one of the moons was very close to the point that it was visible during the day.# Section 1\nMillennia before the Galactic Republic, the planet was home to the Rakata and their Infinite Empire. The planet of Lehon was made into the capital of the Infinite Empire. The Rakata were a scientifically advanced civilization, where they were documented to be Force-sensitive beings who would use their knowledge to subjugate other species that would be considered less developed. The Rakata would use the semi-sentient Star Forge to create and mass-produce battle droids and starships. The Rakata would build large cities on the planet's surface, which would later become crumbling ruins that the jungle would take over. The Rakatans would devolve into warring tribes as the Infinite Empire would collapse due to widespread slave rebellions. This would cause them to retreat to their homeworld of Lehon and retreat underground as the planet had become mostly uninhabitable.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring the reign of the Galatic Republic, various Rakatan tribes would emerge from underground back onto the surface. The Rakatans would use the advanced technologies they had created long ago to isolate and guard their forbidden lore in the Temple of the Ancients located on the planet's surface.\n\nThe planet itself was protected by a disruptor field that could disrupt and disable ship communications and navigational systems.\n\nLehon would be visited by Reven twice, once in the year 3956 BBY and another time in 3959 BBY during the Jedi Civil War.

Many years after its construction at around 5000 BBY, the temple would house the Rebel Alliance base and the Jedi Praxeum. In 26 ABY, the temple had been destroyed during the reign of the Yuuzhan Vong.# Temple Locations\nThe Massassi would build a total of four temples, this included the Great Temple, Temple of the Blueleaf Cluster, Palace of the Woolamander and Temple of Exar Kun. All four of the temples would all be built on Yavin IV with the Temple of Exar Kun being located northeast of the Great Temple on a volcanic island called the Isle of Kun.\nThe Palace of the Woolamander was located southeast of the Great Temple in the Val’Arnos Jungle. The third temple (Temple of the Blueleaf Cluster) was built in the Taurin Delta, which was downstream of the Unnh river from the Great Temple. The fourth and final temple, known as the Great Temple, was built at the Ersham Ridge and was one of the more well-known temples.\n\n# Architecture\nThe Temple of Exar Kun consisted of polished black-coloured obsidian that was studded with corusca gems and its walls would be filled with Sith hieroglyphics and pictographs. The temple would also have only one chamber upon entering with catacombs beneath it, which were intertwined by tunnels. Not much was known about the appearance of the Palace of the Woolamander; however, it is believed to have been a fairly large temple with a chamber where Exar Kun had sealed the Golden Globe. The Temple of the Blueleaf Cluster was named this way due to the fact that it had images of blueleaf shrub leaves carved on its outer surface. The temple wouldn’t be nearly as tall as the Great Temple.

Having been originally established as a burial site for fallen Sith Kings of ancient Korriban, the site was originally known as the ‘’Valley of the Sleeping Kings’’ prior to the creation of the Sith Empire. \n\nSitting prominently at the mouth of  the most notorious Sith Academy in history, the Valley of the Dark Lords would become a consistent place of interest for a wide variety of beings. Sith, Jedi, pilgrims and unfortunate wanderers, the draw of this Valley is unlike any other place in the galaxy.# History of a Graveyard\n100,000 BBY - 3959 BBY\n\nThe Valley of the Dark Lords would first be utilized to house the many fallen Sith Kings of the ancient Sith tribes. However, after the death of Ajunta Pall it would be deemed the most appropriate place to bury the former ruler of the Sith Empire. After many centuries more notable Lords would fall and would end up buried in the same valley. Eventually earning the valley its name. \n\nThe official purpose of the Valley of the Dark Lords was to act as a graveyard. However, due to the Sith Academy raised there by Exar Kun and the many desirable secrets and treasures buried within its many tombs, the Valley of the Dark Lords would become a sight of battle, pilgrimage, education and much more. \n\nPrior to its destruction, the Valley of the Dark Lords would become the eternal resting place of Ajunta Pall, XoXaan, Tulak Hord, Ludo Kressh and Marka Ragnos, among many others. After the death of Naga Sadow and the valley’s destruction at the hands of the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order, the valley would not be used as a grave site for thousands of years. \n\nDuring this period the Valley of the Dark Lords would become plagued with grave robbers, bandits, pilgrims and scavengers. Though due to the dangers of the valley, more people would become unwillingly buried there over the centuries. \n\n\n3959 BBY - 1000 BBY\n\nDarth Revan’s Sith Empire would later make use of Exar Kun’s old Sith Academy and use it to teach all of the Acolytes seeking to enter Revan’s Sith Order. Revan would also use the Sith Academy as a place of research and discovery, making a large part of the Sith curriculum be focused around develing into the various tombs and grave sites of dead Sith. \n\nMany of the tombs during Revan’s reign would be stripped of their most desirable artifacts as a result of the archaeological and discovery efforts undertaken at the Sith Academy. Quite often the final test of a Sith Acolyte would be to delve into these perilous tombs and recover some form of secret or ancient artifact. \n\nAfter the destruction of Revan’s Sith Empire the Sith Academy and Valley of the Dark Lords would once again be left dormant. A place ripe with wildlife activity, smugglers, pirates and other undesirables. The Galactic Republic would blockade Korriban until the emergence of a new Sith threat would come to retake the planet for its rightful owners. \n\nThe Sith Empire would return in 3681 BBY and immediately reconquer Korriban, putting to good use the Sith Academy there by rebuilding it almost entirely. Under the control of Darth Thanaton the archaeological efforts into the Valley of the Dark Lords would resume and the site would once again be used to train the followers of the Darkside. \n\nThroughout the Sith Empire’s existence, the Sith Academy and Valley of the Dark Lords would suffer from constant attacks from various Republic and Jedi strike forces. The Sith Academy in the Valley of the Dark Lords would become extremely efficient at producing Sith for the Empire’s War Machine and as a result it became a prime target for anybody seeking to undermine the Empire’s efforts. \n\nAfter the destruction of the Sith Empire, the Valley of the Dark Lords would again be left abandoned. A former shell of the activity that once flowed through its tombs, dig sites and training grounds. The Valley of the Dark\n\n1000 BBY - Today\n\nThe Brotherhood of Darkness during their war against the Jedi Order reopened the Sith Academy in an entirely new location as they believed the Valley of the Dark Lords to be scavenged and ravaged beyond repair.\n\nThe Valley of the Dark Lords would remain largely inactive. The Jedi Order would rarely visit the planet and would typically only do so in extreme circumstances. It wouldn’t be until 14 ABY that a group of Darkside Acolytes calling themselves the Disciples of Ragnos would undertake a restoration effort to restore the valley to its former glory. In many areas they would be successful and would even discover many tombs hidden after its destruction in 5000 BBY. However, once more the Jedi Order would prove to be the bane of Korriban. A strike force from Luke Skywalker’s Jedi Order would wipe out the Disciples of Ragnos and seal all of the newly discovered tombs. \n\nThe One Sith would return to Korriban roughly a century later to establish its covert headquarters but their use of the Valley of the Dark Lords and ancient Sith Academy is all but unknown. Though it is unlikely they would not at least have dedicated some effort towards exploring the site in their many years hiding on Korriban.\n\n# Layout of The Valley\nSith Lords are rarely humble, even less so when constructing monuments to themselves. The Valley of the Dark Lords is only accompanied by the ancient Sith Academy raised beside it. Beyond that the valley is surrounded by wild wastelands occupied by all manner of wildlife and Darkside creatures. \n\nThe most prominent architecture within the valley is that of the towering statues of six unknown figures who bow in submittance of the power of those buried nearby.

Chambers for rituals were also established to allow the many different Acolytes to prove their worth in the Sith Academy. The higher levels contained different rooms for the\n\n# Academic Curriculum:\nTo even be accepted into the Sith Academy and its teachings, one had to obtain a Sith Medallion as a mark of their impressive and promising skill. Those that sought to get their hands on one of these medallions were referred to as Hopefuls by the Sith and other inhabitants of Korriban. Jedi that happened to fall to the Dark Side had a far easier time being admitted into the Sith Academy given their previous experiences. To progress, an Acolyte had to achieve prestige by demonstrating skill through competitive tests, plenty of which pitted Acolytes against each other. Life did not come easy within the Sith Academy, as plenty of Acolytes met their demise at the hands of other Acolytes or even the instructors in the Academy. Academic Curriculum held no punishment for those that chose to destroy others in hopes to ascend, not even the Headmaster was safe as observed when Uthar Wynn was killed during his time as the Academy’s Headmaster. For one to be given a greater adventure and ascension in the Sith Academy, they had to become an Apprentice.\n\n# Foundation of the Sith Academy:\nKorriban’s Sith Academy was erected sometime in 3996 BBY by the Brotherhood of Sith led by Exar Kun during the dawn of the Great Sith War. The Jedi were well aware of the existence of this Sith Academy, but didn’t choose to invade Korriban and its contents until the conclusion of the war. Jorak Uln was instated into the Sith Academy as the Headmaster upon its finalized product. Following the destruction of the Brotherhood of the Sith as a result of the Great Sith War, the Sith Academy was abandoned and remained untouched until two Sith Lords later in the years decided to reopen the Sith Academy.\n\n# Darth Revan's Sith Academy\nWith the near-destruction of the original Sith Academy on Korriban, two Sith Lords known as Darth Malak and Darth Revan returned to Korriban during the Mandalorian Wars to re-establish the Sith Academy. Their ultimate goal was to train an army of warriors to fight in their Empire. Jorak Uln eventually was replaced as the Headmaster, being succeeded by Uthar Wynn, the next Headmaster that acted as oversight of the Sith Academy during Lord Revan’s rule. Upon Revan’s capture by the Jedi, his memory was erased. He returned to Korriban and killed Uthar Wynn with the assistance of his apprentice Yuthar Ban. In response to the death of the Headmaster, the Sith Academy descended into chaos and anarchy. The majority of the academic students present were killed by Revan as well after guards grew suspicious of Revan and decided to assault him with nearly all of the academy which resulted in their death. With the end of the Jedi Civil War and the beginning of the Sith Civil War, the Sith Academy remained abandoned, many inhabitants and other travelers of Korriban looting what remained of this training ground.\n\n# Darth Vitiate's Sith Academy\nThis academy was constructed with stone and durasteel that reflected the light of the sun at its core.

During this time, Qordis served as the Headmaster of the Sith Academy. Though, the re-establishment of a new Academy was the very reason for the destruction of the Brotherhood of Darkness. Powerful Sith Lords had been trained within this academy, most notably, Darth Bane who went on to create his own rule by erasing the Brotherhood of Darkness from the galaxy. The content in the Sith Archives also expanded more than ever in the Sith Academy established by the Brotherhood of Darkness. After this new group of Sith fell at the hands of Darth Bane, their academy went with them and thus it remained abandoned and forgotten.\n\n","meta":{"index":6,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Sith Academy on Korriban","release_year":2022}},"Temple of Exar Kun":{"content":"# Overview\nLocated on a volcanic island called Khun Island in the middle of a deep lake, the temple was only accessible on foot via stepping stones. These were only inches below the water, and travelers had to approach the temples with their heads down so their feet could be seen.\n\nThe temple itself was made of polished black obsidian set with Coruscant gemstones. It is etched with Sith hieroglyphics and glyphs, which translates as a magical spell that protects the temple and brings doom to its culprits. It had a small courtyard. Inside, the temple had only one room and the catacombs below. These consisted of several rooms connected by tunnels. The final chamber contains his Exar-Kun sarcophagus, presumably intended to contain his body after his death, but it is unknown when his spirit actually merged with the temple walls of Yavin 4. There was also an inner water tank in the temple.# History\nJust before fully embracing the dark side of the Force, the corrupt Jedi Exar Kun came to Yavin 4 and enslaved the native Massassi, who regarded him as a god. He had them build a temple in his honor. This was later called the Temple of Exacune. Kun used the Temple as a non-public retreat, where he continued his studies of the Force. In 3996 BBY, shortly before his death at the tip of the Nice Sith War, Kun used the vitality of the complete Massassi population to transfer his mind to the Temple, where he lived for the following 4,000 years.\n\nThe temple was rediscovered during the Battle of Yavin by Dr'uun Unnh, a rebellious naturalist. He soon realized it had been a Sith temple and was intrigued by the very fact that while all other temples on Yavin 4 were in ruins, this one showed no signs Reword I have no idea what it means. finished. Unnh died shortly afterwards when a speeder and motorcycle crashed into his downed TIE/LN fighter, while Temple's details were found in his datapad by a hunt team. In 1 ABY, Professor Walter Emanus led an archaeological expedition from the school of Corellia to Temple, where he discovered many valuable artifacts, including Valahorn. However, when their excavations uncovered the catacombs beneath the temple, they awakened the spirit of Exar Kun in him. Slaves to the spirits, they formed the cult of Exar Kun. The cult remained within the catacombs until it absolutely was driven out by a team of astronauts dispatched by Emanus' colleague at the university, Professor Cornelius Wagglehorn. Jan Dodonna and Luke Skywalker were also present at the Temple at some point during the excavation and assisted the astronauts with many tasks associated with evacuating the bottom. The astronauts were occasionally stopped at the temple by rebel soldiers who were possessed by Kun's spirit.\n\nSkywalker later established the Jedi Praxeum within the Great Temple on Yavin 4 in 11 ABY.[10] When he arrived, he could sense Kun's dark presence within the Temple. This was something I hadn't felt in Yavin 4, where the Jedi abilities weren't very developed. Exa's Kun spirit revived and lured his disciples into the Temple to show the dark side of the Force. Gantrice and Streen head to the temple, where he finds two Coruscant gems detaching from the wall and falling at Gantrice's feet. This was probably caused by Kun, and Gantris used them to construct his lightsaber. Kun managed to show Gantris, but when he resisted, he destroyed him. Later, Kip Duron and Dorsk 81 visited the temple. There, Kyp put his allies to sleep while he learned from the Sith Lord. Kun tried to kill Dorsk on a whim to demonstrate his power, but Kyp prevented this by asking the Dark Lord to inform him of everything he knew. Visiting the temple soon after, Kun promises to assist in finding his missing wife, Mirax, if she becomes an apprentice. The Dark Lord realized this while other Jedi disciples were working to defeat his spirit, and that they succeeded[11]. After Exar Kun was destroyed, Kip was returned to the sunshine Side of the Force. When Kip returned to Yavin 4, Luke took him to the Temple and faced a test like Luke's within the Dark Side Caverns of Dagobah. Kun then merged with Kip's dead brother Zess as a Force Ghost even as Luke saw himself in Vader's mask. Although there's no certainty, Zess's image was possibly formed by the Temple's Force powers, where he seemed to teach Kip a vital lesson. Shortly thereafter, Koran Horn obtained permission from Luke to destroy the Temple. He saw first-hand how the Sith books corrupted the Gensarai, and did not want the Temple books to lead others to the dark side. You attacked it with your X-wing by firing at the statue. Debris rained down, damaging the interior of the temple and falling into the lake. He then switched to a laser and aimed at the outside of the temple, firing back and forth until the temple collapsed, heating it up and destroying all the writing.\n\n","meta":{"index":11,"author":"Worlock365","name":"Temple of Exar Kun","release_year":2022}},"Starlight Beacon":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Starlight Beacon, simply known as “Starlight”, was a space station created during the High Republic Era, in the Outer Rim.

The Triumvirate’s purge of the Jedi from the Galaxy would come in full sway with their Sith Assassins eliminating the Jedi Order to the brink of total extermination left to only a handful of masters. As Traya sought to end the Force in perpetuity, her apprentices would abruptly betray her, removing her of her power and effectively exiling her.\n\n\tThe Jedi Exile, Meetra Surik would be discovered by Traya soon after, uncorrupted due to her severance from the Force. She later became Traya’s tool in the extermination of both of her former apprentices, as she would orchestrate a final conclusion between her and Surik. At the hands of Surik, she killed both Nihilus and Traya in subsequent lightsaber duels, ending the stain on the Force that is Malachor by reactivating the Mass Shadow Generator.\n\n","meta":{"index":10,"author":"C_aladria","name":"Trayus Academy","release_year":2022}},"Wheel":{"content":"# Overview\nThe wheel, which is also known as the space station BDT-978, was a really giant orbital structure that was stationed and located in the Besh Gorgon system of the galaxies that were placed in the mid-rim.

Afterwards, Fedlz proceeded to give the group ownership to TiberiusMalvern, the original TKG’s founder and, to this day, the group’s owner. Fedlz would be the Order’s Dark Lord of the Sith until the future ascension of Vermened. \n\nAugust 6, 2021 - The Sith Order is Founded\nFounded by the then named TiberiusHerminius (now called TiberiusMalvern) and led by Fedlz, the Sith Order’s group itself is opened. Meanwhile, the Jedi Order group had already been founded by Tiberius in April of 2020, with Ossus acting as their home. During this time, the Sith Order was still in its first stages and barely organized: its only function being the creation of a raiding team on Ossus. Fedlz’s second-in-command would be the user KentuckySquid, who held the rank of “Wrath of the Dark Lord”, which is the equivalent of Powerbase today.\n\nAugust 28, 2021 - The Sith Order’s Discord server is created\nMade by the then Wrath of the Dark Lord, KentuckySquid, all TSO operations were moved from just a 10-member discord groupchat to a proper server. \n\nAugust 29, 2021 - The Dark Council is formed and the first sphere is created\nThis sphere would be known as the “Sphere of Technology”, a sphere without any actual functions in-game, but instead made to house and coach any aspiring developers for the Order: it would be overseen by Darth Falskaar, Jensennix, who officially became the first Dark Council member. \n\nAugust 30, 2021 - The Dark Honor Guard and Laws & Justice are created\nThe Dark Honor Guard is first created, with SanctusTenebris as its Commandant. Additionally, the Sphere of Laws & Justice is made, with PerseusMalvern as its first Overseer. On the same day, the first ever Sith uniforms were released by KaiJustiss, which would be Darth Maul Cloak, Sith Raider, and the original DHG Uniform. \n\nSeptember 4, 2021 - The sphere of Technology is dissolved\nAfter a big enough roster of developers was found for TKG, it was deemed appropriate to dissolve the Sphere of Technology. Its Overseer, Darth Falskaar, transferred to Laws & Justice and changed his name to Darth Mortis. \n\nSeptember 5, 2021 - The sphere of Sith Doctrine is created\nThis rather short-lived sphere focused on the creation and enforcement of a Doctrine of the Sith would have JosephAlzeratus, known as Darth Etreum, as its first Overseer.  \n\nSeptember 8, 2021 - First Sphere Reformation\nThe Sith Order started using a five-sphere system, bringing the Dark Council’s seats to seven (five Overseers, the Dark Lord Fedlz, and the Wrath of the Dark Lord KentuckySquid): \nLaws & Justice - Jensennix \nSith Philosophy - JosephAlzeratus\nMilitary Command - Adolobe\nAncient Knowledge and Expansion & Diplomacy were left vacant for the time being. \n\nOctober 26, 2021 - Vermened becomes the new Dark Lord of the Sith\nOn that day, Vermened would ascend to the throne as our new Dark Lord. This marked a new era of organization and stability for our Order - as Vermened has been our Dark Lord ever since. The day after, he would begin to seek for worthy Overlords to fill each sphere of influence. Many view this as the day on which The Sith Order was reborn as a whole.\n\nOctober 27, 2021 - The original spheres are established\nAll the old spheres and their leaders were cleared, as well as the Wrath of the Dark Lord. The following four spheres would then be made, the new Overlords joining the ranks of the Dark Council:\n1 Expansion & Diplomacy - KannaexMalvern \n2 Ancient Knowledge - Notom\n3 Sith Philosophy - xLiamint\n4 Laws & Justice - ArgusOtto\nTogether with the presence of a separate Dark Honor Guard division, with LucifersWrath as Commandant. \n\nNovember 12, 2021 - The Sith Enclave is released\nAs the Sith finally get a place to call home, our Order becomes closer and closer to how we know it today. On that same day, TSO’s Notion was also released. \n\nNovember 30, 2021 - The Rite of the Kaggath is created\nOver the course of the following months, Kaggaths would become a vital tradition for the Sith, and a way of rising to power for many individuals: some notable examples will be CeasarTemenos obtaining a place in the Dark Lord’s Powerbase by defeating KennaexMalvern, and SlenderMalvern earning a Dark Council seat following the forfeit of xLiamint. \n\nDecember 16, 2021 - LucifersWrath retires from Commandant\nLucifersWrath leaves the order, ending up being the last Dark Honor Guard’s commandant. From there on, the highest rank achievable by a DHG member would become the equivalent of Darth, therefore removing DHG from the Dark Council. \n\nDecember 17, 2021 - The first Dark Lord’s Powerbase member is chosen\nThe rank of Powerbase is created, with KennaexMalvern going down in history as its first member, taking the role of “Hand of the Dark Lord”. One of his duties was to also oversee the Dark Honor Guard and give them a voice in the Dark Council. \n\nDecember 18, 2021 - The Sphere of Defense & Security is introduced\nThe D&S sphere is introduced, being one of the first spheres that was not taken from Star Wars canon. With reyrosky as its Overlord, this widely liked and creative sphere quickly became prominent within the Order. \n\nJanuary 14, 2021 - The Sphere of Mysteries is introduced\nThe Sphere of Mysteries is first introduced: this highly secretive and discreet small sphere would have Morsaki as its Overlord for almost the duration of the whole sphere. \n\nJanuary 16, 2022 - The second Dark Lord’s Powerbase member is chosen\nThe second Powerbase spot is occupied by Notom, who advances from being the Ancient Knowledge’s first Overlord to becoming the first “Will of the Dark Lord”. \n\nJanuary 17, 2022 - The Sphere of Ancient Knowledge is dissolved\nFollowing the ascension of Notom to the rank of Powerbase and the vacancy of the seat of Ancient Knowledge’s Overlord, it was deemed appropriate to dissolve the sphere and instead assign their duties to the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.\n\nFebruary 27, 2022 - CaesarTemenos successfully kaggaths KennaexMalvern\nAfter a stunning rank kaggath between the then Sith Lord CaesarTemenos and the Hand of the Dark Lord KennaexMalvern, Caesar would triumph and secure a place in the Dark Lord’s Powerbase as the new Hand of the Dark Lord. \n\nMarch 5, 2022 - The Order of the Loremaster is opened\nThe Sith Order’s first ever division is opened under the oversight of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy. They would take on the past Ancient Knowledge’s duties, allowing the Sphere of Sith Philosophy to focus more on the hosting of trainings. \n\nApril 10, 2022 - The Sphere of Mysteries is dissolved\nThe Sphere of Mysteries follows the fate of AK, being dissolved while its duties are reorganized. \n\n\nApril 17, 2022 - The sphere of Defense & Security is decommissioned\nOn what went down in History as a very, very dark day for the Sith Order, the sphere of Defense & Security was decommissioned as a whole. Some of its members transferred to the sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy, while others left the order as a whole. Regardless, the disband of D&S was still an unfortunate event for all those who were fond of the sphere, and the possibility of its return is still fiercely debated and discussed to this day. \n\nApril 18, 2022 - The Order of the Oracle is opened\nThe Sith Order’s second division opens under the oversight of the Sphere of Laws & Justice, known as The Order of the Oracle, taking on SoM’s duties. As a result, many former SoM members transferred over to L&J.\n\nApril 19, 2022 - The Order of the Immortal is opened\nThe Sith Order’s third division opens under the oversight of the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy, known as The Order of the Oracle. This elite fighting division housed the greatest of TSO’s duelists for a brief time.\n\nMay 8, 2022 - The removal of Orders, and the great return of SoM and AK\nWith a large rank reform, the Order of the Immortal, Order of the Loremaster, and Order of the Oracle are removed, Inner Circle seats reduced, Lord ranks in spheres removed, but most importantly, the Sphere of Mysteries and the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge make their return. As a result all spheres return to the original roster of the start of Vermened’s era, except with the addition of Mysteries. This five-sphere system was considered highly efficient, and remains the same to this day.\n\nMay 12, 2022 - Sith Academy is opened under SoP\nThe Sith Academy opens, allowing those not part of SoP to contribute to training hosting, to better face the great amount of new members the Order was getting on a daily basis. As of today, it’s currently the only division outside of DHG that hasn’t been disbanded and still stands strongly. \n\nJune 1, 2022 - Notom, the Will of the Dark Lord, retires from the Order\nHe would proceed to become a Sith Wraith, and retire from the Sith Order after a great age of contribution and leadership. On the same day, OmeqaVanquished, known as Darth Havok, would proceed to become the new Will of the Dark Lord, leaving vacant the seat of Overlord of L&J. \n\n\n\nJune 13, 2022 - CaesarTemenos, the Hand of the Dark lord, retires \nFollowing Notom, Caesar would also retire from his position as a member of the Dark Lord’s Powerbase. On the same day, KennaexMalvern proceeded to return to his original rank of Hand of the Dark Lord. No further changes to the Powerbase happened afterwards. \n\nEpilogue - What the future holds \nIt would be untrue to claim that our Order has reached its current point without many sacrifices, challenges and defeats: and yet here we are. Despite many hardships, our Order currently has 21k members and counting, a stable leadership and organization, and a new temple to call home with much more content on the way.\n\n","meta":{"index":1,"author":"Remalior","name":"Timeline of the Sith Order","release_year":2022}}},"meta":{"name":"Order History","index":13}},"Persons of Interest":{"articles":{"Darth Aruk":{"content":"# Overview:\nDarth Aruk was a member of the reconstituted Sith Empire, who served as a Dark Lord of the Sith and a member of Dark Council as the Overlord of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.

She married Andur Sunrider, a man native to her same planet and she had a daughter with him whose name was Vima. During one of Andur’s missions he was ambushed and killed leaving Nomi in great depression. Nomi became a padawan under Jedi Master Thon and participated in a mission to aid Ulic Qel-Droma in which they succeeded. Qel-Droma later developed a romantic relationship with Nomi but ultimately fell to the Dark Side. Nomi participated throughout the Great Sith War, fighting against Exar Kun and his once loved Qel-Droma. The war came to an end with Exar Kun’s death and Nomi win over Qel-Droma, who she left alive due to her personal feelings.  She later returned to the Order, where she continued climbing the ranks until eventually becoming the Grand Master nearing the time of the Conclave on Exis Station.# Biography\nA young Nomi Da-Boda marries Andur Sunrider and adopts his husband’s surname. At the start she was continuously surprised by her husband’s connection with the Force but he assured her she also had it. They lived together on the planet of Darada and then moved to H'ratth after being invited by Master Chamma. There she gave birth to her daughter Vami and after various years, Andur learned everything he could.\n\nThey left the planet and arrived at a hyperspace terminal but were attacked by Bogga the Hutt's gang. Andur, who had been protecting the Adegan crystals, was killed by a gorm-worm. Sunrider, now in grief and anger, is forced to defend herself and her daughter. Andur, now as a ghost, advises Sunrider to continue her journey to Ambria and find Master Thon, who will train her in the Force ways. Sunrider agrees to follow her husband's final wishes and uses the Force to find her way to Ambria.\n\nSunrider, determined to find Master Thon, arrives in Ambria and finds a strange and mysterious lake and hears voices warning her of death and chaos but hears one calm voice. She follows the calming voice and eventually finds a small house with a young Vultan. Sunrider believes this is Master Thon, and he leads her and her daughter back to his home. Sunrider talks about her husband's murder. Bogga the Hutt Had followed Sunrider and attacked the ship, but the Vultan Jedi defended his home and family. Despite being overwhelmed, the Vultan beast manages to defeat the criminals, and are obligated to retreat. After the battle, it is revealed that the young Vultan is actually a Jedi apprentice of Thon's, Oss Wilum. Wilum advises Sunrider that Thon will teach her the Force and that her journey as a Jedi is just beginning.\n\nSunrider, in grief over her husband's death, meditates on her future as a Jedi. Sunrider's instinct to learn battle meditation is strong but it is a difficult skill even for experienced Jedi Masters. Sunrider learns the ways of the Force but refuses to build or wield a lightsaber. Master Thon explains the true reason behind the lightsaber, stating that a lightsaber is not just a weapon for attack and defense but also a focus for the mind and a connection with the Force. Thon shows Sunrider an ancient holocron, lent to him by Master Arca Jeth, and teaches her the history of the Jedi's fight against the dark side. Sunrider still sees the lightsaber as a tool of death and distances herself from it. Nevertheless he gives Sunrider his personal lightsaber, which he had constructed while learning under his Master. Sunrider reluctantly accepts the gift and is tasked with retrieving the Adegan crystals from Bogga's gang. Master Thon and Sunrider rush back to Thon's home to join the pirates' attack. Sunrider refuses, but Thon convinces her to focus her Force powers on the pirates to save him and her daughter. Sunrider realizes that the lightsaber is the weapon of a Jedi and that she is a Jedi. She uses her Master's lightsaber to rescue Thon and the pirates flee back to their ship. Sunrider completes her training under Master Thon and is placed under Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas, who guides her in creating her own lightsaber.\n\nSunrider, under Master Baas, was studying on Onderon. The Jedi, led by Master Arca Jeth, faced a new dark side power called the Naddists, who attacked the procession responsible for taking the sarcophagi of Freedon Nadd and Amanoa to Dxun for burial. The Naddists stole both sarcophagi and retreated to their underground headquarters. Master Jeth was captured by King Ommin and subjected to torture. Sunrider, along with other Jedi, led a team to relieve Qel-Droma. They charged against the enemy soldiers, using Force battle techniques and a lightsaber. Sunrider was found among the rubble of the battle by Ulic Qel-Droma. They led the other Jedi against King Ommin's stronghold, but Ommin halted the attack by concentrating on his hatred. Qel-Droma charged Ommin, disarming and neutralizing him. Sunrider and Qel-Droma freed Master Jeth from his captivity. The remains of Freedon Nadd and Amanoa were transported to and entombed on the jungle moon of Dxun, hoping to dissuade anyone from stealing them again.\n\nThe Freedon Nadd Uprising provided a brief relaxing moment for Sunrider and other Jedi, who were taught how to ride native flying beasts of Onderon. Master Arca Jeth informed them of the escalating troubles in the Empress Teta system due to the rise of the Krath, a secret society founded by dark side adepts. The Jedi Order and the Republic were ordered to inform the combined leadership of the Jedi Order and the Republic about their encounters on Onderon and the situation in the Empress Teta system. A joint task force was formed to aid Koros Major, the last planet resisting the takeover. The joint fleet was attacked by massive space grazers, but Sunrider discovered that the space grazers were actually illusions created by one powerful Force-user, Aleema Keto. Sunrider managed to invade Keto's mind, causing her to lose concentration and fading the illusions. However, the Krath realized that the battle was one step away from being turned against them, ordering their ships to act as living missiles and ram the Republic/Jedi ships. The Krath tactic caused havoc among the joint fleet's ships, causing damage to the Republic command ship Reliance I and Qel-Droma's wounds. Sunrider tended to Qel-Droma's wounds, and the joint fleet was ordered to retreat from the Empress Teta system.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle of Koros Major, thousands of Jedi convened on Deneba to discuss the ongoing Krath attacks. Sunrider announced Qel-Droma's plan to infiltrate the Krath, aiming to bring them down from within. However, many Jedi, including Arca Jeth and Master Shayoto, opposed Qel-Droma's strategy. During the battle, young Vima was snatched by a war droid, but rescued by Sylvar. Qel-Droma, devastated by his master's death, decided to infiltrate the Krath. Sunrider and Qel-Droma's bond grew, and they shared a passionate embrace and kiss before Qel-Droma's departure.\n\nSunrider learns to improve her Force skills under the guidance of ancient Jedi Master Odan-Urr. She learns to combat the Force using an ancient technique used against the Sith in ancient wars. After her teachings, Sunrider travels to Coruscant to investigate reports of a rogue Jedi Knight leading attacks on Republic shipyards. The Jedi, led by Master Baas, prepare to let the Jedi Order handle the renegade Jedi Knight. However, it turns out that it was Ulic Qel-Droma who was leading the attacks. The Battle for Coruscant turned into a brutal battle between the Jedi and Mandalorian forces. Qel-Droma captured the Republic command center and was forced into captivity when immobilized with light side energy. Sunrider and other Jedi challenge Qel-Droma for control of Coruscant, but Qel-Droma defies the Jedi's orders and refuses to renounce his allegiance to the Sith. The trial ends when Exar Kun, Mandalore, and a legion of Massassi warriors arrive, casting a Sith immobilization spell over the attendees. Sunrider begs Qel-Droma to renounce his allegiance, but Qel-Droma warns her that if she doesn't stop interfering, she will be forced to hurt her. Qel-Droma and his allies leave Coruscant to continue their war of conquest. \n\nSunrider and her daughter Vima visited Master Thon on Ambria for healing and training. However, the peace was disrupted when agents of Exar Kun, Oss Wilum and Crado, arrived and called forth deadly hssiss to kill the three Jedi. Sunrider, Sylvar, and Thon defended each other, eventually killing all of the hssiss and capturing Oss Wilum. Sunrider and Sylvar eventually purge the Sith magic from Wilum's system. As the Sith War grew, hundreds of Jedi, including Sunrider, descended upon the library world to evacuate Jedi lore. However, Cay Qel-Droma sensed Qel-Droma approaching the planet in a personal starship. Sunrider, overcome with grief, unleashed her powers upon Qel-Droma, cutting him off from the Force. Qel-Droma repented and agreed to help Sunrider and the other Jedi end the war. After Qel-Droma returned to Exar Kun's secret temple on Yavin 4, Sunrider and the other Jedi created a wall of light side energy to combat the dark effects of Exar Kun's Sith magic. However, their efforts had unforeseen effects, as the light side wave turned the planet into a blazing inferno. The Jedi departed the jungle moon and set about rebuilding the Republic and the Jedi Order.\n\nAfter the Great Sith War, Sunrider and the Jedi began rebuilding the Order and Republic. Sunrider became the Grand Master and called the first Jedi conclave since the war. She hoped that the gathered wisdom would help rebuild the Republic and assure those gathered that the Order was being rebuilt under her guidance. However, the conclave went awry when Sylvar led the Jedi into a discussion on Ulic Qel-Droma's fate. Sunrider's daughter, Vima, had run away from Exis Station and left her mother to find a Jedi master. Sunrider, reflecting on her career as a Jedi, realized that it was not her choice to become a Jedi but rather her forced decision to pick up where her husband had left off. She realized that Vima had made her choices of her own free will. She realized that there was no better example for young Vima than Ulic Qel-Droma to show her the cost of being a Jedi. Sunrider and her daughter, Vima, find Qel-Droma and her daughter training in a frozen fortress. Qel-Droma, now her master, understands Sunrider's arrival and offers her the opportunity to take her back as an apprentice. Vima demonstrates her progress by carving an enormous sculpture in her memory of her late father, Andur. Sylvar, seeking Qel-Droma for his past crimes, arrives on Rhen Var and Nomi senses a clash between the two. Sunrider and her daughter witness the final stages of the fight, and Qel-Droma's chest is ripped apart. Sunrider holds Qel-Droma's body and there realizes that her daughter's love showed Qel-Droma the path to redemption. After Qel-Droma's death, Sunrider and her daughter return to the Republic with a new commitment to the Force, helping them accept their destinies.\n\n# Legacy\nNo information is known about Nomi’s end however the newer generations of Jedi were taught about her heroic acts. Her personality and knowledge were stored in the Noetikon of Light, one of three Noetikons which was stolen and then recovered by an unknown Jedi Consular. Luke Skywalker reestablished the Jedi Order after Emperor Palpatine's death and the destruction of the second Death Star. He seeked Force-sensitives to join him on Yavin 4 to study at his Jedi Praxeum. Tionne, a silver-haired woman, had found ancient data plaques from Exis Station, where Sunrider had held a Jedi conclave a 1000 years prior. She played the speech and sang ballads about the ancient Jedi. In 22 ABY, Tionne and Master Ikrit discover an antique ship on Vjun, named the Sunrider after Nomi Sunrider, symbolizing Ikrit's decision to give up his lightsaber.\n\n# Personality and traits\nNomi, experienced love throughout her whole life. Firstly, falling in love with a fellow Jedi, Andur Sunrider and with whom she’ll eventually get married. Their love brought to the world a beautiful daughter named Vima. After the loss of his husband and grief that lasted various years, she met another young Jedi, however as fate would have it, he fell to the Dark side and the two men who Nomi had loved had abandoned her. Her love wasn´t just for men as her daughter was Nomi’s most precious gift. Nomi had protected her daughter even during the Sith War but when Vima got into her teenage years she decided to seek training from the man who brought happiness to her mother when sadness was all she could see. Qel-Droma trained her even after Sunrider had gone to see if she was safe and indeed she was. They both bonded like father and daughter and eventually Vima left to go to her mother's side once again. During Qel-Droma’s path to redemption he was killed and they both felt it, leaving the two women of his life in grief and pain.\n\n# Powers and abilities\nNomi’s potential as a Force sensitive was clear from a very young age however the Jedi Order didn't pick her for unknown reasons and it wasn't until her husband insisted that she started her training as a Jedi. Her connection, under Master Thon’s tutelage, deepened to the point in which she could make her enemies kill themselves, by using the very rare and acquiring the extremely difficult achievement of mastering the art of battle meditation. She was also capable of disabling Sith spells and illusions, using Force deflection and using Tutaminis. Later, after changing of Master, under Master Urr tutelage,  she learned the rare ability of combating a Sith use of the Force by  essentially cutting them off from the Force targeting the users midi-chlorians and she did it with only a single session of training. But perhaps her most unique and powerful ability was that of conjuring pure raw light out of her own warmth for those she cared about. At the start her usage of the lightsaber was pretty poor but after her Husband’s death her skills with it just kept getting better. She improved so much that at a certain point she was considered to be a master at all forms. Nevertheless, she always expressed her preference using the Force over a lightsaber in a fight against a Sith.\n\n","meta":{"index":185,"author":"Craked10","name":"Nomi Sunrider","release_year":2023}},"Darth Charnus":{"content":"# Overview\nDarth Charnus was a human male Sith Lord who served the reconstituted Sith Empire as the right hand of the cunning Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Decimus. Charnus wasn’t as cunning as Decimus, but he made up for it with his cruelty. His skills were noticed by other Sith, for he could easily interrogate prisoners. His interrogation skills were so well-known that he was frequently assigned tasks to investigate secret communities that sought to kill the Emperor. The main organisation he investigated was the Order of Revan, built by the followers of the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Revan. Charnus and his apprentice, Emic Sandor, defeated this organisation during some time between the Cold War and Galactic War. As always they were successful and didn’t leave a single traitor alive. Unfortunately, Charnus killed a lot of innocent people, which he tried to avoid because he wanted to keep the damage he caused to a reasonable amount. At the start of the Galactic War, Charnus was sent to the Battle of Corellia so he could aid their resistance. He got there via his own dreadnought ship, which was combined with the Centurion-class battlecruiser Tears of Taris.

Momin’s principles at a young age were based on the belief that fear and pain were the only true and pure emotions in the galaxy. These principles were reflected in his sculptures; he believed that his creations were only a success when people were horrified or afraid when viewing his sculptures; otherwise, he had created nothing. These sculptures soon got him arrested and locked away.\n\nMomin was freed by Darth Shaa whilst locked away; Darth Shaa took him up as her apprentice and taught him about the dark side of the Force, along with giving him a pair of lightsabers which he used to sculpt his mask, as well as sculpturing and disfiguring his face before wearing the mask. He acquired the title of Darth during his training and learned a lot about his true self with the freedom he now had, he had however decided to kill his master as he found the title of apprentice and having to call her ‘Master’ to be offensive and thus disposed of her. After the death of his master, he continued gaining knowledge about the dark side of the Force and the Sith through his own research.# Superweapon\nDarth Momin would never take it upon himself to have an apprentice; Instead, he pursued knowledge on his own and wished to create works of art that would satisfy only the dark side of the Force itself. Through the knowledge gained from his research, the visiting of many sites, the addition of listening to the Force, he believed that his work of art would be a city. For this, Momin would create an engine with his followers and acolytes; they constructed a superweapon powerful enough to obliterate cities. He wanted to create a work of art by using the Force in unity with the engine to freeze time and capture the fear and pain to be the expression of all its inhabitants forever, thus becoming his work of art. The Jedi found out about his plan and boarded the ship, resulting in him losing control over the engine and vaporizing only his own body.\n\n# The Mask\nEven though Darth Momin's body was destroyed, his spirit remained contained within the mask. With all of his teachings and records covered up, the Jedi stored and held Momin's mask hidden inside a secret Jedi vault. During a fight with Vader, the Jedi master Jocasta had fled into the vault before being slain, resulting in Sidious learning about the mask's existence. He would, in turn, take the mask for his collection; the mask with Momin’s spirit would reveal his past to Sidious upon examination. Sidious gave the mask to Vader for dark side knowledge and guidance on Mustafar; Together with a team of imperial architects, Vader went to Mustafar for the fortress' creation. The chief architect's aide, Lieutenant Roggo, would become possessed by Darth Momin, finalizing the design and killing the chief architect, which would cause Vader to find out about Darth Momin\n\nVader would take Momin’s mask to a cave and reach into it with the Force, Mormin would show the past to the Sith Lord, but Darth Momin would attempt to possess Vader, which failed. Vader would allow Mormin to possess bodies furtherly to continue his work on the construction. The design of Momin for the fortress was based on dark side energy and focusing spires channeling the energy; Vader approved the construction of it with Momin’s promise that Vader would be able to resurrect his loved one again through the doors and the portal of dark side energy. During the construction, many of his attempts would fail due to too much dark side energy going through the focusing spires of the fortress, which would make the dark side uncontrollable and result in many natural disasters occurring. Eventually, the fortress was finished with small disasters and infestations remaining.\n\nWhilst Vader was distracted by an attack against the fortress, Momin would use the dark side door and channel the dark side energy of the fortress to resurrect his original body. Vader would win the battle and return to the chamber where Momin was waiting; a fight would ensue as the weakened Vader would initially seem to lose, Momin cutting off his dueling arm as he claimed victory and stating he was immortal by the dark side. Vader would mock Momin with his claim, then use his Force powers and overwhelm the other Sith Lord as his body was destroyed flat against the cave wall. Although the promise of the dark side door and portal were true and Momin did design these dark side creations, Vader would never be able to resurrect Amidala due to her not wanting to go with him.\n\nYet the mask still held the spirit of Darth Momin; Sidious would have it placed in his ship, guarded by two royal guards who were quick to be possessed by Momin. The rebels infiltrated the ship, the royal guards were killed by the rebels, yet two of the infiltrators became possessed by Momin; which caused the rest of the infiltration team to abandon the ship and instead blow it up in its entirety, thus also destroying the mask and spirit of Momin contained within.\n\n","meta":{"index":199,"author":"ThornedRedRose","name":"Darth Momin","release_year":2021}},"Gallius Rax":{"content":"# Overview\nGallius Rax, a guy who had previously gone by the name Galli and Operator, rose to the position of Counselor to the Empire in the latter stages of the Galactic Civil War.

Because Phobos was devious, deceptive and killed many of her Sith brethren in an effort to obtain power, the remaining Sith rallied against her to destroy her. The Sith dubbed Phobos \"The Hidden Fear\" when she survived an assassination attempt and amassed a passionate cult that idolized her. Phobos then used her follower to launch attacks against both Sith and Jedi. Phobos' survival stories spread like wildfire, and the Jedi Trials used her figure as a prop for its Trial of Insight.# Biography\nPhobos was alive sometime before 2040 BBY. She was a cunning person who honed her mental abilities, utilizing the Force to subjugate the weak and make them follow her orders. Phobos killed a lot of her competitors in her struggle for dominance. Assumed to be dead, she had actually lived in hiding. The Sith eventually started to believe Phobos had come back from the grave and started referring to her as \"The Hidden Fear.\" Seriously threatened by Phobos and her cult, both Jedi and Sith factions reluctantly banded together to defeat them. This saw the ultimate demise of the Darth by these warriors, although her cult persisted for a considerable amount of time afterward, whose extinction occurred around the start of the New Sith Wars in 2000 BBY.\n\n# Legacy\nThe Phobos simulation was the ''Trial of Insight,'' which took place inside the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant, the capital of the galaxy. It was designed to educate Padawans how to see through deception and to confront their innermost fears. Even after Operation: Knightfall in 19 BBY, which resulted in the temple’s destruction, the program continued to run. \n\nDuring the Imperial Era, the Darth Phobos’s doppelganger met Starkiller, Galen Marek, as he entered the deserted Temple Archives. She was disguised as Imperial Captain Juno Eclipse, whom Marek cherished,faking to be in distress. The bait was taken; the simulation launched at Marek with a double-bladed lightsaber. It claimed to have felt Starkiller's fear of the Captain's death and used it against him during their battle, making realistic versions of Eclipse. For the last time, it begged the Sith apprentice to spare her. The simulation was put to an end by Starkiller, who saw through the hoax and stabbed the figure in the back with his lightsaber.\n\n# Personality and traits\nTheelin in origin, Darth Phobos had musty-green skin, topped with blue hair, and a distinct set of yellow-colored irises. She was skilled at influencing other people and she killed anybody in her way without a doubt, finally turning her fellow Sith against her. She put up a fanatical cult and killed several Jedi and Sith alike in an effort to exact revenge for the assault on her life. Although the Sith first thought she was dead, after a series of killings, they started to assume Phobos was responsible and gave her the moniker \"The Hidden Fear.\" Even after Phobos's actual shortfall, there were long-lasting suspicions that she was still alive, and Jedi Padawans began to tell ghost stories about her. The simulation of Phobos that fought against Starkiller was designed as a replica of the Sith Lord’s personality, intent on inducing fear into the mind of the Sith apprentice.\n\n# Powers and abilities\nDarth Phobos has strong mental abilities that she could use to exert control over the minds of the helpless and compel them to carry out her orders. She benefited from others' fears and was bolstered by her own. From how Starkiller was tricked into believing he was seeing many versions of his fear throughout their combat, it could be assumed that Phobos had a similar ability, taking away one’s sense of direction. She was skilled in several types of telekinesis, including Force Repulse and Saber Throw, and used a potent Force lightning. The artificial image had a double-bladed lightsaber and was skilled with it. She could instantly teleport from one place to another and occasionally utilized Force speed and jump to boost her agility.

The Pantoran Assembly sought to establish a base on the planet of Orto Plutonia in case of any attacks by Independent Systems, and so they requested permission from the Galactic Senate and the Grand Army of the Republic. The Grand Army of the Republic already had a base on Orto Plutonia, however, recently their base had lost communications, which led to Chairman Chi Cho of the Pantoran Assembly and his military leaders along with Chuchi, Skywalker, Kenobi, and the 501st legion to investigate the strange disappearance of the clone outpost communications on the planet. The Jedi accompanied them to act as liaisons between Pantorans and the Jedi Order. Although Chuchi was present, Chairman Cho only brought Chuchi along with him so she could act as Cho’s representative within the senate, because Chuchi had more authority over the Jedi being a senator and Cho exploited this to his advantage in hopes that the peaceful Jedi would not interfere with his interaction with the Talz. Once Cho realized that the Talz already inhabited this planet, he immediately viewed them as “trespassers” and as an enemy, and due to his history within the military he wanted to fight off the Talz, but the Jedi and Chuchi were reluctant. Due to Cho’s arrogance and hatred towards the Talz, he began a small and short battle with them, which led to his demise. After Cho’s death, Chuchi requested to the Jedi that she’d contact the Speaker of the Assembly about Cho’s actions. The Assembly decided to revoke Cho’s status as Chairman and gave Senator Chuchi full authority on this matter. Senator Chuchi then approached the scared Talz tribe in hope that she could declare peace with them. Cho’s final words were directed to Chuchi to kill the Talz tribe, Chuchi refused to do this and instead sought a more diplomatic way to resolve the issue. She approached the Talz tribe’s Chieftain Thi-Sen, with the help of the famous C3-PO as her translator, and agreed to leave Orto Plutonia in the hands of the native Talz tribe and that she and the Pantorans would withdraw from the planet because she’d rather live and serve her people than die for war. The Chieftain was pleased that they’d be leaving and let Chuchi and the Republic forces leave Orto Plutonia. Chuchi returned to Coruscant and continued her duties as a Senator. Not long after this, Chuchi met Anakin’s Padawan, Ahsoka Tano and the two became allies.# Attacks and Blockades\nDuring the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine requested that the last Zillo Beast be studied and used for armor, however, the Zillo Beast escaped and attacked the Senate building, Chuchi survived the attack whilst some other senators died. Not long after all these events, Senator Chuchi was faced with another big crisis, Chairman Notluwiski Papanoida’s daughters were kidnapped and the Trade Federation made a blockade above Pantora. The small moon owed the Trade Federation numerous amounts of debts. Unfortunately, Pantora was experiencing Anti-Republic behavior and considered siding with the Separatists. After her encounter with Orto Plutonia, Chuchi became a stronger voice and stood up for what she believed was right. She protected her people and tried so hard to plead with the senate to side with Pantorans and oppose the wild accusations being thrown at them by the Trade Federation. The Chairman’s daughters were kidnapped by the Rodian Bounty Hunter, Greedo, and another Bounty Hunter hired by the Trade Federation. They were trying to push the Chairman into joining the Independent Systems and the Separatists. With the lack of progress being made, Chuchi decided to take the matter into her own hands and with the help of her friend, Ahsoka Tano, she went to search for the Chairman’s daughters and confront the Trade Federation. They decided to board the Trade Federation vessel and searched around for the daughters. Ahsoka played the role of a servant of Chuchi and the two met a few personnel and then began searching. They snuck into the Ambassador’s Officer and heard the sounds of chatter, they hid under the table and eavesdropped on the conversation. Their suspicions were confirmed when they overheard the two personnel discussing the kidnapped daughters. Then, they tricked the guard protecting the detention block and freed one of the Chairman’s daughters, but they were caught. Ahsoka destroyed the droids and the personnel were quick to realize she was a Jedi. With her newfound knowledge of the Federation, Chuchi used it to convince the Federation to remove the blockade over Pantora and stop Pantora’s commercial isolation.\n\n# The dawn of the Empire\nTowards the end of the war, the infamous Bounty Hunter, Cad Bane, and his crew invaded the Senate building and took several Senators as hostages. Many senators were voicing their opinions of the Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill and met with each other under the influence of Senator Philo, Chuchi was one of them. Bane and the Bounty Hunters imprisoned the Senators and found the daring Skywalker trying to ruin their plan. Earlier, Anakin met with Senator Padme Amidala to discuss a vacation and handed her his lightsaber to prove his love for her. Senator Organa intruded on their conversation, leaving Anakin to hide and Padme to meet with the senators. Without his lightsaber, Anakin was vulnerable and was knocked unconscious by the Bounty Hunters. He was then taken to the senators and was tended to by Chuchi and Padme. Bane then blackmailed the Chancellor in order to release Zirro the Hutt in exchange for the senators’ freedom. After this event, Chuchi was on the Jury of Ahsoka Tano’s trial and was in favor of urging the Republic’s attack on the Inner Galactic Banking Clans. After the Chancellor took control of the banks, the final act of the Grand Plan of the Sith was put in place and the Jedi were about to witness the Revenge of the Sith.\n\n# Clone Advocate\nFinally, Chancellor Palpatine informed the clones to Execute Order 66, and the thousands of Jedi in the Galaxies were killed by their once-trusted clones.

What no one knew was that the recent “storm” on Kamino was an attack led by Rampart to destroy the cloning facilities. Chuchi was on the verge of discovering this when a rogue clone approached her whilst she was taking suggestions from other clones about how they wished their lives to be. Chuchi encountered Senator Bail Organa who sought to help her and the clone to expose Admiral Rampart for his treachery. The vote was postponed and Senator Chuchi was targeted by a clone assassin because she now knew the real way the cloning facilities were destroyed. Chuchi requested that the clone speaks against Admiral Rampart as a witness but the clone was killed and Chuchi was on the run. The assassin almost had her when Captain Rex stepped in and saved Chuchi. Rex and Chuchi then hid whilst waiting for the skilled members of Clone Force 99 (The Bad Batch) to arrive. Once they arrived, Rex briefed them on the plan to steal the command logs from Rampart’s Venator and Omega accompanied Chuchi in convincing the ex-Kaminoan Senator Balle Burtoni to speak up against Rampart. The pair convinced Burtoni and went to the meeting. The Bad Batch encountered many difficulties but managed to get a hold of the command logs and raced to deliver them to Chuchi, who was trying to further delay the vote. With little time left, the Bad Batch gave the logs to Omega who ran to deliver them to Senator Organa. The senator gave the evidence to Chuchi who exposed Rampart for destroying Tipoca City. The senate went from loud murmuring to complete silence when the Emperor, after being absent from these meetings for a while, finally made it. Palpatine twisted the senate into believing that Rampart was to be arrested and that the clones that obeyed his orders were weak. He was several steps ahead of everyone again and used this information to enact his Imperial Stormtrooper program. Chuchi and the clones headed back to the Underworld of Coruscant and bid their farewells. Chuchi promised them all that she wouldn’t stop advocating for the clones and that she would be a voice for the voiceless, which was the act of a brave and true senator, until they got the same rights as normal citizens, something they’d deserved for a long time.

Darth Sion in his later years would become a part of the most feared group of Sith known as the Sith Triumvirate, which consisted of Darth Nihilus, Darth Traya, and Sion himself. Sion had been susceptible to pain and infirmity for a long time as any other person, but he chose to use his pain as his uniqueness among other Sith Lords, becoming the Lord of Pain. Sion would begin as a Sith Marauder in Exar Kun’s Sith Empire in 3996 BBY. Sion sought out death, seeking to fight every Jedi he’d seen, but surviving each encounter. His mindset changed until he believed he was immortal, building a greater and greater tolerance for pain. Sion eventually received a blow that struck him down, but instead of receiving the face of death, the pain inside of him welled up to agonizing levels, driving Sion to strike down his aggressor with all of his hatred and anger. With his body decomposing, he held it together using the dark side of the Force. This process caused excruciating pain which fueled his anger even more. Exar Kun ended up losing the war, however, Sion would survive the fall of his Empire.# Section II\nUnder a new Empire created by Darth Revan, Sion emerged a new Sith Lord, along with Darth Malak, Revan’s apprentice. However, the next few years would be dangerous, Sion saw Revan as a traitor for succumbing to the Jedi Council and turning back to the Light. Malak was killed by his old master, and with his death, came the fall of the Empire. The Lord of Pain would watch as the Sith turned against each other one by one while he was in the Academy on Korriban. Many Sith Lords declared themselves Warlords as the Empire fell apart, claiming their own domains and slaughtering old comrades. Others would flee to the unknown regions of the galaxy.\n\n# Section III\nMany other Sith Lords that remained in the galaxy would eventually come together, including Revan’s former Jedi Master, Kreia, otherwise known as Darth Traya now. In an attempt to find new Sith Lords to assist her in her goals, she had come across Sion and another Sith Lord: Darth Nihilus, the Lord of Hunger. Sion, Traya, and Nihilus would form a Sith Triumvirate secretly, which began on Malachor V, they sought the annihilation of the Jedi Order and wanted to bring back the Sith Order into the power it once held in the galaxy. Sion learned much from Traya, in which she was clearly the more powerful of the two. However, there began a new conflict among the three Sith Lords, they grew discontent with Traya, they began getting stronger than her. Eventually, Sion and Nihilus would conspire against Traya, seeking to get rid of her from their future endeavors. Sion and Nihilus closed in on Traya as she was meditating in the core of the Academy, Sion beat her mercilessly and the two Sith Lords sapped her energy before Nihilus eventually severed her connection to the Force, leaving her an outcast. Sion began his killing spree of Jedi, he would be killed many times in the process, returning from death and slaughtering more. The Jedi would remain almost completely extinct after the two Sith Lords claimed their stake on the galaxy. Eventually, around 3954 BBY, Sion and Nihilus would unify the remnants of the old Empire, creating and becoming the most unified force of Sith in their lives. In 3952 BBY, Nihilus would attack a Conclave of Jedi on Katarr, slaughtering the remainder of the surviving Jedi. In order to escape Nihilus and Sion, the Jedi Order disbanded and went into hiding to escape Sion’s Assassins. In order to find Sion, a Jedi Master by the name of Lonna Vash came to the Academy on Korriban, but fell into a trap and was imprisoned by Sion in the abandoned Sith Academy.\n\n# Section IV\nSion returned to Malachor V, soon joined by Kreia, who now reclaimed her previous title of Darth Traya. Traya betrayed Meetra Surik, and also led Darth Nihilus to his death. After eliminating the remainder of Sion’s assassins, Traya joined Sion in the Trayus Core. Sion made threats with Traya, exclaiming he’d kill her, but Traya ordered Sion to treat Surik with every amount of respect that she deserved once she arrived at the academy. After fighting and killing most of the Sith forces throughout the abandoned academy, Surik managed to come face to face with Sion at last. Sion warned Surik to leave, knowing that if she attempted to attack, Traya would strike her and break her just like she had done to Sion. At last, Surik and Sion fought, but with the power of Malachor inside of Sion, he kept rising again after being struck down. He fell once again after another fight, but Surik tried to convince Sion that Kreia was using him, that Kreia did not respect him, and was using him as a tool for her own benefit. Sion kept fighting, knowing if he won, Traya would have to complete Sion’s training as her true apprentice, but Sion knew that Surik was a powerful enemy. Traya was an interesting Sith who admired and respected those who could let go of the Force, but not Sion, who relied on his connection to bring him back from death. As he accepted death, he warned Surik that Traya would break her, and that Surik was Traya’s weakness. Sion then allowed himself to let go of the Force at last, leaving the living world behind and becoming one with the Force.\n\n","meta":{"index":156,"author":"PhaseSpectr","name":"Darth Sion","release_year":2021}},"Silri":{"content":"# Overview\nSilri was a prominent member of the Nightsisters clan, a powerful Dark Side witch of Dathomir and the one who originally found the Carbonite Sith Army.

After a long retreat from Republic territory alongside the rest of his fragmented Sith Empire, he would grow to become an asset to his people and an instrument in establishing the first Imperial Military.# Part I\nOdile Vaiken was part of The Exile fleet who were attempting to flee their old worlds after the fall of the Sith Empire. The Galactic Republic and Jedi Order believed the Sith to be too much of a menace to remain as a functional society. As a result, the Jedi Order took charge of a Republic Military campaign to eradicate the remnants of the Sith Empire after The Great Hyperspace War. As a result, most Sith loyalists and Sith themselves would be forced to run from their homes in an attempt to escape the oncoming genocide. Odile Vaiken, like many others, would be forced to flee from Korriban itself. This would engrave a deep sense of patriotism in Vaiken. \n\nThe Exile fleet would have to undergo a 20 year drift through space before discovering Dromund Kaas, an ancient and forgotten Sith colony. During this 20 year period, Odile Vaiken would distinguish himself as one of The Exile fleet’s most capable pilots and would learn much about naval techniques. When the surviving Sith arrived at Dromund Kaas, the newly dubbed Sith Emperor, Darth Vitiate, would establish a Dark Council to rule in his place. However, recognizing the capabilities of his non-force sensitive loyalists, the Emperor would name them Imperials in his newly formed Sith Empire and charge many of his Imperial loyalists with high ranking positions amongst the newly established Imperial Military. \n\nOne such recognised officer would be Odile Vaiken, while not yet a Grand Moff, the Emperor would charge Vaiken with bringing order to the new Imperial society. As a result, Imperial society became extremely regimented and national service became part of normal life. Under the supervision of Odile Vaiken the Imperial Army would become an extremely competent fighting force and would prove so during its successful campaigns on Dromund Kaas against the planetary wildlife and on campaigns against the surrounding planets of Dromund Kaas. \n\nIn his later life, Odile Vaiken would undertake the insurmountable task of establishing the Imperial Navy. For his efforts he would be the first Imperial to be granted the honorary position of Grand Moff.

He was entirely loyal to his Sith Overlords and dedicated the majority of his life to laying the foundations of what would become the Reconstituted Sith Empire. \n\nDespite knowing he would never see or truly know if his ideas and efforts would ever achieve anything in the future, Odile Vaiken would still be a stalwart defender of Imperial society and be one of the few Imperials respected and recognised as truly beneficial by the Emperor and Dark Council. \n\nNot only was Odile Vaiken a capable combatant on the ground, but he was a lethal starfighter pilot. Regardless of his combat prowess, it would be his engineering skills and strategy efficiency that he would be remembered for, his ideas having lasted over a millenia and being an instrumental part of the Imperial Military doctrine.\n\n# Part III\nGrand Moff Vaiken would forever be remembered as the father of the Imperial Military. It was his ideas and their implementation that shaped the prowess of the Imperial Military and also established the very nature in which Imperial society functions. \n\nOdile Vaiken’s legacy would live on for centuries within the deep roots of Imperial society.

After Kallig defeated Thanaton and made him submit, Mortis rose from his seat and apologized to his fellow Councilor before breaking his neck with the Force. Acknowledging Kallig as the victor, the four Dark Councilors present rewarded the young Sith Lord with Thanaton's now-vacant seat on the Council, which they ignored the newly-appointed Darth Nox's query when the Emperor would be meeting with the Council.

He was born roughly 200 years after the Second Great Schism that saw the Dark Jedi exiled. Sadow himself was an heir to the legacy left behind by the original Dark Jedi, as he was a Half-Human Half-Sith hybrid, and bore one of the pureset Jedi lineages amongst the Sith Empire. He preached a philosophy of expansionism, which put him at odds with other Sith due to the Empire’s policy of isolation. At the death of Dark Lord of the Sith, Marka Ragnos, Sadow immediately began preparations to take the position for himself. Sadow had grown angry at his fellow Sith due to them doing nothing other than enjoying their vast riches. He believed this would lead to Stagnation. Sadow’s chance to change things was the death of Marka Ragnos.# [The Middle]\nDuring Marka Ragnos’s funeral, a grand procession was undertaken through the Valley of the Dark Lords, lead by Sadow’s biggest rival, Ludo Kressh, who also sought the position for himself. Sadow arrived late to the tomb, and ascended the steps to Ragnos’ new tomb. Ludo Kressh ordered him to step back, stating that he was shaming the memory of the Dark Lord. Sadow refused, stepping up to declare himself Dark Lord of the Sith. Kressh immediately opposed his claim, and the 2 Lords in accordance to tradition, decided to battle. The Lord's duel in front of the tomb quickly became a fight to the death, as it showed neither would back down. However, neither side took victory as the spirit of Marka Ragnos appeared, warning the two to stop at once. He declared that the Golden Age of the Sith would soon end, and unnecessary fighting would only harm the Empire. The very next moment, two Republic explorers would discover Korriban. They were immediately imprisoned upon arrival.\n\n# [The End]\nSadow staged the escape of the two explorers, using the opportunity to make it seem like a Republic operation. He used the widespread suspicion, paranoia, and fear to prepare the Empire for a war. During his preparations, he eliminated Kressh’s forces, leaving no challengers to his authority. Sadow then gathered the other Sith Lords, forming a massive military and navy in order to destroy the Republic. When the time was right, Sadow’s forces launched a surprise attack on the Republic, striking many planets, including Coruscant, the capital of the Republic. Sadow commanded his forces from an isolated meditation sphere. The invasion was initially highly successful with him almost claiming victory until one of his apprentices turned on him, attacking his meditation sphere leaving his forces without commands. While Sadow managed to kill his rebellious apprentice, his forces were in dessary, forcing him to return to Korriban. When he arrived, he found his rival, Ludo Kressh, thought to be dead, with an army waiting for him. After winning the conflict with Kressh, he found himself without an army, when a Republic invasion was imminent. Seeing the fact that he had no chance of winning, he fled into permanent exile on Yavin 4.\n\n","meta":{"index":43,"author":"Ruvjaal","name":"Naga Sadow","release_year":2022}},"Mandalore the First":{"content":"# Description\nMand’alor the First was the first founder of the Mandalorians, originally being a group mostly made out of Taungs coming from Coruscant, a now extinct species.

He was one of twelve servants within the Imperial Dark Council and soon was one of five. Vowrawn, after the death of the current Empress Acina at the time, claimed the title of Emperor in the Sith Empire faction. Vowrawn was a loyal Sith and served the Dark Council for decades before finally claiming the title of Emperor. Vowrawn wasn’t an extremely powerful Sith like some Emperors before him but he did know a lot of Sith magic and rituals and he was the head of the Sphere of Production and Logistics which made him extremely talented in numbers which lead him to believe that the Sith Empire was out numbered compared to the Jedi Order. The Emperor had a very loyal apprentice, Sith Lord Qet, who to show his respect and gratitude gathered an army of slaves and forced them to build a statue of Vowrawn in the Dromund Kaas jungle. Vowrawn despised the Sith Lord Darth Baras. Baras was going around claiming he was the voice of the Emperor and was aided by the force spirit known as the Entity. Vowrawn then considered the only way to succeed in destroying Baras was to release the Entity and so he performed dark Sith magic and released the Entity. After being severely wounded, Baras was sent to Korriban so that the Emperor’s Wrath could duel and since he was so desperate to overthrow the Emperor and survive he called upon the Dark Council to assist him. Lucky for Vowrawn, the Dark Council ignored him and acknowledged the Emperor’s Wrath to duel Baras. The Emperor’s Wrath killed Baras for his lies; he told everyone about him being the Voice of the Emperor so he could become Emperor himself. The Emperor also witnessed an odd thing not long after. Darth Thanaton was going to execute his rival Lord Kallig, Darth Nox, but he was reluctant and failed. Darth Mortis snapped his head and Darth Nox took his place in the Dark Council and became the new head of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge.# Abilities and Traits\nDarth Vowrawn was a charming and intelligent elderly individual. He was the head of the Sphere of Production and Logistics which showed his intelligence. He was a powerful force wielder holding the capability to do rituals, magic and freeing the Entity from imprisonment. He was also very loyal especially when the Eternal Empire invaded the Republic and Sith Empire then when all the Dark Council members died Vowrawn pledged his allegiance to the Eternal Emperor, Arcann. For a little bit he served as the head of the Sphere of Civil Administration, which was the overlooking of supplies and weaponry for the Empire and enforcing its laws. Not long after this he became Emperor after Empress Acina died he assumed that he could be her successor so he took the throne and claimed the title of Emperor. Then he sent Darth Malgus, a slave at that time, to invade Ossus and the beginning of the third galactic war against the Jedi and the Republic. As Emperor he abolished the anti-alien rule of the Sith Emperor and supported Darth Karrid’s ascension to becoming a member of the Dark Council. During the Cold War Vowrawn’s skilled combat abilities started withering because of his old age and so he relied on his charm and deceptions to win the war. He disguised himself as an important Republic asset and planned the death of Darth Baras not only that but he was also able to claim the title of Emperor and be the longest lasting member in the Dark Council at his time.

Millennial was thoroughly against numerous Sith philosophies, however, he still believed in one; Lord Kaan's Rule by the Strong, a Sith philosophy declaring the strongest Sith out of all in the room be handed out the position of leadership. His master believed in the Rule of Two, a philosophy based on two Sith Lords ruling, one master and one apprentice, and training said apprentice until they can defeat their master, only to repeat the process and create stronger generations.# Section II\nAfter a series of arguments with his master, who differed in the way of thinking that Millennial did, he had no choice but to escape and take refuge in the planet Dromund Kaas, as he stood no chance at overpowering the Sith Lord.\n\n\t When arrived on the planet, Millennial stumbled upon an ancient temple in the swamps. The temple was protected by numerous Sith statues and noted to be ruined following the events of the Sith Empire’s loss in the Great Hyperspace War. Later, Millennial invented his religion titled Dark Force, where he developed countless prophecies folks saw potential in, alongside setting the base-of-operations in the temple after it was examined to be inhabitable. To keep a firm status for his religion, those that didn’t believe in Dark Force were killed for heresy.\n\nAfter his death, his religion continued activities for a few more hundred years. Darth Sidious recruited members of the religion to gain their trust and use in the Galactic Empire as counselors. They were then attacked by Sidious' Inquisitors and had no choice but to abandon their temple and escape to the planet Bosthirda. Once on Bosthirda, the religion was erased by a triumvirate of foes that had affiliations related to the Galactic Empire, who also practiced the dark side; Lumiya, Jax, and Azrakel. Azrakel, a former member of the Dark Force was the first one of the triumvirate to appear and fight, dying but managing to defeat most of their forces.

The young woman's advancement in a variety of Imperial-sponsored programmes, including her enrollment in the Intelligence Academy of Carida, was hastened as a result of the Sith Lord Darth Vader, Palpatine's chief enforcer, becoming aware of this.# History\nAfter graduating with the greatest honours and being promoted to the rank of major by Darth Vader, Brie was assigned a top-secret mission to infiltrate the Rebel Alliance and either assassinate or cause the exclusion of Rebel hero and Jedi Luke Skywalker among his peers. However, the same events that brought disgrace upon Skywalker also left Brie gravely crippled and perilously close to death. When Darth Vader discovered her, he gave her cybernetic substitutes that closely resembled his own. Brie then began getting training from Vader in the evil side of the Force while posing as Lumiya, Dark Lady of the Sith.\n\n\nThe Emperor's Hands were trained assassins who reported directly to Palpatine, and Lumiya was one of them while she studied covertly as Lord Vader's Shadow Hand.She set out on a journey to the planet Ziost, where she made her own lightwhip. However, during that journey, both Palpatine and Darth Vader were killed in combat at Endor, and as the most prominent of their students despite her incomplete training, she assumed the title of Mistress of the Sith.\nShe apprenticed Flint, a former stormtrooper, and supported the extragalactic Nagai species' conflict with their mortal Tof adversaries out of a desire for vengeance against Luke Skywalker and the Alliance for the deaths of her Sith Masters.\n \nEarly in her campaign, The Sith Lady experienced a crucial setback that necessitated the replacement of her armour. It also saw the debut of a triangle headgear, which, together with her lightwhip, later became her identifying feature. While still assisting the Nagai, she faced up against her sworn adversary, Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, and ultimately fell short. But as the Nagai-Tof War got underway, the Dark Lady broke out of Skywalker's custody and vowed to wreak havoc on him when they next crossed paths. She, therefore, dissolved her alliance with the Nagai in favour of the Tof resistance, but their quick demise at the hands of the combined Alliance, Empire, and Nagai forces signalled the end of the conflict. The majority of the galaxy believed Lumiya to be dead, so she withdrew to the Outer Rim with vengeance always on her mind.\n\nThe Dark Lady built a fleet while she was concealed in order to launch an attack against the New Republic, the authority that replaced the Rebel Alliance.\nAfter the strange passing of her first pupil, she once more collaborated closely with Imperial Intelligence and took on Carnor Jax, a former member of the Imperial Royal Guard. The final remnants of the Prophets of the Dark Side cult were destroyed by Lumiya and Jax working together. In response to a potential threat to the Sith Order, she then tasked him with infiltrating the Imperial Ruling Council while she personally negotiated with Imperial Regent Ysanne Isard for more resources.     \n\nJax attempted to betray Lumiya, but his fledgling ambitions drove him astray. Kir Kanos, a fellow former Royal Guardsman, assassinated Jax, leaving the Dark Lady without an apprentice once more. With the ancient Sith oracle stone artefact in her control, she went back to the planet Korriban to make plans while continuing to keep an eye on events happening across the galaxy. But by 25 ABY, Lumiya had left the outer rim in favour of Vectivus's former asteroid home, where she had mastered the making of his dark side-enhanced Force phantoms. On Korriban, she considered accepting an offer from a new Sith order that wanted to adopt the Dark Lady, but on the way there, she was stopped by extraterrestrial Yuuzhan Vong advance scouts who were preparing for a galactic invasion. She avoided captivity and made her own covert attempts to thwart the Yuuzhan Vong offensive.\n\nLumiya came to believe that order and stability could only be imposed by the supreme will of a Dark Lord of the Sith as the galaxy plunged more into anarchy.\nWhen she encountered the Fosh ex-Jedi turned Sith Vergere while fostering such views, Lumiya's training was completed thanks to the latter's greater understanding. By creating and elevating the next Sith Lord, they planned to bring the galaxy back to harmony. As Lumiya and Vergere worked to bring Jacen Solo, the grandson of Darth Vader, full circle in the Sith tradition of the Skywalker family, she turned down a second offer of partnership from those on Korriban.\n\nShe and Vergere helped the Yuuzhan Vong, with whom Vergere had made friends, capture Solo, and the Fosh started the training that Lumiya would finally complete. Vergere passed away three years into the Yuuzhan Vong War, and her part in the situation concluded, but it took Lumiya another twelve years to be ready to fulfill her end of the contract. She carried out her plan to seduce Solo in 40 ABY by escalating the already tense relationship between the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances and the Five Worlds government of the Corellian system. This was done against the backdrop of a new conflict that she had secretly instigated. A planned series of events brought Solo to Lumiya's house, where he decided to follow the Sith path.

Jedi Master Atris would lead a rather hypocritical life and be one of the most staunch defenders of the Jedi Order, even during the course of many of the Order’s wrong doings.# Disapproval\nThe earliest recorded knowledge of Jedi Master Atris’ involvement in galactic affairs came during the early days of the Republic’s participation in the Mandalorian Wars. Atris was one of a majority on the Jedi High Council that would protest against Jedi involvement in the Mandalorian Wars. Atris was known for her stubborn ideology and would be unwavering in her disapproval of Revan and the Revanchists. \n\nAfter the Mandalorian Wars had ended, one Jedi, known as Meetra Surik, would appear before the Jedi High Council to be judged for her participation in the conflict. Having been stripped of her force to survive the detonation of the Mass Shadow Generator, Meetra Surik would be deemed unfit to remain as a member of the Jedi Order and was made clear that Jedi Master Atris took Meetra Surik’s participation in the conflict rather personally, providing the former Jedi with no leniency in her judgement, even believing that exiling Meetra Surik from the Jedi Order was not a harsh enough punishment.\n\nAtris saw Meetra Surik as somewhat of an idol and viewed her fellow Jedi as an exceptional Jedi prior to the Mandalorian Wars. When Meetra Surik abandoned the Jedi Order to follow Revan into the conflict it weighed heavily on Atris, more so than most other Jedi at the time. Atris would go on to blame Revan personally for Meetra Surik having been forced to strip herself of the force and would condemn one of Revan’s former Master’s, Jedi Historian Kreia for Revan’s actions.\n\n# Downfall of The Jedi Order\nAfter Malak had been defeated by Revan the Jedi Order was struggling to rebuild from its losses. Through warfare and defection to the Darkside, many Jedi had died or abandoned the Jedi Order all together. The Jedi Order had little breathing room to recover, as by this time the Wound in the Force, whom the Jedi would later come to know as Darth Revan, alongside his counterpart, Darth Sion, were hunting surviving Jedi and either turning them or killing them. \n\nThe Jedi Council were unaware of what was hunting them and did not know of the existence of the Sith Triumvirate. Atris, alongside the surviving Jedi High Council would convene a meeting of a majority of surviving Jedi on the world of Katarr. Atris, believing the Jedi could defeat the threat should they meet it head on, took it upon herself to leak the location and time of the Jedi gathering. As a result, while Atris was offworld, Darth Nihilus would descend upon the planet and kill every Jedi at the gathering, as well as every surviving being on the planet, with the exception of one Mirilukan. \nThe death of the Jedi Order and subsequent destruction of the world of Katarr could be attributed to Atris, whom upon receiving word of the Jedi Order’s destruction, would flee into hiding to start her own ‘’Jedi Academy.’’\n\n# Reunion\nDuring the Dark Wars, Atris would build the foundations of what she claimed would be a Jedi Academy. And from a certain perspective it could be perceived as such. Atris, on the world of Telos IV, would mentor 6 Echani women in various forms of Echani martial arts, educational studies and on specific matters concerning the Jedi Order. \n\nDespite the young women who would become known as Handmaidens to Atris being force-sensitive, Atris would make them swear an oath never to undergo Jedi teachings or learn the ways of the force. The Handmaidens served the purpose of monitoring and supporting the Jedi Order, aiding them in eradicating corruption and even being trained to kill Jedi should they fall to the Darkside. \n\nIt was in this Academy that Meetra Surik and Atris would re-unite. Fleeing Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion, Meetra Surik would be forced to track the Ebon Hawk, stolen by one of Atris’ Handmaidens, to Atris’ Academy. While there Atris would inform Meetra Surik of what had happened to the Jedi Order and begrudgingly assist Surik in finding the remaining Jedi Masters who were in hiding after the devastation of Katarr. \n\nAtris was an emotional woman, despite being a Jedi Master, and still harboured a lot of anger towards Meetra Surik for abandoning the Jedi Order to go to war. Atris would make this very clear during their meeting on Telos IV. Despite her anger being directed towards Meetra Surik she did secretly still admire the Jedi Exile for her courage and for standing by her decision to follow Revan.\n\n# Corruption\nAtris sought to oneday rebuild the Jedi Order in her own image of perfection and intended to use the Handmaidens to assist her with this. However, Atris ironically would fall to the Darkside, believing herself to be too strong to succumb to the allure of Sith teachings. She would fall in almost the same way Revan and Malak would years prior. During her time as a Jedi Historian, Atris would amass a large collection of teachings and holocrons, including those of the Sith. Atris would often study these holocrons on Telos IV to understand the once forbidden knowledge held within them. \n\nAfter the surviving Jedi Masters had been killed by the now returned Darth Traya, Traya would return to Telos IV in search of Atris. Darth Traya would explain Atris’ emotions to her, understanding how she felt and essentially expose Atris to what she already felt but was too stubborn to express. Atris assumed the position of a Dark Jedi, having been educated on Sith teachings by her holocrons she had now become the very thing she fundamentally at her core, believed she never would.\n\n# Redemption\nAfter Atris’ fall, Darth Traya would return to Malachor V and soon after Meetra Surik would follow in her footsteps, finding herself back on Telos IV. Meetra Surik would find the fallen Jedi Master and duel her in the centre of Atris’ Academy. Upon defeating Atris, Meetra Surik was left with the decision to either kill or spare her. To the surprise of Atris, Surik would spare the life of Atris and in doing so, Atris understood everything she did wrong and forgave Surik for abandoning the Jedi Order. \n\nAtris would then be left to the judgement of the rebuilding Jedi Order in the same way Meetra Surik was once at the mercy of Atris’ judgement many years prior.\n\n# Personality and Ideology\nThe story of Atris is in many ways a sad one. Her stubborn views of Jedi perfection and her gross overconfidence would be the very thing that would prove her own imperfection. Despite her harsh judgement of the Jedi Exile she herself would be judged in the same manner. \n\nAtris is viewed historically as the epitome of Jedi imperfection, despite her own staunch beliefs that the Jedi were perfect. She failed in the many ways that the Jedi Exile succeeded, and in a way this caused her to doubt herself and can be attested to her fall to the Darkside. Atris fought an overwhelming mental battle that she was too confident to admit she was losing until it eventually became too late. \n\nAtris was quick to judge and harsh in doing so, and it took the kindness of the one that she judged the harshest to eventually help her in overcoming her flaws and to admit her failures.\n\n","meta":{"index":24,"author":"seko1111","name":"Jedi Master Atris","release_year":2021}},"Aloysius Kallig":{"content":"# Introduction |\nAloysius Kallig was a male Sith Lord of the Old Sith Empire. Like many ancient Sith of his time, his name was nearly all but forgotten in the annals of time. While very few writings of history are still intact from the time of the Old Sith Empire, there is a text still intact written by the Dark Lord of the Sith Tulak Hord, who held him in respect as the greatest of his rivals.# History |\nAccording to the writings of the Dark Lord of the Sith Tulak Hord, Aloysius Kallig was a Force-sensitive male born into a wealthy family of the Old Sith Empire. Although Kallig had immense wealth, he abandoned his inheritance and his family in everything but name and went to train on the Sith homeworld of Korriban. \n\nThrough his many years of training at the Sith training grounds, Kallig would rise to be the best in his class, he would study military tactics and become a master military strategist, and in his lightsaber skills, he would be just about unbeatable. Once finishing his training at the Sith training planet of Korriban, Aloysius Kallig would pursue his goal of serving the Sith Empire alongside the Sith Lord Tulak Hord. \n\nIt was in the midst of Tulak Hord’s invasion of the planets Yn and Chabosh that Aloysius Kallig would express his interest in joining Tulah Hord for the invasion, however, Kallig would be outright dismissed by Tulak Hord, for the Dark Lord did not see any value in the would-be Sith. It would not be until Kallig killed Tulak Hord’s highest appointed general, that the Dark Lord would see the worth in Kallig and appointed him as the top general of his army, thus anointing him as Lord Kallig.\n\nThrough Tulak Hord’s campaigns, Aloysius Kallig’s infamy and power would grow to a terrifying level, so much that even Tulak Hord would grow to be frightened of the influence and power Kallig could unleash if he so wished. Thus this led to Tulak Hord arranging for his death, when Aloysius Kallig was assassinated his family, his wife, and his children fled and sought shelter and protection from the Dark Lord. As Kallig’s family fled, his body was left and entombed on Dromund Kaas. \n\nAlthough Lord Kallig’s spirit would remain in the mortal world, he would remain restless, clinging to his desire for revenge on the Dark Lord whom he once saw as a dear friend. Aloysius Kallig would roam the place of his entombment for millennia his spirit broken in his desires for revenge, and would not awaken to his former self until he would sense a disturbance in the Force, the source he would later discover would be his own descendant, who would in later years be anointed the new Lord Kallig and eventually become known as Darth Nox.\n\n","meta":{"index":41,"author":"Obiseck","name":"Aloysius Kallig","release_year":2022}},"Darth Cognus":{"content":"# Overview\nA few years following the conclusion of the New Sith Wars, a female Iktotchi assassin, The Huntress, emerged. Over a successful five-year stint, she secured employment with the royal guard of Doan. Outstanding performance in this role led to an extended contract, now at the behest of Princess Serra who sought Darth Bane's capture. Darth Bane fell into an ambush orchestrated by The Huntress and her mercenary cohorts, subdued using senflax poison and later incarcerated in the Stone Prison on Doan. Plans for her departure were postponed following an unexpected bond with Bane. Inside the prison, she crossed paths with Dark Jedi Set Harth, who suffered humiliation yet was allowed to escape. Darth Bane arrived shortly thereafter, and following The Huntress' request for him to impart the ways of the Dark Side, accepted her as his apprentice. As Darth Cognus on Ambria, named for her prescient abilities, her training commenced. Darth Zannah, Bane’s other apprentice, traveled to the planet to challenge him for the title of Sith Master. Later, Cognus ascended to the role of Sith Master and secretly mentored an apprentice, who was eventually dispatched adhering to the \"Rule of Two\".# Early life\nAn Iktotchi assassin, she possessed abilities far more refined than those of her peers. She honed her skills in telepathy and precognition, developing foresight greater than any other and eventually mastered the ability to manipulate visions and glimpse possible futures. Her career as an assassin was exemplary; she completed every mission without fail and rarely suffered injuries.\n\n# Doan missions\nThe Huntress was engaged by the Royal family of Doan for two separate contracts. The first was to assassinate a mining organization leader, partially responsible for Princess Serra’s husband's death. Upon arrival in Doan, The Huntress identified a Jedi among them. Leveraging surprise, she swiftly shot down Gelba, the leader. Subsequently, she tackled the rest of the miners, and a Jedi weakened by her force-suppression ability. She killed the Jedi knight, Medd Tandar, thereby fulfilling the contract. Her efficient execution intrigued Serra, who recently lost her father to Darth Bane.\n\nThey convened on Ambria, the planet where King Caleb met his end. During this meeting, Serra presented the second contract, which involved capturing Darth Bane. Through the Force, The Huntress witnessed visions of the past, specifically, Darth Bane and a blond woman causing Caleb's agonizing death. The Huntress reminded Serra of her role as an assassin, not a bounty hunter, but was nonetheless enticed by a generous credit offer. Furthermore, she was equipped with Senflax, a substance meant to immobilize Bane in combat. In Darth Bane's absence, The Huntress infiltrated his residence. As her companions kept watch outside, she thoroughly surveyed the estate, committing every detail to memory. She deactivated all the mansion's security measures, encompassing those protecting a small outbuilding at the property's rear.  The Huntress ventured inside, initially mistaking the structure for an armory, only to find it was a library teeming with educational materials—from datapads to aged parchment scrolls. She stumbled upon the Dark Lord's holocron, although its significance eluded her. She decided to seize it before commencing her thorough examination of the estate. With everything in place, the plan progressed. A trap was set using sonic detonators, and a strategy was devised to slow him down sufficiently to administer the venom. Bane returned, sensing the imminent danger. However, The Huntress's force-suppression compelled him to engage the mercenaries. Bane utilized Force lightning to eliminate three mercenaries, but The Huntress, leveraging her abilities and flash grenades, managed to push him from the balcony. After dealing with several more mercenaries, Bane confronted The Huntress, only to find the venom taking effect. Caught off guard during the flash grenade chaos, The Huntress seized the opportunity to slash him before pushing him down. With Bane now unconscious, the contract was nearly fulfilled.\n\n# Dark Lord of the Sith\nAt a certain point, Darth Cognus took on an apprentice named Darth Millennial. A three-eyed human, Darth Millennial did not regard the \"Rule of Two\" as beneficial to the Sith. He believed that this rule put the Sith at a disadvantage against the Jedi due to their numbers, a conviction which ultimately forced him into exile.

In physical terms, she excelled at infiltration and information gathering. As a trained Iktotchi assassin, she had proficiency in an array of weapons, ranging from long-range to close combat to explosives. Her comprehensive knowledge of venoms, combined with her other skills, made her one of the most formidable threats in the galaxy.

During the Sith-Imperial War, Maladi sabotaged the Ossus Project, a joint effort between the New Jedi Order and Yuuzhan Vong to restore devastated planets. She manipulated the Empire's High Moff Morlish Veed to ally with the Sith and orchestrated an attack on the New Jedi Temple on Ossus, leading to the fragmentation of the Jedi Order. Maladi and Krayt then focused on supplanting Emperor Roan Fel and installing Krayt as the ruler of the Empire. Maladi's next objective was to find Cade Skywalker, a descendant of the Skywalker family known for their strong connection to the Force. She believed that turning Skywalker to the dark side and utilizing his healing abilities could benefit the Sith Empire.

However, his teachings were considered odd by fellow Jedi Revan. In 3964 BBY, Revan returned under Kreia's tutelage and sought his advice on the Jedi Council.

Over time, however, the ideals of the Sith Lords diverged, and Traya and Revan's legacy dwindled from Darth Nihilus' slavery to hunger and Sion's chaining him to spread grief. his pain on others.\n\nAfter expelling Traya from the Sith Order, Sion and Nihilus began an assassination campaign against the Jedi, unaware that they were aiding their former Sith Master. Traya, who took on her former identity as Kreia, returns to Republic space, orchestrating the assassination of the Jedi. Jedi Exile, a former Jedi student from Traya, searches for Meetra Surik, also known as Jedi Exile, to help defeat the Palestinians in the final battle at Malachor V. Surik helped defeat the Mandalorian by activating Mass. Shadow Generator, a destructive weapon. who left wounds in the Force.

This changed when Kreia became Darth Traya, when her eyes became pitch black and her skin pale. Her beliefs were quite different than those of her peers. She believed manipulating others was fine, knowing others intentions was essential, and love was nothing but a lie. However, with time, she loved one person, Meetra Surik, the exile and the only person who actually understood her.

He was also the ruler of many Tuskan tribes until losing a clash with Obi-Wan that resulted in his skin being shown. Krayt started off and grew up with the ways of the Jedi but slowly turned to the Dark Side after the events of Order 66.# Section 1\nA’Sharad Hett was a human male and Tusken mix that was born and raised on Tatooine. From the moment he was born, he would be raised and taught following the ways of the Jedi, as well as the tradition of the nomadic sand people. A’Sharad would grow up informally with the ways of the force and Jedi beliefs up until his father was slain by Aurra Sing, a bounty hunter assisting in a small Tatooine war. A’Sharad would end up claiming his father's saber and still used it even after making his own. Hett would grow up to become a skilled Jar’Kai user.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter his father's passing, A’Sharad was taken as a padawan by Ki-Adi-Mundi. With careful watch from a Jedi Master, he and his master would go on a mission on the planet Mastalare. During this mission, he would gather the opportunity to speak with and learn from many high-ranking Jedi, some of which were Yaddle, Mace Windu, his master, and many others. The goal of this mission was to talk with the residents of Lannik, who claimed they wanted to end the ongoing civil war on their planet. Malastare was used as the meeting location for the treaty.\n\nA few years after this, the bounty hunter who murdered A’Sharad’s father all those years ago would resurface on an uncharted planet claimed by Senator Tikkes. Both Hett and his master went to end the threat once and for all. On the planet, they encountered The Dark Woman, who was previously the master of Aurra Sing. She also displayed her disappointment in her and was eager to assist them on their journey. During this mission, A’Sharad was assigned to the senator, as that was who the bounty hunter was \ngoing for next. Despite his best efforts to defend himself, Sing still managed to board the ship. Upon entry, A’Sharad felt an extreme burst of anger that caused him to knock Sing unconscious. Unfortunately, he was able to regain control of his emotions and turn in the killer to his master. Krayt’s outburst of emotions left him feeling guilty, so he requested to be put into exile like his father before him. Hearing this, the Dark Woman offered to take him in and control his emotions. Over the course of about ten years, he would become a knight and take in a padawan by the name of Nikto.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring the clone wars, A’Sharad acted as a General for the Galactic Republic and was used mainly for air support during the Battle of Geonosis. He also led clone troopers to many ground battles and planets such as Argonar and Metalorn. After Obi-Wan’s assumed death, Hett would befriend the young Anakin Skywalker and act as guidance when he needed it most. After the battle of Jabiim, Anakin and A’Sharad worked together to clear the way for the Republic Military hospital to lay ground on New Holstice. During one of the battles, Anakin and A’Sharad fought together, one of Anakin's comrades was dying, causing Anakin to panic and try to massage her heart with the force. This only led to a much more painful and quick death. A’Sharad confronted Anakin about this and discovered that Anakin had not yet processed the idea that people die and it is a natural thing. A’Sharad would teach him of the memory moths and how it's a good way to get through a comrade’s death.\n\n# Section 4\nDuring the conclusion of the Clone Wars, Palpatine executed his priority protocol, better known as Order 66. This command caused all clones to execute their Jedi commanders. Hett was lucky enough to be away from his clone squad at the time, though when he returned, he confronted one of the clones and learned what happened before killing him. He fled in an attempt to find any other remaining Jedi, with disappointing results.\n\nThinking he was the last remaining Jedi, Hett moved to Tatooine, where he started a new life and became a leader for several Tuskan clans. He led these armies and set up camps \n\nwhile privately preparing for a war against the Galactic Empire. Hett’s excellent leadership ability allowed him to recover the losses the Tuskens faced when Hett’s dad was killed.\n\n# Section 5\nOn a mission across Tatooine, Hett and his Tusken force approached a farm under the name of Owen Lars. When approaching the farm, Hett and his force ended up being attacked by none other than Obi-Wan Kenobi. This, of course, shocked Hett and they ended up in a clash. Obi-Wan believed Hett was getting dangerously close to the dark side and pleaded for him to stay back from the farm. He did not listen as he believed that farmers were the reason for the Tuskens murder and problems. Hett would end up losing the fight, as well as his arm. His mask also fell off in the middle of the fight. The Tuskens forbade any flesh from being shown, regardless of whether it was an accident. This meant that all of the Tuskens turned around and abandoned him, with no words spoken.\n\nHett could not stand the humiliation and begged Obi-Wan to kill him right there. Of course, Kenobi did not want to kill an old comrade, so he told him to never return to Tatooine. He hoped that Hett would see his errors and return to the Jedi way, but this only caused his anger to rise. Hett would learn the truth about Owens' farm and regret keeping it a secret decades later.\n\n# Section 6\nAfter his forced removal from Tatooine, Hett became a Bounty Hunter while not exposing himself as a Jedi. When pursuing a bounty on Korriban, A considerable storm arose that caused Hett to have to reveal his Jedi abilities. Hett killed the bounty after he threatened to turn him in for exposing his powers. After this, he started to hear a voice calling to him from the darkness. In it, he discovered a room containing a Sith Holocron. An old Sith Lord appeared from the Holocron and offered to teach him the ways of the Sith, which Hett accepted.\n\nHett opened his eyes to the Sith ways and manipulated himself into believing that he was only learning new skills to kill Palpatine and Vader. However, when he resurfaced he realized that a lot more time than he thought had passed. The Battle of Endor had ended, and Vader and Palpatine had been defeated by Luke. Because of this, Hett set off to the unknown regions to lose himself.\n\n# Section 7\nWhile traveling the Unknown Regions, Hett was captured and placed onto a Yuuzhan \nVong ship where he was put in the Embrace of Pain. Here he was endlessly tortured both in the mind and in the body. His fake arm cut off by Kenobi was replaced with a real one, and his eye was replaced by one from a Yuuzhan Vong. During this endless cycle of torture, Fett would meet someone by the name of Vergere. He would tell Fett about the weakness of the galaxy and that all it needs is one person to lead a new sith force to fix the galaxy. Vergere would end up leaving the ship to try and fix the galaxy, which allowed Hett to escape and return to Korriban.\n\nAfter his return to Korriban, Hett underwent the name of Darth Krayt, naming himself after a dragon from his homeworld. He also completely re-established the Sith order and abolished Darth Banes's rule of two, and instead introduced the rule of one, meaning that it was just the entirety of the Sith Order with many minions under it.\n\nThroughout hundreds of years, Krayt as well as his army grew stronger and stronger. Krayt started to train his body to support the Yuuzhan Vong implants while also expanding and strengthening his army. Unfortunately, though, his body started to fail him with his old age, and he presumed he had about twenty years to live.\n\n","meta":{"index":83,"author":"ShokuMatsu","name":"Darth Krayt","release_year":2022}},"Komari Vosa":{"content":"# Overview\nCount Dooku mentored Komari Vosa, a human woman with Force sensitivity who went to the dark side of the Force after being banished from the Jedi Order.

Vosa was eventually defeated, but he chose to spare her life because the prize was the same whether she was alive or dead when she was apprehended. Darth Tyrannus, her old lord, assassinated her. Despite his disappointment at losing a talented pupil like Komari Vosa, Tyranus congratulated Jango Fett on winning the competition. He promised to pay even more than the five million credits if the bounty hunter consented to come to Kamino to be cloned.\n\n# Personality and traits\nKomari Vosa was renowned as a gorgeous female Human with sharp, angular features during her tenure with the Jedi Order. Her expression changed as a result of the pain she was feeling. Her jawline and upper torso were scarred by the Bando Gora, while the evil side bleached her blond hair bone white and her irises yellow. Vosa, as a Jedi Padawan, had a strong feeling of aggressiveness and a desire to fight. She was a tough pupil who was impatient yet extremely skilled in Jedi techniques. Her master overlooked her flaws because he was confident in her growth. She got overwhelmed in rage as a result of his master's blatant treachery. Vosa lost her sanity and endured a major personality transformation after being subjected to physical and psychological anguish by the Bando Gora. She became evil and vengeful.\n\n# Powers and abilities\nA Jedi with a feeble intellect who is a competent saber-to-saber combatant. A dangerous Jar'Kai combat form wielder who is also talented in Soresu. Vosa's approach was maybe not confined to Soresu. There is also proof of her use of ataru and shien, which she demonstrated during her bounty pursuit. Her lightsabers displayed curved hilts like her former instructor Dooku's, hence she may have studied Makashi. Despite her frail intellect, Vosa had a high degree of proficiency in the force, which gave her speed and agility. She could also use telepathy and has a vast range of force abilities. Her deep dive into the dark side gave her a lot of resistance. This made her reckless since she repeatedly abandoned her defenses and launched herself at Fett, allowing the bounty hunter to gradually tear her down until she was defenseless. She spoke Huttese, Kaminoan, and the old Sith language alongside the Galactic Basic Standard.\n\n","meta":{"index":139,"author":"Craked10","name":"Komari Vosa","release_year":2023}},"Varner Hilts":{"content":"# Overview\nA human who worked as the amiable steward of Sith mythology for the Lost Tribe of Sith. Born and raised during the turbulent Time of the Rot. Hilts wanted to bring the Tribe back together by utilizing the knowledge of the past as a historian. The Lost Tribe was into a state of ferocious intramural conflict, and its actual roots had been forgotten. Hilts was far more progressive and open-minded than many of his Sith peers. Even the native humanoids of the planet Kesh, the purple-skinned Keshiri, saw him as an equal. The numerous Sith groups were brought together by Varner Hilts, who then gave the Tribe a new task to conquer  this new continent. The other Sith unanimously chose Hilts to be their next Grand Lord. Iliana, whom Hilts later married, later took on his family name. While an old rule mandated that the Grand Lord's consort be put to death upon the latter's passing, Hilts pledged to protect her. Takara Hilts, a daughter from their marriage, was subsequently born. Later generations would refer to Grand Lord Hilts' rule as the \"Hilts Restoration,\" and it was seen as a period of peace, stability, and restoration.# Biography\nVarner Hilts was a male Human who resided on the isolated planet Kesh in Wild Space and belonged to the Lost Tribe of Sith, a clan of stranded Human Sith. That blade had been used in an attempt to kill a certain faction leader by Hilts' father, but the dagger's sheath was left unfastened.The Tribe's homeland, Keshtah Minor, had been destroyed by civil war for more than 960 years when it was finally put an end by the passing of Grand Lord Lillia Venn in 3960 BBY. Only on Testament Day, a festival celebrated every 25 years during which the Testament of Yaru Korsin, the founder of the Lost Tribe, was read, could the many Sith groups come together harmoniously. Being the Tribe's Caretaker by the age of thirty-five, Hilts was able to oversee Testament Day that year. As Grand Caretaker, Hilts had the authority to call the Pantheon's Peace, which permitted the reading of Yaru Korsin's Testament using a holocron, an antiquated piece of Jedi and Sith technology that existed before the Tribe. Before the year 3000 BBY, Hilts met a Sith lover who tried to murder him and seduced him. Hilts reminded the several Sith factions that the Circle Eternal was not the place for bloodshed after mediating between Iliana and Neera, the head of Force 57. Korsin Bentado proposed that the three Sith groups move their battle outside, where a number of other factions had congregated, and fight there. Hilts offered to do the holocron reading because he couldn't stand by as blood was spilt. Hilts said that lying was a trait of the Sith when Iliana learned he had lied. Hilts made the decision to go to the historic Kesh Sith Temple and open it because she thought Korsin had left a postscript. The Omen, a legendary Sith ship that had delivered the Tribe's forefathers to Kesh, found its ultimate resting place in the temple. The Kesh Sith temple was situated at the northernmost point of a long, hilly peninsula that ran parallel to the mainland of Keshtah Minor. Hilts and Jaye returned to the Temple where they packed some provisions before setting out for the location. Hilts had remembered Yaru Korsin's Testament and the Kesh Sith Temple's full blueprint during the course of his employment as the Tribe's historian. Hilts saw the construction of a monument honoring Seelah Korsin, the Mother of the Tribe, outside the Wardroom. Her own Sisters of Seelah had intervened during the battle, and Iliana retreated to the Sith Temple to elude her assailants, especially Korsin Bentado, the head of the Korsinite League, whom she had previously severely injured. Iliana had found the bones of her idol Seelah Korsin in the wardroom of the Temple. Iliana was shocked when Jaye made his presence known, but Hilts reassured her that the Keshiri were on his side. To symbolize the end of the Time of the Rot, Hilts would christen his reign as the Hilts Restoration as the next Grand Lord. To spread the word of Hilts' rise and the finding of Keshtah Major, Edell Vrai, Korsin Bentado, and Neera dispersed over mainland Keshtah Minor. In order to create a way of reaching Keshtah Major, Hilts appointed the mathematician Vrai as his principal engineer. He hypothesized that the locals would be aware of the Sith existence if the Keshiri rebel Adari Vaal and her followers had arrived on the new continent in their flight of stolen uvak. The old guy was reenergized by the prospect of conquering a new continent. Unquestionably, the conquest of Keshtah Major was the most significant aspect of Hilts' administration. The Tribe worked to discover a safe route to go to Alanciar under the direction of Chief Engineer and High Lord Edell Vrai. The Sith and Keshiri on Keshtah knew little about science and technology, but they both understood that Kesh was a globe. The Tribe's scribes calculated that the western path across the ocean to Keshtah Major was shorter than the eastern route, but the Tribe's explorers were unable to advance because of the powerful tidal currents. The Sith attempted to employ uvaks for exploration flights, but they were unable to due to the distance. Boats also weren't effective. Then 25 years of investigation later, the solution became clear: Airships fueled by hydrogen. During the next years he would suffer plenty of setbacks and new enemies would appear but with the emergence of new allies, his immense intelligence, his powerful wife and confidence, he was capable of overcoming all obstacles and giving back its old glory to the Lost Tribe of the Sith.\n\n# Personality and traits\nVarner Hilts was distinguished from other Sith by his calm demeanor and his sense of logic. He had a passion for history and was one of the Tribe's most well-known authorities on the old Tapani language, which was spoken by the Tribe's ancestors. Hilts had no interest in either politics or conflict, in contrast to many of his Sith brethren. He showed the indigenous Keshiri people respect and treated them equally. He was not beyond lying, though, if it served his interests. Prior to 3000 BBY, Varner Hilts, who likewise yearned for a female companion, was unable to locate one because of his unsatisfying job as the Tribe's caretaker, an archivist and museum curator responsible for maintaining track of the Tribe's historical records and timekeeping. Varner Hilts shared this yearning for a female companion, but prior to 3000 BBY he was unable to locate a spouse owing to his unsatisfactory job as the Tribe's caretaker, an archivist and museum curator charged with maintaining the Tribe's timekeeping and historical archives. Hilts got married to Iliana after being promoted to Grand Lord. Iliana's power ambitions were to be restrained, and she was to be shielded from her previous adversaries, notably Korsin Bentado, by this marriage.\n\n# Skills\nVarner Hilts was not adept at utilizing the Force to defend himself or to engage in lightsaber battles. He was also warned as a young man that no one would stand next to him for fear of unintentional amputation due to his subpar lightsaber abilities. Despite having undergone the same training as his Sith peers, he had only ever used his Force abilities to deflect pieces of falling debris. Hilts needed Iliana, his wife, to keep him safe even as Grand Lord. His superior intelligence and logical reasoning, however, more than made up for his lackluster combat abilities. Varner Hilts was also capable of and prepared to utilize deceit to further his personal objectives.\n\n","meta":{"index":153,"author":"Craked10","name":"Varner Hilts","release_year":2023}},"TAY-0":{"content":"# Overview\nTAY-0 was a conceited, masculine racer droid who piloted a modified 12 series speeder repulsorcraft, in the celerity sport of Riot Racing on the desert planet Serolonis during the Imperial Era's first year, 19 BBY.

TAY-0 chose offence over defence, and with a policy of almost no rules, he outfitted his speeder with blaster cannons to destroy any competition. The Trandoshan Ciddarin Scaleback bet currency on TAY-0 against the Dowutin Grini Millegi and his racer, Jet Venim, the reigning Safa Toma Classic champion. \n\nScaleback arrived in Serolonis in 19 BBY to witness the race for her earnings, accompanied by two other Clone Force 99 employees, Tech and Wrecker, who brought the adolescent clone Omega for supervision.

It is known that his family and many of his friends were present on Malachor V, suggesting that he lived there, though what became of Darth Nihilus after this event is well documented.\n\nConsidered by many as the most terrifying of all the Sith, Darth Nihilus is perhaps one of the most unique beings in galactic history, primarily being a dark side aberration fuelled by an unquenching hunger for life, Darth Nihilus’ very existence is considered an abomination, an entity that consumes all in his path regardless of its affiliations or nature.# Part I\nThe being known as Darth Nihilus was created on Malachor V, when the planet was torn apart by the Mass Shadow Generator and all but a few survivors on the planet were left, the very hatred within Nihilus fuelled his will to survive. So much so that he consumed the very life of many of his fellow survivors. In those brief moments of consumption the pain and hatred for Nihilus had ceased, but he felt discomfort at what he had done. Each time Nihilus consumed a living being his hunger grew more stronger and the pain grew larger, forcing Nihilus to consume life not as a desire, but as a necessity to feel what can only be described as relative comfort.\n\nNihilus would eventually be found by Darth Traya, once a Jedi Master and teacher of the legendary Jedi Knight Revan, Darth Traya recognised the potential of Nihilus and took him as an Apprentice within her Sith Academy. Nihilus would rise throughout the ranks of Traya’s Sith Academy and become one of three ruling Sith within the now known Sith Triumvirate. \n\nDespite having been dubbed a Dark Lord of the Sith, a Darth and a leader of the Sith Triumvirate, Nihilus held little regard for the teachings of the Sith or their philosophies, Nihilus would utilise the resources the Sith Triumvirate offered to achieve his only goal; to consume every living being in the galaxy. Darth Nihilus would travel from planet to planet, consuming all life he could.\n\n# Part II\nDarth Nihilus alongside his fellow Triumvirate leader, Darth Sion, would betray their once Master Darth Traya. Darth Nihilus personally severed Traya’s connection to the Force and fed upon her life essence, leaving her weakened and almost entirely stripped of her powers. Once this was done Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion would commence a purge of the Jedi Order, while Darth Sion would use the conventional tactics of battle, Darth Nihilus carried out his part in the purge by consuming the lives of the Jedi he encountered. Eventually as a result of their purge the Jedi Order had less than 100 survivors. \n\nIt was at this point Darth Nihilus’ body was essentially non-existent, he would go on to entirely encase his essence within his mask and robes. His human form would fade away and he would exist merely as a presence of dark side energy. He would now be considered a wound in the Force itself, often considered the dark side’s version of a Force ghost.\n\n# Part III\nDarth Nihilus would later be lured to the world of Katarr by Jedi Master Atris. In an effort to stop Darth Nihilus numerous surviving Jedi including some of the remaining Jedi Council rallied to Katarr to prepare for battle, though when Darth Nihilus arrived there was no battle to be had. When Darth Nihilus spoke his presence was so overwhelming it fed on everything on Katarr’s surface, the nature, the people, the Jedi survivors, everything save but one Miralukan; Visas Marr. \n\nVisas Marr would be taken by Darth Nihilus as his Apprentice and Shadow Hand, their bond would be so strong that it would serve to strengthen each other in battle, it is theorised that despite Darth Nihilus no longer being of human nature, he still held emotions other than hate and pain due to this unique bond. This bond can be compared to a Force bond like the one Meetra Surik and Traya shared. It would be at this point that Darth Nihilus would reveal that he believed his hunger would provide order and stability to the galaxy, as during a Force vision shown to Visas Marr, Darth Nihilus envisioned a galaxy in which all beings were cut off from the Force and each other, Nihilus believed that this was true order.\n\n# Part IV\nSo strong was Nihilus’ vision and his power in the Force that upon witnessing it, Visas Marr’s eyes were carved out of her head and her ability to see through the Force was greatly reduced. Those in Nihilus’ presence were often in great pain but physically and mentally. The slave crew he kept aboard his flagship the Ravager were consistently in agony, Visas Marr herself would beg Nihilus to be allowed to die in his presence, and his very hatred kept his flagship from falling apart, as it was a badly damaged cruiser from Malachor V. These passive abilities only go to prove the true power this Sith Lord held, even unintentionally. \n\nDarth Nihilus’ Sith Order became experts in hunting down not only Jedi, but Force users everywhere across the galaxy. During Darth Nihilus’ life he would sense the Force and would use his hunger to destroy multiple planets. While the ability to consume life on such a scale could not be taught, the ability to sense the Force could. Darth Nihilus trained many Sith Assassins in his own ability to sense the Force and sent them into the galaxy on his behalf to do so. For many of these Sith simply being in the presence of Nihilus would enhance their ability to detect the Force, this would make Darth Nihilus the greatest threat to the future of the Jedi Order and at the time, the greatest threat to the galaxy.\n\n# Part V\nDarth Nihilus would be defeated above Onderon, by the Jedi Meetra Surik, his ex-Apprentice Visas Marr and Mand’alor the Preserver. The duel that took place seemed impossible due to Nihilus’ ability to drain the Force but the Jedi Meetra Surik had a similar ability, she was able to draw upon the Force of those around her and did so through her allies. Visas Marr during the battle would offer her life so that Nihilus could be defeated and this particular show of devotion by one Nihilus had such a strong Force connection with stunned him long enough for Visas Marr to sever her connection with him, allowing the trio of allies to defeat Nihilus. Despite him being defeated Darth Nihilus was never truly killed, his spirit remained attached to his mask and robes which were later buried on Korriban. The combined dark side energy of Korriban and the spirit of Nihilus allowed him to remain as a Force essence on the planet for thousands of years.\n\nThe story of Darth Nihilus would be told for generations to come however it wasn’t until 137 ABY that he would yet again be encountered. This time by Darth Krayt. Darth Krayt wished to learn how he could prevent Yuuzhan Vong creatures from consuming his body, though in the fashion of Darth Nihilus, he simply spoke in his own language. The spirits of two other Dark Lords were also present, Darth Bane and Darth Andeddu who both agreed with Darth Nihilus, seemingly understanding him; all three agreed Darth Krayt was unworthy of being called Sith. This was the last interaction with Darth Nihilus recorded in galactic history.\n\n","meta":{"index":12,"author":"Seko1111","name":"Darth Nihilus","release_year":2021}},"Durge":{"content":"# Overview\nDurge was a male Gen’dai bounty hunter born in 2022 BBY. He was known for being ruthless and formidable, due to a combination of skill, experience, and his species. Gen’dai were an extremely rare species, composed entirely of nerves and muscle, making them formless, and essentially able to take any form they needed to. In addition, they possessed incredible regenerative abilities, being able to regrow their bodies at will. They also could not die of old age, so Durge was blessed with thousands of years of experience in bounty hunting.# History\nBorn in 2022 BBY, Durge was born on the unnamed Gen’dai homeworld. From a young age, Durge was already in great physical shape and possessed an aggressive nature, unbecoming of most Gen’dai. After witnessing bounty hunters on the job, Durge became obsessed with the profession. He later left his tribe to explore the galaxy, training under several different bounty hunters along the way. At one point, Durge met Jaing, a mandalorian bounty hunter who taught the Gen’dai everything about mandalorian combat skills and tactics. \n\nSome time later, the two were approached by a doctor who offered to give the bounty hunters cybernetic enhancements. Fearing they would become obsolete in combat without them, Durge and Jaing agreed to let the doctor give them the cybernetics. The cybernetics essentially merged with their suits of armour with the new cybernetics. Eager to test out their upgrades, Durge and Jaing engaged in a sparring match, but were interrupted by the doctor. The doctor informed the bounty hunters that his facility had been breached by a clan of Mandalorian bounty hunters loyal to their enemy Ung Kusp had breached the door in search of a Sith artifact. In the ensuing battle, Jaing was incapacitated by a thermal detonator, leading Durge to believe him dead and swear vengeance on the Mandalorians.\n\nDurge would go on to fight in the new Sith Wars, facing off against multiple Jedi and learning several ways to kill them. After the defeat of the Sith, Durge went into hiding. 100 years before the Battle of Naboo, Durge was hired to assassinate the then-Mandalore. He was successful, but was also captured and tortured by the Mandalorians. He eventually escaped, but it took him a century to recover from the torture, 60 of which were spent underground.\nDurge re emerged at the time of the Clone Wars, only to be disappointed that most of the galaxys Mandalorians had died. Durge was later invited to join the CIS by Count Dooku himself. Durge took up the offer after learning that the Grand Army of the Republic was composed of Jedi and clones of a Mandalorian bounty hunter, giving him a second chance at revenge. Durge would fight in several battles of the War, slaughtering countless Jedi and clones along the way. Late in the war, Durge successfully managed to lure Obi-Wan Kenobi and his protege Anakin Skywalker to the Karthakk system aboard a stolen ship. Believing Asajj Ventress was on board, Kenobi and Skywalker boarded the ship, only to be met with several explosives strategically placed along the way. After being wounded, Kenobi was beaten mercilessly by Durge, only being saved when Skywalker stepped in. Kenobi left in search of clues to Ventress’ whereabouts while Skywalker engaged the Gen’dai in combat. After having his helmet destroyed by Skywalker, Durge went into a fit of fury, which Skywalker managed to exploit, throwing the Gen’dai into an escape pod and guiding it through the force to collide with the nearest star, disintegrating the pod and Durge with it.\n\n","meta":{"index":88,"author":"KenjiVolt","name":"Durge","release_year":2022}},"Uthar Wynn":{"content":"# Introduction\nUthar Wynn was a humanoid Male and the Headmaster of the Sith Academy.

Uthar was also known but unaware of the training of former Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Revan who was presumed dead due to a betrayal of Revan’s apprentice Darth Malak who shot down Revan’s Cruiser while battling Jedi Knight Bastille Shan. Uthar's time in the Academy was lost due to the Dark Lord being turned back to the Light.# Early Life\nUthar wasn’t always a Headmaster, he was also a student himself and was a very well-informed Student as well. during his time as an Acolyte, he would devote his life to the studies of the Dark Side and the Sith Philosophy, this led to his hand-picked selection by the Headmaster at the time “Jorak Uln” who was a crazy man who devoted a lot of time into the tomb of Tulak Hord. Jorak would be forced by his Apprentice Uthar to further commit his studies in the Tomb of Tulak Hord resulting in Jorak’s final descent towards psychotic behavior and officially losing his ability to teach and run the Academy. This allowed Uthar to secure his spot as Sith Knight and ascend as the new Headmaster of the Sith Academy.\n\n# The Deceitful Lie\nDuring the Jedi Civil War a young Jedi padawan named Dustil Onasi and son of the republic war hero Carth Onasi, was deceived by Yuthura Ban, Uthar’s new Apprentice who was assigned to acquire the talented Force-sensitives for the Sith Academy. Uthar found Dustils talents very useful to the Sith and looked to get him prepared for his initiation into the Order. However, Dustil fell in love with another Hopeful named Selene and altered Dustils performance towards the Dark Side of the Force. To resolve this problem Uthar saw to it that selene was to be removed from the Sith Academy…. Permanently.

He was the most trusted and loyal servant of the founder of the One Sith, Dark Lord Darth Krayt, to whom only Wyyrlok was second to when it came to both power and knowledge.# Section 1\nThe Male Chagrian Darth Wyyrlok was the third to use this name as it was a hereditary title that carried on from his grandfather, the first Darth Wyyrlok and his father, the second Darth Wyyrlok. His duty as Darth Wyyrlok was to attend to Darth Krayt, the leader of the One Sith, as a servant. Prior to the Yuuzhan Vong War, Darth Krayt was implanted with a Yorik-Kul by the Yuuzhan Vong which allowed him to utilize their technology, but simultaneously they continued to grow, which made Krayt fear that one day they would consume his entire body which led to him spending time in Stasis for years on end. Even by the time of Darth Wyyrlok III, Krayt wasn’t fully healed which meant that Wyyrlok had to tend to his master during that time and take care of him. At some point, Wyyrlok had a daughter whom was sent to Korriban for training in the ways of the Sith, during this time as Wyyrlok was the closest to Darth Krayt, he was not only an attendant and servant but also a spokesman and friend to him; acting as the Dark Lord's confidant.\n\nOnce Darth Krayt started his plans for galactic dominance, Darth Wyyrlok was by his side for the entire Sith-Imperial War which lasted over three years. This led to Darth Krayt becoming an Emperor,however, he complained to his servant that his body was failing him, whereas Wyyrlok suggested a Healing Trance or Stasis once more but Krayt refused stasis as he believed he needed to show people he was strong as an Emperor.\n\n# Section 2\nSeven years after the Sith-Imperial War, Darth Krayt was once again put in stasis. This caused Wyyrlok to fear for his master's life, this led the One Sith to the capture of a Jedi Healer known as Hosk Trey’lis, but even their methods were inefficient. A skilled healer, Cade Skywalker, went on a rescue mission to save Trey’lis but was captured and tortured. This was done in order to bend Skywalker and eventually break him as Darth Krayt believed he would be the one to cure him of his affliction.\n\nKrayt decided to try indoctrinate Skywalker into the One Sith even though Wyyrlok disapproved of this decision, which in the end, Wyyrlok was correct where at the first opportunity that he got, Cade Skywalker attempted an escape in which he severed Darth Nihl’s arm and injured Darth Krayt. He escaped unscathed on a ship known as the Mynock. This injury forced Wyyrlok to put his master Darth Krayt into stasis as he was fearing for his life.\n\n# Section 3\nOver the coming years, Darth Wyyrlok III stayed by Darth Krayt's side while looking for ways to heal him of the affliction, like finding the secrets of Lord Andeddu. Wyyrlok was also by his master's side during the massacre at Dac, and  even went to help his injured master at Had Abbadon. However, he decided on something else entirely and proceeded to use Force Lightning on his master, killing him. Darth Wyyrlok then recovered his master’s body and escaped. He convinced the galaxy that Darth Krayt was in fact injured and in Stasis once more, which gave him the opportunity to take control, where he decided to deceive the people around him so that he may act as regent in the Emperor’s stead. The only person that saw through it was Darth Maladi, who believed the ruler should have experience in leadership as well as power to bend the Sith to their will, and so she began constructing a weapon that would stabilize the One Sith by making them fear the Dark Lord's power.\n\n# Section 4\nA short time later, Darth Wyyrlok returned to Korriban to inspect the place where his master’s body was kept, where to his surprise; the body was gone, as if it disappeared without a trace. After some time, it became very clear that Darth Krayt was in fact alive and was heading to Coruscant. Upon hearing of this, Wyyrlok decided to spread the news that he actually  killed Darth Krayt, where he did this in order to further deceive the One Sith, as his old master succumbed to illness and could no longer serve and act as Emperor, and further stated that the living Darth Krayt all Sith felt in their mind was not Darth Krayt but rather, an impostor. Shortly after, Darth Krayt arrived on Coruscant with Darth Nihl, Darth Talon and 2 masked Sith Troopers in order to get rid of the Usurper to the throne, where they carved their way into the throne room where the Dark Lord of The Sith, Darth Krayt, and Sith Regent, Darth Wyyrlok III, engaged in a duel. Darth Wyyrlok proceeded to use Sith Sorcery to show Darth Krayt the torments of his long life while claiming it was him and his ancestors that kept the One Sith functioning, while the Dark Lord was suffering from his affliction. As Darth Wyyrlok stood over Darth Krayt believing himself victorious, Darth Krayt proved otherwise by plunging his sabers into Wyyrlok’s chest. Darth Wyyrlok collapsed while clinging onto the arms of Lord Stryfe, who left him to die in order to take his place as regent.

Undeterred, he shrouded himself in the cloak of darkness, assuming the guise of a maleficent Jedi, skillfully entwining the minds and abilities of Force-users under his sway. Those who refused his teachings became his adversaries, whom he eliminated at opportune moments.\n\n# Personality\nJedgar possessed an insatiable ambition for power, distinguishing him as the most ambitious among the Prophets. Unlike Kadann, he desired immediate power and would employ any method to achieve his goals, regardless of consequences. Frustrated by Kadann's superiority, he refrained from open opposition but remained arrogant, cruel, and impatient. His impulsive nature often led to mistakes and further defeats, as he would prematurely seize victory before his plans fully unfolded. He took pleasure in his Dark side abilities, frequently employing armies of Force Wraiths and his lightsaber in combat.\n\n# Physical Appearance\nTall and slender, Jedgar had a bald head, a bearded chin, and hooded eyes. Like other Prophets of the Dark Side, he wore traditional star-covered robes reminiscent of deep space. Always armed with a sickly glowing green-bladed lightsaber, its distinct electronic hum resonated with aggression. Jedgar also used hssiss creatures to dampen his Force presence.\n\n","meta":{"index":130,"author":"SkyPanik","name":"Jedgar","release_year":2023}},"Meetra Surik":{"content":"# Introduction\nJedi, General, hero of the Republic. Meetra Surik was all of these things and more. Among all the great stories studied and told about the Jedi, few stand out as much as Meetra Surik and her struggle to reconnect herself to the Force while battling one of the most powerful Sith Lords in history. Meetra Surik would go from a young Padawan following her idols to war and grow into one of the most independent and strongest Jedi Masters of her era, she would survive three wars and become responsible for the survival of the Jedi Order after the Dark Wars.# Part I\nMeetra Surik would begin her life as many Jedi do. At an early age she would be inducted into the Jedi Order as a Youngling, having been detected as Force sensitive and become one of the many Jedi Younglings who would train within the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine, prior to the days that students would train on Coruscant. \n\nMeetra Surik had perhaps one of the rarest and most dangerous Force abilities of them all, one she was consistently cautioned against and fortunately never had to use on anyone but herself. She had the ability to sever an individual’s connection from the Force, essentially stripping them of their life essence and making them a living wound in the Force. Much like a foe she would face later in life.\n\nDuring her days on Dantooine, young Meetra would rise to the rank of Padawan and be informally assigned to the then Jedi Knight Kavar Lamares. There is no knowledge surrounding why she was informally assigned a Master and it would not be the first time this would happen, later being assigned to Jedi Master Vima Sunrider informally as well when Kavar would go off to assist the Republic in preparing for the inevitable Mandalorian invasion.\n\n# Part II\nMeetra Surik would be one of many Jedi who believed in Revan and Malak’s desire to help defend the Republic against the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. As such she would join the Revanchists and set off for war. Surik was a strongly compassionate individual and believed it was her duty to avenge the lives already lost by the Neo-Crusader onslaught in the Outer-Rim. Her first Master, Kavar Lamares was involved in the early skirmishes prior to the Republic and Jedi Order taking an official stance on the war and believed it was only right that she follow in his footsteps. Because of this, Meetra Surik was among the most dedicated Jedi to Revan’s cause, perhaps only being outmatched by Revan himself. \n\nMeetra Surik would eventually become Knighted during the Mandalorian Wars, likely a result of her bravery and brilliant strategic mind, after being Knighted it was not long before the Republic Military recognised her prowess and commissioned her as a General within the Republic Army. Revan saw her as his most trusted ally and General, even more so than Malak. Meetra would be placed in charge of some of the bloodiest and crucial campaigns of the Mandalorian Wars.\n\n# Part III\nWhen Revan ordered the Republic Military to conduct a counter-offensive, Meetra Surik would be charged with taking the most fortified Neo-Crusader position in the war. Revan believed it was crucial to free the independent world of Onderon from the Neo-Crusader occupiers that had taken the planet towards the start of the war. But to take Onderon, Revan knew he had to take its moon, Dxun.\n\nDxun was staunchly loyal to the Neo-Crusader cause, having been inhabited by Mandalorian Clans decades before the war began, the moon was heavily fortified and the Neo-Crusaders had prepared the dense jungle well for invasion.\n\nDxun served as headquarters for the initial invasion of the Republic and as the staging point for all operations the Neo-Crusaders conducted against the Inner Rim, if the Republic did not take the planet then the war would be lost, as Dxun provided a gateway into many coreworlds \n\nthat had already cost the Republic Military too much to retake during Revan’s counter-offensive. \n\nRevan would order Meetra Surik to take Dxun, however upon the initial landing a majority of General Surik’s forces would be depleted. She had but a small fraction of her invasion forces and was up against massive garrisons of Neo-Crusader defenders. However, due to Meetra Surik’s tactical brilliance and the almost suicidal strategies employed by Revan during the later stage of the war, Meetra Surik would be successful in driving the Neo-Crusaders off Dxun, essentially marking the turning point of the war and allowing the rest of the Republic Military to take Dxun.\n\n# Part IV\nAs a result of Meetra Surik’s success in taking the moon of Dxun, Revan would place her in charge of the final battle against the Neo-Crusaders. Meetra Surik would be responsible for tackling the largest element of the Neo-Crusader fleet above Malachor V and for detonating the Republic super-weapon, the Mass Shadow Generator.\n\nMeetra Surik successfully engaged the Neo-Crusader armada but was overwhelmed by their numbers. The largest element of the Republic Fleet was with Revan on a mission to kill Mand’alor the Ultimate and destroy his own personal fleet. While Revan was successful, Meetra Surik’s forces were struggling against the Neo-Crusaders, she relayed this information to Revan who in return ordered Meetra Surik to detonate the Mass Shadow Generator. \n\nDespite having thousands of Republic forces in orbit around Malachor V still fighting, Meetra Surik would detonate the super-weapon and as a result was forced to sever her personal connection to the Force in order to survive. Surik would prove successful in ending the Mandalorian Wars.\n\n# Part V\nAfter the Mandalorian Wars had ended, Revan, Malak and the rest of their Jedi followers would travel into the Unknown Regions of space in search of the hiding Sith Emperor. Meetra Surik would stay behind, being the only Jedi that would return to face judgement for her actions and disobedience of the Jedi Council’s wishes. Meetra Surik would return to the Jedi Order only to face scrutiny and harsh judgement, despite being a war hero of the Republic, the Jedi Council did not view her as one. \n\nMany Jedi on the Council including Master Atris would come to view Meetra Surik as a potential follower of the Darkside and believed her punishment should be severe, whereas other Jedi Masters such as her former Master, Kavar Lamares, believed that the punishment being issued was an emotional response to the Council being defied. \n\nDespite a passionate speech in defense of her actions, Meetra Surik would be exiled from the Jedi Order, stripped of her lightsaber and sent on her way. The Council had sensed that she was no longer connected to the Force and believed that a harsher punishment was unnecessary. From this point onwards she would forever be known as ‘’The Exile’’.\n\n# Part VI\nAfter her exile at the hands of the Jedi Council, Meetra Surik would find herself travelling the Outer Rim. It is unknown as to why Meetra Surik decided to go to the Outer Rim though it could likely be attributed to her desire to find Revan, who was missing at the time as he travelled into the Unknown Regions in search of the Sith Emperor.\n\n# Return\nMeetra Surik would eventually return to known space at the height of the Dark Wars. Upon finding out about the near destruction of the Jedi Order and that all surviving Jedi were in hiding due to an unknown looming threat, Meetra Surik was confident she would be safe due to her lack of connection to the Force. This was true to an extent. If it was not for Master Atris leaking the information of Meetra Surik’s return to the Sith Triumvirate on purpose, she would have been safe. Unfortunately due to Master Atris’ plan to lure the threat into the open as she had once tried on Katarr, Meetra Surik would be hunted by Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion, who believed her to be the last of the Jedi, regardless of her status as an exile. \n\nBelieving Meetra Surik to be the last of the Jedi as well, the Republic Navy gave orders to a Republic warship to re-route from their expedition to Telos IV and collect Meetra Surik. Unfortunately as a result of Master Atris, the Republic vessel would fall into a trap laid by Darth Sion. The Republic vessel received a distress signal from an unknown freighter claiming to be under attack from a Sith warship, as per Republic Naval regulations the Republic warship went to investigate and found a relatively abandoned freighter, except for the body of Darth Sion. \n\nUnbeknownst to the Republic, Darth Sion had his cloaked Sith assassins board the Republic ship to find Meetra Surik. Kreia, formerly the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Traya, and one of the Jedi Masters responsible for teaching Revan, would find Meetra Surik as she knew it was a Sith trap and take her to the Ebon Hawk, which was also picked up by the Republic warship. \n\nJust prior to Kreia’s arrival Sith assassins began slaughtering the crew of the Republic vessel in an effort to find Meetra Surik. During this slaughter, a HK assassin droid would unfortunately drug Meetra Surik, causing her to pass out on the Ebon Hawk and lose much of her recent memory. The Sith would take control of the Republic vessel and fire on the fleeing Ebon Hawk, damaging it greatly. Despite this, the Ebon Hawk managed to flee to a mining facility over Peragus as a result of the protocol droid T3-M4’s efforts.\n\nWhen Meetra Surik awoke she would discover Kreia and an abandoned mining facility. According to the facilities logs there was infighting due to a galaxy wide bounty being placed on Jedi. The facility was occupied by Kreia, Meetra Surik, their eventual companion; Atton Rand and many hostile mining droids. The three had to escape as the Sith were hot on their heels.\n\n# Search\nMeetra Surik and her new companions would escape Peragus narrowly, having a run in with Darth Sion and many Sith assassins. After their escape they would make their way to Telos IV and while there, Kreia would explain much of what has happened in the galaxy. Despite Meetra Surik’s reluctance, Kreia made it clear they would need to prepare to battle the Sith, as they did not care about Meetra Surik’s lack of Force sensitivity or that she had been exiled. \n\nAfter discovering what had happened to the stolen Ebon Hawk and aiding many individuals on the Telos IV orbital station, the trio would make their way to Telos and reunite with an old Mandalorian Wars veteran, Bao-Durr, who had served personally with Meetra Surik during the war and was one of the engineers responsible for creating the Mass Shadow Generator, he was also the one who personally activated the device, under Meetra Surik’s orders.\n\n\nTogether, all four would make their way to a shuttle and renew their search for the Ebon Hawk. Unfortunately they would be tracked by numerous HK assassin droids who would shoot them down over Master Atris’ secret Academy. After dispatching the droids the individuals would be drugged and awake inside the Academy, having been captured by Atris’ handmaidens. While there, Meetra Surik would face one of her demons, Jedi Master Atris and the two would exchange a lengthy debate. \n\nReluctantly Master Atris understood the requirement for the Jedi High Council to be reunited, as some Masters still survived. If the galaxy wanted to defeat the new Sith threat, Meetra Surik would have to search for the surviving Jedi Masters and unite them. Atris would provide Surik the destinations of the Jedi Masters and send Surik on her way, providing her with the Ebon Hawk and sending a surviving Jedi Padawan, Mical, with the group. \n\nTogether, along with numerous other companions found along the way, Meetra Surik would find and eventually bring the surviving Jedi Masters together on the ruins of the Dantooine Enclave. Unfortunately though this was Kreia’s plan all along, she harboured disgust for the Jedi High Council for casting Meetra Surik aside and believed these Jedi to be weak. Revealing herself as Darth Traya she would put Meetra Surik into stasis and strip the Force from the Jedi Masters.\nKreia believed that the Jedi at the time were weak due to their dependence on the Force, she believed they needed it to survive and Meetra Surik’s survival without it is what made her strong, someone who could rise above the Force. Kreia, now known yet again as Darth Traya, would illustrate this by killing the Jedi Masters by utilizing the very same Force sever technique that Meetra Surik was capable of. The Masters would cling to the Force for survival, ultimately resulting in their deaths.\n\n# Betrayal\nDarth Traya would flee to Telos and corrupt Master Atris, leading her to fall to the Darkside. Meetra Surik would soon follow however and find the corrupted Jedi Master turned Sith Apprentice within her Academy, after a lengthy duel Meetra Surik would convince Master Atris of her wrong doings and forgive Atris for everything that had happened. Atris, having been so \nconvinced that she would be killed by the Exile for everything Atris had done to her and for falling to the Darkside was shocked, and renounced her Sith ways. Atris would inform Meetra about Traya fleeing to Malachor V to rebuild her Sith Academy. Meetra Surik would leave Atris in the hands of what would become the new Jedi Order to face judgement for her many failures and set out to confront the Sith Triumvirate.\n\nBy this stage Meetra Surik had trained most of her companions in the ways of the Jedi, with many of them being qualified Jedi Knights. She rallied the Republic as well as the surviving Mandalorian Clans on Dxun and took them to war against the Sith Triumvirate. They would begin with Darth Nihilus, the Republic fleet along with a Mandalorian strike force accompanied by Meetra Surik and her companions would attack Darth Nihilus’ flagship and essentially kill the Dark Lord. While not technically dead as the Dark Lord had imbued his presence in his mask and robes, he was at the very least defeated and no longer a threat. This would become known as the Battle of Telos IV and would result in the destruction of much of the Sith Triumvirate.\n\n# Return to Malachor V\nMeetra Surik would take the Ebon Hawk to Malachor V, the site of where she had originally lost her connection to the Force. Meetra Surik could feel the pain and suffering of the world, suffering she had caused. She could also feel the presence of the Sith Academy there, and her former mentor Darth Traya. The Ebon Hawk would crash on Malachor V and the crew would make their way to the Sith Academy. While there they would face dozens of Sith Lords, Sith Assassins and Dark Jedi, including Darth Sion. \n\nAfter numerous duels with Darth Sion, the Dark Lord admitted he could not best Meetra Surik and gave in to his feelings. All along Darth Sion felt some resemblance of love and respect for Meetra and this proved to be his weakness. Darth Sion only lived due to his pure hatred that kept his body together, when faced with Meetra Surik he began to feel other emotions that would result in his body malfunctioning. Meetra Surik convinced the Dark Lord to let go of his \nhatred and to give into the Force, Darth Sion would listen to Surik and after giving up on hatred, he would die. Having defeated most of the Sith Triumvirate including two of its leaders, Meetra Surik would make her way to the heart of Traya’s Academy to confront Darth Traya herself. \n\nMeetra Surik would find Darth Traya in the core of her Academy, awaiting Surik’s arrival. The two would engage in a swift duel, Surik would overpower Darth Traya and be forced to cut her remaining hand off, ending the Force bond that existed between the two and forcing Darth Traya to her knees. Darth Traya would ask Surik to kill her in typical Sith fashion, however to Darth Traya’s surprise Meetra Surik refused. Despite feeling somewhat honoured that Surik refused to kill her, Darth Traya felt more rage than anything and used the Force to re-animated three lightsabers that she would use to attack Surik with. This would force Surik to kill her old mentor, thus ending the Sith Triumvirate. Meetra Surik would then, as she did many years prior, order Bao-Durr to reactivate the Mass Shadow Generator once more, fully destroying Malachor V and ensuring that Traya’s Sith Academy could never be used again.\n\n# Part VII\nOnce again declared a hero of the Republic and this time the Jedi Order, Meetra Surik would set about retraining herself within the Enclave on Dantooine that was in the process of being rebuilt. Despite having saved the Republic and potentially every living thing in the galaxy from the Sith Triumvirate and especially Darth Nihilus, there were still surviving Jedi and Republic veterans that doubted Meetra Surik in the same way she was doubted after returning from the Mandalorian Wars. \n\nT3-M4, the loyal companion of Revan and now Meetra Surik revealed to Surik that he had information relating to the whereabouts of Revan but was adamant he could only show them to Bastila Shan, who had been in hiding until the revival of the Jedi Order. Meetra Surik took T3-M4 to meet Bastila Shan. The droid would reveal the information to the pair and most notably revealed that Revan had been captured by a member of the Sith species who were thought long extinct. Despite saving the Jedi Order, Meetra Surik no longer felt welcome there and decided to go to the aid of her old ally. Having Revan’s mask in hand which was supplied by Bastila Shan and her faithful companion T3-M4, Surik began her search once more.\n\nT3 and Meetra Surik would come across the world in T3’s message, Nathema. By the time they got there the world was entirely void of life, a feeling of emptiness would pour over Surik as not a single living thing existed on the planet. This was as a result of the Sith Emperor’s ability to feed and drain life in order to extend his own power and existence, much like Darth Nihilus. \n\nThe duo would find information relating to the Sith Empire. They had discovered that the Sith Empire was in search of Dromund Kaas and T3-M4’s splicing abilities allowed the pair to locate Dromund Kaas. The two were able to successfully land on the planet and made contact with Lord Scourge, the Sith Lord responsible for Revan’s capture. \n\nLord Scourge did not want to see the Sith Emperor invade the Republic for his own personal reasons and decided to aid Meetra Surik in freeing Revan and destroying the Sith Emperor. Together they managed to free Revan and return his mask, but had to defeat a Dark Council member on the way which resulted in Dromund Kaas being put into martial law. \n\nThe only option was to take on the Sith Emperor, Darth Vitiate. Together the three would attempt this, getting as far as the Emperor’s throne room and confronting him directly. Unfortunately for Meetra Surik and Revan, Lord Scourge would have a Force vision of their inevitable loss. Revan would be on his knees in pain after being electrocuted by Darth Vitiate and Meetra Surik chose to defend Revan, however Lord Scourge would turn on her, seeing this as an opportunity to gain the Emperor’s favour. \n\nLord Scourge would stab Meetra Surik in the back, killing her almost instantly. Revan would be recaptured and Lord Scourge would be declared the Emperor’s Wrath. Meetra Surik would not die entirely; instead, she would live on through the Force as a Force Ghost for many decades to come.\n\n# Part VIII\nAfter her death, Surik would ensure Revan’s survival once more by providing him with enough Force energy to remain alive through the Emperor’s torture. Surik would eventually help free Revan from the Emperor’s captivity by alerting the Jedi Order and Republic to his location. The Jedi Order would dispatch a fleet and strike Force to free Revan, successfully doing so. Meetra Surik would urge Revan to continue his fight against the Sith Emperor, to which Revan agreed. \n\nYears later the Sith Emperor would be confronted one last time, the Alliance Commander, Jedi Master Kira Carsen, Meetra Surik, Revan and even Lord Scourge would find and confront Darth Vitiate directly. With the combined might of hundreds of fallen Jedi and Sith, including Meetra Surik, the Alliance Commander and Revan would kill Darth Vitiate, putting an end to his reign and allowing Surik to finally be at one with the Force.\n\n# Personality and Abilities\nMeetra Surik was an exceptional Jedi and had a personality to mimic this. She was highly regarded by those above and below her as kind, generous and capable of accomplishing almost any task set before her. As a result of this she was able to form bonds in an unnatural nature, likely amplified by the Force. She was always looked to for guidance and seen as an example to be followed. This would serve her well as a General in the Mandalorian Wars and later when recruiting and training many of her companions as Jedi. \n\nShe was able to convince the remnants of the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders to go to war for her on behalf of the Republic, she was able to convince a Dark Lord of the Sith, consumed by hatred to let go and allow himself to die. She would also be capable of forming Force bonds, specifically the one created between herself and Kreia. \n\nMeetra Surik had a similar capability to that of Darth Nihilus. Whereas Darth Nihilus would feed to keep himself alive and sustain his power, Meetra Surik would kill and as a result she would become more powerful. She was not conscious of this however the Jedi Council was and feared her as a result. She was also able to learn abilities and skills simply by watching them happen, not only just learning them but mastering them. She would become an expert at many forms of lightsaber combat and develop a mastery of many Force skills simply by watching them happen. \n\nThough on top of all of this, Meetra Surik was a brilliant strategist and tactician. Hardened through many years of warfare and command experience, Meetra Surik had a tactical mind that could only be rivalled by the likes of Revan, this allowed her to forge alliances, oversee battles and eventually win the war against the Sith Triumvirate. Meetra Surik was exceptional in every way.\n\n","meta":{"index":17,"author":"Seko1111","name":"Meetra Surik","release_year":2021}},"Darth Dramath":{"content":"# Overview\nIt was Dramath, a male Sith Lord, who ruled the planet Medriaas in the years before the Great Hyperspace War. He belonged to the Old Sith Empire. The hedonistic and self-satisfied ruler of his own fief, Dramath brought about one of the greatest evils in galactic history when one of his many illegitimate children turned on him and condemned him.# Old Sith Wars\nThere is a legend that spread throughout the Sith Empire during the Old Sith Wars that described Lord Dramath as having had a son, Tenebrae, through marriage with one of his subjects, a poor farmer's wife. As soon as Dramath learned of Tenebrae's existence, he ordered the child’s mother to drown the Young Tenebrae, but his mistress secretly defied him and refused to dispose of the child. Tenebrae's stepfather attempted to attack Tenebrae's mother after realising the truth about his wife's affair with Dramath Here, the young Tenebrea would demonstrate his force sensitivity by killing his stepfather.  Eventually, the young Sith killed his mother after torturing her. Tenebrae was utterly ignored by Dramath ,despite the murders he had commited, until he reached the age of ten, wherehe confronted Tenebrae in order to decide whether or not to enslave or execute the boy. Tragically, Dramath discovered to his horror that Tenebrae had already surpassed him in power at this very moment. Dramath was killed by Tenebrae which marked the recognition of Tenebrae by Marka Ragnos who titled him “Vitiate of Medriaas”, for his first deed as the new ruler he renamed his home planet to “Nathema”. Several years after the Sith defeated the Jedi in the Great Hyperspace War, Vitiate performed a dark ritual, destroying all life on the planet now known as Nathema and rendering it unconnected to the Force. This also gave Dramath's illegitimate son the ability to become immortal. Eventually and quietly, Vitiate would create the Eternal Empire with himself as the Eternal Emperor Valkorion, and would go on to declare himself the Emperor of a revived Sith Empire. The only person who remembered Dramath was gone, and every record of the planet had been purged to ensure his dark deeds remained a secret. Nor could anyone have guessed that he wasn't entirely dead. Vitiate had actually kept the spirit of his father, the long deceased Dramath, inside a powerful holocron, and he tortured him mercilessly for a thousand years. The holocron was subsequently kept underground beneath a structure called the Sanitarium, the only stable and hospitable structure on Nathema. With the passing of the centuries, it was in a twisted sense that Dramath had become the closest thing Vitiate had to a friend, despite the circumstances regarding the pair.\n\n# Encountering the Outlander\nEventually, Lana Beniko, the Outlander, and the Anomid scientist Jarak opened Valkorion's vault in 3630 BBY to escape from a death fog that Vaylin, the daughter of Valkorion, unleashed while attempting to undo the damage Valkorion had done to her mind. As a result of the Investigation, the Outlander released Dramath, who, when asked to relate his encounter with Valkorion to the Outlander and Beniko, explained what had happened. As the pair approached him he told them to take the holocron, saying it would help destroy Valkorion and asked to be freed from his torment.\n\n","meta":{"index":51,"author":"2lu0","name":"Darth Dramath","release_year":2022}},"Ganner Rhysode":{"content":"# Introduction\nGanner Rhysode was a Jedi Knight and member of the New Jedi Order, whose sole wish throughout his life was to be a hero, and his confidence was proof of that. He was one of the main figures during the Yuuzhan Vong War. He suffered an injury during Yuuzhan Vong's invasion of the galaxy and a scar was left as a reminder for him to stay humble. Ganner was tasked with finding Jacen Solo, who he managed to help escape by sacrificing himself. He became one with the Force and held off hundreds to let Solo escape. According to Solo’s Master vision, Ganner died a legend becoming a figure known as The Ganner.# Biography\nGanner Rhysode, born Force-sensitive, was recruited to attend the Jedi Temple on Yavin 4 and there he developed his skill. He was considered a promising Jedi Knight and was attracted to Jedi Master Kyp Durron, who believed in using the Force to fight injustice. He saw himself as a leader of a new generation of Jedi Knights who would deliver justice without being restricted by the old Jedi code. The sudden appearance of the Yuuzhan Vong in 25 ABY provided an opportunity for Rhysode to press war against the invaders. Rhysode was present at the reunion Skywalker called on Yavin 4 to address the threat and discuss the need for an organized response.\n\nSkywalker assigns Rhysode to investigate a case in Bimmiel, an uninhabited world in the Yuuzhan Vong territory. There they discover the remains of a fifty-year-old Yuuzhan Vong. After a week of storms, Rhysode and Horn go on a scouting mission to recover the remains and they find a Yuuzhan Vong camp. The students analyze beetles from the Yuuzhan Vong site and discover that one produces synthetic stink and another produces carbon dioxide. Rhysode and Horn decide to eliminate the Yuuzhan Vong themselves in combat and form a plan to free the students while others extract them and lace the camp with the virus and synthetic kill scent. Horn and Rhysode distract the two warriors and Horn uses his ability to project feelings. Horn, injured, offers to stay behind while Rhysode uses telekinesis to float the students out. Instead, Orlanis shoots the top of the grashal while he levitates Horn out and safely escapes with the entire team.\n\nAfter returning to the Jedi, Rhysode, and Horn were assigned to infiltrate Garqi with six Noghri commandos and two civilians. They prepared for the mission and launched from Ralroost aboard Lost Hope. During the battle, the Lost Hope suffered an engine explosion, allowing the concealed shuttle Best Chance to escape. Rhysode had to use the Force to set off damaged charges, helping separate the Best Chance from its shell. They landed safely and spent a week scouting and making their way across the land. Horn proposed capturing some slaves to understand the Vong's actions. They drove the Yuuzhan Vong back, allowing them to escape with a few captives. They headed to the Pesktda Xenobotanical Garden. The Yuuzhan Vong arrived and ordered them to surrender. Rhysode challenged their leader, but the battle ended swiftly. Horn burned the garden, preserving the valuable knowledge, and they made their way back to the Best Chance in time for its liftoff.\n\nIn 27 ABY, the Yuuzhan Vong unleashed voxyn creatures, prompting Rhysode to study them. Cilghal learned that the voxyn were coming from Myrkr, where they were cloned from a queen. Anakin Solo suggested a group of young Jedi Knights be turned over to the Yuuzhan Vong, who would carry them behind enemy lines. Master Skywalker suggested he lead the team. They captured the YVH droids and secured the ship, capturing Rhysode. They found the worldship Baanu Rass orbiting it, but Anakin Solo sensed Jedi aboard it. They were ambushed by a cruiser, and Rhysode fired a baradium missile at the cruiser. They made an emergency landing on the surface, while Kore piloted the Exquisite Death away as a decoy. They withdrew through the training warren, where the voxyn were trained to hunt Jedi. The team fought through the training warren, battling against the Yuuzhan Vong's slaves and voxyn. They eventually escaped the warren, but were ambushed by the voxyn. Rhysode helped hold the passage, but Besa and Drark were killed, and Anakin Solo was badly wounded.  The voxyn queen escaped, and Anakin Solo gave himself over to the Force. They withdrew and had Sebatyne track the queen while they holed up. They were interrupted by Anor and Vergere, who offered to guide them to the escaping voxyn queen. Solo killed the queen near Jaina's crashed ship, while the others captured the frigate Ksstarr. Jacen was captured, and Rhysode had to flee with the survivors of the team.\n\nRhysode attended Anakin Solo's funeral and joined Han and Leia Organa Solo in the Millennium Falcon for the Jedi base at Eclipse. They eventually traveled to Borleias, where General Wedge Antilles led the world's defense with the Skywalkers. \n\nRhysode heard a rumor that Jacen Solo was alive on Coruscant. He shares this with Jaina Solo, who dismisses it as nonsense. Rhysode pursues the rumor, eventually arriving on a refugee ship over Bothawui. He enters a room where he is tricked into believing he is a Jedi in alliance with the Yuuzhan Vong. The man, disguised as Yuuzhan Vong, reveals himself as Jacen Solo and renders Rhysode unconscious. Rhysode is brought back to Coruscant with Solo, where he is held in a state of semi-consciousness, hearing Solo, Anor, and Vergere discuss sacrificing him. He is awakened by Solo, who praises the Yuuzhan Vong gods and explains that he was not a traitor. Rhysode is unsure of his trustworthiness, but Solo insists that his death inside the Well could be meaningful. Rhysode, confused and terrified, is led to the site of the sacrifice and confronts Solo for his weakness and failure to be a hero. After being picked up by the Force, Rhysode escapes through secret tunnels used by senators. He decides to use his lifelong dream of being a hero and holds back the Yuuzhan Vong to give Solo time with the World Brain. Rhysode challenges the Yuuzhan Vong in single combat, defeating them in large groups. He eventually remembers his desire to act as a hero and destroys the senate dome and tank beast with infantry support.\n\n# Legacy\nGanner's last stand made it possible for Solo to flee the planet and escape the Yuuzhan Vong army. This sacrifice was later proved to be essential during the war as Solo, later killed the leader behind Yuuzhan Vong and made them leave Coruscant intact. Ganner’s sacrifice was made a myth even by Yuuzhan Vong, ”an invincible Jedi giant called the Ganner who guarded the gate to the land of the dead, keeping the dead from leaving to harm the living” and was named a liberator for the shamed ones as part of the Jeedai heresy. His sacrifice was not only remembered by Yuuzhan Vong. He had the highest kill count in the war and the Jedi named the conference room in Ossus and a squadron after his name.\n\n# Personality and traits\nRhysode was confident from a very young age, even more after becoming a Jedi and an Adult. His expertise in the Force and his good looks made this confidence rise even higher. Since childhood, he always wanted to be a hero and impress others with his power. When he became a Jedi, he saw himself as a member of a less restricted newer Jedi generation that was capable of giving justice to those that needed it. He was also known to be very flirtatious but the truth was he did this to lie about his true feelings. His arrogance and confidence were struck after a certain mission during the Yuuzhan Vong War, where he suffered an injury that left him scarred. From that point on he started respecting his fellow peers, not underestimating his opponents, and accepting there are better Jedi than him. Ganner eventually decided to change his appearance as proof of his change, now letting his beard grow and becoming a true adult.\n\n# Powers and abilities\nGanner had a natural connection with the Force and his unknown usage of it during his youth made him have a very casual approach to it. His expertise lay in telekinesis and mind tricks however he was also capable of using the Force as a shield or to make a controllable bubble around him.

He was responsible for the death of the last of Palpatine's clones and creating a route to the throne, the elimination of the last Dark Side Prophets on Bosthirda was carried out by Jax and Lumiya and he was also in charge of the Royal Guard's demise. All but one of them were put to death. The sole survivor, Kir Kanos, would later be his executioner. His death left Lumiya without an apprentice for 30 years and with immense pain and suffering.# Biography\nDuring his youth, Jax served in the Galactic Empire as a stormtrooper and even worked as one of Agent Blackhole's referred to as Blackhole stormtroopers.\nJax distinguished himself as one of the finest in his squad, and it didn't take long for this to be noticed. Jax was then taken from his unit and sent to get prepared to be a Royal Guard. Jax underwent rigorous training that included learning the lethal combat technique known as Echani. Jax and the other candidates would put their mettle to the test in the Squall, an arena, under the careful eye of Master Ved Kennede. It was here where Jax first met Kir Kanos, and would often spar eachother with Jax as the winner. Jax and Kanos were top students in their class, but Burr Danid was more highly regarded for his flawless fighting style and unequaled talent. \nThe young man was brutally murdered by Vader in front of the whole group of trainees. Although Jax had anticipated this to happen.After spending a year together, Kir Kanos, Lemmet Tauk, Jax, and Frost were taken to Master Kennede, who told them that only one more exam remained and it would be a duel to death. Frost was swiftly killed by Jax in an unilateral battle. As the last two reached the Emperor's apartments, his dead corpse was hidden from view. Jax was permitted to observe Tauk and Kanos go through the identical test that he had just finished.\nBoth Kanos and Jax were promoted to the rank of Royal Guard. Jax's following duty in the Royal Guard is unclear, although it is presumed that he did a commendable job protecting the Emperor. However, during the entirety of Jax's time in the Empire, his allegiances were to himself and his prospects for ascending to a position of greater authority rather than Palpatine. Jax's battalion was the one sent to the Dark Lady Lumiya when she asked Isard to send a division of the Royal Guard. Jax was being trained as Lumiya's Sith apprentice when she first noticed the Force potential in him. Jax honed his telekinesis and precognition skills while receiving his training in the Force. Jax began to interact with many of the influential figures in Imperial politics within Lumiya's circle. He met Quest, a clever political swindler who had spent some time gaining a quiet majority on the Council. The two Force-users advanced together to seize control of the Empire. Quest provided Jax with a task force headed by the Star Destroyers Emperor's Revenge and Steadfast as well as a military unit commanded by General Redd Wessel by using his clout with the Ruling Council. Jax also appointed Lieutenant Geff Blim to be his \"hand\" at this time, remembering the assistance Mara Jade had given Palpatine. He met with Nom Anor at this period and subsequently told Lumiya about the odd agent.However, the relationship between this agent and Lumiya was broken when Jax was slain. Jax returned to the Royal Guard after Palpatine regained power of the Empire in 10 ABY, although his true allegiances belonged to his previous comrades. Jax was aware that his confrontation with the Emperor was about to occur. Jax managed to entirely remove himself from the Royal Guard's database and any future duties. By paying off the Emperor's doctor to sabotage Palpatine's surviving clones. Palpatine's final clone body accelerated in age and altered due to the sabotage, indicating his demise. To eliminate the last of the Royal Guards, Jax dispatched an army of stormtroopers. Jax was furious because one Royal Guard, Jax's nemesis Kir Kanos, managed to escape the massacre. Jax made the decision to postpone his aspirations for galactic hegemony until Kanos had been found and killed. In the end, Kanos struck Jax in the chest with his weapon. Kanos took off Jax's helmet and informed the deceased Jax that he was unable to wear it. As Kanos departed the barren planet, Jax's lifeless body was still lying still in the middle of the Squall, where it all had started.\n\n# Personality and traits\nCarnor possessed an insatiable ambition and during his training his sole goal was to be the best in the class. This said, he was aware of his limitations and the importance of having influential partnerships. His master’s are testimony of this. This insatiable ambition made him very capable of recognizing possible menaces, a quality that would later be seen when he was the only one who understood Kir Kanos true danger. This ambition came with a consequence for his subordinates. They were expected to do everything with perfection and the minimal error would not be tolerated.\n\n# Powers and abilities\nDuring his time as an stormtrooper he surpassed the best of the best making him rightful to train to become a Royal Guard. During his training, he demonstrated mastery in martial arts and the usage of vibroblades, which would eventually lead him to become one of the Emperor’s bodyguards. Telekinesis and force sense ability, the two unique abilities he earned after training in the force under Lumiya’s wing. He had extreme control over diverse objects with his telekinesis and could detect lies with his force sense ability. He was considered to be on par with Lord Vader and Darth Sidious.\n\n","meta":{"index":146,"author":"Craked10","name":"Carnor Jax","release_year":2023}},"Lord Grathan":{"content":"# Introduction\nLord Grathan was a human male who lived in prominence during the Cold War between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. His base of operations was on Dromund Kaas where he owned a large estate that housed his personal quarters and a prominent underground laboratory and research network, where he would practice his craft. Grathan made his mark on galactic history when he rebelled against the Sith Empire and declared himself the thirteenth member of the Dark Council given his vast Powerbase. This claim would be dismissed by the Council which would declare open war on Grathan and his followers.\n\nAfter such a declaration Grathan fled the Citadel on Drommund Kaas and took up permanent residence within his Estate deep in the jungles of Dromund Kaas, bringing with him his private army and scientific personnel. At this facility, Grathan would have his personnel mass produce war droids and cybernetic soldiers under his supervision, to ensure that any chance of open warfare from the Dark Council would be impossible.# Prominence & Downfall\nDespite Grathan’s tight defenses and an impenetrable fortress being his estate, he was not untouchable by any means. Grathan’s security was tested when the Order of Revan broke into his estate and stole from him the Mask of Revan which he had stored in his most secure vault. Despite such embarrassment, this did nothing to quell Grathan’s bravado and so he was entirely unprepared when Darth Baras wished to deal a blow to him by striking down Grathan’s family. Baras dispatched his apprentice for such a task which would prove successful with both Lady Grathan and their son Beelzit lying dead. Having been crippled by this loss, Grathan would live the rest of his life in obscurity on Drommund Kaas.\n\n# Abilities and Legacy\nGrathan was skilled in various aspects of the force, enough to earn him the loyalty of his large powerbase. Upon this Grathan was well vested in the arts of a Sith Warrior able to use a series of telekinetic attacks as well as an unbreakable defense granted by not only his skill with his purple bladed saber but by his sheer force of will which by calling on the Dark Side of the Force allowed him to bolster himself to endure unimaginable pain. \n\nDespite Grathan’s focus on the Warrior school of combat, he also had a keen interest in supplementary abilities and practices. For one, Grathan had a keen interest in cybernetic enhancements and with his scientists enhanced his own soldiers and even himself, leading to his infamous cybernetic suit and mask which contributed to his combat capabilities as much as they do in instilling fear into an enemy. This interest led to Grathan’s most dubious ability, with the assistance of his scientists, Grathan was able to perform a technique where they would graft a human mind into that of a droid, leaving behind a horrid abomination of a soldier. This ability was the perfect culmination of Grathan’s cybernetic ambition and his power in the Dark Side.\n\n","meta":{"index":40,"author":"ard1974","name":"Lord Grathan","release_year":2022}},"Darth Hadra":{"content":"# Overview\nDarth Hadra was a female Human Dark Lord of the Sith of the reconstituted Sith Empire who served as a member of the Dark Council during the Cold War.# History\nDarth Hadra had murdered her opponents and enemies to achieve her position.

He was personally selected by Asajj Ventress to become her servant following her severe test selection. Mother Talzin and her Nightsister enchantresses used their dark magic to bestow Opress with frightening abilities, placing him underneath their rule. After learning from Dooku, Opress was dispatched to Toydaria to capture King Katuunko and persuade him to join the Separatists. During a fight to stop Opress, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker were encountered by Opress and his former master Ventress. After striking Opress with Force lightning until the apprentice implored his master for mercy, Ventress told herself as his master's betrayer and tried to kill him. Opress fled and returned to Mother Talzin, who informed him he had another brother who could aid him. Opress journeyed across the galaxy looking for his brother, Maul, who was overpowered by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Opress became Maul's apprentice, and jointly, the brothers hatched a plot to bring Kenobi out into the open and slaughter him. After bringing Maul back to Talzin, she cast magic on him and mended his mind and body. Transmitting a message to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, the brothers threatened to kill an entire village on the planet if Kenobi didn't come to encounter Maul. Deeming Maul would kill the entire village just to get to him, Kenobi went to protect the people and stop Maul. Once there, Maul, with his brother, whom Kenobi was oblivious was related to the situation ambushed him, seized him, and imprisoned him.\nOnboard the vessel, Maul prepared to torture Kenobi to death and would have had it not been for Asajj Ventress. Dooku's former apprentice turned into a bounty hunter and tracked Opress to Raydonia to calm the million credit reward on him for the disorder he caused at plot Dribble's diner at the spaceport on Stobar. After rescuing Kenobi, Ventress and the battered Jedi master battled Opress and Maul, barely fleeing with their lives. After the failed try on Kenobi's life, Opress wreaked devastation across the galaxy with his brother, accumulating a mass fortune. The brothers attracted a band of pirates to their ship and persuaded them to join forces with them. After joining the brothers, the pirates attacked their old leader, Hondo Ohnaka. Following the brothers from one of their recent incidents, Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Adi Gallia joined forces with Ohnaka. The two Jedi encountered the brothers while Ohnaka dealt with his traitorous crew. During the duration of the duel, Opress killed Gallia, leaving Kenobi to confront the two brothers alone. Kenobi directed the brothers away from the pirates, so Ohnaka could deal with his men. Kenobi dueled the two brothers. Ostensibly beaten, Kenobi maneuvered during the duel, causing Maul to cut off his brother's arm. Defeated, the two fled from the Jedi and the reunified pirates. Fleeing in their ship, the pirates shot it down, forcing the brothers to utilize the escape pod and leave the riches to the pirates. Close to death, drifting through space in their escape pod, the two brothers were rescued by Pre Vizsla and the Death Watch. Recognizing that each side could be useful to the other, Vizsla, Maul and Opress decided to join forces to eliminate mutual enemies: Dooku and Kenobi. However, each side intended to betray the other. \nJointly with Vizsla, the brothers created the Shadow Collective, an organization consisting of several large crime families, including Black Sun, the Pyke Syndicate, and the Hutt clan. Operating their combined resources, the Shadow Collective bombarded Mandalore. The Mandalorian authorities were incapable to stand against such a force. Pre-Vizsla and Death Watch came to stop the assault, as a result, Vizsla and his Death Watch were seen as Mandalore's heroes. Ultimately displaying his true colors, Vizsla had the brothers arrested, assumed total control of Mandalore, and dissolved the Shadow Collective. Escaping from prison, Opress pursued Maul, who challenged Vizsla to single combat and won. The two brothers seized authority of Mandalore and a fragment of Vizsla's soldiers. those who remained loyal to their deceased leader revolted. Feeling his former apprentice's power growing, Darth Sidious journeyed to Mandalore. Endeavoring to hold on to their power, the two brothers dueled the Sith Lord. During the fight, Maul was knocked out, leaving Opress to duel the Sith Master alone. Not capable to stand up against the superior foe, Opress was slaughtered. Dying, the magic of Mother Talzin exited him, transforming him into his previous physical form. After Opress' death, Maul tried to duel Sidious alone and failed.

Before rising to Empress she was a part of the Dark Council and served as overlord of the Sphere of Technology. As Empress, she started a war against the powerful Eternal Empire of Zakuul. Afterward, Zakuul was overthrown and the Empress died from the powerful weapon known as the Lokath superweapon. This was an unfortunate death considering she was trying to claim that superweapon for her Empire. With the death of Acina, there had to be a new Emperor and this was the Sith Lord, Darth Vowarawn. Vowrawn ran the Empire a little while after Acina’s death until he met his ends. Darth Acina, in her early years, trained on the Sith planet of Korriban. She rose through the ranks extremely fast and became Dark Lord of the Sith following the death of Darth Karrid. She also became the Overlord of the Sphere of Technology and was tasked with overlooking an important technology warehouse called the Arcanum. One of Acina’s apprentices had an allegiance with the Dread Masters and they started an offensive raid on the protected Arcanum. The Dread Masters stole many important and powerful artefacts; such as the Darkstaff and the Seeds of Rage. Acina sent Imperial troops to reclaim the Seeds of Rage and they were successful.# Reign of the Empress\nBefore she was Empress, Acina was a Dark Council member and Dark Lord of the Sith. She ruled the Empire for five years and many supported her reign. Acina allied with the Eternal Emperor, Arcann, but after he died she saw an opportunity to make her Empire more powerful. Acina decided that she needed to defeat Arcann’s notorious sister, Vaylin. Vaylin sent her new Eternal Fleet to invade the planet Voss and stage an attack on the Empress. The Empress sent her Imperial fleet to support the Alliance and luckily for the Empress, her fleet arrived at a reasonable time and managed to scare off the Eternal Fleet. After her success, the Empress called the Alliance Commanders to Dromund Kaas to negotiate an agreement. She sent Gelmid Lorman, the Logistics Minister, to escort the Alliance. The Alliance brought their advisers with them, Theron Shan and Lana Beniko, and the Empress decided it would be wise to allow the Commander to board her shuttle and negotiate there. The Empress assured her guests that she had no intentions of claiming the Eternal Throne. During their conversations, the Empress’ shuttle’s engine failed and they were forced to escape the shuttle into the dangerous wilderness of Dromund Kaas. Surviving the harsh weather of the wild, the Empress discovered they were sabotaged by the legendary assassins, GenoHaradan, who she thought to be a myth. The team was hired to assassinate them by orders of Leontyne Saresh, who was a former Chancellor of the Republic. The pair were being attacked and were forced to move into the closest shelter, which was a Sith tomb. They continued to travel inside the tomb and found Lorman waiting there. Lorman was the one behind the sabotage and the strike team that forced them into the tomb. Acina handed Lorman over to the Commander and the Commander returned to the headquarters on Odessen to discuss the fate of Saresh. Acina decided it would be necessary to continue with the alliance. Before all of this, Lorman imprisoned an Imperial Officer by the name of Malavai Quinn who, after the alliance was formed, became the advisor of Acina. After the defeat of Vaylin, the Eternal Throne was empty and so the Alliance decided to revert it to the old ways where the GEMINI captains programmed and controlled the Eternal Fleet. With the Alliance in control of the Eternal Empire, Acina had to be ready for anything and prepared for the possible war against the new Eternal Alliance. After receiving an anonymous call that informed the Empire of a powerful superweapon on the planet Lokath, Acina sent her Imperial forces to claim the recently rediscovered superweapon. The Imperials found out the Republic and Eternal Alliance were after the same thing after encountering them. Acina sent Major Quinn to negotiate with the Eternal Alliance to defeat the Republic forces led by Supreme Commander Jace Malcolm.\n\n# Personality and abilities\nDarth Acina was a powerful Sith, who struggled to gain the title of Dark Council. Acina was said to talk in a confusing way, where she made everyone who talked to her think she was playing a guessing game with them. Following the death of the well-known Darth Marr, she wanted to rebuild the Sith Empire. The Sith space was attacked many times by the Eternal Empire and eventually, Acina was the last Dark Councillor left. Acina, for the first time, had lots of support from her people when she became Empress and many called her the “wisest of all Sith” because of the methods she used as Empress. Acina didn’t sleep much, she usually practised her lightsaber skills and eventually took up horticulture as a hobby. Acina only ever drank water that was purified from Dromund Kaas. She was a ruthless Sith Lord and when she was betrayed by Minister Lorman she wanted to execute him, but she also wanted to keep her alliance with the Commander so that they could defeat the Eternal Empire. Obviously, with her technical skills, Acina was head of the Sphere of Technology and was interested in things like cybernetics. Her peers relied upon these skills, however, she never risked her life to get these for she didn’t want to suffer any injuries. Darth Acina was a talented duellist and pilot. She could use associated jargon in a dangerous situation. Acina used to demure Darth Marr’s strategies as leader of the Dark Council. Acina was a powerful force-wielder and used a double-bladed purple lightsaber in battles. However, when she took the title Empress, she laminated the lightsaber for she rarely used it afterward. Acina was a talented Sith Lord, who was adored by her people as Emperor and belittled by Sith before joining the Dark Council and becoming popular.

Having previously worked as an assassin for the Galactic Empire during the early days of the Galactic Civil War, a rebellion that lasted from 4 BBY to 5 ABY that resulted in the defeat and disbanding of the Galactic Empire. Devian was also known to be the personal hitman of the late Emperor Palpatine, Ennix having been trained by none other than Darth Vader himself. Following the Empire’s collapse, under the rule of Carnor Jax and the Imperial Interim Ruling Council, Devian sought to reform the Imperial Remnant, who at this time were losing to the New Republic, with the same vision that the late Emperor Palpatine had for his Empire during his reign. \n\nDevian established his faction the Restored Empire, as a rogue third faction and contender in the ongoing conflict between the Remnant and Republic. Amassing a military force composed of renegade Imperial officers and soldiers, including the forces of one General Vota, along with some discarded hardware of the Galactic Republic discovered on the barren world of RZ7-6113-23, where Devian had made his base of operations upon. Devian had devised a plan to bring about the destruction of both the Remnant and Republic with the use of a volatile and explosive substance known as Zinethium, planning large scale terror attacks on the galactic capital of Coruscant to coerce the two factions into continuing the conflict, with the hope of the two obliterating each other.\n\nIn order to plant the Zinethium on Coruscant, Devian had offered Kir Kanos, a former member of the Emperor’s Royal Guard, the chance to join the Restored Empire. However, Kanos’ conflicting sense of honor, due to his views of Devian’s often extreme tactics, prevented him from accepting Devian’s offer, but Devian had foresaw something like this happening and had let Kanos escape, knowing he would go to Coruscant to warn the New Republic. Devian had planted the Zinethium in the shuttle that Kanos had stolen beforehand, however, the plan had failed due to the intervention of the Jedi Master, Luke Skywalker, of the New Jedi Order and the forces of the New Republic discovering Devians base on RZ7-6113-23, forcing him to abandon the base and to accelerate his plans. \n\nDevian, in accordance with his plans, had sabotaged peace talks between the Imperial Remnant and the New Republic, which resulted in the death of a wealthy Imperial leaning Barons daughter, Feena D’Asta the daughter of Ragez D’Asta. Framing the attack on the New Republic, Devian launched a full-scale assault on the Imperial capital of Orinda, which was left undefended as Imperial forces engaged in a retaliatory strike against the Republic on Coruscant. When the Imperial fleet, commanded by Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, was able to regroup at Orinda, Devian was able to capture the admiral and attempted to force him to surrender, however, Devians plans had collapsed when the fleets of the D’Asta family arrived to help reinforce their Imperial allies. The Baron, Ragez D’Asta, was informed of Devians involvement in his daughter’s death by Kir Kanos. In the chaos of the battle, Devian fought Kir Kanos in one-on-one melee combat, to which Devian lost the duel and was slain by Kir Kanos.# Biography\nEnnix Devian was a Male Human that grew up in the alien slums of the planet Abregado-rae, before the times of the Galactic Empire. When Devian grew up, he would join the Commission for the Protection of the Republic, which would later become COMPNOR, the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order. Devian would later enter into the Imperial Security Bureau, where his talents had come under the scrutiny of Emperor Palpatine himself.\n\nDevain had come to be known within Imperial circles as a talented assassin during the Galactic Civil War, working directly under the Galactic Emperor, and Dark Lord of the Sith, Palpatine. Palpatine’s apprentice and enforcer, Darth Vader, had selected Devian to be trained in deadly duels usually against darksiders, such as Antinnis Tremayne. Inone duel, within the arena known as The Squall, Devain was able to kill his competitors, but had lost his right eye to the Dark Lord, which he had quickly replaced with a cybernetic eye. \n\nAs an additional reward for surviving The Squall, Darth Vader also gave Devian a prominent scar of his left arm. Devians last test was to survive alone on the planet of Honoghr while being hunted by a party of Noghri Death Commandos. When Ennix Devian had passed, he became the personal hitman of Emperor Palpatine, being given the nickname of Palpatine’s Kaarenth Impaler and being known to the Imperial Court.\n\nFollowing the formation of the Imperial Remnant, the remains of the Galactic Empire after their defeat at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Devian had become dissatisfied with the leadership of the Imperial Ruling Council, under both Xandel Carivus and Carnor Jax. Following the splintering of the Imperial Ruling Council, Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon had taken the reins of the Remnant. Many Imperials, including Devian, thought of Gilad as a disgrace to the Imperial name and Devian felt that the Imperials had to embrace their old roots again. As such, Devian had proclaimed himself as the Supreme Commander of a splinter faction, the Restored Empire, in 13 ABY. Supreme Commander Devian’s charisma and conservative Imperial views allowed him to attract many followers within the Imperial Remnant, including that of General Vota and his forces. \n\nAfter Devian’s spy network, which included Zam Basdor, a dignitary of Pellaeon and a member of his inner circle, uncovered plans to sign a peace treaty in order to officially end the Galactic Civil War between the Imperial Remnant and New Republic, Devian launched into action, organizing a complex plot to destroy both factions. Supreme Commander Devian made his base of operations on the barren planet of RZ7-6113-23 within the Chopani Sector, which had a large storage of discarded Clone War Era military hardware. Using the resources found within the base, Devian was able to amass a fleet of Venator-Class Star Destroyers and Acclamator-Class Assault Ships. By Devian’s order, the New Republic frigate, named the Endor, was destroyed by the planetary cannon on RZ7-6113-23 when it was investigating the Chopani Sector.\n\nPhase One of Devian’s plan was to send a group of assassins to kill the Solo family within the Imperial Palace on Coruscant, while Phase Two of the plan was to damage New Republic and Imperial Remnant relations through sabotaging peace talks by launching a series of terror attacks on Coruscant. In order to improve his men’s morale and improve the legitimacy of his cause, Devian hired the famed bounty hunter, Boba Fett, to track down the former Imperial Royal Guardsman, Kir Kanos, who Devian had described as both the living artifact and embodiment of the late Emperor Palpitine’s ideals, however, this was only a means to his true goal. While Devian had hired Fett to retrieve Kanos to bring back to the headquarters of the Restored Empire, Devian’s benefactor, Nom Anor, hired a group of thieves to infiltrate a Class-3 toxic weapons dump on the planet Nyara, in order to retrieve chunks of a substance known as Zinethium.\n\nDevian wanted to use this volatile and explosive substance to destroy the Imperial Palace on Coruscant and to eliminate the entire New Republic government. He had planned on using Kir Kanos to plant the substance, since Devian knew that Kanos would reject his offer to join him and would immediately attempt to turn himself over to New Republic custody in order to save the person Kanos loved, Mirith Sinn. However, after Phase One of the plan had failed, Devian had brushed off the setback and proceeded with Phase Two of the plan. \n\nBoba Fett had successfully retrieved Kir Kanos and brought him to the Empires headquarters, where Devian presented Kanos with the traditional Imperial Royal Guard uniform and acquainted him with his ideals over a dinner Devian hosted in his honor. Kanos, however, viewed Devian as nothing more than a dishonorable thug, an opinion which was reinforced by Devian slaying his own soldier, Lonkin, in order to prove his worth in combat. \n\nDevian then proceeded to explain to Kranos his plot to destroy Coruscant with Zinethium and as expected the guardsmen refused his offer to join. Devian would have him imprisoned to help him rethink his decision before being forced to execute him, which Devian did to create an illusion for Kir Kanos, but while Kanos was in a cell, Devian planted the Zinethium on a prepared shuttle he expected Kanos would use to flee off-world. Kanos was able to escape from his cell, using an improvised explosive from a blaster he was able to secretly take off of Devian during their conversation, kill some of Devian’s stormtroopers, which Devian sacrificed in order to maintain the illusion that Kanos was really freeing himself, and took the shuttle to depart immediately for Coruscant to warn the New Republic, all according to Devian’s plans.\n\nThe attempted Zinethium attack on Coruscant was stopped, however, by the Jedi Master of the New Jedi Order, Luke Skywalker, who flew the shuttle into orbit before the Zinethium could detonate. Soon after Kanos’ “escape”, a New Republic warship, under the command of Captain Lar Ndigo, was detected entering the Chopani system, which was investigating the earlier disappearance of the frigate, the Endor. \n\nDue to this unforeseeable event, Devian was forced to abandon his base of operations and had a squadron of starfighters engage Republic forces. The ship's crew was able to raise their shield in time before the planetary cannon could fully charge its shot and were also able to scramble out starfighters of their own. The warship was able to land a direct shot on the planetary cannon before it could fully charge its second shot, after which ground forces were sent to the planet's surface to investigate, however, this was all a distraction planned out by Devian and Vota so they could evacuate their navy and forces from the system and rigged the base to explode, killing the Republic ground forces inside the base.           \n\nMeanwhile, a peace summit between the New Republic and Imperial Remnant was being held, with the goal of signing a peace treaty, with Feena D’Asta, the daughter of Baron Ragez D’Asta, Mirth Sinn, and Kir Kanos attending the summit. This didn’t last long, however, as Devian’s stormtroopers were able to raid the summit, successfully preventing the signing of the treaty, but during the assault Feena D’Asta was killed, as with all the stormtroopers, by Kir Kanos’ hand. \n\nUpon investigation of the stormtroopers corpses, Kanos had discovered the emblem of the Restored Empire tattooed on the attackers wrists, which prompted Kanos to immediately contact Republic command on Coruscant to explain Devian’s role in the attack. While the Republic decided to investigate Devians role in this, Grand Admiral Pellaeon, unaware of the Restored Empires existence at this time, felt that the Republic was involved and launched a retaliatory assault on Coruscant in order to maintain Ragez D’Asta’s loyalty to the Imperial cause. This left the remnant capital of Orinda practically undefended, allowing Devian to move his fleet in for an assault on the planet. \n\nDevian’s assault on Orinda was promptly stalled, however, by the sudden arrival of Pellaeon’s fleet, who had reversed course from Coruscant after receiving word of Devian’s assault. Devian and his forces were able to board Pellaeon’s flagship and killed off his personal guard, forcing him into a surrender, but Devian offered the Grand Admiral a chance to join the Restored Empire by abandoning his plans of peace with the New Republic and helping with the reconstruction of a stronger Galactic Empire. Devian also showed the Grand Admiral that Zam Basdor was a traitor within his ranks, who was promptly shot by the enraged admiral. The admiral was seized by Devian’s order and was thanked by Devian for tying up a loose end, Pellaeon responded to Devian by offering him a chance of surrendering to him, which the Supreme Commander laughed off, however, Pellaeon revealed that reinforcements, in the form of Baron Ragez D’Asta fleet, had arrived in the sector and were destroying Devian’s fleet as they spoke.\n\nThe Baron arrived on Pellaeon’s flagship with Kir Kanos, Mirith Sinn, and a force of stormtroopers by his side. Ragez D’Asta revealed that he had three fleets waiting behind the moon of Orinda, catching the forces of the Restored Empire by surprise. The Baron acquainted Devian with a clone of his daughter, which he had grown during the days of the Imperial Ruling Council, passing her off as the original, he explained to Devian that the attempt made on his daughter's life had failed and attempted to force him into surrendering. In the ensuing confusion, General Vota attempted to execute Gilad Pellaeon, but was gunned down by Mirith Sinn before he could. A massive firefight then broke out and during the fight, Devian attempted to execute the admiral as well, but was disarmed by Sinn. Being outnumbered and in a losing battle, Devian attempted to flee in a Lambda-Class shuttle, but was confronted by Kanos who was wearing the Royal Guard uniform Devian had given him during their initial meeting.\n\nKanos swore death to the Supreme Commander. Devian ordered a group of stormtroopers to kill the guardsman, as he was only one man, but Kanos easily dispatched them with a blaster rifle. Devian realized then that it would be more honorable to have a duel to the death with Kanos and unsheathed his vibro-lance for a final battle. Kanos managed to cut Devian’s vicro-lance in two and knock him unconscious with a kick to his face, however, Devian was able to regain consciousness before Kanos could deliver the killing blow and also cut Kanos’ weapon in two.\n\nBoth of them were trained in combat by Darth Vader himself, and Devian claimed that he knew all of Kanos’ tricks. Devian kicked Kanos in the chest, knocking the wind out of him, and using this opportunity, Devian impaled Kanos on the left shoulder. Believing himself the victor, Devian revealed to Kanos that his loyalty and service to Palpatine was all a ploy to serve his own ambition and that he would die with that information. \n\nDevian tried to deal a final killing blow to Kanos, however, Kanos was able to gather enough strength to break the blade off of Devian’s vibro-lance and impaled him in the heart with his own weapon, thus killing Devian and collapsing both the Restored Empire and Devian’s vision. Devian died without ever realizing that he himself was a puppet to his benefactor, Nom Anor, who was an agent for the extragalactic species known as the Yuuzhan Vong who sought to destabilize the galaxy by continuing the Galactic Civil War for as long as possible.\n\n# Personality and Traits\nDevian was known within Imperial circles as something of a thug that worked directly under Palpatine. Devian had committed various acts of violence in which he took pleasure in doing. Later in his life, following the merciless slaying of Lonkin in an effort to prove his worthiness in combat to Kir Kanos, Devian tried to rationalize his action by claiming he would not have killed the man if his weapon had not touched him, Emperor Palpatine had taught him to overcome all opposition with overwhelming force.\n\nDevian was also an ultranationalist, claiming to have unquestionable loyalty to the late Emperor’s ideals and based his vision of a Restored Empire around this mentality. However, he would later reveal to Kanos that his loyalty to Palpatine was all fabricated and only used his connections with Palpatine to advance his own ambitions.\n\n# Skills and Abilities\nDevian was personally trained by the Sith Lord, Darth Vader, in the arena known as The Squall as an assassin and was a master of vibro-lance combat, he also considered himself on-par with Kir Kanos himself. As such, during their final showdown over Orinda, Devian was able to hold his own against Kir Kanos for sometime while also showcasing his familiar combat style and knowledge of the tricks taught to him by Darth Vader, however, he would be killed by Kanos during the final showdown between the two.\n\n","meta":{"index":134,"author":"BoarGrills","name":"Ennix Devian","release_year":2023}},"Darth Savik":{"content":"# Overview\nDarth Savik was a female human Sith who served under Darth Hadra and Darth Acharon during the bale of Corellia, and meanwhile as Dark Councillor of the Sphere of Scientific Advancement in the resurgent Sith Empire During the third Galactic war.

His rise across the Imperial ranks despite the infamous speciesist military policies of the Empire is a true testament to his capabilities. He was the only alien Grand Admiral to have ever existed at any point in time.# Biography\nHis long span of career first began in the Defense Force of the Chiss Ascendancy where he served as an officer, fervently displaying his brilliance in logistics, tactics, and martial skill sets. Despite his natural talent, many among the Ascendancy would abhor the idea of pre-emptive and or preventive strikes, even with the early presence of Yuuzhan-Vong already appearing from amongst the Unknown Regions. With his constant incursions beyond Chiss territories, he would encounter the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, who had the double identity of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. After the two came to know the extent of the danger posed by the Unknown Regions, they would effectively agree to silence the Republic movements in the region by destroying the Republic exploration ship Outbound Flight, killing many Jedi in the process as they may draw the ire and attention of the Yuuzhan-Vong.\n\n\"This one is constantly thinking, analyzing, and strategizing. He showed no fear, but was curious, studying me in turn.\"\n-Emperor Palpatine\n\n# Biography II\nDue to his repeated offenses, Mitth’raw’nuruodo would be exiled from the Chiss Ascendancy into a far-flung uninhabited planet within the fringes of the Ascendancy’s borders, eventually being encountered by Navy Officer Voss Parck in the Unknown Regions and brought to now Emperor Palpatine. Having taken note of Thrawn’s adept experience within the Ascendancy, he would approve his admission into the Imperial Navy despite the ongoing speciesist policies of the Empire limiting aliens to a bare minimum. As the Galactic Civil War sparked and went ahead, Thrawn would rapidly rise through the Imperial ladder, eventually reaching the rank of Grand Admiral. He was fully aware that defending the Ascendancy as an Imperial officer would be far less difficult and more coordinated than returning to the Chiss altogether. He would form a secretive empire of his own in the Unknown Regions amassing men and resources as a bulwark to the Yuuzhan-Vong.\n\n\"But.. it was so artistically done..\"\n-Grand Admiral Thrawn, in his final words\n\n# Legacy\nBy the year of the Battle of Endor, Thrawn would still be heavily occupied in the Unknown Regions as the Emperor fell, the Imperial officers disintegrated into shambling warlords, and the Second Death Star’s fall. He would return in 8 ABY, bringing an armada of 6 Imperial Star-Destroyers among other ships forming a military confederation on the fringes of the fledgling New Republic’s borders launching devastating raids and attacks upon the important worlds and assets of the region. Any hope of restoring the Empire would not come to be with his very untimely death in 9ABY at the hands of his Noghri bodyguard Rukh. Despite this, there are many rumors surrounding his empire in the Unknown Regions and tales of his clones in hiding, preparing to defend the known galaxy from threats in the unknown.\n\n# Overview\nThrawn was a male Chiss who served under the Chiss Ascendancy and Galactic Empire, more specifically the Imperial Navy. He was famous for being a tactical genius, and employed many unique and effective strategies against his foes during naval battles. Once the Empire was fully dismantled by the New Republic after the Battle of Jakku, and the subsequent conquest of Coruscant, Thrawn would come to control a large portion of its remains.\n\n# Section I\nIn his early years, Thrawn served under the Chiss Ascendancy. The Chiss Ascendancy was a separate faction that operated in the unknown regions. He quickly rose through its ranks, becoming a well-respected naval officer. Those who were aware of his genius deeply respected him. However, this was not the only faction he would serve under. While on a mission somewhere in the unknown regions, he encountered a colony of Neimoidians. They warned him of the Empire’s tyranny, and begged that he convince the Chiss government to go to war with the Empire. However, he was hesitant to trust them, and informed the Chiss Aristocra of the incident. It was decided that Thrawn would fake his exile, and go undercover in the Empire to weaken it, or attempt to form an alliance.\n\n# Section II\nSure enough, Thrawn was eventually captured by the crew of an Imperial Venator known as the Strikefast, and brought back to Emperor Palpatine. During their first encounter, Thrawn offered to exchange information about the unknown regions. He also stated that Jedi Anakin Skywalker could vouch for his abilities, and was somewhat disappointed to hear that Anakin had perished before the conclusion of the Clone Wars, but he had spoken highly of Thrawn before he died. The Emperor and Thrawn would have many discussions about the unknown regions, which were sparked by Palpatine’s deep interest in the topic. Thrawn would also later be assigned to train at the Imperial Royal Academy, where he would be formally admitted into the Empire as an officer. He faced discrimination within the academy, but he eventually graduated to receive the rank of Lieutenant.\n\n# Section III\nAs a Lieutenant, he served on a Gozanti-class Cruiser named the Blood Crow. During these first few years of his service, he would deal with minor tasks across the mid and outer rims, such as taking care of smuggling, aiding distressed ships, and occasionally defusing political situations. He would later be reassigned. After several other notable incidents, such as the Dromedar hijacking and the Battle over Umbara, Thrawn had come to rise the Imperial ranks quickly, and would eventually find himself back in the Emperor’s throne room, where he would be offered the rank of Grand Admiral by Palpatine himself. At first he was hesitant to accept the promotion, and was still rather concerned that the Empire could try to use the Death Star on the Chiss. However, the Emperor reassured him that he had no intent to use the weapon on the Chiss people, and Thrawn accepted the promotion, becoming the secret thirteenth person to ever hold the prestigious position. It was also at this time when Thrawn first met Darth Vader. The two briefly exchanged formalities, with Thrawn seemingly having no idea that he had already met him, however different he was at the time.\n\n# Section IV\nAfter receiving his promotion, he was stationed on Lothal to help local forces defend against a rebel cell in the area. He led forces in several engagements, both on the ground and in space, to mild success. The rebels he was battling employed very unusual battle tactics that worked to their favor, and as a result were able to escape each encounter with the Grand Admiral. While he was stationed on Lothal, Thrawn also proposed a new design for a TIE fighter known as the TIE defender. It was to wield strong shields, and more advanced weapon systems than its predecessor. However, the design never completely passed its testing phase. His final stand against the Rebel Alliance occurred on Lothal, and ended with his Star Destroyer, the Chimaera being forced to jump to an unknown location in hyperspace with rebel Jedi Ezra Bridger still on board, as part of his plan to sacrifice himself to win the battle and liberate Lothal from the Empire. He succeeded in this plan due to having a large group of purrgil, a species of “space squids” who had the natural ability to jump to hyperspace and attach to Thrawn’s ship, and pull it with them when they jumped.\n\n# Section V\nFollowing this, Thrawn’s location was left to speculation as the Empire continued to fight the Alliance to Restore the Republic. On some occasions, it was rumored that Emperor Palpatine would’ve preferred to assign the Grand Admiral to accomplish certain missions, however was brought back to a disappointed state once he remembered that he went missing years before. It would not be long before the Empire fell to the Rebel Alliance after their crushing defeat at the Battle of Endor, which resulted in the destruction of the Second Death Star, the death of the Emperor, Lord Vader, and a huge portion of the imperial military. However even after the New Republic fully replaced the Empire, it’s remains still operated in the shadows, with rumors that Thrawn would be the one to take command of it’s remaining military forces, and exact his revenge on the New Republic, with him even unofficially taking the title of Heir to the Empire.\n\n# Section VI\nThe Grand Admiral’s military prowess was undeniable, and he employed several tactics that when executed correctly, could devastate enemy forces. He thoroughly believed that the key to victory lay in learning about opponents, understanding their strategies, culture, and even art. Thrawn even came to have his own sort of art collection, which consisted primarily of works that related to war campaigns he had led in the past. He devised strategies involving the use of hyperspace and gravity wells, to strategically place his ships where they could be most effective in naval combat. The Grand Admiral was also skilled in hand-to-hand combat, often practicing with training droids. In conclusion, Grand Admiral Thrawn was a brilliant and effective military leader, whose efforts bolstered the success of the Galactic Empire greatly.\n\n","meta":{"index":39,"author":"C_aladria and AwesomeO561","name":"Grand Admiral Thrawn","release_year":0}},"IG-88":{"content":"# Information\nIG-88B is one of the first five identical IG Series Assassin Droids.

These droids were made in secret by Holowan Laboratories, and from the second IG-88B was first turned on, he had a strong desire to kill and after realizing his skills and capabilities for doing so, he went rogue, killing everyone that was with him in the lab. IG-88B served as a War Droid for a time before he ultimately chose to pursue Bounty Hunting, as this was due to the job allowing him to kill as much organic life as he wanted. After he became a Bounty Hunter, he very quickly became feared by the people who knew of him due to the fear of droids, specifically ones capable of killing and assassination. This fear particularly came from the droids during The Clone Wars which instantly made IG-88B a notorious Bounty Hunter in the known galaxy, where his notoriety became rivaled only by Boba Fett.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring the age of the Empire, IG-88 took on multiple jobs, the first of which being capturing a Crimson Dawn Lieutenant named Qi’ra.

IG-88 along with Boba Fett, Bossk, Dengar, Zuckuss and 4-LOM all assembled on The Executor, where Vader offered money for the task. IG-88 trailed the Millennium Falcon all the way to Cloud City, Bespin. IG-88 was destroyed and left for scrap for some time after his longtime rival caught him trailing them. In the end Boba Fett was the one to capture Han Solo.\n\n\n\nSome time later, IG-88 was hired to kill Vader alongside the Droid Crush Pirates of Bestoon. This hit was put out by Sly Moore who also informed the droid of Vader’s at the time damaged state and code needed to slice into his armor. The droid unsurprisingly failed at this grand task and Vader destroyed him, taking his severed hand to access a nearby terminal that IG-88 was using, through this Vader got all the information he needed on who put out the hit. The droid proceeded to rebuild himself and head to Coruscant to inform Moore of the loss after which she gathered her council before Vader stormed in with reinforcements aware of Moore’s betrayal. Vader then proceeded to take everyone down and destroy IG-88 once more.\n\n# Section 4\nAfter IG-88 was yet again found and rebuilt, he killed and destroyed his saviors in order to test himself, he claimed their ship and contacted Deva Lompop whom he was hired by. Under orders of Lady Qi’ra, the same Qi’ra he was hired to capture years before, he was to reacquire Han Solo from Boba Fett’s ship, Slave 1. After failing yet again despite subduing Boba Fett he returned to the planet he was initially found on prior to this contract to contemplate his future and improve his programming.\n\n\n\nAfter his failure on his last job, IG-88 was hired for yet another job by The Empire this time, he was to take out the leaders of The Son-Tuun Pride that were aiding The Crimson Dawn. After tracking some Rodians and arriving at the Son-Tuun Spaceport, IG-88 gave them time to Surrender which resulted in a firefight that the Phlutdroid won. He reported his success and took on a bounty to take out the leader of The Unbroken Clan, Vukorah, the result of this job isn’t recorded anywhere.\n\n\n\nIG-88 took on a job to infiltrate the second Death Star’s software which failed as he was single-handedly defeated by an Imperial Astromech Droid, R2-Q5.\n\n# Section 5\nLater down the line, IG-88 was contacted by the Mercenary Bazine Netal who was questioning IG-88 and so IG-88 told her of where he almost caught the Millennium Falcon with Kallus.

Shortly after his time as a bounty hunter he became Crime Lord whose name was know across the galaxy striking fear into the hearts of his opposers.\n\n","meta":{"index":203,"author":"Eternal_Incursion","name":"Boba Fett","release_year":2024}},"Force Vampire":{"content":"# Origin\nTel Angor was a Jedi knight who served the order of the Silver Jedi. He was highly well known amongst his colleagues and exceptionally praised for his abilities, both in combat and in the force. Although the order had a goal of eradicating the dark side,  it would soon become something that the order wanted to embrace to further enhance its members' abilities. The order of Silver Jedi had decided to experiment with the darkside in which Tel Angor had decided to participate. After days of meditation and strengthening his bond with the force, the experiment would begin and backfire almost immediately; causing Tel to become completely corrupted by the darkside with a thirst for force energy.# Aftermath\nUnfortunately for Angor, his new process to sustain himself was through feeding on the force energy of other living beings. This would typically lead to attacking anyone he came into contact with. The force vampire as he would now be referred to, would mainly focus on attacking force sensitive beings with strong connections to keep him satisfied and fed. However, being able to consume force energy was not the only ability that the force vampire wielded as he could also transfer the energy that he gains into pure physical strength that could greatly help with his attacks and recovery when needed. Despite these strength enhancing abilities, the force vampire was also capable of radiating waves of terror that would shock its victim so greatly that it could physically damage them.\n\n# The hunt\nThe Silver Jedi had acted immediately upon finding out about these tragic events and attempted to hunt down the vampire at all cost. Unfortunately for the Jedi, most leads on the force vampire would usually only end in his victims with many who encountered the vampire not making it out alive. However, before the events of the Clone Wars occurred, a group of seven Jedi were able to track down the force vampire. Afterfter a long and straining battle, they were even able to capture him, imprisoning him on an outrider class cruiser. After the imprisonment of the force vampire, the trip had begun and the Jedi would serve as guards until Tel could be brought back to the light; however one Jedi had made a critical error that resulted in the vampire escaping and feeding on the crew members. Only one single Jedi Knight managed to survive and sabotaged the hyperdrive and sublight drives to isolate the vampire and died heroically against the creature in a battle. The order of the Silver Jedi had been disbanded by this point and the force vampire had made his way to Coruscul to destroy the final stronghold but was stopped before he could do so. A journal was found regarding the experiment which apologetically ended off with “We never should have tried”.\n\n","meta":{"index":58,"author":"edex08","name":"Force Vampire","release_year":2023}},"Darth Tyranus":{"content":"# Overview\nCount Dooku, also known as Darth Tyranus, was a mighty human male Sith Lord. He was born on the planet Serenno. Dooku started as the Padawan of the powerful Jedi, Grand Master Yoda. As a Jedi, Dooku trained a Padawan named Qui Gon Jinn. Qui Gon was a powerful Jedi who was fluent in the form of Ataru. Like his master, Qui Gon didn’t follow all of the Jedi rules and learned that from Dooku. Count Dooku eventually left the Jedi Order and returned to his home planet. After leaving the Jedi, Dooku became the apprentice of one of the most powerful Sith Lords ever, Darth Sidious. Sidious took Dooku in, and the two secretly created a plan. Sidious hid in the shadow of the senate. Meanwhile, Dooku did all of his dirty work. Dooku created the Separatist army with the help of Poggle the Lesser, a Geonosian that owned droid factories, and his apprentices, General Grievous and Ventress. Dooku was an extremely talented lightsaber-wielder. He was the head instructor in the Jedi Order and was proficient in Form II, Makashi. Dooku had a unique lightsaber design. His curved hilt made it easier for him to master Makashi. However, Dooku was only a puppet for Sidious’ real plan to rule the galaxy. At the time, Dooku had no idea his master would betray him, so he blindly worked for Sidious. Dooku was killed aboard his ship when he kidnapped the Chancellor. He died at the hands of Darth Sidious’ new apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, later known as Darth Vader.# The Separatists\nCount Dooku was the leader of the Separatist droid army (CIS). The CIS was an army that contained millions of B1 battle droids, super battle droids, and the occasional sniper/destroyer droids. The Separatists were another Sidious plan to weaken the Jedi and force them into using the clone troopers. This led them into the dark days of the Clone Wars. Dooku led the CIS into war with the Grand Army of the Republic and killed many Jedi and clones. Towards the end of the Clone Wars, once the Chancellor was caught, Dooku held Chancellor Palpatine, who was secretly Darth Sidious, captive on his ship. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker were sent to save the Chancellor from Dooku. Unfortunately, the two Jedi fought off all Dooku’s forces until they reached the mighty Sith Lord. Dooku fought them both and knocked out Master Kenobi, leaving Anakin to fend for himself. Anakin used his rage to counter Dooku and chopped his hand off. Dooku’s lightsaber landed right in Anakin’s hand, and Anakin finally had Dooku hostage. Chancellor Palpatine convinced Anakin to kill Dooku, but Anakin “it wasn’t the Jedi way” and sliced the great Sith Lord’s head off. Anakin released Palpatine and escaped the ship, holding Kenobi and helping the Chancellor. After the death of Dooku, Kenobi hunted down and killed Grievous on Utapau, thus ending the Clone wars and starting Order 66. Unfortunately, Sidious sent Anakin to destroy all droids and kill the Separatist leaders.\n\n# Personality and abilities\nCount Dooku was one of the best lightsaber-wielders and mastered the Makashi form. Count Dooku was also skilled with the Force lightning ability. Count Dooku was also considered a “political idealist” by his peers. Dooku had a sister, Jenza, that was a Jedi, and the two were very close until one day, Dooku became a Sith Lord and was titled Darth Tyranus, and his sister was so desperate to turn him that he killed her. At the end of the Clone wars, Dooku allied with Quinlan Vos and Maul to overthrow Sidious, but Dooku was killed before they got the chance. The only Jedi Dooku remained fond of was his dead Padawan, Qui Gon. He even bragged to Kenobi about him and how he is still miserable after Qui Gon’s death. Dooku wanted Qui Gon’s Padawan, Kenobi, to join the CIS and told him that the real Dark Lord of the Sith was named Darth Sidious. Kenobi was reluctant to believe the deceiving Sith, but Dooku was respectful to Kenobi until he turned him down. Dooku was a powerful Force wielder known as one of the best swordsmen in the Jedi Order. Dooku could even take on Kenobi, Anakin, and Grand Master Yoda. Dooku was extremely skilled in Fore lightning, which made it easier for him to torture and kill his foes. He could also use it in telekinesis. Dooku was a scholar in the powers of the Force and could telekinetically manipulate people. Dooku was skilled in lightsaber to lightsaber combat because he used Form II, Makashi. Dooku desired to become a Sith Master/Dark lord of the Sith, which is why he wanted to overthrow Sidious. Still, he didn’t realize Sidious had already overthrown him from the start, thus starting the long era of the Galactic Empire.\n\n","meta":{"index":82,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Darth Tyranus","release_year":2022}},"Grand Moff Vilim Disra":{"content":"# Overview\nVilim Disra, a Human male politician, held significant positions within the Imperial Remnant. By 19 ABY, he served as the Grand Moff and was responsible for the Braxant sector. Additionally, Disra held a seat in the Council of Moffs. Interestingly, he formed a secret triumvirate consisting of himself, Grodin Tierce (formerly an Emperor's Royal Guard Major), and a con-artist named Flim. This alliance aimed to create internal conflict within the New Republic by exploiting the Bothan's involvement in the Caamas Document issue. Their goal was to prevent Fleet Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, the Supreme Commander at the time, from achieving a successful peace agreement with the New Republic. Prior to this, Disra had been a member of the Central Committee of Grand Moffs, supporting Trioculus's claim to the Imperial throne.# Value\nVilim Disra embarked on his career as the Chief Administrator of the Shelsha sector. In 3 BBY, he served under Governor Barshnis Choard but eventually betrayed him when Choard sought to secede from the Galactic Empire. Disra collaborated with Choard and a mercenary named Caaldra to unite pirate gangs under the BloodScars and prepare them to target specific Imperial installations. He also feigned allegiance with the Rebel Alliance, promising their assistance in defending Shelsha. However, Disra had ulterior motives and planned to betray Choard, Caaldra, and the Rebels. He orchestrated events to have Choard captured by Darth Vader and positioned himself as a hero to the Empire. Disra's plan succeeded, but Emperor Palpatine refused to grant him the governorship of Shelsha. In the post-Endor period, Disra was initially a member of the Central Committee of Grand Moffs but was subsequently demoted, possibly for supporting Bertroff Hissa and Trioculus. He played a role in the assassination of Grand Admiral Rufaan Tigellinus, enabling him to secure a position on the Committee. By 11 ABY, Disra began searching for someone to successfully impersonate Thrawn as part of his plan to overthrow the New Republic. By 19 ABY, he had become one of the eight members of the Council of Moffs. During the Caamas Document Crisis, Disra hired the con artist Flim to portray Grand Admiral Thrawn, forming a triumvirate with Major Grodin Tierce to consolidate Imperial military power. Under Disra's nominal leadership, they devised a plan to sabotage Bothawui's planetary shield and manipulated tensions arising from the discovery of a datacard implicating the Bothans in the Caamas bombardment. Disra also enlisted pirate gangs, particularly Captain Zothip's Cavrilhu gang, to attack New Republic convoys. Disra used the pirates as pawns to deplete the New Republic's resources while gaining Preybird-class starfighters in return. However, Disra's control over the triumvirate was limited, as Tierce manipulated the group from the beginning. Disra intended to betray Tierce and Flim, but Tierce had already uncovered Disra's plan. As conflict escalated over Bothawui, it was revealed that Tierce was an unstable clone. Talon Karrde provided information that exposed Disra's scheme, resulting in his arrest on charges of treason. Ephin Sarreti replaced Disra on the Council of Moffs.\n\n","meta":{"index":121,"author":"SkyPanik","name":"Grand Moff Vilim Disra","release_year":2023}},"Anakin Skywalker":{"content":"# Overview\nBorn on Tatooine, Anakin Skywalker was a legendary Force-Sensitive human male. In the Jedi Order, he held the rank of Jedi Knight and was seen as the chosen one due to his high mid-chlorian count. Although he turned to the Dark Side of the Force as Darth Vader, the persona of Anakin Skywalker rebirthed after saving his son, Luke Skywalker, from the Emperor’s Force Lightning attack.# History\nFrom a young age, Anakin was showing emotions such as fear that led to the Dark Side, this is shown when he was brought to the Jedi Council, and Master Yoda, along with Master Mace Windu, asked him about his feelings and his mother. The young Skywalker asked how was such a question relevant, and Master Yoda sensed fear in Anakin. Besides this, after Qui-Gon Jinn died, the chosen one was taken under Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon’s former Padawan. \n\nObi-Wan Kenobi’s job was hard because as Anakin grew, his arrogance and emotions grew too. Anakin thought Obi-Wan wasn’t a good master, but if he wanted to become a true Jedi, he had to get along with him. That thought of Anakin eventually changed, and he considered him a father rather than a master. During his time as a padawan, Anakin Skywalker was given the task of protecting Senator Padmé Amidala from an assassination attempt. While Padmé and Anakin were in Naboo, he decided to return to Tatooine because he had constant nightmares about his mother suffering. After finding her in a Tusken camp, Anakin saw his mother heavily damaged. Without being able to say anything, Shmi Skywalker died in his son’s arms. Anakin was furious and decided to kill every Tusken Raider in the village. \n\nOne of the missions Obi-Wan and Anakin went on together was the First Battle of Geonosis, where they fought against Darth Tyranus. As a result, Obi-Wan ended up with minor injuries, while Anakin’s right arm was cut. Both master and padawan were saved from death because Jedi Master Yoda entered the secret hangar and fought Dooku. After the event of Geonosis, Anakin and Padmé married in secret, because the Jedi Order didn’t allow it due to emotions such as jealousy and fear of loss that could lead to the Dark Side. \n\nAnakin Skywalker went through everything during his time as a Jedi Knight, such as seeing how his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, was exiled from the Jedi Order and how the Jedi Council denied him the rank of Jedi Master.\nAnakin’s faith in the Jedi Council was lost, but suddenly Obi-Wan notified Skywalker that the chancellor required his presence. Once Anakin arrived at Palpatine’s office, the chancellor talked to him about the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise, and how the power of the Dark Side of the Force could save his wife, Padmé Amidala, from death. \n\nAnakin then notified Jedi Master Mace Windu that the chancellor Palpatine was the Sith Lord the Jedi were searching for. Mace Windu, along with Agen Kolar, Saesee Tiin, and Kit Fisto, confronted Sidious. Unlucky for Mace, his three teammates died against Palpatine and he was the only one left. After defeating Palpatine, Anakin arrived at the Emperor’s office and noticed Mace Windu attempting to kill the Emperor. He tried to convince Mace Windu that the Emperor was needed alive. However, the Jedi Master didn’t listen to the chosen one and tried to attack Palpatine. After swinging his saber, Anakin betrayed Mace Windu and cut his hand, allowing the Emperor to project a Force Lightning attack on the Jedi Master. After clearing the Emperor’s office, Anakin was officially a Sith under the name of Darth Vader.\n\n# Rebirth of Anakin\nFrom Darth Vader’s point of view, the persona of Anakin Skywalker was erased from his memory. However, Vader still remembered his life as a Jedi. Upon this, he also discovered he had two kids: Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa. His goal was to convert Luke Skywalker into a Dark Side user.\n\nAfter his son arrived in Endor, Luke Skywalker told Vader there was still good in him and that his true self was still alive. Vader responded that his past as Anakin didn’t have any meaning for him anymore, and escorted his son to the death star. \nOnce Vader and Luke met the Emperor, Vader’s son tried to kill Darth Sidious, but he was stopped by Darth Vader, and the battle started. Luke Skywalker defeated Vader by cutting his hand, but after being requested to kill his father by Darth Sidious, he threw his lightsaber away and said he didn’t want to join the Dark Side. Palpatine, mad about this, projected a Force Lightning attack on Darth Vader’s son to torture him. Darth Vader then lifted the Emperor and threw him to the reactor of the dead star. Vader was heavily injured because the Emperor’s Force Lightning got stronger when his apprentice lifted him. After saving his son from death, he redeemed himself as a Jedi. After Anakin Skywalker died, he turned into a Force Ghost and completed his task of bringing balance to the Force.\n\n","meta":{"index":201,"author":"ValenTemenos","name":"Anakin Skywalker","release_year":2022}},"Lord Nyax":{"content":"# Overview\nThe story of Lord Nyax was an old Corellian tale, that was a part of a greater collection of Corellian mythos. A tale that was told to boys and girls, that he would come to kidnap them in their sleep to foster compliance and obedience, more so towards misbehaving kids. As time passed, the tale of Lord Nyax would become synonymous with Darth Vader, due to his secret mission of kidnapping children with Force-Sensitivity on Corellia, and would eventually spread from the planet to the wider galaxy.\n\nThroughout galactic history, other beings had their identity assimilated to that of the evil spirit. During the Galactic Civil War, a Corellian cult, known as the Cult of Lord Nyax, carried out acts of horrendous terror, including terrorism, against the local Correllian population in the name of their Lord. During the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion, the Dark Side Adept Irek Ismaren had assumed the identity of Lord Nyax, after hearing his name in the minds of his victims he’d tortured.# History\nIn times that were considered ancient by 27 ABY, the evil entity known as Lord Nyax was referred to by Corellian parents to their children in order to frighten them into more compliant behavior. Lord Nyax was described as being either a pale ghost-like figure or a man shrouded in a dark cloak with sickly yellow eyes, a hooked nose, sharp teeth, and long nails. The entity's depiction shared many similarities with the appearance of the Galactic Emperor and Dark Lord of the Sith, Palpatine, and also shares these similarities with the appearance one takes with the cosmetic effects of Dark Side corruption.\n\nShortly after the Clone Wars had ended, the story of Lord Nyax became associated with Darth Vader, as he would also appear at night to kidnap and execute any Force-Sensitive children, as it was assumed they could potentially grow to become Jedi and be a threat to the New Order. Following this, the legend of Lord Nyax had spread from Corellia to all of the known galaxy during the early years of the New Order.\n\nAt the time of the Galactic Civil War, several Corellian sects had honored Lord Nyax as their deity. By 1 ABY, a sect called the Cult of Lord Nyax had formed that worshiped him. The cultists donned dark cloaks, as Lord Nyax is mentioned, wearing something similar, and committing a number of terror attacks in his name. The leader of the cult had taken the name of Lord Nyax upon himself, however, he would eventually be killed by an unknown spacer. The followers of Nyax, another sect that worshiped Lord Nyax, adored the evil entity and promoted radical anti-Jediism, and when Darth Vader was on Corellia fulfilling his task of kidnapping any Force-Sensitive children and executing them, along any remaining Jedi on the planet, the Followers saw him as a reincarnation of their god.\n\nIn 12 ABY, a mentally damaged Dark Adept-in-training, named Irek Ismaren, assumed the name of Lord Nyax, after he had read it in the minds of his terrified victims. He understood this as a recognition of his status, as Nyax sounded quite unique and Lord, to him, meant he was more important than everything else. Under his new identity, Ismaren brought terror to Coruscant, the capital planet of the New Republic, after it had fallen into the hands of the Yuuzhan Vong, a species of extra-galactic invaders. Irek Ismaren, or Lord Nyax in this case, was assumed to have died by being crushed to death by falling boulders inside the Jedi Temple ruins, however, later reports also suggested that he may have survived.\n\n","meta":{"index":137,"author":"BoarGrills","name":"Lord Nyax","release_year":2023}},"Mandalore the Avenger":{"content":"# Article\nMand’alor the Avenger, also known as Shae Vizla, was a famous Mandalorian and one of the Mandalores of the Old Republic Era. \n\nShae Vizla was mostly known for helping the Dark Lord named Malgus on the strike of Alderaan and eventually the Sacking of Coruscant, marking her name forever in history, however it was not the last time she did so. \n\nAfter a few years as a Bounty Hunter or helping Imperial Forces, Shae retired along with her Aliit, also named Aliit Vizla, settling themselves on the planet of Rishi, attempting to stay far from any large scale galaxy wide conflicts or events, only caring about her Aliit and even taking less and less contracts as a bounty hunter.\n\nHowever, that retirement wouldn’t last, as after a few years, the Revanites and Nova Blades managed to create a fleet on top of Rishi moon, which postponed her retirement for a few times as she learned of the Republic and Sith Empire forming a coalition to take down the Revanites and Revan himself, a Dar’jetii.\n\nShae Vizla, only planning for it to be a short term out of retirement, was wrong, as it turned out, the Eternal Empire made an appearance, shortening her hopes for the battles to be, eventually leading her to take part in a major role into the war.\n\nSadly, within the war that occured, Mand’alor the Vindicated fell in combat by skytroopers of the Eternal Empire.

In his imperial career, he was known for his cunning character, a distinct pair of blaster-shaped earrings he wore and his droid, 3B6-RA-7, who accompanied him.# Biography\nThere are no records of Dunhausen’s young life or what eventually became of him.\nFollowing the attack on the second Death Star, a former Jedi Knight, Kadann, prophecised that the rightful heir to the imperial throne would locate and use the Glove of Darth Vader. This resistant relic survived the explosion of the Death Star. Imperial powers sought to find the glove to attain Kadann’s dark blessing. Dunhausen joined the Central Committee of Grand Moffs intending to puppeteer Trioculus, a self-proclaimed son of the late Emperor Sheev Palpatine, and establish supreme power upon his succession. In 5 ABY, they revealed their puppet at the Kessendra Coronation on the planet Kessel as rightful for the throne, publicly opposing Director Ysanne Isard of Imperial Intelligence, who also laid claim. In a meeting with the committee, Dunhausen had recommended introducing a new leading position on Tatooine to consolidate his power of Mos Eisley spaceport but was rejected by Trioculus.\nSometime later, the committee travelled to Mon Calamari for the foreseen relic. Kadann learnt through his network of spies that their pawn was phoney but was later convinced by the committee, so he gave his blessing. Not long later, Trioculus fell for a trap while searching for the Lost City of Jedi on moon Yavin IV, which saw him frozen in carbonite by crimelord Zorba Desilijic Tiure. Meanwhile, Kadann falsely proclaimed prophecies that gave him imperial power. A Mofference (Grand Moff committee conference) was held to discuss the growing threat of the false Prophet. They underestimated their foe and were subsequently trialled at the Chamber of Dark Justice onboard Scardia Station. This proved advantageous for Kadann as it was part of the steps to reduce his opposition in the galaxy.

He served as the Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge for a little while until he died in a Kaggath against the mighty Sith Lord, Darth Nox. Thanaton was born by the name of Teneb Kel and was a slave to the Empire until he was discovered to be Force-sensitive by a Sith Lord known as Calypho who trained him on Korriban. On Korriban, Calypho taught Thanaton the secrets of the Force and the Sith. He also taught Thanaton how to assassinate by sending him on missions. Due to his ambitions and greed, Calypho was arrested by the Dark Council. After his master's arrest, Thanaton was sent to serve the Imperial Military by order of the Dark Council so they could observe him. He achieved many victories for the Empire, due to his skill in combat, but the Dark Council still saw his master’s flaws in him. To prove his loyalty, the Dark Council sent Thanaton to Dromund Kaas so that he could kill Calypho. Before killing his former master, Thanaton was sent on an important mission to find the Sith Emperor’s former apprentice, Exal Kressh. Thanaton went with his friend, Maggot, to Lenico IV. There he encountered Kressh. The two duelled for a bit until Kressh had the upper hand and defeated Thanaton. Thanaton remained on the planet left for dead. Thanaton started having visions of the Emperor’s quest for immortality and saw that Kressh was vital because he was a child of the Emperor, which was because the Emperor stole Force-sensitive children and used them in his army so he could gain immortality and power to conquer the galaxy. He then located and killed Kressh and Maggot so the Emperor’s plans would not be revealed.# The hunt for Zash's allies\nAfter the death of Kressh, Thanaton demanded the Dark Council promoted him to Lord, so he could kill Zash, and so he claimed the title Darth Thanaton. He then started to build a power base in the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and was considered a Sith traditionalist, because he did things the old way. Thanaton encountered the deceiving Sith Lord, Zash. Thanaton and Darth Skotia, his new ally, considered Zash to be a scheming and corrupting Sith, because of the way she treated her apprentices. Zash deceived her apprentice, who would later be known as Darth Nox, to kill Darth Skotia. Zash was then promoted to Darth. Once she was promoted, Zash started her quest for immortality. This surprised Darth Thanaton. Zash sent her apprentice all over the galaxy to claim artifacts so she could transfer her spirit into a different body. Once her apprentice encountered her on Dromund Kaas, he killed her and was promoted to Lord Kallig. At the same time, Darth Thanaton ascended to become a part of the Dark Council and became Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge. With his ascension, Thanaton used his power to kill the new Sith Lord and failed multiple times. Thanaton declared a Kaggath on the young Kallig and travelled to Corellia. Kallig beat the powerful Sith, which forced Thanaton into retreating to Korriban and begging the Dark Council for mercy. Kallig tracked down Thanaton and met him in front of the Dark Council. They then proceeded with the Kaggath and Thanaton was defeated. The Dark Council saw Thanaton as a failure. He broke the rules of the Kaggath out of cowardness. This irritated the Council and so Darth Mortis snapped Thanaton’s neck using the Force as Thanaton begged for mercy. The death of Thanaton left an empty seat in the Dark Council. Due to his victory in the Kaggath, Lord Kallig ascended to Dark Council member and Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge. Kallig was titled Darth Nox and would become one of the most powerful Sith in history due to his ability to bind and communicate with Force Ghosts because he was a descendant of Aloysius Kallig.\n\n","meta":{"index":79,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Darth Thanaton","release_year":2022}},"General Hux":{"content":"# Introduction\nGeneral Hux is a First Order officer, young, ambitious, and cruel.

The same Kylo Ren has a low opinion of Hux as a warrior. Hux, in turn, being a rational person, does not understand well the mystical part of the First Order that Kylo Ren represents.# Section 1\nHux's authority as a general extends beyond the military; he is also the Commander-in-Chief of Starkiller Base and can issue orders regarding the use of its destructive weapons but only after Snoke approves of this decision. Hux was still a child when the Empire and the New Republic signed a truce agreement. His father left the Academy on Arkanis and was one of those Imperials who went into self-imposed exile in the Unknown Regions (which the Empire was secretly exploring). Hux grew up with the legends of the great Imperials and how the Empire saved the Galaxy from the horror of the Clone Wars.

Tarkin’s career would not end here as he achieved the status of Grand Moff of the outer rim territories due to his efforts in exterminating all resistance to Palpatine reign. However, Tarkin was a harsh and ruthless leader often executing his comrades if they failed to live up to the empire’s expectations. Eventually, Tarkin would meet his demise on the first Death Star in 0BBY after an infiltration mission, carried out by the Rebel Alliance, dying in a great explosion.\n\n","meta":{"index":198,"author":"Edex08","name":"Grand Moff Tarkin","release_year":2023}},"Darth Andeddu":{"content":"# Introduction\nDarth Andeddu, also known as the Immortal God-King of Prakith, was an ancient Sith humanoid male who once reigned on the throne as Dark Lord of the Sith around the period of the One Hundred Year Darkness. Andeddu was a very paranoid man who had believed that his subordinate Sith Lords, whom he called his enemies, wanted to claim his ritualistic and vast collection of Sith lore. Of course, he was partially correct when he was overthrown and betrayed by his followers. He had fled Korriban for the Deep Core. Within the Deep Core, Andeddu made his way to Prakith, a planet where he would rule for centuries as the Immortal God-King, praised as a deity before his physical demise. He was placed deep inside of a tomb to deter all those who sought to steal his power. Before Andeddu had died, he stored all of his wisdom inside of a Sith holocron, which had also contained his most powerful and darkest of secrets, how to cheat death by transferring one’s essence into another vessel. A Sith Cult founded by Darth Andeddu called “Malevolence” was formed after his death and sought to protect and guard Andeddu’s tomb for generations to come.# Section I\nDarth Andeddu hailed from the Deep Core world of Prakith, where he studied the wisdom of another great being, Karness Muur. Over time, Andeddu grew in power and great wisdom, developing an expertise over the dark side of the Force. However, as he continued to study Muur, he wanted to learn more than Dark side healing abilities, and sought more power from then on. Andeddu was interested in how to cheat death entirely. He was successful in his quest to find the power to cheat death, learning that in order to cheat death, he must preserve his mind and consciousness. He also had learned the secret of transferring his essence into another vessel if he so needed. As Andeddu grew in power and stature, he also grew in fear of others around him. Andeddu had refused to release the knowledge of how to perform the ancient Force abilities that he had discovered, leading to the Sith Lords banding together to take the throne and his power for themselves. After his coup, he had returned to his own private stronghold on his homeworld where he had stored all of his Sith spell books and scrolls that contained his knowledge and wisdom. Because of Andeddu’s dark side abilities, he had begun to exceed the natural lifespan of a normal being, in which he would then rule Prakith for many centuries to come. However, with the hyperspace lanes leading to Prakith being erased from existence, it caused Prakith to go into a deep isolation where Andeddu would rule undisturbed for a long time, but he was still paranoid of his own demise and his followers stealing his power. So, to avoid this extreme paranoia, he entombed himself with all of his scrolls and belongings, placing his holocron inside of a sarcophagus along with his physical body. The Malevolence cult continued to reign after his death, worshiping their God-King and maintaining his tomb. Andeddu declared that they would guard his tomb for generations and await the day that he resurrected himself from death to lead them once again.\n\n","meta":{"index":16,"author":"PhaseSpectr","name":"Darth Andeddu","release_year":2021}},"Sith King Adas":{"content":"# Introduction\nAdas was a Sith King, the first that ruled over Korriban and the Sith for a total of three centuries. Adopting the title “Sith’ari”, the Sith believed his rule would last for eternity due to the belief of him being immortal. Though, this belief was proven false once he met his demise in a war between the Sith and Infinite Empire. Even after his death, the ancient Sith King’s history continued to make an impact on future events to come. His wisdom was stored within a holocron, held onto by the Sith for many generations, creating a legacy that established the foundation of Sith unification.# History\nThis soon-to-be Sith’ari was born sometime around 28,000 BBY. At birth, Adas possessed a charcoal skin complexion, quite rare among Sith Purebloods. Due to this, Adas was seen as one of few with outstanding amounts of potential and would be trained as such. As he continued to grow throughout his life, he naturally grew with high intelligence and extreme combative prowess. Adas was also proficient in Sith alchemy, proving such by wielding a large battle-ax forged entirely from alchemy with spiked ebon armor to complement it. With his wonderful leadership capability, Adas led the Sith throughout many different conflicts that came forth on Korriban, thus providing him with the title of Sith King, also known as “Sith’ari.”\nThe time period of his reign which lasted 300 years was known as the “Reign of the Ax.” His rule was perceived as eternal by his fellow Sith followers because of his impressive feats in leadership and unification of the Sith species thus beginning the prophecy of the “Sith’ari” similar to the prophecy of the “Chosen One.” It wasn’t until the Infinite Empire governed by the Rakata arrived on Korriban in seeking to dominate the Sith species. The Rakata taught Adas holocron technology, allowing the Sith King to record whatever information he pleased and store it within a holocron. Adas followed along and did this to display a feat rather than preserve his wisdom. Rakatan forces enlightened Adas with this knowledge in hopes to gain his trust so that they may enslave the Sith species for their own benefit. \n\nAfter the Rakata realized that the Sith King was not easily fooled, they devised a battle plan to release their soldiers on Korriban in an attempt to conquer by force. As a response to their invasion, the Sith’ari gathered all of his people to defend against the attack. With great defense, valor, and leadership from Adas, the Sith pushed the Rakatan forces off of Korriban, capturing many of their starships in the process to use against them. The Sith would move onto the worlds of Ziost, Tund, and Malachor V as a result of their battle. Despite the hopes Adas had for establishing a newer, yet traditional generation of Sith, he met his demise in the process. His death would cause disorganization and faults within the caste and society of the Sith, many other Sith battled each other to become a successor of Adas to unite the culture once more.\n\n# Legacy\nAfter the death of the Sith King Adas, Korriban descended into chaos and anarchy, most of the native Sith engaging in battle with each other in an attempt to display the strength to be deemed “Sith’ari.” Quite a few Kissai, the priest caste of the Sith believed that the death of Adas was an indication to reject the philosophies of the Dark Side and instead, follow their own instinct in The Force which would lead them to Tund. With all the chaos transpiring on Korriban, the capital of the Sith was eventually shifted to the planet Ziost. Given enough time, the conflicts on Korriban came to a conclusion, allowing the Sith to reorganize themselves, attempting to follow Adas’s concept of how others can gain power from the strength expressed by the leadership of another. After all the time without a King, Hakagram Graush would ascend to become the new Sith’ari and rule over those among Korriban until the Dark Jedi brought his rule to an end.\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly twenty-one thousand years after the death of King Adas, around 6900 BBY, a group of Dark Jedi exiles led by Ajunta Pall would make themselves known on the Korriban. By demonstrating their extreme prowess in The Force, the Dark Jedi would be praised as Gods among the Sith, so much so that the exiles were perceived by the Sith to be even more powerful and influential than the previous Sith King Adas. By conspiring with the Shadow Hand, the second in command of the Sith monarch, Ajunta Pall was able to gain the trust of Hakagram Graush and execute him. Sorzus Syn, another exile, studied the philosophies and culture of the Sith, which included the very history of Adas that was stored in a holocron preserved by the native species for many years that assisted Sorzus Syn in creating the many philosophies of the Sith such as the Code of the Sith.\n\n","meta":{"index":25,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Sith King Adas","release_year":2022}},"Darth Scabrous":{"content":"# Overview\nDarth Scabrous was an ambitious human male Sith Lord who served as the orchid’s caretaker of the academy on the planet Odacer-Faustin.

Scabrous would end up finding a formula for this disease. Just like Drear, Scabrous sought immortality, which led to his search for Drear’s Holocron, which contained a formula for the zombie virus. The virus leaked and spread all over the academy, turning those inside into zombies, including those who had already died. The Sith that were resurrected turned into cannibalistic zombies who were controlled by Scabrous himself. Scabrous attempted to kill a Jedi by using his knowledge as the orchid’s caretaker, the Jedi was Hestizo Trace, so he could sacrifice her and eat her heart so he could gain a high midi-chlorian count to fully make himself immortal.

He witnessed the extinction of the Sith order, which he was a Sith Warrior in. Bane, after witnessing the death of many Siths and developing a loneliness feeling, decided to make his own order along with the Sith philosophy, the rule of two. He trained his apprentice, Darth Zannah in the ways of the Sith and later Zannah killed him. Although it was a tragedy, Bane wanted this to happen because once an apprentice kills their master it proves that the apprentice is obviously stronger but also he will train his apprentice to become stronger than him and the cycle continues for a long time. Many Sith killed their master. One of the most common stories is how Darth Sidious killed his master Plagueis and after that there isn’t much about apprentices killing their masters because the rule of two is ignored. The thousand year old philosophy almost ends with Sidious training Maul as his apprentice when there are already two Sith lords, which is him and his master Darth Plagueis. However, Darth Sidious still trained Darth Vader and obeyed the rule of two up until his death. Darth Sidious and Darth Vader were basically the last Sith lords who obeyed the rule of two.\n \nDuring the Clone Wars, Yoda ventures to Moraband in order to gain immortality and along the way he encounters Darth Bane which is the one of the 1st times he was mentioned in a canon story. Darth Bane had a weird helmet/mask and armour. This is called Orbalisk armour and he wore the helmet in his sleep in order for him to prevent the Orbalisk from growing into his facial parts and smothering him. Bane used the Orbalisk as power by feeding it his dark side energy so that the Orbalisk could help him heal and grow more powerful. The Orbalisk is a poisonous creature and inflicts pain in its host if it is normal but luckily for Bane he had the force and could feed it so it’ll work in his favour.# Insight into Bane's Legacy\nDarth Bane was a magnificent Sith. He was the founder of one of the most well-known sith philosophies, the rule of two. Bane was a dark lord of the sith and was born on the ancient sith home planet, Moraband, modern Korriban. Darth Bane is the so-called “founder of the modern sith”. He was lurking in the shadows waiting to strike the Jedi and rise to power so he could rule the galaxy. He was a human male who was the one and only Sith to survive the Jedi-Sith war and went into hiding. Bane, having witnessed the greed and blindness for power the sith craved, decided to start a new sith tradition that states there can only be a master and an apprentice. \n \nOnce the apprentice was strong enough they’d often kill their own masters and claim the title. Darth Zannah, Bane’s apprentice, did this along with many other sith. This tradition was put in place so the Sith wouldn’t make the same mistake as the brotherhood of darkness did and so the Sith had a chance to defeat the Jedi by training those who have the capability to become a powerful sith lord and continue the cycle. The rule of two was first broken when Darth Sidious trained Darth Maul as his apprentice even though he was still learning from Plagueis. However, many Sith before Palpatine obeyed the rule of two and continued Bane’s legacy to dominate the galaxy and the Jedi with it.\n\n# Personality, Traits and Abilities\nDarth Bane was a pale-skinned male Sith lord with yellow eyes, or Sith Eyes, who believed people with strength should be dominating those who are weak in order to gain power. He was a visionary and philosopher who witnessed the downfall of the Sith. However, he made a new Sith order and invented the rule of two. Bane studied many Sith documents to invent this philosophy and he saw the loneliness some Sith felt and he did something about it, which was the inventining the rule of two. Bane was a Sith Warrior in the old order and was a skilled combatant with the ability to create impressive military tactics and to wield the force powerfully. Although he was a powerful Sith his weakness was diplomacy, Bane wasn’t a diplomatic Sith lord he relied on military tactics and like many other Sith, he inflicted fear into the hearts of many beings. \n \nDarth Bane used form II, which is also known as Makashi, in lightsaber battles. He believed that with the lightsaber hilt curved it’ll fit better in the wielder’s hand and combat would be easier, which was accurate because Count Dooku who was one of the best lightsaber wielders on both sides during the clone wars also used makashi form and had a curved hilt lightsaber. Darth Bane could control his Orbalisk infection by wearing a mask during the day and his sleep. He used the Orbalisk and its armour to help him heal himself and grow stronger because he fed it his dark force energy. The Orbalisk gave Darth Bane adrenaline in his bloodstream which allowed him to draw out his dark side power allowing him to grow stronger. Although it had its perks for him, if Bane couldn’t control his anger he’d go into a mindless rage. The Orbalisk had a weakness, it's believed that electricity could impact the Orbalisk but Darth Bane and his Orbalisk could absorb that energy. Darth Bane’s Orbalisk was removed from his skin and was made into armour hence why he wears the mask and armour. This had the same benefits but Darth Bane wouldn't have to worry about it growing in his face.\n\n","meta":{"index":52,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Darth Bane","release_year":2022}},"Lord Kaan":{"content":"# Overview\nSkere Kaan was a Jedi Master, he served during the end of the New Sith Wars. He eventually defected and became a Dark Lord, creating the “Brotherhood of Darkness” within the Sith Empire. Due to this, he earned himself the title of “The Dark One”. After a decade of his rule, Sith started to leave his brotherhood, they even saw flaws in his beliefs. Darth Bane used Kaans own thought bomb to destroy whatever remained of the Brotherhood of Darkness. That is where he set up his own Order using the “Rule of 2”, one master, 1 apprentice.# Early Life\nSkere was born during the dark age of the Republic, he was born unknown. He was eventually found by the Jedi Order, he trained and as time passed he became a Jedi Knight. Because of his knowledge and fleet command, he was also a beacon of hope for the Jedi High Council to defeat the Sith. Since he mastered the art of “Battle Meditation” he was considered a high-value asset. The Jedi High Council awarded him the title of Jedi Master to control his extremist views. He took a handful of Knights and ran away from Coruscant forming the “Brotherhood of Darkness”.\nDuring this time, the Sith were crippled, they were claiming the title of Dark Lord and starting campaigns against each other which lasted a while. Kaan decided to unite all the Sith by forcing them under his rule and killing anyone who doesn’t abide by his rule. Kopecz and Qordis, which were the 2 most powerful Sith Warlords at the time, pledged themselves to Kaans’ cause.\nJedi Lord Hoth deemed Kaan a threat and left Coruscant to make his own little army. Kaan made everyone a Dark Lord, however, he did not let anyone take the title of Darth because only he held that title. \nJedi Lord Hoth formed the Army of Light, their purpose was to hunt Sith, this war lasted a decade. It was considered an all-out war, but the Republic deemed it as a series of battles against an illegal organization. The Sith retook their home by winning the “Battle of Korriban”. Kaan Re-established the ‘Sith Academy’. He placed Sith Warlord Qordis there to oversee the training of the next generation of Sith.\n\n# Nearing the End\nKaans’ next target was Ruusan, he had the Sith fleet lay a devastating blow on the planet, the planet had weak defenses which allowed an easy first victory during the Battle of Ruusan. During the second Battle of Ruusan, the Sith pushed the Jedi back, and Kaan decided to launch an invasion of the Bormea Sector. However, the Jedi weren’t at the core, Jedi Lord Hoth decided to gather the Army of Light and launch a full-scale attack on Ruusan to finish off the Brotherhood. By the time of the Fourth Battle of Ruusan, Kaan was outnumbered but still believed they could pull through. Jedi Githany defected and gave the Sith vital information on the Jedis’ attack strategy.\nBane was against Kaans’ strategies, he believed that Kaan was acting like a commander more than a Dark Lord of the Sith, and also believed he wasn’t using the dark side properly. Lord Kaan tried killing Bane, unfortunately, it didn’t work and Bane survived. Lord Kaan eventually accepted Bane’s advice, and the members of the Brotherhood meditated and focused their energy on Bane. Lord Kaan and other members became overconfident and decided to break their meditation because they believed the Jedi were weak and they could just finish them off. He also believed Bane was taking advantage of them.\n\n","meta":{"index":194,"author":"Renjaal","name":"Lord Kaan","release_year":2023}},"Bendu":{"content":"# Biography\nBendu was an individual who represented the equilibrium between the light and dark side of the Force. Residing on the planet Atollon, Bendu was a large creature of unknown origin who advocated for neutrality, believing that he should not directly involve himself with conflicts. He did not concern himself with directly influencing Jedi or Sith ideals, and rather just assisted any force-sensitives by providing them with guidance and wisdom. This is demonstrated with his actions towards Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus and his Padawan Erza Bridger, guiding them onto the path of success.# Mentoring the rebels\nBendu was awoken on Atollon after years by Kanan’s imbalance and stress from the thought of Erza turning to the dark side. After losing his sight to Maul in the Mission of Malachor, Kanan Jarrus was given knowledge by Bendu on how to use his other sensory abilities to replicate his vision. To assist Kanan with his sight, Bendu had him confront multiple krykna, which were spider-like predators native to Atollon. Kanan’s fear caused creatures to attack violently, but after careful concentration he was able to subdue and befriend them. \n\nBendu also served as a guide to Erza Bridger on multiple occasions, providing him with a warning of the consequences of converging a Jedi and Sith holocron. The quest he sent both the Jedi Knight and his Padawan on to retrieve the Sith holocron from the caves allowed them to bond further, teaching Erza to forgive himself and to make peace.\n\n# Personality and abilities\nAlthough Bendu maintained his composure and generally expressed insightful advice, he could have regular emotions which was shown by his anger towards Jarrus for calling him a coward. This was in reference to Grand Admiral Thrawn’s attack on Atollon, where Jarrus pleaded for his assistance where Bendu initially refused. Bendu also believed that only the individual was capable of change, and objects like Holocrons could not influence one towards good or evil. \n\nBendu possessed the ability to sense nearby Force wielders, and could teleport himself at will across the entirety of Atollon. Manipulating lightning strikes was also extremely easy for Bendu, as he used it to destroy multiple AT-AT walkers. He is not invulnerable however, as cannon fire from walkers was able to subdue him on the ground. Bendu could also predict events like Thrawn’s defeat at the hand of Erza Bridger on Lothal.\n\n","meta":{"index":187,"author":"purebourne","name":"Bendu","release_year":2023}},"Bastila Shan":{"content":"# Overview\nBastila Shan was a female human and an extremely talented Jedi Master. Bastila Shan started as a Jedi Sentinel and progressed through the ranks after saving Darth Revan, who was corrupted by the Eternal Emperor. Revan and Bastila figured out that they shared an extremely powerful Force bond that kept each other alive. Bastila was born on the planet Talravin. Her mother was Helena Shan and her father was an obsessed treasure hunter. Helen left the Jedi Order to give Bastila the best possible life and her father also cared dearly for her but he wanted to take her out on his treasure hunts. However, Helen disapproved of this and told Bastila’s father that the hunts were too dangerous. When Bastila joined the Order she was in charge of a Jedi strike team to save the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Revan, and his apprentice, Darth Malak. They boarded Revan’s ship and then cornered Revan. After turning Revan, Revan defeated Malak and redeemed Bastila when she turned to the Dark side. Revan and Bastila got married and two years later Revan went to eliminate Sith threats in the unknown region. Unfortunately, Revan left Bastila and his unborn child due to the fact he wanted the best life for his kid. Bastila then went into hiding with her kid to raise him normally.# Dark Lord's apprentice\nMalak eventually captured the Ebon Hawk crew and put them in several different cells. They knew that Revan cared for Bastila so they tortured her even worse than the others to make Revan tell him where the Jedi Enclave was located. Revan refused to tell them leading Bastila to an immense amount of torture. The crew was freed and on their way out they fought Malak’s forces. Saul Karath told Carth Onasi about Revan’s true identity, which led Onasi to a confused and frustrated state. He demanded that Shan tell him answers but she told him she would tell him later. Malak stopped them from boarding and informed Revan of what his true identity was, and how he was mind-wiped by the Jedi Council. Bastila fought off Malak to allow Onasi and Revan to escape and find the Star Forge. Unfortunately, Shan lost the duel and he imprisoned her so that she could turn on the Jedi and become Malak’s apprentice. Malak eventually convinced Shan that the Council was using her and holding her back, so she developed a hatred towards them and became his apprentice. Shan reunited with Reva, Jolee Bindo, and Juhani and informed them that she was Malak’s new apprentice and that she would help Malak take over the galaxy. Shan couldn’t stand a chance against the three Jedi and then she realized that Revan was extremely powerful and deserved to be the real Dark Lord of the Sith. Shan tried to convince Revan to reclaim his title as Dark Lord by using the Force bond they shared. Revan then realized that Bastila was more to him than a Force bond and Shan denied this. She believed the only thing that they were was Force and power so she begged Revan to help her defeat Malak. Revan was unsure whether or not to trust her again after betraying him and joining Malak. Shan had no other choice than to accept her love for him and claimed that they could rule the galaxy as master and apprentice or something more perhaps. Shan said to Revan that she’d be “utterly yours”. Revan chose to follow the Jedi code and denied Shan. Shan retreated to the Star Forge and Revan and she had their last battle. Shan got the upper hand but couldn’t defeat Revan so she returned to the Jedi and confessed her love for him. Shan helped the Republic win the war and Revan killed his former apprentice. The Jedi then destroyed the Star Forge and the Ebon Hawk crew were honored by the Republic. Afterward, Shan and Revan settled on the planet Coruscant and got married. The Council didn’t agree with this so they left the Order. Two years later Revan went to find the remaining threats in the Unknown Regions and left Bastila and his child because he believed it was too dangerous for them...

He was a descendant of the great Sith Lord Alloysius Kallig, and he continues the Sith Lord’s legacy by restoring his bloodline to being powerful again. Darth Nox was a member of the Dark Council and the overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, which focuses on reclaiming lost artifacts and expanding the Sith’s knowledge. He served as the apprentice of the notorious Sith Lord, Darth Zash. He started as a slave and was selected to go to the Sith Academy on their home planet, Korriban. He started as the apprentice of the cruel Overseer, Harkun, and eventually met Zash, who took him in. Zash sent him on various missions to reclaim lost artifacts of the legendary Dark Lord of the Sith, Tulak Hord. Nox encountered his ancestor, Kallig, and started to drift away from Zash. As a Sith Lord, Nox was very powerful, and after Zash performed a special ritual, which was supposed to transfer her spirit to Nox’s body, Nox’s companion, Khem Val, interrupted her, and she ended up in his body. Zash’s other apprentices, Corrin and Kaal, saw the body and attacked Nox. Corrin realized that this was meant to be, so the two apprentices swore their loyalty to him.# The Sphere of Ancient Knowledge's Overlord\nThe news came to Nox via a messenger, who informed him the powerful Sith Lord Darth Thanaton had joined the Dark Council and planned to kill all of Zash’s followers. Nox then gathered his powerbase and challenged Thanaton to a Kaggath, a duel between two Sith and their powerbases for one’s rank or to humiliate them. After running away multiple times, Thanaton went to the Dark Council on Korriban to plead with them for his help and to get rid of Nox. However, Nox hunted Thanaton down and finished the kaggath in front of the council. After the death of Thanaton, Nox was promoted to Dark Council and overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge. A few Sith disagreed with Nox as a Dark Council member because he was only a Lord when he defeated Thanaton and many others worked hard to get their ranks. However, there was no one more fit to lead the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge than Darth Nox, a descendant of one of the most famous Sith in history. With the help of his ancestor, Darth Nox could expand the Sith’s knowledge and reclaim lost artifacts as he did as Zash’s apprentice. Darth Nox’s ability to communicate with Force Ghosts made him even wiser than most Sith, and he could find artifacts easier and learn more about the history of the Sith.\n\n# Powers and personality\nDarth Nox was a very powerful Dark Lord of the Sith who had an extremely rare ability to talk to Force Ghosts. He communicated with his ancestor, the legendary Alloysius Kallig. Darth Nox was a scholar of Sith history; after all, he was the Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, which required him to excel in Sith history. The Sith Lord had the power to conjure up Force-Storms as well. Darth Nox found pleasure in torturing and fighting with people. He’d often torture people who killed a member of his cult by electrocuting them. Above everything else, Darth Nox hated being talked down to. As a former slave, people always talked down to the Sith and treated him poorly. Although the Sith Lord was very corrupt, he still respected different cultures, such as the Kaleesh, and shared a strong bond with his Kaleesh apprentice, Xivhkalrainik. Darth Nox was a very ambitious Sith who sought power and victory. The young and powerful Sith Lord could stun his foes and be proficient in Force lightning abilities and a very skilled lightsaber-wielder. Darth Nox could also use the Force drain ability and was able to bind and sense Force Ghosts. The power-hungry Sith was also skilled at the long-lost Force ability, Force walk. A lot of other Siths said that he had a very powerful gift of Sith sorcery, and this was proven to be true when he defeated the powerful Darth Thanaton multiple times in the Kaggath. Darth Thanaton feared Nox, and at one point, Thanaton cowered away from him during the Kaggath. Darth Nox defeated Thanaton, and as Thanaton begged his fellow Dark Council for mercy, the Sith Lord, Darth Mortis, snapped Thanaton’s neck, claiming Darth Nox was the rightful winner of the Kaggath. Then he was appointed head of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge. After being in the Dark Council for a long time, Darth Marr didn’t trust any of his fellow council members except Darth Nox.\nThe two went on many missions together and grew fond of each other over time.

She was his company during his search for the Star Forge.# Vao's Childhood\nVao grew up as an orphan alongside her brother, Griff. Griff was a gambler and a scammer; he always was borrowing credits, which left him in many debts. When Vao was five, she moved to a planet named Taris. They got there by hiding in a starship’s cargo crate. She and her brother were living in the Lower City of Taris. She assisted a man named Zayn Carrick, a man who was accused of murdering four Jedi Padawans that were helping in Taris’ authorities with maintaining law and order. Later on, Mission was abandoned on Taris by her own brother as he had met a woman named Lena and wished to leave Taris with her.\n\n# On her own\nWhen Vao was alone, she met a Wookie named Zaalbar. Zaalbar was an outcast from Kashykk, who was harassed by a Lower City gang called the Black Vulkars. Vao and Zaalbar managed to beat up its members and scare them off, ending the harassment. Vao and Zaalbar became best friends and never had any arguments; they had a nice relation between each other and she even gave him a nickname of “Big Z”. \n\nIn 3956 BBY, Mission and Zaalbar met Revan, a former Sith Lord.

These attackers were hired by a neighboring planet engaged in a century-long war with Niorde. To protect their planet, D'harhan and a group of Niordi underwent cybernetic enhancements, transforming themselves into living artillery weapons. Despite their powerful advantage, the Niordi ultimately lost the war, leaving D'harhan as the sole surviving living weapon. Throughout his life, D'harhan shared a significant history with Boba Fett, and both held each other in high regard.# Biography\nD'harhan, the Near-Human Niordi, had an eventful life filled with transformations and alliances. Born on the mysterious planet of Niorde in the Unknown Regions, D'harhan belonged to a species engaged in a centuries-long war with a neighboring planet. The Clone Wars introduced a new threat as the Leech Legion mercenaries were hired to attack Niorde. In response, D'harhan and a select group of Niordi scouts underwent cybernetic modifications, turning themselves into living weapons to defend their homeworld. Undergoing a complex surgery, D'harhan's head was replaced with a cannon, and his brain was placed in a heavily-armored box on his chest. His limbs and spine were reinforced, and a tail was added to mitigate recoil. Following the operation, D'harhan became the sole surviving living weapon, as Niorde fell to the Leech Legions. He later ventured into the field of bounty hunting, forging a long-standing relationship with the renowned bounty hunter, Boba Fett. During their collaboration, D'harhan and Boba Fett embarked on various missions together, including the pursuit of fugitive Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ferus Olin on the planet Bellassa. Their partnership was marked by shared respect and a deep understanding of each other's abilities. In the Bounty Hunter Wars, D'harhan was recruited by Boba Fett, alongside IG-88B, Bossk, and Zuckuss. Their mission took them to Circumtore, where they confronted the treachery of the Shell Hutts. Despite initial tensions among the group, D'harhan played a crucial role in the battle against the Shell Hutts' mercenaries, using his cannon to devastating effect. However, the physical strain of his cybernetic enhancements eventually overwhelmed D'harhan. He suffered severe injuries, and Fett had to take over the weapon. In a moment of sacrifice, D'harhan allowed Fett to use the cannon to annihilate their enemies. Mortally wounded, he expressed regret for trusting Fett but acknowledged the bounty hunter's need to persevere. D'harhan's life ended in Fett's arms, leaving behind a poignant reminder of their shared history. Despite D'harhan's passing, his legacy lived on in the memories of those who crossed paths with the Niordi bounty hunter. Years later, Fett recounted the story of D'harhan's transformation to the Assembler balance sheet, highlighting the tragic yet significant role he played in their intertwined lives.\n\n# Weapon System\nD'harhan's radical transformation into a walking cannon occurred during the war on his planet. The surgical procedure involved the removal of his entire head, which was replaced with the cannon itself. Bolted to his collarbones and anchored into his chest, the cannon had  primitive gear for vertical movement. Power cylinders and cables were integrated into his body, while a saurian-like cybernetic tail provided stability during firing. D'harhan's cannon was outfitted with precise targeting sensors and indicator lights that were seamlessly integrated into his nervous system. Acting as his eyes, the sensors followed his gaze, while the indicator lights conveyed his mood—yellow for standby, orange for danger, and red when he was ready to fire. D'harhan's brain was relocated to an armored box in his midsection, protected by a thick chest plate. Communication became a challenge as he no longer had a mouth, relying instead on a small box attached to his belt. This box contained a speaker and a screen for silent word display, and a keyboard enabled him to communicate slowly with others. It was revealed by Boba Fett that cyborgs of the same type, including D'harhan, could communicate through an internal com-link network connected to their nervous systems. Even during his \"sleep\" or standby state, the cannon remained active, tracking movements and allowing D'harhan to sense approaching individuals and listen to conversations around him.\n\n","meta":{"index":122,"author":"SkyPanik","name":"D'harhan","release_year":2023}},"The Entity":{"content":"# The Entity\nThe Entity was a female Sith spirit that originated from Corellia and would soon be enslaved by a soon-to-be Dark Councilor and Sphere of Military Offense, Darth Baras. Baras would use The Entity to accommodate his power towards his ascendance to the Dark Council with her powers of precognition and farseeing. The Entity was known for almost eradicating the Jedi Order centuries before the Great Galactic War. Dark Councilor Darth Vowrawn of the Sphere of Production and Logistics had mentioned that the Entity was as old as the Force itself and was an embodiment of the Dark side. Darth Baras would come to indenture and bind the Entity to himself on Corellia sometime before the Galactic War between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. He stole the majority of her visions of the future as well as her power and energy, which he would then use to build his Empire. The Entity, of course, hated being used in this way but was unable to counter Baras due to his power.# History\nLater on, Darth Vowrawn would begin to notice a change within Darth Baras, sensing the disruption and finding out about the Entity’s enslavement. He would work for an unknown period of time in order to free the Entity from Baras’ grip. As soon as Vowrawn figured out how to free the Entity from Baras’ grip, he would act upon his plan many years later, with the appearance of the second Emperor’s Wrath, who happened to be Darth Baras’ former apprentice. However, Darth Vowrawn believed the Wrath was not aiding him in freeing the enslaved spirit until he was attacked by an assassin sent by Baras, in which the Wrath protected him. This newly constructed friendship and trust would lead both of them to an assault on Baras’ on-world base. Once the two Dark lords had reached the chambers of the Entity, they were attacked by a Cyborg named Draahg, who would place a death field upon Vowrawn. Draahg’s cybernetics powered the death field, in which the Entity told the Wrath in order to rid Vowrawn of the death field, Draahg’s death would be necessary. The Wrath decapitated Draahg after a long duel, releasing Vowrawn from the death field. Before Vowrawn freed the Entity, he made sure of whether Baras could see what had happened there, knowing he was able to observe through the eyes of the Entity. Once the Entity had been set free from their torture, she had told the Wrath to remember her before returning to the Force.\n\n","meta":{"index":30,"author":"PhaseSpectr","name":"The Entity","release_year":2022}},"Darth Drear":{"content":"# Overview\nDarth Drear was a Sith Lord of human or Sith Pureblood descent who served the reconstituted Sith Empire and created an academy on the planet Odacer-Faustin, which was a Sith academy that would last thousands of years. Drear was the head of this academy and forced his students to construct the Sith academy to the point where they died. Drear had a secret temple underneath the academy’s library where he practised Sith alchemy and searched for immortality by developing a special elixir, spreading a nasty disease that turned the infected into zombies. Unfortunately, Drear was in his temple studying alchemy when the virus spread and infected him. He was up to the final stages of the virus when this happened and was turned into a zombie before his death. Drear may have died, but his formula for the virus was kept safe in his Holocron. This Holocron was later found by Sith Lord Darth Scabrous, who was the headmaster of Drear’s academy hundreds of years later. Scabrous attempted to use the virus to make himself immortal. However, this also backfired for him because the virus spilled, and the entire academy was infected. Hestizo Trace, a Jedi, later killed Scabrous.

He had yellow eyes and was adopted on the planet Onderon. He started off as a Jedi training on the planet Ossus. His master, Matta Tremayne, was killed by him later in life. Nadd slew his master because of his lust for power which he desired. He then renounced his allegiance with the Jedi Order and started his journey to the Dark side. He then departed Ossus and made his way to the centre of the Old Sith Empire and from there he followed the Force to the moon of Yavin 4. There he found the Dark Lord Naga Sadow and Sadow trained him in the arts of the Dark side of the Force. Before then, Nadd had a broad knowledge of the Dark Force for he had spent a little while in the heart of the Old Sith Empire, studying the ways. Once he convinced himself that he learned everything he needed to from Sadow, Nadd killed him and left Yavin 4. Afterwards he searched for a planet to claim as his own and he took the title of Dark Lord of the Sith. He decided to claim Onderon and title himself as King. His reign lasted for longer than a century and once his body was entombed underneath the Royal Palace of Izziz his spirit lingered in his tomb teaching his descendants the ways of the Dark side of the Force. Nadd had a huge influence on his people that they fought over the deceased Dark Lord. However, one day a team of Jedi Knights led by Arkanian ventured to the planet of Onderon to cease the fight and placed a temporary halt on Nadd’s influence after Queen Amanoa’s defeat. However, her husband King Ommin put the Sith’s influence back in place. King Ommin then released Nadd’s spirit from the chaos and then rose the Naddist insurrection. Nadd then revealed himself to the Jedi and helped them hunt down Arca Jeth. Nadd was defeated and ashamed so Arca Jeth banished him from Onderon. Before he was banished he taught a few people of the Dark side and informed a Jedi knight, Ulic Qel-Droma, of his destiny as a Sith Lord. Nadd trained the Ketos for months revolving Sith magic until one day a lost Jedi, Exar Kun, seeked support in the Dark ways of the Force. Nadd took Exar in after trialling him and trained him in the ways of the force. Exar Kun was deemed worthy as a Sith apprentice and Nadd took him to Yavin 4 where his old master lay dead. Exar Kun embraced the Dark side and defeated a Sith wyrm and the Massassi native warriors. This pleased Nadd very much and so he showed Exar the need to create a physical body using alchemy but Kun refused. Infuriated by Nadd’s expectations, Kun betrayed him and attacked Nadd. His force powers strengthened because of a Sith amulet present and Kun was able to blast Nadd with a potent blast of Force energy, After this Nadd informed the Ketos of Kun’s betrayal and warned them about him. Before dying for the second time he announced Satal and Aleema as the future of the Sith.# Personality and Abilities\nNadd, in his younger days, was said to be a joyful and radiant young man who loved life. He was also a determined young man who manipulated the Force and was inspired to become the greatest Jedi of all time. He was confident that the masters on Ossus would promote him to Jedi Knight but when they failed him he grew furious. He demanded an explanation from his master but realised she was no use to him for the only way he could find out was if he travelled on his own. Nadd after this had a new desire, to become the most powerful Sith Sorcerer in history. Nadd after gaining a very broad knowledge of the Dark side believed that the force served him because when one embraced the Dark side they would become one with the Force and the two would become inseparable. Once he was a Sith Lord, Nadd protected himself very well. He wore heavy battle armour and a helmet, which he also used as a crown for his kingship. Nadd’s influence on his people was so powerful that even as a spirit his citizens seeked help and he trained them in the ways of Sith magic but he was also vigilant so he wouldn’t teach them so much that they surpassed his knowledge. Nadd desired a physical body after his death so he could continue to serve as a powerful Sith. As a Jedi Nadd was a scholar in the ways of the Force and impressed the masters on Ossus. He could wield some of the powers that the Jedi Masters could at a young age. His teachers all believed that he would be sitting among them before any other student. However, when the Jedi Masters informed him of his failure he went on a rampage and killed his master. Blinded by his arrogance he blamed his master for her own death. Darth Nadd placed all of his knowledge in his own holocron which a few thousand years later was found by Darth Zannah, apprentice of Darth Bane. With this knowledge he also knew about the Orbalisk parasite which fed on the Dark Force. Nadd possessed a bronze bladed lightsaber which killed many Jedi in battle. Nadd was more skilled in aspects of the Force rather than lightsaber combat. He could not exceed his master Trymane in lightsaber duels even though he could kill her. Nadd was a skilled Sith who focussed mainly on becoming a Force scholar which he did on both sides. Nadd’s Force abilities were extraordinary and were stronger than a lot of the Jedi Masters on Ossus including his own.\n\n","meta":{"index":195,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Freedon Nadd","release_year":2022}},"Darth Zannah":{"content":"# Overview\nDarth Zannah, formerly known as “Rain” during her childhood, was a Sith Lord originating from the planet Somov Rit. Zannah began her apprenticeship and journey to the Dark Side under the only remaining Dark Lord of the Sith from the New Sith Wars, Darth Bane. Instituting the Rule of Two, Darth Zannah was the first to initiate this rule under Bane and an important figure to carry this rule out. A skilled duelist and practitioner of Soresu while utilizing a double-bladed lightsaber, her strongest aspect was her usage of Sith Magic and Alchemy, becoming one of the strongest Sorcerers in Sith history. She’d equal Bane in strength and become his successor after their final duel on Ambria.# History\nCurrently known as “Rain” in her youth, Rain possessed no signs of force aptitude, however, was recruited along with her Cousins to combat the Sith after manipulating (with assistance) The Force around her. As the battle raged on Ruusan, Rain’s starship was attacked by Sith Forces causing her to be lost in the forest below. She’d befriend a “Green-Furred Bouncer” named Laa. Laa would be killed by Jedi Scouts, inducing Rain into a rage and killing them both; Darth Bane would take notice of Rain's display of anger and potential and take her as his Apprentice. Rain would then embrace her name of birth, Zannah, as everyone that knew her as Rain were all dead.\n\nZannah would be taken to the planet of Ambria to start her preliminary training, which involved ancient Sith magic that Zannah would grow incredibly prestigious in. She’d undergo numerous missions under Bane such as: manipulating the terrorist Anti-Republic Liberation Front (where she’d use the name “Rainah”)  into a botched kidnapping attempt on former Supreme Chancellor Tarsus Valorum to further incite Anarchist movements, recovering information about the origins and creation of holocrons., as well as infiltrating the Jedi Temple archives on Coruscant to obtain information about the orbalisk creatures. During this mission, her presence would be revealed and she’d flee to Tython where Bane would await her. The Sith Lords were pursued and outnumbered by the Jedi, ultimately the numbers would prove to be futile as they were Slain.\n\nThe Sith relocated to Ciutric IV, and over the course of ten years, Zannah grew to be an accomplished Sith sorceress who equaled Darth Bane in strength. Under Bane she had greatly increased her power in every aspect, she wielded a Double-bladed lightsaber primarily using Form III (Soresu) and was extremely versed and powerful in Sith Magic and Alchemy. She now found an apprentice of her own, Set Harth, replaced later by Darth Cognus and Zannah’s eventual successor. Bane and Zannah had their first duel end in a stalemate, due to the collapsing of a passageway in Stone Prison. However, their final encounter would be on the planet Ambria where her training had begun. Bane was defeated in their duel and in a last ditch effort, used Essence Transfer into Zannahs body where they’d now fight a battle of wills. She’d become victorious and banish his spirit into the Void of The Force. Darth Zannah would successfully go on to continue and enforce the Rule of Two, with her Apprentice Darth Cognus succeeding and continuing it further where it’d be firmly established for many Millennia to come.\n\n# Notable Facts\nOne of the most skilled Sorcerers in Sith history.\nCustom-Made Double Blade known as “Bane's Heart” and practitioner of Soresu.\nBlade later fell into the hands of General Grievous.\nUsed a powerful Dark Side Tendrils ability.\nSuccessfully infiltrated and retrieved Data from the Jedi Temple.\n\n","meta":{"index":166,"author":"RenavusMorningstar","name":"Darth Zannah","release_year":2022}},"Lord Simus":{"content":"# Overview\nLord Simus was a bodiless male Sith magician who served the Old Sith Empire faithfully as a Sith Councilor for a century. During his time as an aspirant of the dark lord throne, Lord Simus challenged his rival Marka Ragnos and got beheaded. By the application of Sith magic, he persisted beyond natural death. \nUnder the reign of Marka Ragnos, Lord Simus helped shape the Sith Empire in its golden age as the Dark Lord's advisor and continued to guide the Sith even after the great Ragnos eventual demise. Despite the volatile nature of the Old Sith Empire politics, Lord Simus the gray-skinned Sith had been well respected by all ancient warlords. \nWith his death, the Sith mourned and called for vengeance. Led by Naga Sadow, his apprentice, later Dark Lord of the Sith. The Old Sith Empire would have been pulled into one of the most bloody times in its history, the Great Hyperspace War.# Dark Lord Aspirant\nBorn centuries before 5000 BBY, the young and ambitious Warlord Simus grew strong in both the art of Sith sorcery and combat prowess. He accumulated wealth and power, abiding for the time that he could rise to greatness. \nFollowing the death of the previous Dark Lord of the Sith in 5150 BBY, a fierce battle among the Sith competed for the Dark Lord's mantle ensued. With Marka Ragnos as his most dangerous contender for the throne, Lord Simus challenged him into a duel and got decapitated by the hands of the Dark Lord. Although the Sith Lord got beheaded, he did not give up on his life. With his great knowledge of Sith sorcery, Lord Simus used the ancient and long-lost Sith magic to keep himself alive by preserving his head in the crystal sphere.\n\n# Sith Councilor\nAfter the ascension to the throne of Marka Ragnos, Lord Simus eventually proved himself and earned a seat on the Sith council, a sole ruling council of the Old Sith Empire. Despite losing all of his combat prowess and having to rely on servants to move him around, his wisdom, vision and cunning gained him respect from his fellow councilors. Even though he and Marka Ragnos were old rivals, Lord Simus put aside all of their previous resentments in a favor of the Empire as he advised Marka Ragnos in his many plans and aspirations.\nWhile serving as a Sith Councilor, the Lord took a Half-breed Sith named Naga Sadow as his apprentice. Naga Sadow would have been raised learning much Sith sorcery and wisdom from his master. Another which future Dark Lord of the Sith would have learned was the transgression of the Jedi and the Republic as the vision of expansion and victory of the Old Sith Empire over their Ancient enemy would be fixated upon by both the master and apprentice.\n\n# The End of the Golden Age\nOver a hundred years of stability and prosperity, the Old Sith Empire faced another inner turmoil. Eventually the deterioration of time finally caught up upon Marka Ragnos as he passed away on his deathbed. Naturally, the Sith were seeking the new Dark Lord to be their ultimate ruler. \nAmong them were the two aspirants of the Dark Lord’s mantle, Ludo Kressh and Naga Sadow. Both of them have conflicted views about the vision of the Empire. Ludo Kressh detested the expansion of the Empire as to preserve the stability, backed by many of the Sith. Naga Sadow on the other hand seeked to expand the Empire, a vision shared with his master Lord Simus. \nAfter the clash between Ludo Kressh and Naga Sadow in front of the tomb of Marka Ragnos at the sacred catacomb world, Korriban. The arrival of the scout ship of the Galactic Republic, starbreaker 12 landing on the planet sowed even more chaos. The passengers Jori and Gav Daragon were immediately arrested and put into prison at Sith Citadel on the Sith throne world, Ziost. \nDuring much deliberation and disagreement between Sith Lords, Lord Simus served as mediator between the Sith Councillors to ease tension. Him and Naga Sadow agreed upon the idea to use the Republic explorers as tools to find their ancient enemy. For the Sith to launch war against them with the aim to seize territory. \nHowever, even with wisdom and respect gained from many years sitting at the Sith Council’s throne, the majority of the councilors did not follow through with their vision and sided with Ludo Kressh. The fate of the two explorers would be execution. Lord Simus would travel to the explorers’ cell to inform the twins about their final verdict.\n\n# Death\nUnlike his master Lord Simus, Naga Sadow did not give up on his ambition. Soon to be Dark Lord of the Sith secretly set a plan which would result in war between the Galactic Republic and the Old Sith Empire into motion. \nThe old Lord Simus sensed the disturbance from the cell which held the twins. He followed and found many dead Sith, his ally Naga Sadow stood with his back turned. Lord Simus thought that this was the result of the Republic Raid and proceeded to ask Naga Sadow with worry. The apprentice turned to answer him with an apology then shot the old Sith and his servant with the Republic blaster pistol. The true death of Lord Simus.\nWith the death of his former master seemingly by the hand of the Republic, Naga Sadow was able to convince the Sith Council about the threat of their long-hated enemy. Reputation of Lord Simus earned him much respect and admiration in life. Many would go on calling the Republic “monster” for their crime against the bodiless Simus. His death not only made the council rationalize the decision to attack the republic but also induced the emotional response from the Sith.\n\n","meta":{"index":193,"author":"nuariel","name":"Lord Simus","release_year":2022}},"Darth Tormen":{"content":"# Introduction\nDarth Tormen was a male Sith pureblood with red skin and orange eyes that was known for helping during the Imperial invasion on Corellia in the Cold War with his commander expertise.

He didn’t like having his enemies easily be defeated but rather succumb to him as he was a monster only made for war, being rather ruthless to everyone. Besides his personality, he had no tolerance for failure; showing the fact that he used Force choke and killed the remaining bridge crew after his flagship he was on was attacked.\n\nHe would often charge towards anyone who fought him and ruthlessly assault his adversaries even if he was outmatched. He wielded a single-bladed lightsaber and was capable of telekinesis and Force rage. He retained a flag-ship for himself and taught an apprentice, a female pureblood named Vindis before she eventually became a Sith Lord.# History\nAround the Cold War, Sith Lord Fatalissar requested a Kaggath against Tormen. When he was announcing Ziost to be the arena where the Kaggath takes place, \nTormen decapitated Fatalissar in close range with no remorse while he was still debating.\n\nAfter that event, he invited the latest survivor and champion of the Great Hunt for a mission to his flagship, the Tyrant. Tormen was furious when the hunter refused to drop his weapons and killed his welcoming party in self-defense. He would give the hunter a significant sum for the completion of his mission and even give the chance for revenge as the targets, Sero and Janarus were accountable for a framing. He would have to lure them down from Coruscant to Corellia. Before they could do anything, they would have to take down another two targets that would try to destroy their plan.\nWhen he was successful the hunter returned to the flagship upon Tormen’s request. While they were on it Republic Special Forces managed to invade the ship, the attack was sudden and a majority of the crew were scattered off in different locations of the flagship, Tyrant. They managed to take back control of the ship, Tormen terminated the remaining crew after finding out that the captain was already dead. After that event, still, on the flagship, Tormen explained his plan to lure the targets. He tells the hunter what consequences they will bear and they come up with a plan. They would find three high-ranked leaders in the resistance and make them unwillingly sign a compromise. As Corellia was protected by Imperial rule, Janarus wouldn’t be scared to approve the treaty while Sero would convince him to assemble the green jedi and take it upon the battlefront instead of thinking straight.\n\nEventually, the plan took place. Tormen sent the hunter out to terminate Sero while he stayed where the treaty was supposed to happen and awaited the group of Green Jedi Sero dispatched. Tormen slaughtered them all with ease and informed the hunter beforehand on how to enter Janarus’ ship, the Founder. Janarus tried to bargain with the hunter by listing Tormen’s war crimes but he refused his offer and killed him.

He started to go around torturing people in public so he could feed his powers and grow stronger. One day when Vitiate was ten he stripped his real father, Lord Dramath, a powerful Sith, from the force and made him go insane. At thirteen the current Dark Lord of the Sith at that time, Marka Ragnos, took him in and gave him the title Lord Vitiate. He then spent years studying the dark side of the force; some called him a scholar since he was that knowledgeable. In a few years he became the most powerful Sith of his time and any before and he used this power to strip the force from the planet Nathema and the Sith Lords on it. Vitiate was able to forge giant force storms and use the force lightning during battles and could transfer his consciousness to other bodies. He used this to possess children so he could make an army of force wielders and used the same mind trick of Revan and Malak, making them his puppets. He was so skilled at telekinesis that he didn’t even need hand gestures to help just by thinking he could throw Revan across the throne room.

The Revanchist, honored as the Revan, reviled as Revan the Butcher, dreaded as Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Revan, and praised as the Prodigal Knight. Revan was once one of the most important people in the galaxy for both Jedi and Sith, who took a prestigious and essential part in the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War.# Life and Conflict\nRevan was born on the Outer Rim sometime during the year 3994 BBY, joining the Jedi Order and training under a subsequent number of Jedi Masters as a Jedi Padawan. Few of these notables would be Jedi Master & Historian Kreia, who would have a profound impact on his philosophy and ideas as a Jedi. He would later meet a fellow Jedi student and aspirant named Alek, quickly becoming very close friends and even confidants. He would soon become a Jedi Knight and also become one of its most vocal and charismatic members as a very outstanding critic of the Jedi Order’s inactivity and relative isolation from the Galactic Republic’s conflict in the Mandalorian Wars against the Mandalorian clans. \n\nIn opposition and defiance of the Jedi Council, he would take up the name Revan and don the mask of a fallen Mandalorian who opposed Cassus Fett’s genocide, leading the Revanchists in aiding the Republic’s military arm subsequently being appointed Supreme Commander. He would be a renowned tactician, strategically outweighing the brutal offensives of his adversary, Mandalore the Ultimate. Eventually, he would lure the Mandalorian forces into a decisive battle off the planet of Malachor V in 3960 BBY, slaying Mandalore the Ultimate aboard his ship and destroying the Mandalorians with the Mass Shadow Generator. This victory would leave him in disdain and he with his friend Alek, now known as Malak, would venture to the Unknown Regions in search of the True Sith upon which they would discover the Sith Emperor and his remade Sith Empire, who would turn them to the Dark Side of the Force converting them into new Dark Lords of the Sith, Darth Revan, and Darth Malak.\n\nThe new Sith Lords would begin their sweeping conquests unto the Republic, eventually breaking free of the Emperor’s control over their minds and seizing the Star Forge; an ancient superweapon made by the Rakata fueled by the Dark Side which allows for the production of an armada of ships and weapons, Revan and Malak would ignite the Jedi Civil War with their advances unto the Republic which at its climax, would result in Malak’s betrayal against Revan and Revan’s subsequent capture by Jedi Knight Bastilla Shan, who would form a Force bond with her captive.\n\n# Rebirth and Death\nWith his memory gone and erased, Revan would be given the identity of a Republic soldier on board the ship Endar Spire, which would soon find itself under attack by Revan’s former apprentice, Darth Malak. Malak’s attack on Taris would be an attempt to capture Bastilla Shan however to no avail. Revan and his companions along with Republic officer Carth Onasi would find Shan and escape Taris successfully before Malak could level the surface of the planet.\n\n Upon escaping Taris, Revan and his companions would head to Dantooine, retraining as a Jedi Padawan within the Jedi Enclave there. He would be tasked with locating the Star Maps, ancient relics made by the Rakata to illustrate the path to the Star Forge. However, soon Malak would capture the group and reveal Revan’s true identity, as well as take Shan captive. This would force Revan and his companions to locate the Star Forge by themselves which would be successful. Aboard the Star Forge, Revan would confront a corrupted Shan and bring her back to the Light Side of the Force, revealing his love for her and successfully defeating Malak. This would earn Revan the Cross of Glory and the title of Prodigal Knight. \n\nRevan would marry Shan and live a life of relative obscurity hidden for several years until his memories would return to him prompting him to leave his wife and unborn child behind to once again begin his search in the Unknown Regions. \nThe Sith would capture and hold him imprisoned for three years until his former lieutenant and unofficial apprentice, Meetra Surik, would break him free with the help of the Sith Lord, Scourge. Their attempt to kill the Sith Emperor would fail and he would be kept under constant torture for three hundred long years until he would be freed by Republic forces. With this, he would take control of a Rakatan Foundry, building an army of extermination droids to end the Sith Empire once and for all, before he was promptly killed by an Imperial strike team.\n\n# Revenge and Legacy\nDespite his death, Revan persisted. His torture at the hands of the Sith Emperor during those three hundred years would shatter and split his mind into two, the Light Side of Revan would try to be one with the Force, however, his Dark Side would stubbornly resist clinging on to life as he rejected and cheated death fully embracing the Dark Side of the Force. He would take control over the Revanites or the Order of Revan, with the goal of ending the Sith Empire and bringing back the Sith Emperor into a physical form to kill him. Seeing the possibilities of this cataclysmic plan, the Republic and the Empire would join forces to stop Revan and his Order, with the Light Side also taking part in the coalition as it wished to acclimate to the Cosmic Force. The Sith Emperor would regain his strength, and the two halves of Revan would merge into one; dying one last death. \n\n\tRevan’s spirit continued to aid the struggle against the Sith Emperor which would in the end succeed once and for all, ending the turmoil and allowing for Revan to be one with the Force. His legacy would not end there, as subsequent Sith Lords such as Darth Rivan; a mistranslation of his name would attempt to take up his mold, and Darth Bane would travel to the planet of Lehon in seeking out Revan’s holocron, which would become fundamental to his development of the Rule of Two.\n\n","meta":{"index":190,"author":"C_aladria","name":"Darth Revan","release_year":2022}},"Death Trooper Pik":{"content":"# Overview\nPik was a human male Death Trooper who served the Imperial Navy under the command of the brilliant Chiss Grand Admiral Thrawn.

They were deployed on Aloxor to search for a missing freighter. Pik and Waffle were sent to protect Ronan and Vanto, both of which they despised. Death Troopers weren’t a fan of traitors to the Empire and only had respect for those who earned it, mainly those who they served under. Pik didn’t see much in Ronan due to his constant complaints towards Thrawn, and they didn’t respect Vanto much either because he left the Empire for the Chiss Expansionary Defence Fleet. What they didn’t realise was that Thrawn sent Vanto. Pik and his fellow Trooper Waffle showed courage on their mission with Vanto and Ronan.

Merf, a devoted Freely, took part in a risky ransom plot in which his crew abducted famed Rebel commander Leia Organa and attempted to sell her back to the Alliance for a hefty ransom in 1 ABY.\nHowever, a group of Stormtroopers quickly surrounded the Freelies' lair, Organa managed to flee during the gunbattle, and Merf and his friends were left with nothing.# Biography\nMerf, a male Vorzydiak, was a native of the Vorzyd V world in the outer rim, also called \"The Gambler's World.\" By 1 ABY, Merf had joined the Freelies, a group of troubled young people led by a Human named Jax. Merf and his companions were well-known for prowling the grimy alleys of the capital city of Efavan in search of scores when they came across a pair of roaming, valuable-looking droids one evening. Merf and the group tried to take C-3PO and R2-D2 for themselves but quickly discovered they had forgotten the tool they needed to free C-3PO from his restraints. This allowed R2-D2 enough time to summon a police droid, which chased the Freelies away.  \n\nHowever, once the Freelies entered a weapons store with the intention of pulling a prank, Merf and his companions soon ran into those same droids again.\nThe Freelies were persuaded to keep their distance by the droids' use of automated defensive weaponry, which quickly malfunctioned and caused damage to the shop. Instead, they stayed back and followed the droids to the spacecraft Luke Skywalker, a rebel hero, owned. Leia Organa, a famous Rebel leader, was taken there by the Freelies after they deceived C-3PO into letting them board. They brought her back to their stronghold and demanded five million credits in exchange for her safe return to the Alliance.  \n\nHowever, the Freelies' intentions were seriously derailed when Bemmie was taken hostage by Imperial Stormtroopers who were also searching for Organa.\nSkywalker saved Bemmie from horrifying torment, and the appreciative Vorzydiak guided Skywalker back to the Freelie lair. The two parties were briefly forced to join forces when the hideout was invaded by a squad of Stormtroopers, despite Jax's refusal to trust Skywalker. Once he made contact with the commander of the troops, Jax intended to sell Skywalker and Organa. However, Bemmie managed to direct the Rebels to a covert exit from the hideout, saving them from Merf and the Freelies' plans.\n\n# Personality and Traits\nMerf was a devoted member of the Freelies gang, obeying Jax's orders and adhering to the group's belief that the most crucial thing was for the Freelies to be left alone. Merf lusted after the two droids C-3PO and R2-D2, and he found it difficult to imagine what it would be like actually to have two droids of his own.\n\n","meta":{"index":162,"author":"iMirones","name":"Merf","release_year":2022}},"Lord Scourge":{"content":"# Overview\nLord Scourge was a male pureblood Sith who served as a Lord in Vitiate’s reconstituted Sith Empire. He later became the Emperor’s Wrath, a title that made him one of the highest ranked members of the Sith Empire. The Emperor’s Wrath was a title given to one by the Emperor to help the Emperor by being his personal enforcer. The Emperor’s Wrath was one of the very few people who could actually talk face-to-face with the Emperor. Lord Scourge was an advanced Sith for his time. He excelled in the Sith Academy and served under the legendary Darth Revan. He was sent to Dromund Kaas to help find the one who attempted to assassinate Darth Nyriss, a member of the Dark Council. He later found out that it was Darth Xedrix and then he killed him. Nyriss was deceiving him in order to test his loyalty to the Emperor. Nyriss showed Scourge the Emperor draining life from his home planet, Nathema. Fueled by anger Scourge joined Jedi Masters Revan and Surik but soon he figured out that a different Jedi was going to kill the Emperor, through a vision and so he betrayed the two Jedi. Scourge served as the Emperor’s Wrath for three centuries killing the Emperor’s enemies. Only when the Galactic War started did Scourge find the Jedi destined to kill the Emperor, the Hero of Tython. Scourge pledged his allegiance to the Jedi and betrayed the Sith in order to kill the Emperor. Since he had an important role in the defeat of the Emperor, Scourge was awarded the Republic’s Cross of Glory.# Loyalty\nHe started by pledging his loyalty to the Sith but later changed. Scourge was a young Sith and already excelled at the Sith Academy which proved to the Dark Council that he was already a powerful and knowledgeable Sith. The Dark Council chose him to find the one who tried to assassinate Darth Nyriss because of this and only to show Scourge what the Emperor did to Nathema. This was when Scourge started to oppose the Emperor but obviously he didn’t have the power to kill such a powerful immortal. Scourge had a vision that showed him of a Jedi who would kill the Emperor and so he joined forces with Masters Meetra Surik and Revan. He served under Revan until he realised that Revan wasn’t the Hero of Tython who’d kill the Emperor and so he went back to serving the Emperor and for three centuries he slaughtered all of the Emperor’s enemies serving as the Emperor’s Wrath. Scourge ended up encountering the Hero of Tython and joined forces with him to get his revenge on the Emperor. He went to the Jedi Masters on Tython, which included the Grandmaster Satele Shan, and he informed them of the Emperor’s plans. He joined the Jedi and obeyed the order Grandmaster Shan set him and completed the tasks to prove his loyalty. Scourge feared that if he went to help the Hero kill the Emperor he would fall under the influence of the Emperor again so he could only offer to fly the Hero and his crew to him and from there the crew fought their way through to the Emperor and the Hero killed him. Scourge refused to join the Jedi and couldn’t return to the Sith because of what he did so he remained an ally of the Hero’s, who became a Jedi Master, and helped him in battles amid the Galaxy.\n\n# Personality and Abilities\nScourge was an ambitious Sith who starved for power before he became an immortal. He was arrogant but powerful and had dignity. These, however, were the only emotions he showed and possibly had. The Emperor performed a ritual on Scourge which stripped his emotions and humanity in order to make him an immortal. Scourge finally got his emotions back after the death of the Emperor and remembered what companionship felt like. Scourge despised selfishness and greed and was intelligent and cunning. He also thought of the Jedi as weak due to their merciful actions. Unlike most Sith Scourge devoted himself to things that were bigger than himself and didn’t require personal gain. Scourge was a natural at torturing and interrogating people and so he used the Dark Force to help him torture foes. He could sense people around him and used a lot of telekinesis powers in combat. He used the Force to boost his speed and agility to help in combat and used the Dark Force to conceal himself from his enemies and keep himself warm. He used the Force to guide his lightsaber when he threw it in order to kill his target enemy. Scourge was an expert in lightsaber combat and in the ways of the Force. He mastered the forms Soresu, Joyu and Ataru. During combat he would hit his foes with two handed strikes, sweeping blows and he could unarm his opponents with his lightsaber. He transferred lightning to his fist so that he could punch his enemies and deal critical damage. He was so skilled with lightsabers that in the academy even the instructors feared duelling him. But most of all Scourge could gain strength from his foes' emotions and devour their fear and anger. Scourge couldn’t gain strength when fighting droids because they had no emotions so he had to overcome his weakness and was able to fight droids just as well as any other Sith.\n\n","meta":{"index":106,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Lord Scourge","release_year":2022}},"Darth Talon":{"content":"# Overview\nDarth Krayt's One Sith contained an adult female Lethan Twi'lek named Darth Talon, who was the female castle's first Sith Lady.Talon was adorned with black Sith tattoos covering her body, including her head and lekku, each of these tattoos has been made by Krayt himself and had been inscribed with his own mark. While still a Sith apprentice, she was trained under a fellow Twi'lek Sith Lord named Darth Ruyn, who she later killed on Krayt's order with a swift decapitating strike of her lightsaber, shortly before ascending to the status of a full-fledged Sith in Krayt's Order. The Dark Lord, Krayt, recognizing Talon's unwavering loyalty, anointed her as one of his Hands, thereby allowing the Dark Lord to truly interact with her. With this responsibility, Talon found herself working alongside Darth Nihl, a counterpart of hers from the Hand organisation.\n \nTalon took part in many of her Master's most important missions, including the capture of Cade Skywalker, the fugitive Jedi, and his training in the methods of the Dark Side of the Force, until Talon's apprentice renounced the One Sith. In spite of Darth Wyyrlok's unsuccessful attempt to take over the One Sith from Talon after her lord Darth Krayt’s supposed death, Talon remained loyal to her lord Darth Krayt. She assisted Krayt in his recuperation, as well as combating the Sith that stood between Krayt, during which she and Nihl witnessed his return to power. In the end, when Darth Krayt was finally defeated during the Battle of Coruscant, she as well as the rest of the One Sith entered hiding. By concealing their activities, the One Sith continued to achieve their objectives.# Training\nLethan Twi'lek Darth Talon was a third-generation Sith, raised and taught at the Sith Academy on Korriban, an ancient Sith Burial world of the One Sith. She was honed in her unique Force- sensitive abilities under the tutelage of Darth Ruyn. Psychologically, she was cultivated to be completely receptive to the One Sith's teachings. Although Talon's first loyalty was to the founder of her order, Darth Krayt, the Dark Lord of the Sith and emperor of the new Sith Empire. On the cusp of completing her training, Talon found herself deeply engrossed in the Dark Side of the Force. The final test of loyalty for Talon would be to kill Ruin cold-bloodedly. Darth Krayt's apprentice did not hesitate to kill her formerMaster without question since she had no choice other than to obey his orders. Having completed her final rite of passage, Talon was elevated to the rank of Hand, confirming her status as one of the Emperor's most trusted assassins. In her first mission as a Hand, Darth Talon was given the task of locating and capturing Princess Marasiah Fel in order to lure the deposed Emperor Roan Fel from hiding.\n\n# Personality & Traits\nDarth Talon was  cold and dispassionate, Talon's lack of passion was due to her undying loyalty, a unique trait to herself.. Darth Krayt instructed her to do what he asked of her without question or hesitation. This was evident when she decapitated her Mentor Darth Ruyn upon receiving the orders to do so. She was unmerciful like most Sith and kept Elke Vetter alive only for as long as she needed to find Marasiah Fel, except for the short time necessary to hunt down the criminal. While dedicated to the Rule of One, she was not in a position to care about her own life, as it was revealed to Cade Skywalker during her training that she would rejoice in her death when his training was complete, if such was Darth Krayt's will. \n\nThough she was a powerful and respected member of the Sith Order, it was clear that she was never meant to rule, for she was a fanatic like most Sith and did not possess the ability or desire to lead as Darth Nihl did, nor did she possess his independent thought. As such, she became one of the Sith working under Nihl's command to sabotage the galactic governments.\n\n# Weapon of choice\nAs with most Sith, Darth Talon possessed a single crimson-bladed lightsaber that served as her primary weapon. This instrument was elongated and notched with crisscrossed grooves on the surface. The Lightsaber was formed of Coral akin to that of her fellow One Siths.\n\n# Powers & Abilities\nThe combat skills of Talon were without a doubt amongst the best of the One Sith. As previously mentioned, her skill at fighting was further entailed in the fact that she was anointed as one of Darth Krayt's hands, as in the following example. TheDarth Talondemonstrated her ability in lightsaber combat by defeating two Jedi known as Shado Vao and Wolf Sazen simultaneously on Vendaxa, showing her aprotic knowledge of the weapon. Princess Fel, who just happened to be nearby, prevented Talon from killing Master Sazen but only by a last minute change of heart. The fact that she was known to perform acrobatic flips and leaps when using a lightsaber could indicate that she was using the Ataru FormThe fact that she had often, if not always, fought with one hand suggests some application of Makashi to her style of self-defence. Due to her fighting skills, her rank as a hand, as well as her innate skills as a Sith, she had a status high above the majority of the Sith. It is also important to mention that Talon was a skilled practitioner of Force techniques such as Force lightning, with which she executed the Imperial Knight Elke Vetter. To verbally reveal crucial information to Vetter, she used a Force technique in which she summoned a light circle of cyan from within herself into the path of her adversary on the ground.\n\nIn return, she was able to manipulate the minds of beasts to aid her in combat with the Jedi. Her strength was such that she was once able to push Shado Vao to the ground with such force that he was unable to recover for quite a while. In addition, she was able to sense Darth Krayt's life force and free him from stasis with the help of force lightning, which she accomplished with no trouble.\n\n","meta":{"index":47,"author":"2lu0","name":"Darth Talon","release_year":2022}},"Kyle Katarn":{"content":"# Introduction\nKyle Katarn, member of the New Jedi Order, was a Force-sensitive rebel who later became a Jedi. Originally he was an Imperial officer but ultimately joined the Rebellion. For the Rebellion he did various secret tasks, the most important one being the sabotage of the Dark Trooper Project. He was later informed about his Force sensitivity and he self taught himself how to use it. He faced the Dark Side twice and eventually became a Jedi Master. Ultimately, after participating in the Yuuzhan Vong war, he became a member of the Jedi High Council.# Biography\nKyle Katarn, born in 23 BBY, was the son of farmers from the Sullust colony moon of Sulon. He spent time with his father in their workshop where they repaired or made machines. Katarn joined the Imperial Academy in 5 BBY to help financially and gain knowledge. During his four-year engineering training, Kyle discovered his natural gift for cybernetics and information engineering. He was trained in piloting, martial arts, and shooting. Katarn's Omega Exercise, a raid on a Rebel asteroid base, led to him knowing about his Force potential.\n\nKyle researched the Empire's tradition of \"walking the edge\" during their graduation and discovered that 36 cadets had died falling from the cliffside. He was assigned to lead a group, but no casualties occurred. Kyle was decorated with the Medal of Valor. After the ceremony, Kyle was invited to dinner with his family, to which he reluctantly accepted. He received an official message announcing his father's death in a suspected Rebel raid on his homeworld, leading to a hatred towards the Rebellion. Katarn accepted a position in the special operations division of the Imperial Army and became a Second Lieutenant.\n\nOrs, a member of the Alliance Intelligence, showed Katarn footage from the Battle of the G-Tap, which led Katarn to hate the Empire. He discovered that the Imperials had staged the attack using Imperial tactics. Katarn threw off his Medal of Valor. Kyle helped Ors repair her ship and she admired his knowledge and confidence. He confessed his desire to join the Alliance and Ors invited him to join her team. An anonymous email advised him to be prepared for consequences. Kyle realized it was sent from Nathan. He felt guilty for betraying Nathan's confidence but not forgetting the reason that made him leave. Kyle initially took the lead and offered to start the ship until Ors arrived. However, the pressure doors were closed, and the Controller didn't work. Kyle activated repulsors and had Waller shoot at another ship to force the Controller to open the doors. Jan collapsed due to oxygen loss, and he moved the ship towards her. Rosco brought Jan on, and Kyle lifted them up.\n\nOrs introduces Kyle to Mon Mothma, the Alliance leader, who explained his father's truth and the Empire's Death Star. Mothma proposed a mission to infiltrate an Imperial facility, to retrieve schematics to identify a weak spot.  This begins Kyle's career as a Rebel-sympathetic mercenary and spy. Katarn is still haunted by the loss of his father and seeks the one responsible for his death. One year after the Battle of Endor, he is contacted by an administrative droid to attend a meeting in Rimmer's Rest on Nar Shaddaa. Upon arrival, it is revealed that his father was killed by Jerec, a Dark Jedi with ambitions of restoring the Empire. Katarn uses telekinesis to reclaim a holodisk, which falls down the abyss. Ors follows his tracks and rescues Katarn, who suffers a blaster wound and concussion. Katarn is brought to the medical frigate Mercy, where he receives high-priority treatment . Ors visits him in Tank 23 and discovers Kyle secretly keeps a 3-D snapshot of her in his wallet, whispering her love to him.\n\nKatarn, unconscious in a medical bed, sees a vision with the spirit of Jedi Qu Rahn. Qu Rahn tells him about Jerec's murder and the connection between the two with the Valley of the Jedi. The figure reveals that he was watching over Kyle and instructs him to return to his home and use the holodisk to learn the ways of the Jedi. Katarn reactivates their family droid and loads the disk, revealing his father's message and a green-bladed lightsaber belonging to Qu Rahn. He embarks on a journey to locate the Valley of the Jedi and protect it from a faction of Dark Jedi led by Jerec. Katarn infiltrates Jerec's tower in Barons Hed and locates the droid, who created a digitized version of the map. He defeats Yun, one of Jerec's dark pupils, but is soon attacked and has to escape without either version of the map. \n\nIn Ruusan, Katarn infiltrated Jerec's outpost and defeated Dark Jedi Maw, who revealed Jan Ors was dead. Jerec confronted Katarn, revealing Jan's captured and not dead. Katarn refused to join him, but Jerec blasted him with dark side energy trapping him inside. Katarn was unconscious, and two remaining Dark Jedi pulled him out. Boc, another Dark Jedi, destroyed Katarn's lightsaber before leaving to assist Jerec. Katarn defeated Sariss and rescued Ors from the Valley of the Jedi.  Katarn struck Boc with the ancient dark side technique known as spear of midnight black, revealing his identity as a Jedi. Kyle Katarn faced Jerec's Dark Master, who had already begun using the power from the Valley of the Jedi. Katarn defeated Jerec with a light-side technique that disrupted his connection to the Force. Jerec tried to turn Katarn to the dark side by reminding him of his father's murder, but Katarn showed mercy and tossed the Dark Jedi his saber. Jerec attacked Katarn again, but Katarn's counter strike killed Jerec.\n\nKatarn returned to Skywalker after refusing to become his apprentice twice due to his fear of the Dark Side. He became a Jedi Master and an instructor at Skywalker's Academy. He trained Jaden Korr and Rosh Penin in the Jedi ways. When a Dark Jedi cult called the Disciples of Ragnos threatened the galaxy, Katarn and his apprentices investigated various worlds. They discovered that the leader of the cult was Tavion Axmis, a former apprentice of Desann. Katarn's investigations revealed that Axmis planned to  resurrect the ancient Sith Lord Marka Ragnos. Katarn and Jaden Korr investigated Vjun, the site of Darth Vader's castle. They were forced to split up when Katarn's perch dropped out and he fell down several floors. Korr overcame Penin and escaped with Penin. Katarn promoted Jaden Kor to Jedi Knight. Katarn received a transmission from Penin pleading for help, and he telepathically urged Jaden to spare Penin's life. Jaden pardoned Penin's life and fought Alora. Katarn ordered Jaden to aid the Jedi on Korriban and rushed Penin off to a medical facility. Katarn became the Academy's most respected Jedi Battlemaster, educating many other Knights and fighting in the Third Battle of Yavin.\n\nAfter years of service he became a member of the Jedi High Council and continued to fight for the Order for many more years.\n\n# Personality and Traits\nKyle appeared to be a cold emotionless person but the truth was he actually was concerned about others well being, even if he was very independent. From a very young age he demonstrated his interest in engineering in which he had talent. After joining the academy, he was trained in martial arts, piloting and shooting. He also demonstrated high capacities in cybernetics. His emotionless appearance made him a very respected cadet in the academy. During a mission, Kyle learned about his father’s death which made him change. He no longer cared for the Empire nor his peers. He then joined the Rebellion and did various missions with his companion Jan Ors. Kyle wasn't very keen on teamwork however he always cared for Jan’s safety. They eventually became a couple after Kyle finally understood Jan’s feelings for him. He then came to know he was Force sensitive, which he trained by himself. This led to him almost falling to the Dark Side various times but Jan brought him back various times. He was reluctant to use the Force due to this but ultimately decided to use it as he understood the Force isn't bad, it's only bad depending on the user's objective.\n\n# Powers and abilities\nKyle was proficient in the use of various weapons in addition to his training in the academy he became capable of using any weapon he found. He also was an excellent marksman which made him a that not only in close combat but also in ranged combat. His connection with the Force made him form intuition without him knowing. Once his connection deepened, he was capable of seeing visions, using telekinesis and eventually, stopping time. Even if he self taught how to fight with lightsabers, he was one of the most respected Jedi Masters. In the Valley of the Jedi, he learned lost techniques such as the Flowing Water attack and became a master of Djem So. He was also capable of using Ataru as his secondary form. In addition, him being ambidextrous made him capable of wielding two sabers or a saber and a blaster. Despite knowing the dangers of the Dark Side, Kyle used various techniques such as Force Grip or Force Lighting. However, he was also powerful in the light side, being capable of using  Force Absorb and Force Protection.\n\n","meta":{"index":183,"author":"Craked10","name":"Kyle Katarn","release_year":2023}},"Darth Wredd":{"content":"# Section 1\nDarth Wredd was a male Sith Lord who was part of the One Sith Order.

He was described as  humble and protective of his people and always sought  justice to those who used the ways of violence.\n\n# Section 3\nEven though the man who became “Darth Wredd” may have been able to stand his ground if anyone threatened his people and had force-sensitive abilities, this did not stop everyone from harming his people. During the final years of the Second Imperial Civil War, the Galactic Empire and One Sith Order would invade the planet. In the onslaught, Wredd would come to fight a Sith Lord in a 1-on-1 duel. The Sith Lord would defeat Wredd but ultimately spare him, noticing his potential in the force. The Sith Lord would decide to take Wredd as his apprentice and force him to watch his world be used for testing a bioweapon. Ultimately, the planet would be knocked off its course. The Sith Lord would force Wredd to wear a mask and adopt the name of Darth Wredd. Wredd would never forgive his master for these actions, and deep down, he swore he would kill his master.\n\n# Section 4\nWredd would notice an opportunity to kill after the death of Darth Krayt on Coruscant. A Triumvirate ship would enter the Surd Nebula, where Darth Wredd and his master would be waiting on their flagship. Wredd would ultimately convince his master to open fire on the Triumvirate ship, ultimately making it crash on the rogue planet of Mala. There they would kill the remaining Triumvirate crew and duel an Imperial Knight. During the duel, Wredd’s master would overpower the knight, who was about to do the killing blow until Wredd struck him down. Wredd would imprison the knight on the planet and take the knight's armor, impersonating him as an Imperial Knight. Due to these actions, Wredd would cut all ties to the One Sith Order.\n\n# Section 5\nWredd would impersonate an Imperial Knight but ultimately be caught due to his mischievous actions. Wredd would set his eyes on destroying the One Sith Order, and he would create his own order. Wredd created a plan to lure the Fel Empire to the rogue planet of Mala and trap them. Ultimately, the imperials would fall for the bait, but the One Sith Order caught wind of this and decided to end both the Fel Empire and the Darth Wredd insurgency at the same time. The One Sith Order would invade with a massive force, outnumbering the Imperial Knights and Wredd’s forces. The Imperials and Wredd’s forces would team up and make a final stand against the One Sith Forces. Ultimately the Imperial Knights combat prowess saved the day and One Sith Order was no-more. When Empress Fel was distracted by treating a wounded soldier, Wredd would take his chances on assassinating the Empress. He would be intervened by his “supposebly” apprentice, Jao Assam. Wredd would be pursued by Jao to the edge of a cliff, who would chop off both of Wredd’s hands in his anger. Wredd would taunt Jao to kill him, as that was the final step to the darkside. Jao realized what Wredd was up to and decided not to  kill him. Wredd would plead with Jao to kill him, as that would end the Sith Order. Wredd’s wishes would ultimately be granted as he was shot by a new-found friend, Ania Solo. With Wredd gone, the Sith Order was no more for now.\n\n","meta":{"index":135,"author":"Mus8732","name":"Darth Wredd","release_year":2024}},"Blevin":{"content":"# Overview:\nBlevin was a human male who served the Galactic Empire as a Lieutenant-supervisor of the Imperial Security Bureau. He was informed about the incident on Ferri, involving Cassian Andor, and reported the incident in an ISB meeting led by Major Partagaz.

During the meeting, Blevin informed Partagaz of the lack of ability the corporate security showed during the incident. Afterward, Blevin went to investigate what really happened on Ferrix and who was behind it. He made his way to corporate security headquarters on Morlana One.

Blevin informed them that they would be transferred and they were forced to hand over all their corporate security items. The newly appointed ISB Lieutenant-supervisor, Deedra Meero, heard about this incident and thought that the Starpath unit recovered on Ferrix was linked to the stolen one from the Steergard Naval Yard, which was a sector of hers. Deedra requested all information on the Ferrix incident, but Blevin denied it. Deedra tried convincing Blevin to allow her the information but he kept denying it, so she went to Partagaz.

She was also the sister of the twin brothers, Arcann and Thexan. Vaylin was very powerful and very undisciplined. Her father himself couldn’t even control her, so he locked her away on the planet Nathema. Vaylin threatened the great Emperor, so he couldn’t have her with him in case she decided to challenge or kill him one day. Vaylin was forced to remain in Nathema’s Sanitarium and live out her life being tortured and losing her innocence. Her mother tried to free her, but Valkorion stopped her and blamed her for Vaylin’s disobedience and then developed hatred towards Senya. After a long time on the \"dark and cold planet,\" Vaylin was finally allowed back to Zakuul, where she plotted her revenge. Vaylin supported Arcann when he decided to kill Valkorion, and she was promoted to High Justice of the Emperor. Five years through Arcann’s reign, the outlander escaped with the help of their mother. Senya fought against her children after learning about the death of Thexan. Vaylin eventually betrayed Arcann and tried to confront her mother. Once Vaylin returned, she noticed that SCORPIO had taken the throne but the droid, when Vaylin arrived, just handed the throne to her.# Eternal Empress\nThe Empress decided to do everything in her power to kill her relatives so they wouldn’t have to challenge her to the throne. As the Empress, Vaylin also wanted to prove to her subjects that she was a far worse tyrant than her brother, Arcann. After searching for a long time, SCORPIO suggested that Vaylin destroy the Alliance by luring them into a trap. As the new Eternal Empress, she searched for her brother and mother and encountered Senya on Ord Mantell. Vaylin tried to lure her family into a trap and found the Outlander. She tried to strike down the outlander when the spirit of Valkorion entered the Outlander’s body. The Outlander manipulated Vaylin, and Valkorion killed her and used her spirit to enslave her. However, the Outlander freed her, and together they joined forces with the rest of her family. A few years later, everyone who Valkorion ever manipulated teamed up to kill him. They finally did. Valkorion claimed that he only sent his daughter to Nathema so that she could learn a lesson, which infuriated her because the torture was extremely traumatizing. This convinced her to join the rest of her family in finally destroying the entity once and for all to stop his reign of terror. They were finally successful in killing the entity, and Vaylin enjoyed watching her cruel father die. The family watched Valkorion die and say his last words, ending thousands of years of the tyrant’s reign.\n\n# Personality and abilities\nVaylin had a great childhood, being free and spending time with her mother. This was until Valkorion sent her to Nathema so she could be tortured, and from then on, she vowed that she’d never be “caged again.” Once she got back to Zakuul, she plotted her revenge on Valkorion and Arcann had a plan to gain the title of Emperor by killing his father. Vaylin, having a strong hatred against her family and a desire to become Empress, agreed to support Arcann on his idea. She had no empathy when she returned from Nathema and only cared for herself, so once she saw the possibility of becoming Empress of one of the biggest Empires, she took it. Vaylin especially hated her mother and was obsessed with trying to torture her in the worst ways possible, and while Arcann fought their father, Vaylin tried challenging her mother. Once Arcann told Vaylin to let their mother go, she lost it and felt lonely because now her brother was against her. On Nathema, Vaylin broke her chains, and from then on, she realized that she feared being lonely. Once Arcann abandoned her, she developed an even stronger hatred against her family and led a hunt to kill them. Valkorion claimed that Vaylin was her best and most powerful creation, showing that even the Immortal Emperor feared his powerful daughter. Vaylin was the only one who couldn’t be manipulated by Emperor Valkorion, thus making her able to defeat him. After Nathema Vaylin changed mentally and physically, she grew even more powerful. Vaylin had the power to conjure up Force-Storms, as she proved in her duel with the possessed Outlander. After Vaylin’s death, she had the power to become a spirit. However, Valkorion imprisoned her and used her spirit as a puppet so he could reclaim his Empire and mentally abuse the Eternal Fleet. Vaylin may have been one of the most powerful Force-users, but she was not proficient in lightsaber form, for she relied mainly on the Force to help her win battles.\nThe legendary Empress could even destroy a thick door easily while it took the powerful Sith Lord, Lana Beniko, a lot of effort to lift the door. When she broke her chains on Nathema, Vaylin vaporized every guard and sent a massive shockwave that even scared her father. The Immortal Emperor was no match for Vaylin because her Force-Storms were impossible to block. Vaylin destroyed the Sanitarium with very little effort. Vaylin was one of the most powerful Force-wielders in the galaxy and could even challenge the legendary Immortal Emperor and beat him in a battle, which was extremely hard because the Emperor lived for thousands of years searching and gaining power until he was eventually said to be unstoppable yet Vaylin could stop him.\n\n","meta":{"index":80,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Empress Vaylin","release_year":2022}},"Dark Underlord":{"content":"# Overview\nDuring 1750 BBY when the New Sith Wars were happening, a dark side spirit which was known as the “Dark Underlord '' came in power to be the Dark Lord of The Sith.

The Dark Underlord created an alliance which was known as the Black Knights. Established on the Planet known as Malrev IV, the Dark Underlord was leading a bloodthirsty campaign which was against the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order.

He sought to increase his power in the Sith-ruled Grumani area. His fleet of Stormdriver starships constituted the foundation of Zodoh's strategies.  Zodoh tested his new weapon on the planet Aquilaris Minor in the Daimanate, an area of space ruled by the Sith Lord Daiman, as a show of strength to the Sith Lords present there, but was forced to end the operation early due to Jenn Devaad's activities. Darknell was assaulted by Zodoh, but Devaad and Kerra Holt, a Jedi Knight, stopped him. As a result of the destruction of the Voracious, the Stormdriver fleet was rendered inoperable, leaving Zodoh adrift in empty space. After the conflict, Daiman's troops discovered Zodoh wounded but still alive and brought him before the Sith Lord, who used a tiny Stormdriver to wreak retribution by dehydrating the Hutt.# Biography\nThe Hutts seized the opportunity when the comm-relays in Hutt Space failed, leaving the Sith Lords operating in that region of the galaxy dependent on the Hutt clans to convey supplies and manpower. A Republic task force was once entirely kidnapped by Zodoh's tribe on the planet Daalang when the local populace deserted them. The Alderaanian Baron Lemayne-led Grace Command, which provided aid to those stranded in Sith space, managed to free a small group of captives after five years of imprisonment, among them Captain Jenn Devaad. Zodoh chose to expand his commercial activities outside of Hutt Space after becoming weary of the clan wars, and he focused on the Grumani sector in the Outer Rim Territories. As Zodoh began initiating hit-and-run attacks on Sith forces, he learned the real purpose of Grace Command's activities there: the charity served as a cover for Operation Deluge, a scheme to undermine the Sith war effort by flooding entire worlds with Deluge, an addictive drug that sapped people's desire. Several Stormdrivers, capital ships with weaponized moisture vaporators that could create downpours by squeezing moisture from a planet's atmosphere, were also part of Zodoh's fleet. A strike force of Intruder-class starfighters under Zodoh's personnel command launched an assault on the Daimanate planet of Aquilaris Minor. Zodoh retreated his fighters while the Sith were still reeling from his initial strike, and he positioned one of his Stormdrivers above Capital Cay's harbor, utilizing its vaporators to begin draining the water from the bay. Devil Squadron, an organization of Fire Lotus-class starfighters linked with Grace Command and made up of the Daalang survivors, headed by Devaad, attacked and destroyed the Stormdriver while the crew was distracted. Zodoh had provoked the fury of the regional Sith Lords by entering Sith territory, and Odion and Calimondra both showed their ire at being called by the Hutt. According to Zodoh, he was in Sith space to grow his company by supplying the Sith warlords with slaves and weapons. Exactly in time for the Hutt to see Devil Squadron leave for the Malakite-occupied world of Heptooine, Zodoh's fleet made its way back to the Aquilaris Minor system. Flying one of his Intruder-class starfighters, Zodoh let Devil Squadron see him as they made their way to the location of their upcoming leap into hyperspace. Devaad led Devil Squadron in pursuit of the Hutt, disregarding Holt's advice to exercise care in order to get revenge for her time spent in captivity.\n\n# Personality and traits\nZodoh was a masculine Hutt with brown skin and orange eyes. As was typical of his species, Zodoh was involved in crime, especially the fabrication of armaments and the trade in slaves, but he saw himself as a businessman serving his customers. Zodoh has trouble trusting people. Oon Garat, one of the few people who enjoyed Zodoh's trust, was discovered by the Hutt to be the focus of rivals looking to hire her. Zodoh discovered that he liked working in the field and that battle suited his hedonistic tendencies, which was unusual for a Hutt. Although he was disliked, Zodoh thought that his leadership style made him more successful than other Hutts. With aspirations to become the greatest Hutt ever, Zodoh was haughty. He was not easily moved and treated the Sith Lords in the Grumani sector with contempt, considering them to be nothing more than small-time criminals who would eventually come to serve him. In his interactions with the Sith and with Devaad, he was deceitful and manipulative. His willingness to utilize Deluge to enslave whole people and his use of Stormdrivers to produce fictitious storms to drown his adversaries were the finest examples of his callousness. Zodoh was willing to sacrifice a large portion of its billion-person population in order to conquer Darkknell. The Hutt was shrewd and persistent, nevertheless, and was prepared to tolerate minor setbacks in order to accomplish long-term goals.\n\n# Skills\nUnlike the majority of his kind, Zodoh was an athletic combatant. The Hutt had a jetpack that allowed him to fly and armor covering his upper torso. He preferred utilizing his favorite weapon, an ancient Mandalorian axe, to combat his opponents. In addition, Zodoh was capable of using his own body as a weapon, using his enormous size to overwhelm and subjugate his opponents as well as wrapping his powerful tail around them to pull them to him and smash them. Zodoh defeated the Jedi Kerra Holt thanks to his edge in zero gravity thanks to his jetpack. After the Voracious was destroyed, he was able to survive in space because of his Hutt physiology, although other species would have perished.\n\n","meta":{"index":178,"author":"Craked10","name":"Zodoh","release_year":2023}},"Darth Zavakon":{"content":"# Overview\nDarth Zavakon was a male Dark Lord of the Sith of Sith Pureblood or Human race.

He was born in 41 BBY and was the son of a slave, known as Shmi Skywalker. His offspring consisted of: Luke Skywalker as his son, Leia Organa as his daughter and Ben Solo as his grandson.# Anakin’s childhood-padawanship\nSince he was a child he was seen as the chosen one because of his intelligence at a young age. After being investigated by Qui-Gon Jinn, he brought Anakin Skywalker to the Jedi High Council, saying they should train him because he was the “Chosen One” and that he would bring balance to The Force, however, Grandmaster Yoda and Jedi Master Mace Windu were in a disagreement due to his age and fearful behaviour. After this meeting, Anakin Skywalker was sent to pilot a starfighter in the Battle of Naboo, where once again, he showed his ability to pilot at a young age.\n\nAs Obi-Wan Kenobi’s Padawan, Anakin Skywalker had great potential, but his attitude was unwise, which was the beginning of his way to the Dark Side of the Force. During this learning period, Anakin Skywalker met Senator Padme Amidala with the mission of protecting her because of an assassination attempt. After Obi-Wan Kenobi was back with him, Anakin told him he felt affection and love for Padme, but Kenobi said to his apprentice that she couldn’t be trusted due to her being a politician. \n\nAfter a while, Skywalker was sent out once again to protect Amidala on Naboo, where he confessed his love to her, but she declined because Anakin wasn’t supposed to form attachments as a Jedi. After reflecting on a dream where he saw his mother suffering, he decided to go back to Tatooine, where he found her tied with a stick and with a cut on the side of her face. After a few minutes, Shmi died in his son’s arms, Anakin consumed with rage, killed everyone in the village, promising Padme he would become as strong as possible to stop the people he loved from dying.\n\n# The Birth of Vader\nOnly few people realised Anakin couldn’t control his emotions since he was a Padawan, a hint of this is when Anakin killed everyone in a village because his mother died.\nAfter his ascension to the rank of Jedi Knight, Grandmaster Yoda suggested Anakin to take a Padawan, so he decided to train Ahsoka Tano as his new apprentice;which he formed a great friendship with.\n\nDue to a few problems that occured during a mission, Ahsoka Tano was brought to trial for bombing the Jedi Temple. After the decision was taken, she was exiled from the Jedi Order. Anakin and Padme trusted she was innocent, and got enough proof to get her back in the order, but she refused, making Anakin lose his trust in the High Council.\n\nAt the end of the Clone Wars, Darth Sidious noticed Anakin’s abilities, and used him as his agent and emissary from the Jedi High Council. Once again, Anakin was frustrated with the Jedi High Council for denying him the rank of Jedi Master. Darth Sidious noticed this and instantly contacted Anakin, trying to convince him that if he joined the Sith, he would be able to protect those he loved. Due to Anakin’s frustration and the feeling he had for Padme, he accepted to join the Dark Side after killing Mace Windu, being named as “Darth Vader”.\n\n# Vader's last days\nVader was revealed the true identity of Luke Skywalker through his agents. He located and distracted him to come to Bespin for their meeting. At the end of the battle, Darth Vader cut off his hand, and seeing he was at a disadvantage, he revealed to him he was his father, and also tried to convince him to join the Dark Side, he refused and jumped off to die but he was saved by his sister and friends.\n\nDarth Sidious was noticing that his apprentice was filled with mourning instead of hate due to his previous actions. Intending to keep him in the Dark Side, he tortured Darth Vader with Force Lightining, he tried to fight back but he was overwhelmed by Mas Amedda’s Royal Guards. After choking three of them, Darth Vader was Force-Choked back by the Emperor, who told him to forget everything that happened in his life.\n\nAfter meeting the Emperor on Endor, Darth Vader noticed a rebel shuttle was approaching the forest moon of Endor and instantly notified Darth Sidious, who allowed them to land on the shield generator base, where he was waiting for Luke. After meeting his son, he escorted him to the Emperor’s room in the Death Star, where the fight started. These two were matched in level, but Vader’s purpose wasn’t to kill his son, it was to lead him to the Dark Side, this succeeded when Luke kicked Vader down the stairs by using the Dark Side of the Force. The Emperor noticed this and told Luke to use his rage again on Vader, but Luke realised what he had done to his father and took a defensive position, but then lost his control again and cut off Darth Vader’s hand. Luke, once again realising what he has done, threw away his lightsaber, which made Sidious use Force Lightning on him. Vader couldn’t see his son suffering, so he got up and grabbed the Emperor with his left arm, throwing him to the reactor shaft.

The reason for this dates back to 3996 BBY when Ulic Qel-Droma challenged the Indomitable to a fight. The Sith Lord told the Mand’alor that if he lost, he and his crusaders would have to swear loyalty to him and the Dark Lord of the Sith.

She would open herself up to the Dark Side of the Force, which would leave her scarred following Revan’s destruction of Malachor V with the Mass-Shadow Generator as the wound in the Force would overcome her. \n\nThis would transform her into a Sith Lord, Darth Traya, the Lord of Betrayal. She would embrace the Dark Side and take upon the endeavor of forming a Sith Order under her own rite, training two apprentices who would later become Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion; powerful in their own rite forming the Sith Triumvirate. Their presence would endure across the galaxy, as they would hunt down the Jedi and strain their presence in the Force or purge them, dwindling their numbers down to a handful of individuals. Despite this, she would later be betrayed by both her apprentices as their insatiable hunger for power would drive them strained.\n\n# Conflict and Truth\nShe would eventually discover the Jedi Exile, Meetra Surik, and would form a close bond with her to the point of becoming symbionts; people who’ve formed a deep bond by the Force and are able to feel each other’s pain with their lives forever intertwined. As she would take on Surik as a student, she would also plot to split the individuals who’ve corrupted the Force’s will such as the remaining Jedi Councilors and her former apprentices, Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion. Surik would eventually locate the Jedi Masters who’ve managed to survive the purge conducted by the Triumvirate in hiding due to their fears of the Sith and their dogmas, at which Kreia would split the connections of the Jedi Masters from the Force enraged at their blindness, causing them to perish due to their attachments to it passing from the Living to the Cosmic Force. \n\nAfter this, she would locate Jedi Master Atris’ hidden academy on Telos IV and expose her hypocrisy, compelling her to admit her fall to the Dark Side of the Force accepting the darkness within her. Surik would then destroy Darth Nihilus over Telos as she would accept her human self and embrace it.\n\n# Reflection and Death\nSurik would travel to Malachor V to confront her former master and companion, facing her final test against the renewed Darth Traya. Traya would subdue Sion, asserting her dominance over him. She would seek to bring about her final goal, to rid the galaxy of the Force’s influence as we know it. Her plot in the betrayal of both Sith and Jedi would be a defining moment, as the Jedi Exile would fight her in the core of Trayus. Surik would be compelled to fight Treya as per her ultimatum; the Exile’s death or hers. \n\n\tTreya and Surik would battle in Trayus, with the Jedi Exile eventually triumphing over her former master in Trayus Academy, where Treya had once trained Sith of her own. Despite her feelings and overcoming emotions, Surik would grant her master’s wish of death. Before Traya passed on, she would grant Surik visions of the future as she would escape the fabrics and seams of the Force and see through it all at the end.\n\n","meta":{"index":38,"author":"C_aladria","name":"Darth Traya","release_year":2022}},"Reva Sevander":{"content":"# Overview\nReva was a force-sensitive female human who served as an Inquisitor with the title of Third Sister. She served during the early reign of the Galactic Empire and was Grand Inquisitor for a short period. Before the Galactic Empire began its reign, The Third Sister served in the Jedi Order as an Initiate. While she had no problem working with the Empire, her true goal was to kill the infamous Lord Vader as revenge for the slaughter of her fellow friends in the Jedi Academy. Despite being generally disliked by many, including her fellow Inquisitors, she still rose through the ranks at an incredibly fast pace.# Anger\nReva was only a youngling during Anakin's ruthless invasion with the 501st. She watched as her friends were brutally murdered while playing dead within a pile of bodies. Years after the events of The Great Jedi Purge, she set out to join the Inquisitorious, a group of Jedi killing force users. After being accepted, she went on a journey of vengeance knowing that she would be granted an opportunity to kill Lord Vader. She planned to lure Anakin's former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, out of hiding, and use him as a distraction while she killed Vader. Reva, on her ruthless path of vengeance, ended up being disliked by most of the Inquisitorious.\n\n# Vengeance\nReva began her plan to lure Obi-Wan by kidnapping the young Princess Leia Organa. Sevander knew that by kidnapping her, Obi-Wan would be forced to come out of hiding to save her. She was correct, as the old Jedi master did come to save her. \nRight before she could succeed in his capture, The Grand Inquisitor blocked her path, sick of her foolishness. Reva, who was completely rage-fueled at this point, stabbed the Inquisitor in the stomach, leaving him to die. Unfortunately for her, it was too late; both Obi-Wan and Leia had taken a ship and fled off-planet.\n\n# A Better Opportunity\nNot long after this, Vader learned of his old master's resurgence, and how it occurred. Vader offered Reva the position of Grand Inquisitor if she was able to successfully locate Kenobi. She ended up finding him and sent Vader to fulfill his long awaiting goal. With the successful location of Kenobi, she was awarded the title of Grand Inquisitor. Vader launched a final attack, where Reva and Kenobi spoke. Ben offered to act as bait after discovering Reva's true intentions. She agreed and thus set out to complete her true goal. While Vaderwas distracted she tried to strike him, with no success. Vader completely outmatched Reva, and hit her, leaving her to die just as she did with the Grand Inquisitor.\n\n# The Last Resort\nWhile lying on the floor, Reva found a transmitter that detailed Luke Skywalker and how he could be in danger of being found. A completely rage-fueled Reva set out to kill Luke as a final act to avenge her friends who were killed by his father. She set out to Tatooine and upon finding Luke, released the anger that had been building up since the most traumatic event of her life. Cowering over him, she raised her saber as a final blow before realizing that she was becoming just like Vader. Heartbroken, she picked up an injured and worn-out luke and brought him to his caretakers. She decided to take Kenobi's words to heart, and she set out to live a new life, leaving her fate unknown.\n\n","meta":{"index":62,"author":"ShokuMatsu","name":"Reva Sevander","release_year":2022}},"Senior Lieutenant Yve":{"content":"# Overview\nYve was a female human Naval officer who served as a Senior Lieutenant and Starfighter Commander.

She was the former apprentice of the legendary Dark Council member, Darth Marr. She killed Lysennius Melchiro, her nemesis and one of the people who posed a threat to her rank as Governor. Her main focus after that was to eliminate all rebel insurgencies and crush the Republic forces. She trained an apprentice by the name of Lerek Serrus. She was later betrayed by her apprentice when the Jedi Consular, the Barsen’thor, travelled to Balmorra hoping to “liberate” them and remove the Empire from power. Lachris was eventually killed by this Jedi and one of the resistance members, Zenith. She was talented in the Dark Side of the Force and rose to the rank of Darth quickly. Once she became Governor Lachris and her apprentice led their Imperial forces in the name of the Dark Council. Before this, she was a part of the attack on Coruscant which was after the treaty of Coruscant. Darth Lachris went to the Sundari land which was where an important Imperial base was. She then discovered that a few Jedi went to assist the resistance, by order of Grand Marshal Cheketta, in taking over Balmorra. After learning about this, Lachris sent an Imperial strike team to take down the barricades of the Balmorran Arms Factory and to search for information against the Republic to prove they were involved in the support of the resistance. Afterwards, she ordered them to kill Ralon Nys along with his squad and  then to kill the remaining resistance members and after she was successful she finally had the world under her control.# Balmorra\nLachris assigned her forces many tasks to destroy her enemies and it took a while but eventually she had full control of the planet, or so she thought.

She became a Jedi knight but would eventually fall to the Dark Side and become an apprentice to Darth Caedus, the Dark Lord of the Sith. During her time as a Jedi, Tahiri became very good friends with fellow Jedi initiate Anakin Solo. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Tahiri became a weapon for the Order, however, her mentality shattered after the death of Anakin Solo, whom she had feelings for. She fled to Zonama Sekot where her two personalities unified, giving her balance once again. In the midst of the Dark Nest Crisis, Tahiri was banished from the Jedi Order and sent to Dagobah for leaking confidential information. However, she came back for not too long before ultimately joining the Sith. After only a year she also left the Sith Order and became a bounty hunter. After a successful year, she was accused of a certain assassination but escaped and eventually became Imperial Hand. After a brief service, she joined the Order once again.# Biography\nTahiri, born on Tatooine, was raised as a Tusken Raider and had a pet bantha named Bangor. She was adopted by the tribe's leader Sliven and later found by a Jedi Master. She was brought to Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 at nine standard years old. Tahiri and Anakin, the youngest of the Solo children, became close friends. They discovered the Golden Globe and the ancient Kushiban Jedi Master Ikrit, which contain trapped souls. They encountered native predators and discovered ancient carvings in a cave that revealed the Golden Globe contained the souls of the Massassi children imprisoned by Dark Lord Exar Kun. Tahiri and Anakin returned to Tatooine, where they discovered their real parents are Tryst and Cassa Veila, Force-sensitives.\n\nIn the year following the first Death Star duel, Jedi historian Tionne discovered that Darth Vader had saved Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber and kept it at Bast Castle on Vjun. She informed Master Skywalker at the Jedi Praxeum about the artifact and invited Tahiri, Anakin, Uldir, and Ikrit to accompany her. They encountered a group of mercenaries and pirates, led by Orloc. The Jedi pursued them, but Orloc's subordinates defeated Ikrit and deceived Uldir into believing he could awaken the Force powers within him. Uldir stole Ikrit's ship Sunrider and two Jedi artifacts.\n\nUldir found Orloc at Exis Station, where he became his master. Orloc had no Force powers but used tricks to deceive others with demonstrations of \"Force power.\" Tionne, Ikrit, Anakin, and Tahiri tried to convince Uldir that Orloc was a fraud, but he attacked the four Jedi with his gimmicks. During the duel, Tionne was wounded, and Ikrit joined Anakin and Tahiri in the fight. Uldir realized Orloc was a liar. The Jedi defeated Orloc, removing a threat to the growing New Jedi Order.\n\nTahiri, a Jedi Knight, played a crucial role in destroying the voxyn queen in Myrkr. Despite her depression, she remained determined to defeat Lord Nyax. She was deemed a Jedi Knight and led the Barefoot Squadron. However, her greatest trial with the Yuuzhan Vong came from within. When Han and Leia Organa Solo took her and Jaina Solo to re-establish communication, the Riina personality resurfaced, causing mental turmoil. Tahiri and Jaina Solo merged to survive, but remained loyal to the Galactic Alliance. She teamed up with Corran Horn to extract Nen Yim, Harrar, and the prophet Yu'shaa from Coruscant and became Corran's Jedi apprentice. She participated in the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, mastering the Vongsense taught by Jacen.\n\nTahiri, Tekli, and Danni Quee stay on the planet to help the Yuuzhan Vong adjust to their new home. They receive a Force-call from the Unknown Regions, which leads them to discover the creature that once was their fellow Jedi Raynar Thul, transformed into the Prime Unu of the Killik species. Tahiri becomes a \"Joiner\" and becomes influenced by the Prime Unu's control of the Colony. She binds with Tesar Sebatyne and Lowbacca, who reveal Raynar's survival to Aryn Dro Thul. Luke Skywalker views this as a betrayal of the Jedi Order and exiles them to Dagobah to meditate on being a Jedi. Jacen accidentally reveals his knowledge about Tesar and Lowbacca's actions, leading Luke to accuse him of using her to spy on fellow Jedi.\n\nIn 40 ABY, Tahiri Veila returns from exile to counter the Corellian-led secessionist movement, which threatened the Galactic Alliance's primacy. She is placed in command of Team Tauntaun, which aims to remove the Corellian Head of State, Thrackan Sal-Solo, and apprehend Five World Prime Minister Aidel Saxan. However, the mission is compromised when a traitor leaks information about the Alliance's plan to the Corellians. YVH droids are placed in defense of Corellia's secessionist leaders. Despite the setbacks, the team manages to turn a major defeat into a minor victory.\n\nJacen Solo, who pledged allegiance to the Sith after submitting to Lumiya's teachings, later recreates himself as Darth Caedus, the new Dark Lord of the Sith. Caedus believes that Veila could be useful to him in other capacities if she could convince her to sever old loyalties to the Jedi Order. He uses Flow-walking, a rare Force technique, to allow Tahiri Veila to witness their past, including their last encounter with Anakin Solo. However, Caedus' intentions are less altruistic, as he causes her emotional pain by reminding her of how she allowed Anakin to die without admitting to loving him.\n\nDarth Caedus' ploy was successful, as Tahiri Veila submitted herself to him as a spy within the Jedi Order. Caedus corrupted her and allowed her to see Anakin again through flow-walking sessions. He nurtured her addiction and reliance on him, intensifying her dependence on him. Throughout their time together, they grew closer and possibly engaged in a physical relationship. Veila was a valuable asset to Caedus, serving as his spy within the Jedi Order. She fought in the Second Battle of Balmorra and the early stages of the Battle of Kuat, relaying information on Jedi activities to Caedus. During the Battle of Kashyyyk, Veila witnessed Caedus' orbital bombardment on the Wookiee homeworld and attempted to arrest Caedus' parents, Han and Leia Organa Solo. However, her actions led to her arrest and confiscation of her StealthX. Caedus's loyalty to Veila was primarily driven by her obsession with flow-walking and Anakin Solo, but her dependence on Caedus worked to his advantage. After returning to the Galactic Alliance, Caedus continued to flow walk with Veila to ensure her loyalty. However, the Jedi eventually discovered her new allegiance, ending her role as an undercover agent before she could discover the secret base.\n\nDarth Caedus, after unsuccessfully converting Ben Skywalker into a Sith apprentice, focuses on Tahiri Veila, who becomes his right-hand subordinate. Veila is intellectually cunning, competent, and trustworthy, and becomes more formal around the Dark Lord, who becomes Joint-Chief of State alongside Admiral Cha Niathal. Caedus enjoys Veila's company more than Skywalker's.\n\nThe Sith Lord and his apprentice travel to Fondor on the Anakin Solo, a GAG Star Destroyer named in honor of Caedus' late sibling. Caedus is determined to break Veila's longing for a dead boy. As Fondorian starfighters approach, Caedus orders the shields deactivated, leaving the flagship in a precarious situation. Veila decides to fire on the Fondorians or risk allowing them to attack first. Caedus orders a hasty withdrawal to Coruscant, saving lives but is haunted by her decision.\n\nUpon returning to Coruscant, Caedus recruits Veila as a junior lieutenant within the Galactic Alliance Guard. She wears a dark blue uniform with black military-issued boots and has her hair pinned up to match her military uniformity. Veila earns Caedus' confidence and becomes Caedus' representative to the Imperial Remnant.\n\nVeila, a young woman, meets with Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon at the Imperial Palace of Ravelin to discuss the advantages of joining forces with the Alliance. Pellaeon, who dislikes Darth Caedus and Yuuzhan Vong, is surprised to see Veila's strategy. They both agree that the Moffs would benefit from joining forces with the Alliance. Veila's performance on Bastion was met with praise from Caedus, who was pleased with her performance.\n\nDespite her inability to locate the Jedi's secret base, Veila continues to devote herself to the task. She witnesses interactions between Caedus and Niathal, which initially baffled her. She becomes privy to the Dark Lord's plans and inner thoughts, and serves as the gatekeeper for access to Darth Caedus. Some of Anakin Solo's crew suspect their relationship is romantic, while Niathal views it as a \"gang boss and junior henchman\" nature.\nDarth Caedus, the Joint-Chief of State and popular leader within the Galactic Alliance enlists Tahiri Veila to monitor the activities of Niathal and Pellaeon. Veila serves as a liaison and spy on the Alliance's Imperial allies, and Caedus instructs her to remain vigilant of the Grand Admiral's actions. Veila, however, remains committed to the Dark Lord's cause and is unsure of her true intentions.\n\nWhen Niathal betrays Caedus, the Galactic Alliance Defense Force is split in two, with Caedus being more popular among soldiers. The Dark Lord retains the majority of the Galactic Alliance's war fleets, leaving Niathal with only a small minority of supporters. Pellaeon's personal opinion of the Dark Lord influences his decision to support Niathal and her fellow traitors. The senior Moff commanders on the Bloodfin object to Pellaeon's betrayal of Caedus, and Veila shares their concerns and becomes determined to convince the Grand Admiral to recommit the Remnant to Caedus' cause.\n\nTahiri Veila, a former Imperial, tries to convince Pellaeon to reconsider his decision to destroy the Galactic Alliance. She believes that the Alliance's self-destructive nature would lead to the Corellian secessionist movement. Veila believes that Darth Caedus can bring victory to the Galactic Alliance and that Fondor must be shown as an example. Veila offers the Grand Admiral one last chance to live in exchange for joining Caedus. When Pelleaon succumbs to a fatal wound, the Moffs assume overall command and direct the Remnant back to Caedus' side. The majority of the Imperial Remnant, except for the Bloodfin's crew and the Maw Irregular Fleet, support Caedus.\n\nDarth Caedus congratulates Veila on saving the Galactic Alliance and showing her lack of enthusiasm for killing an old man like Pellaeon. He also acknowledges her as his apprentice and promises to rescue her, even at the risk of his own life.\n\nDarth Caedus returns to Coruscant as the Chief of State of the Galactic Alliance, while Niathal and her supporters are recognized as traitors. The Dark Lord consolidates his rule on Coruscant through secret police activities of the Galactic Alliance Guard. Lieutenant Tahiri Veila resumes her search for Luke Skywalker and his fugitive Jedi, despite her earlier disobedience. Ben Skywalker leads a Jedi team to discover Darth Caedus' whereabouts, but Captain Lon Shevu, Skywalker's friend and spy, reveals Caedus' location on Nickel One. Veila incapacitates Skywalker, and she and Leia Organa Solo attempt to rescue him. As Darth Caedus oversees the war, Veila interrogates her Jedi prisoner, using torture and seduction techniques to gain information on the Jedi Order's secret base. Shevu, a traitor in league with the Jedi, is used as a pawn to capture Skywalker. Veila accidentally overuses her powers, electrocuting Shevu to death, and Skywalker uses her distraction to his advantage, incapacitating the Sith long enough to escape from Coruscant.\n\nAfter Skywalker's escape, Veila returns to her master, Caedus, who had been interrogating Mandalorian prisoner Mirta Gev. Veila revealed that Prince Isolder had been captured and could possibly possess knowledge of the Jedi Order's secret base. Caedus discovered that the Jedi had relocated their base of operations to the planet Shedu Maad. Veila suggested disfigurement to make Gev more cooperative, but the Mandalorian refused to cooperate.\n\nThe Sith Lords' interrogation was disrupted by the arrival of a female Human lieutenant, who asked Gev to collect a sample of Gev's blood for the Moff Council to create a nanovirus that would target and kill those connected by blood to Boba Fett and his family. Gev agreed to cooperate if Caedus promised to heal her and prevent the nanovirus's creation.\n\nTahiri Veila, a Sith, meets Darth Caedus as the Second Galactic Civil War approaches. Caedus discovers the Jedi Order's secret base and leads an assault on the Jedi and their allies from the Anakin Solo bridge. Anakin Solo suffers damage and is nearly destroyed by a shadow bomb. Veila suggests that her master could prevent losses by altering the past through the flow-walk ability. However, Caedus reveals the true nature of flow-walking to his apprentice, allowing her to believe that the past could be changed through it. This betrayal of trust leaves Veila embittered and hateful towards Caedus, who has betrayed the Order and committed murder on behalf of her Sith Master. Despite the rift between the master and apprentice, Caedus instructs Veila to embrace her anger and hatred to become even more immersed in the dark side's power. Despite her loyalty, her commitment to Caedus' cause is undermined, and her resolve as a Sith is weakened.\n\nTahiri Veila, a former Sith apprentice, was sent to Shedu Maad with stormtroopers to infiltrate and destroy the Jedi base with a baradium bomb. However, she was intercepted by Ben Skywalker, Taryn Zel, and elite Hapan soldiers. Skywalker tried to convince Veila to reconsider her decision to detonate the bomb and that she was not a Sith in her heart. Veila renounced her allegiance to Darth Caedus and the Sith, but when Skywalker offered to lie on her behalf, she rejected it. She surrendered unconditionally and was taken into Jedi custody. Jaina Solo, who had also infiltrated the Anakin Solo, killed Darth Caedus in cold blood. The Second Galactic Civil War ended with the dissolution of Lumiya's Sith Order and the acceptance of the Galactic Alliance's primacy. Veila provided information about the final actions of Darth Caedus and the Moffs, and the Jedi learned that Mandalore had been infected with a nano-killer virus.\n\nTahiri Veila, a former Jedi apprentice, faced indecision and uncertainty over her purpose in life after losing Anakin Solo and betraying the Jedi Order. She chose to pursue a bounty hunter life to come to terms with her actions in the Second Galactic Civil War. The Jedi Order was threatened by Anti-Jedi Natasi Daala, who pursued policies that hindered freedom. Jaina Solo founded Darkmeld, a clandestine organization, to recruit former Jedi Tahiri Veila. Veila refused to rejoin the Jedi Order, and the Daala administration sought to attach an observer to her. Veila was put on trial in the Ninth Hall of Justice to defend herself against the Anti-Jedi laws. The Court of Justice sided with Veila, citing the inability to monitor the entire Jedi Order and those with a strong affinity to the Force. The outcome of Veila's trial and the Court's rejection of Daala's attempt to impose limitations on ex-Jedi through \"guilt by association\" were hailed as a victory for the Jedi Order and demonstrated that Daala had not yet gained absolute control over the legal system.\n\nTahiri Veila resigned her membership to Darkmeld after recovering from Seff Hellin. She was arrested by Alliance military officers for the murder of Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon two years earlier. Veila was brought to trial in the Court of Jedi Affairs, where Galactic Alliance Judge Arabelle Lorteli presided. Veila fired her lawyer, refusing to betray the Jedi again. Daala's attempts to convict her on the basis of her assistance in Caedus' rise to power were seen as a double standard. Daala attempted to counter the criticism by arresting Niathal, leading to the Mon Calamari's death by suicide. Jaina Solo persuaded Imperial Head of State Jagged Fel to hire a more efficient defense attorney for Veila. Bothan Eramuth Bwua'tu, uncle of Admiral Nek Bwua'tu, represented the Galactic Alliance as the prosecutor. The Falleen Judge Mavari Zudan presided over the rest of the trial. With Bwua'tu as her lawyer, Veila made progress in the court, but she felt worried about her position. Bwua'tu argued that her client was bound by military duty to obey her superior officer's orders. Despite her emotional response, her lawyer's plan successfully garnered the sympathy of the jury.\n\nIn 44 ABY, Tahiri Veila's trial came to a close, and the Jedi Council formulated a plot to overthrow Chief Daala before her regime could fully turn against the Jedi Order. The Jedi stormed the Executive Building and arrested Daala before her security forces could react. The Triumvirate was created as a temporary constitutional replacement for the Chief of State's executive office. The Jedi Council hoped to rescind the Galactic Alliance's case against Veila using its new executive authority. However, Sebatyne was reluctant to leave Veila to her fate, fearing favoritism and losing their legitimacy as rulers.\n\nThe Jedi Council was aware that they needed the support of the Senate, military, and people, and if they showed favor to Veila, they would be accused of favoritism and lose their legitimacy. The jury found Veila guilty of the murder of Gilad Pellaeon, and sentenced her to death. Veila was deposited in the Armand Isard Correctional Facility, where she briefly encountered Daala, the deposed leader of the Galactic Alliance.\n\nIn response to the overthrow of the Daala administration, Mandalorian bounty hunter Boba Fett infiltrated the facility and retrieved Natasi Daala to use her against the Jedi Order. Veila used the opportunity created by her enemies as a chance to escape from prison, becoming a homeless fugitive. As most Jedi were away from the Temple and unable to count on the Council's support, Veila took comfort in her freedom and went barefoot once more.\n\nAfter escaping, Veila turned herself over to Han and Leia Solo for help. Despite avoiding execution, she was eventually turned over to Head of State Jagged Fel, the leader of the Imperial Remnant. Veila was framed for the assassination of Gilad Pellaeon during Darth Caedus' reign. The Imperial-Alliance conspiracy was ultimately destroyed by the Lost Tribe of Sith, who infiltrated the Galactic Alliance government. During this time, Moff Tol Getelles discovered Natasi Daala's plot to usurp control of the Imperial Remnant. He informed the High Moff of the conspiracy and the secret location of Daala's Maw Irregular Fleet. Veila accompanied Fel to the Exodo system, where the battle continued between the Imperial Remnant and the Maw Irregular Fleet.\n\nVeila escaped and required help from Han and Leia Solo. She was eventually sent to Jagged Fel, the Imperial Remnant leader. Despite being framed for Gilad Pellaeon's assassination, the Imperial-Alliance conspiracy was destroyed.\n\n# Personality and Traits\nTahiri was known to be optimistic and very free-minded. She respected the Tusken culture but felt irritated about certain clothes they wore, being footwear her main phobia. She maintained the tradition of walking barefoot even during adulthood. During her training she met a fellow initiate, Anakin Solo, with whom she became best friends and eventually would love him, however before she could reveal those feelings, Anakin was killed in the Yuuzhan Vong War. During this period she changed completely due to being captured and tortured in addition to Anakin’s death. Her happy and full of emotion personality faded away and a cold emotionless Tahiri was born. With time her depression grew and denying him a kiss the last time she saw him haunted her throughout her whole life. Anakin’s loss caused her to fall to the Dark Side, and her constant grief made her very vulnerable and psychotic. Eventually, she managed to maintain more control but never really recovered and always kept Anakin in mind and the kiss she didn't give him.\n\n# Power and abilities\nAs a Jedi knight, Tahiri was proficient in both the usage of Force techniques and saber combat. She could also combine saber combat with martial arts to maintain enemies at a distance. As it was typical in the New Jedi Order, she also had a blaster pistol. Surprisingly she mastered Tràkata and became a force in saber-to-saber combat. When she became a Sith, her style changed and her abilities were trained to peak condition. She became much more aggressive and her abilities were enhanced by the emotion she felt due to her loss. She also had natural resistance, as she could endure extreme pain but continue fighting.\n\n","meta":{"index":49,"author":"Craked10","name":"Tahiri Veila","release_year":2023}},"Colonel Wullf Yularen":{"content":"# Overview\nWullf Yularen or Admiral Yularen, later known as Colonel Yularen was an intelligent human male. He served both the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Empire as a high-ranking Officer. Wullf Yularen fought in the battles of Christophsis, Kaliida Nebula, Geonosis, and many others during the Clone Wars. After the Galactic Republic was transformed into the first Galactic Empire, Yularen resigned due to his eagerness in becoming a Colonel for the Imperial Security Bureau (ISB). Yularen eventually became Colonel and a major part of the ISB, after becoming the leader of the Naval Intelligence Agency (NIA). Yularen quickly became allies with the Chiss Naval Officer, Thrawn. Yularen helped Thrawn rise through the ranks of the Imperial Navy until Thrawn reached the rank of Grand Admiral. Unfortunately, Yularen was assigned to remain on the Death Star after the devastating battle of Scarif, where the Rebellion gained the plans for the Death Star. Sadly, with the destruction of the first Death Star, Yularen died during the destruction.# Serving the Galactic Empire\nYularen was quite a vital aspect of the Empire, briefly serving as an Admiral during the Republic’s transition into the Empire and then later serving as a Colonel. After he resigned as an Admiral, Yularen chased his dream career of becoming Colonel of the new Imperial Security Bureau. He achieved this goal pretty quickly and was assigned his first mission, which was to lead a division whose main purpose was to expose any instances of sedition in the Imperial Senate. Five years after the Galactic Empire was formed, Yularen was appointed the head liaison of the  Imperial Security Bureau and Naval Intelligence Agency. He was tasked with making sure that all members cooperated with each other. A little while later, Yularen’s rival, Vice Admiral Rancit, was killed at Carida and so the Emperor himself gave Yularen his spot as Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Agency. Yularen continued his task for Commander Gallius Rax until he returned to the  Imperial Security Bureau and served as Colonel again. Once he returned he accompanied Senator Renking, Senior Lieutenant Thrawn, and Ensign Eli Vanto, Thrawn’s aide, at the Alisandre Hotel during ascension week. Renking introduced these men to his aide, Arindha Pryce, and Yularen told them the story of Thrawn capturing a pirate crew. Yularen had to leave the party early and before doing so he introduced Thrawn to Imperial Officers and Senators. Yularen and Thrawn found themselves working together on the secret case of Nightswan. Soon Yularen, Thrawn, and Eli started to inspect dojos and found out that the Yinchom dojo might have something to do with a new case about the higher skies advocacy. After this incident, Thrawn met with Pryce to discuss higher skies. Pryce tempted Moff Ghadi with illegal information higher skies had on his enemy, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. Tarkin then agreed to promote Pryce to Governor of Lothal and finally promoted Eli Vanto to Lieutenant Commander. Yularen and other  Imperial Security Bureau members arrested the higher skies advocacy members and the Yinchom dojo. A long time after this, Yularen had participated in many missions, such as the Batonn insurgency and carnage at Creekpath. One of his final missions was to help Grand Admiral Thrawn find a Rebel spy, whose codename was Fulcrum. Yularen interrogated several Imperial Officers in the Lothal sector aboard Thrawn’s flagship, the Chimaera. They soon learned who Fulcrum was, Yularen’s favourite pupil, Agent Kallus. Kallus framed Yogar Lyste, but Thrawn was smarter than that. Thrawn, however, allowed Kallus to continue working as Fulcrum so he could lure the Rebels. Not long later, the former Lothalian Governor Ryder Azadi impersonated Colonel Yularen so that an Imperial Officer could comply with Protocol 13. Unfortunately, this plan worked because of Yularen’s rank in the Empire. The Imperial garrison on Lothal was then trapped and then destroyed. This also led to the disappearance of Thrawn and his Seventh Fleet, which made Lothal free of the Empire. Sadly, a while after this event, Yularen was assigned to the first Death Star during the Rebellion’s attack and he was killed. However, Yularen left a legacy behind him. Yularen was known as one of the Emperor’s most valuable personnel and members of the Empire were quite devastated that he could’ve survived instead of a TIE fighter pilot.\n\n","meta":{"index":161,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Colonel Wullf Yularen","release_year":2022}},"Janus Greejatus":{"content":"# Overview\nJanus Greejatus was a human Dark Side Adept who served under Emperor Sheev Palpatine within his Ruling Council during the Imperial Era. He carried a short shrivelled stature with a pale complexation and sunken eyes and was seen wearing distinctly bright robes and a hat, both seemingly oversized for the old man. Having speciesist ideologies, he would eventually succumb to the same tragic end as his master with the destruction of the second Death Star in 4 ABY.# Biography\nBorn on the planet Chommell Minor of the Mid Rim, Greejatus grew disdain against all other species after encouragement from his father as they had crippled his family’s wealth. He and Palpatine enrolled in the Legislative Youth Program, entering the political stage for his planet.\nGreejatus was sent by King Bon Tapalo of Naboo to attend Senator Vidar Kim’s funeral held in Galactic City of the planet Coruscant; Kim had been killed by a ploy orchestrated by Palpatine and Hego Damask. Partaking in the ceremony by transporting his ashes to and scattering them in the Solleu River on the planet Naboo, Greejatus gained political support and became a pawn for Palpatine’s grand scheme.\nPalpatine was elected as the new Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and positioned Greejatus as the Senator of the Chommell sector in 32 BBY. However, he was replaced by Horace Vancil in the reelection that happened two years later.\nLater, the former senator earned recognition as a Senior Adviser to the Supreme Chancellor during the Clone Wars, influencing the activities within the planet Naboo. One such event was the homecoming of Poggle the Lesser on the planet Geonosis, which he attended with other colleagues as representatives of Palpatine’s office.\nFollowing the advent of the Galactic Empire, Greejatus’ loyalty to his master was demonstrated; he continued to serve Palpatine as one of his closest advisers, gaining a prominent place within the Imperial Ruling Council in 14 BBY. His role involved the establishment of the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order, which aimed to supervise the Empire’s day-to-day management. Still with apparent hatred towards non-humans, he was also crucial in the projects of the secretive Imperial Department of Redesign, a task force enabled to eliminate non-human threats.\nSometime before 4 BBY, Greejatus and another fellow adviser, Sim Aloo, were soon made into Dark Side Adepts due to their sensitivity to the Force. Palpatine planned to keep his trustworthy underlings in power so he had more accessible reign over the galaxy. The Adepts were ordered to retrieve Sith artefacts, specifically the Enchantress’ book of Ushruu, so they hired a group of the Trandoshan species to do their bidding. Yet, this plan was in vain as the team were eaten by the queen of the Corellian hounds, who was guarding the book on the world.\nIn 4 ABY, the loyal adviser accompanied the Emperor aboard the second Death Star, along with five other advisers, presumably perished in its explosion.\n\n","meta":{"index":160,"author":"AnimatedEcrux","name":"Janus Greejatus","release_year":2023}},"Mandalore the Ultimate":{"content":"# Description\nMand’alor the Ultimate was known as the First Mandalorian to found the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, he was also from the Taung Species.\n\nMand’alor the Ultimate sought revenge from the Sith after their betrayal and the Crusade gave a reason to re-unite the now scattered Aliit of Mandalorians, which all of them answered to the call that Mand’alore the Ultimate had sent to them.\n\nThe Taung nearing extinction, Mand’alor the Ultimate was the last “Identified” Taung Mand’alor, although it did not stop him from leading the Neo-Crusaders to near victory, almost ending the Republic.\n\nHowever, Mand’alor the Ultimate was defeated in single combat by the Jedi Knight Revan.

Faro was a skilled leader who participated in many battles and defeated Grand Admiral Savit. With her ascension to Commodore, Faro was promised Task Force 231, but Thrawn saw her potential and recommended they put her in charge of a fleet. The Imperial High Command approved of this and promoted her to Commander of the Eleventh Fleet. Faro was a brilliant tactician like Thrawn, and serving as Thrawn’s second-in-command made her tactical skills even better. Her major flaw was that she was very blunt to Imperial high ranks, except Grand Admiral Thrawn and his friend, Eli Vanto. Faro was very ambitious and sometimes disagreed with Thrawn, but never ceased to surprise  her.# The Seventh Fleet\nFaro, when Thrawn was a Commodore himself, was very sceptical of his motives and strategies. Despite this, Thrawn gained Faro’s approval due to his intelligence as a tactician, and in return, earned Thrawn’s respect because of her own tactics and honesty. The two ascended their way through the ranks and found themselves on a very important mission requested by the Emperor himself. With the supervision of the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader, the Chimaera and its crew were sent to the planet Batuu, so they could eliminate the disturbance the Emperor felt in the Force. Whilst Thrawn and Vader investigated what was happening on the planet, Faro was placed in charge and dealt with possible threats in space. They learned of a species called Grysks, who were supposedly hiding in the separatist droid factory on Mokivj. Vader and his Legion went to infiltrate the factory while Thrawn and Faro remained on the Chimaera. Thrawn soon alerted them of the Chiss children who had the capability to use the Force, they weren’t as strong though. Then Thrawn demanded all TIEs destroy the Grysks ships and they left no survivors. Once Faro returned she contact Imperial High Command about why she never received her task force and the Chimaera crew were called by Grand Moff Tarkin, Director Krennic, and Grand Admiral Savit to discuss Thrawn’’s TIE defender idea.

Born somewhere in the Outer Rim, he was a man whose renown and acts were remembered throughout the entirety of his order. His exhausting reputation, combined with the destruction of his homeworld and the death of his family, drove him to exile on Tatooine, where he joined the Tusken tribe. He had a son there, A'Sharad Hett, with whom he led the Tusken. This came to an end when Jedi Master Ki Adi Mundi was dispatched to fetch Sharad back during a battle with the Hutt. Aurra Sing, an ex-Jedi bounty hunter, murdered him in the conflict, leaving A’Sharad in the custody of Ki Adi Mundi, who adopted him as his padawan. Fortunately, the orphaned child succumbed to the evil side and became Darth Krayt, who subsequently ruled over the Sith Order.# Hero\nHett was initiated into the Jedi Order at an early age, as custom mandated. He learned in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and subsequently became Jedi Master Eeth Koth's student. Their connection developed substantially quicker than average, the master even permitting him to visit his family on his homeworld. Years later, as a Jedi Knight, his achievements made him famous across the order, exceeding his master's and gaining several titles. He even made friends, including Qui-Gon Jinn. Sharad despised his fame, believing that people's adulation for him had caused them to lose the humility that Jedi should have. He declared that all he wanted was to live with this family, and in 47 BBY, returned to Coruscant after completing a difficult assignment. Hett met his master there, and before saying farewell, he spoke to him one final time through tears. Now, he hoped the long-awaited family reunion would occur without any problems. However, upon his arrival, all the deserted Jedi saw was ruin and death, which devastated him and left only anguish.\n\n# Exile\nSharad, now a wanderer, landed on Tatooine, where he joined a Tusken clan and ultimately became their leader. He also had a son with his wife, K'Sheek, there. K'Sheek was stolen as a child by the tribe and raised as a Tusken. During a quiet decade, Sharad lived and schooled his kid in Jedi methods. However, peace didn’t endure forever; Jabba the Hutt was the one who shattered it. In order to acquire credits, he started a war between the Tusken tribes and the humans, allowing him to sell the blasters he had. With no other choice, the human Tusken led the tribes to war while attempting to limit losses on both sides. The Jedi Order dispatched Mundi to return the Jedi to the order, but Sharad felt his place was with the Tusken and declined the offer. Sharad faced off against Jabba, Garulla the Elder, and Aurra Sing. Sing came and dueled him while he was on his way to fight Jabba. Sharad proved to be far superior, but the bounty hunter had a surprise: Dun Möch. The combat form was unknown to Sharad, and it was during this period of confusion that she thrust him with her saber. Mundi, now with Sharad deceased, chose Sharad's son as his padawan, respecting his final words.\n\n# Powers and abilities\nIt is assumed that Sharad is on par with a Jedi Master, a rank he may have achieved if he hadn't exiled himself. He was noted for being an incredibly powerful force in lightsaber fighting, which he excelled at, only losing once due to a new kind of battle he had never seen before. Sharad was also incredibly skilled in the force, as well as competent at adapting to environmental tactics and survival, which allowed him to survive among the Tusken Raiders.\n\n# Lightsaber\nSharad carried his lightsaber with him at all times as a Jedi Knight and even after the exile. The color may have shifted throughout time, but he was famed for wielding a crimson-red blade as a warlord. A few years after his banishment, the Jedi Temple received word of a Tusken Raider wielding a crimson saber. Even Master Yoda recognized him, and Eeth Koth, his teacher, corroborated this notion. His son acquired the weapon before his father died, which he wielded during the Clone Wars. Decades later, A'Sharad Hett, the son, abandoned the ways of his father and became Darth Krayt.\n\n","meta":{"index":159,"author":"Craked10","name":"Sharad Hett","release_year":2023}},"Onimi":{"content":"# Overview\nOnimi was a male from the Yuuzhan Vong species. He was a Shamed Shaper and, other than another mystery individual and a questionable exception, the sole Force-sensitive member of his kind. At the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, Onimi turned out to be the actual force behind the Yuuzhan Vong.# Biography\nOnimi, a member of the Elite, was a shaper. He gradually acknowledged that the eighth cortex, which was meant to bear the wisdom required to survive the decades of conflict that the Yuuzhan Vong had consigned themselves to, was hollow. Onimi was recognized as a Shamed One after adding yammosk tissue to his brain, taking the shape of a psychologically and physically warped, crazy beast. He blamed the gods, particularly Yun-Harla the Trickster goddess, for his misfortunes. These changes made his social position crumble; he was treated as an annoyance and continuously underestimated. However, Supreme Overlord Shimrra did not despise him but instead treated him like a pet. The unknown reason for this was Onimi's connection to the force, a connection long lost in the Yuuzhan Vong. \nThe force gave him the possibility of playing with other people's minds. In addition, due to the experiments he suffered, Onimi could amplify the force he used and exude toxins from any part of his body. Trying to regain his position, Onimi used Shimrra. He encouraged him to embrace him as a familiar, turning him into a trickster for the new leader. Taking advantage of this new connection, he took an active role in deciding the species' new home. All in the shadows with the hope of returning to a position that was once his.\n\n# The Court of the Supreme Overlord\nOnimi wasn't solely a trickster. Under an alias, he collaborated with Nen Yim, another Vong, to develop the eighth cortex and new technologies for the Yuuzhan Vong. When the invasion wasn't going the way he intended, he took matters into his own hands. Nen was tasked with introducing information into the cortex, while Onimi interfered with the court of Shimrra. Nevertheless, he didn't have knowledge of war, and the warmaster's mistakes weren´t for him to blame. Their invasion of Coruscant was a failure, which led to their extermination by the now-named Galactic Alliance.\n\n# Revelation\nDuring the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, when Luke Skywalker and the Solo twins infiltrated Shimrra's quarters, Onimi directed the biologically modified Slayer soldiers as they sought to repel the Jedi. Their defeat made Onimi flee without a choice. Jaina, one of the Solo twins, pursued him to the throne room but was swiftly incapacitated. Now woken up, Jayla saw with terror Onimi's true form and intentions. It was revealed that he was the true mastermind behind Yuuzhan Vong. Furthermore, her use of Yun-Harla's reputation fueled even more of Onimi's hatred; he saw her as responsible for his tragic life. His true plan was to become a god by sending the Alpha Red pathogen to Zonama Sekot, Vong's origin planet. Onimi sensed the arrival of the other Solo Twin, Jacen. In him, he saw the living image of Yun-Shuno, a goddess known to pardon the Shamed One. Her death, from Onimi's point of view, was the pivotal point in his rise as a god. Therefore, he attacked Jacen, but unbeknownst to him, the Jedi had reached full connection with the Force, becoming one with it. With this power, he cured him using the pure power of the Force, eliminating all deformations. However, this led to Onimi's connection to the Force being lost and his resistance against toxins dissipating. These events caused his body to collapse and turn into a pool of toxic residue. His death and the loss of his connection caused the citadel to tremble and inevitably fall.\n\n# Legacy\nJacen's confrontation with Onimi had profound implications for Solo in the future. Jacen's perception of oneness with the Force gave him the same concept as the Unifying Force doctrine itself: he had transcended good and evil, light and dark. This event drove his mentality through the floor, leading him to lose his Jedi ways. Jacen eventually became Darth Caedus, the Sith Lord, and perished at the hands of Jaina, the sister he spared from Onimi.\n\n","meta":{"index":158,"author":"Craked10","name":"Onimi","release_year":2023}},"Darth Vectivus":{"content":"# Early Life\nDarth Vectivus was a Force Sensitive human male. During adulthood, he lived an average life, with not much going on. He had a family in which he cared for, and a good handful of friends. During his life, he worked in the business industry as well as trade. He learned much from trading, utilizing anything he learned into his business practices. He was an administrator of a mining facility in the MZX32905 system, which was located in the Kanz sector, near Lorrd and Bimmiel. His mining facility was designated the Jonex Mine Eight Eleven B mining facility. He settled his base of operations on an asteroid named, “The Home”. This asteroid was affluent in metal ores, which his company accumulated. To him, his peers, and employees, they did not know that this planet was infused with the dark side of the Force. The outcome of the dark side of the Force being on this planet engendered a sentient mynock-like species, which were extinct. The species had astronomically immense triangular yellow ocular perceivers, and communicated utilizing telepathy.\n\nOver time, being on the asteroid corrupted the minds of the workers. As for Force Sensitives who resided on the planet, they would optically discern abstruse visions. They commenced to comport much akin to the mynock-like species that resided on the planet afore them. After time, Darth Vectivus, who was also Force Sensitive, commenced to experience the aberrant sensation and visions the other Force Sensitives had. Conscientiously and mutely, he silenced any aberrant and odd reports, ceasing any activity that the Jonex Mining Facility was doing. He utilized his spare time to devote himself to experimenting with incipient things with the dark side of the Force. He developed and created new and different Force abilities and techniques while doing so.# Sith Lord\nAfter shutting down the operation located on the asteroid, he persuaded people to evade the asteroid, seeming as if nothing deplorable transpired. Following the recent event, he wandered the galaxy, hoping to find the Sith who could teach him the dark side of the Force and his incipiently found facilities. His mission was prosperous, as he was able to find a Sith Master, in which he became the Apprentice to and learned under them and their erudition. He had gained so much knowledge of the Dark Side that he progressed further than he could learn. After concluding his training under his master, he inherited the role of the Dark Lord of the Sith, going under the incipient designation, Darth Vectivus, a denomination that only a few would fear. Although he became Sith Lord, he still had the same morals as he did when he was a businessman. He maintained the morals he had, which obviated him from becoming corrupted and zealous for triumph, unlike his peers and those who came before him. Darth Vectivus was heavily more of a librarian than a combatant or a dictator. He relished reading and circumvented himself with erudition and lore of the Dark Side and Sith culture. As a plenarily-fledged Sith Lord, he arrived back at the mine, which he worked at. He built a sizably voluminous mansion inside of the core of the asteroid. He did so in order to be further connected to the dark side, which contaminated the asteroid. In case he ever physically died, he created a personal Sith holocron.\n\nThis holocron contained all the knowledge he learned after the years, and business skills, which one could use to become rich and invest well. Not only did it contain these things, but it gave a detailed explanation of empowered projections. Which Darth Vectivus created himself. These projections, which he nicknamed Phantoms were apparitions that the Force could control and altar. The Phantoms required a healthy soul of a living host to serve as the anchor of the person who created the apparition. The anchor allowed the physical embodiment of the user to be locked in the physical plane, without accidentally moving to the spiritual plane. If one apparition were to be destroyed or killed in any way, the other apparitions would follow after them and perish. Darth Vectivus was so strong with this ability he created that he was able to conjure hundreds of these phantoms, with barely any work. Darth Vectivus died at “The Home”, surrounded by those who cared for them.\n\n# Lumiya\nA millennia after Darth Vectivus’s death “The Home” was now the base of operations of Lumiya, who was a Force Sensitive human female and the Dark Lady of the Sith. “The Home” became a sanctuary where Lumiya studied different topics that Darth Vectivus held within his library. She would study the history of the Sith, the Force and what could do with it, and also Darth Vectivus. During Lumiya’s time living in “The Home” she encountered the spirit of Darth Vectivus. His spirit was found lingering in the bowels of the asteroid. From his spirit, Lumiya was able to master the ability to create and control Phantoms and apparitions to a great extent. She was so powerful with this ability that she could send these apparitions across the universe to do her bidding, whether it be to spy on someone, tell them something, or even attack them.\n\n\nCirca 40 ABY, Lumiya started to believe that the galaxy was slowly descending into a state of chaos and destruction. She thought that the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, the current reigning government, was unable to maintain peace and prosperity throughout the galaxy and the citizens. She felt as if the morals and beliefs of the late Darth Vectivus was needed in order to maintain the stability and peace that the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances were unable to uphold. Through this vision that she saw, she hoped to transform the Jedi Knight, Jacen Solo, into the Sith leader that no one else could become. Under the name “Brisha Syo” Lumiya was able to lure Jacen Solo, Ben Skywalker his cousin, and Nelani Dinn, a female Human Jedi Knight to “The Home.” Whilst in her base of operations, she was able to split up Jacen Solo from his trio of friends and started to manipulate him into becoming what she believed was the perfect Sith, Darth Vectivus. After time, Jacen became convinced by Darth Vectivus’s morals and beliefs, much to Lumiya’s plan. Chaos struck, as the Second Galactic Civil War followed after Jacen Solo fell to the dark side. From this, he changed his name from Jacen Solo into Darth Caedus, who would become a Dark Lord of the Sith.\n\n# Alema Rar\nFollowing the death of Lumiya, the residence was left unoccupied for a short time. After the time of “The Home” being unoccupied, a Twi’Lek Dark Jedi named Alema Rar took control of the domain. Alema Rar traveled to the Sith homeworld of Korriban in order to meet with members of a secret Sith Order. There, she was presented with Darth Vectivus’s holocron in which he made himself, in order to deliver it to Darth Caedus as a gift. Rar believed that the information within the holocron would be useless to Darth Caedus. In doing so, she did not give him the holocron, holding onto it. After the final days of the Battle of Kashyyyk Rar traveled back to “The Home”. When she arrived back, she started to learn and practice Darth Vectivus’s Phantom-creating ability.\n\n# The Destruction of The Home\nDarth Vectivus’s asteroid became aware to others, which cause people want to head there in order to gain knowledge on how to create the powerful apparitions which he and a few others once were able to make. A female Sith lord named Dician was informed that Alema Rar was in possession of “The Home” which was the base located on the asteroid on which Darth Vectivus once lived. Although most were unknown about Vectivus, he was mainly known for his ability to conjure the apparitions, which struck fear in those who were weak and wanted to learn these techniques. After a discussion, the Sith Order decided it was best to destroy the asteroid and “The Home” in order for no one to be able to learn how to create the apparitions. A shuttle crew from the “Poison Moon” traveled to the asteroid. They planted fission bombs in multiple locations, destroying the asteroid, obliterating everything on the asteroid, including “The Home” and the information stored within it.\n\n","meta":{"index":31,"author":"OfficiallyMommy","name":"Darth Vectivus","release_year":2022}},"Darth Nurin":{"content":"# Overview\nDarth Nurin was a female human Sith Lord who served in the reconstituted Sith Empire’s Imperial Fleet.

After killing his Sith Master, Darth Tenebrous was on the look for a new Sith Apprentice. Darth Tenebrous, also known as Rugess Nome, decided to take in a five-year-old Muun child known as Hego Damask, who turned into the Dark Side under the name of Darth Plagueis. \nIn 67 BBY, Darth Tenebrous, along with Darth Plagueis, went to Bal’demnic to investigate a lode of cortosis ore. The investigation didn’t go well, as their M2 mining probe droid ignited a gas that caused a massive explosion.

He presided over the Sith World of Ch’hodos, where his main base of operations was located. Shar Dakhan was a devotee of Naga Sadow, pledging his entire fleet to him in his war efforts against the Galactic Republic.# History of Dakhan\nDakhan was a male who belonged to the Sith species. He was a Sith lord and ruled over the Sith World of Ch’hodos up to the Great Hyperspace War. Sith Lord Naga Sadow became Dark Lord of the Sith after defeating Ludo Kressh and the death of Marka Ragnos. Naga Sadow announced plans to go to war with the Galactic Republic, and Dakhan donated his entire fleet for the cause. Soon after the pledge, Dakhan hosted a war rally at his fortress on Ch’hodos, with legions of Massassi caste soldiers, warships, and behemoths, with Dakhan riding a large green Sith war rhino.\n\nDakhan followed Sadow into the Great Hyperspace war, where Sadow instructed an invasion force led by Dakhan to capture the planet of Coruscant. Dakhan managed to force the outnumbered Jedi defenders to the Senate Hall steps. Sadow aided Dakhan by using Sith illusions to make Dakhan’s army appear stronger. The Jedi held out until Sadow broke concentration, and Dakhan’s army appeared to dwindle. This boosted the Jedi's confidence, allowing them to defeat Dakhan’s forces, without killing Dakhan himself. Dakhan was pursued by the Republic with his remaining army, which led to the second battle of Korriban, which resulted in the fleeing of Naga Sadow and Dakhan becoming acting Dark Lord.\n\nA counter invasion by the Republic was launched after the Great Hyperspace War, where Dakhan managed the defence of the Sith Empire.

His abilities as a Force-Sensitive were mediocre at best, and he lacked the confidence to ever become a true Jedi. His bad luck made him see something he shouldn't have and hence commenced a galactic manhunt for him. After clearing his name, he left the order and decided to live as a bounty hunter. During his manhunt, he met Jarael, a girl who would later become his companion. He would solve various problems throughout the universe and eventually return to Coruscant, where he would continue living and developing his relationship with Jarael.# Biography\nZayne, a young Jedi Knight, was discovered by an unknown Jedi Knight and brought to the Jedi Order. He was accepted to the Jedi Academy on Dantooine, where he was trained by Master Vandar. However, his Jedi abilities did not advance as far as hoped. He struggled to keep up with his fellow Padawans and was interested in the Mandalorian Wars and other issues affecting the Jedi Order.\n\nAfter encountering Squint, the Padawans on Taris faced a challenge. Zayne felt isolated and doubted his ability to become a Jedi Knight. The Masters' fears about their Padawans led them to desperate measures, as they hated the Sith. They announced a knighting ceremony, but the ceremony was a trap. Zayne, running late, discovered his Masters in the midst of their crime and managed to escape. Zayne's ineptitude saved him twice. Instead of taking Gryph to the authorities, he quickly went to the Jedi Tower. The Masters confirmed his knighting with a swift made-up story about his alleged \"special relationship\" with the Force. Shad grew suspicious of the Masters' treatment of Zayne and urged them to strike preemptively. Zayne and Gryph flee from the Jedi Masters, who have framed them for the Padawan massacre. They encounter the aging mechanic \"Camper\" and his friend Jarael, who attack Zayne with their shockstaff skills.\n\nThey descended to the rogue moon to find clues to the Padawan Massacre, revealing the destroyed droid that might have had information about the Masters' murder of their Padawans. However, before they could locate its information, Lucien Draay and the forces of the Republic descended to the moon's surface to capture Zayne.  Zayne returns to Taris, where he encounters Mandalorian ships and a Mark II assault droid. He discovers a Hidden Bek hideout, where Brejik and gang members attack Zayne. The Mandalorians arrive, and Zayne and the Hidden Bek gang retreat. During their conversation, Zayne encounters a Twi'lek girl named Mission Vao, who reveals she has a pet. They follow Griff, who kidnaps the missing Constable of Taris' children. Despite Gadon's anger, the Hidden Beks can negotiate with the Taris Resistance and join them.\n\nAfter Raana's death, the Taris Resistance leader, Zayne, and Gryph left the Taris Resistance and entered the Undercity. They were forced out of the village by Rakghouls. They encountered Jedi Master Celeste Morne, who was sent by the Jedi Covenant to recover the Muur Talisman and bring the fugitive Padawan in. Morne discovered the Padawans were the supposed killers, but they were unable to kill them due to their noise. Blasting interrupted their journey, and they fell through the floors. Celeste followed them.\n\nZayne and his companions, excluding Alek and Shel, landed on Odryn to uncover the Covenant's misdeeds. They hid in Del and Dob Moomo's laundry hamper and entered the Sanctum of the Exalted, documenting Sith artifacts recovered by the Covenant. Zayne discovered that Covenant researchers analyzed the artifacts and had enough evidence to show the Jedi Council. They encountered Feeorin Borjak, who questioned Zayne's intentions and revealed that the Feeorins had broken down since the Padawan Massacre. The unexpected arrived, surprised Zayne and Gryph, and ordered Feln to destroy the Sanctum of the Exalted. Feln agreed to kill Zayne, but Zayne tried to convince Borjak and the Feeorins that Feln was using his people for his own benefit. Despite Feln's attempts to kill Zayne, he managed to escape and avoid Feln's attack. Borjak reported that the Moomo Williwaw was approaching Odryn, and Zayne's friends were planning to raid the Sanctum. Zayne witnessed Feln's detonation, causing the Sanctum to explode, burning the village. Feln blamed Zayne for the devastation and promised to strike him with his lightsaber. Gryph swapped the lightsaber, and Borjak and the other Feeorins turned against Feln, ending his life and rule. Later, Borjak found Zayne's lightsaber and proposed rebuilding it. Zayne agreed, believing it would be better for Borjak and his people. However, Zayne lost evidence against the Covenant when Jarael revealed that the Moomo Brothers had smuggled Sith artifacts from the Sanctum onto their ship.\n\nAfter Operation Vindication, Zayne left for Dantooine to help his deceased Padawan friends. He founded the Rogue Moon Project, which aimed to help those abandoned by the Jedi Order and the Republic. During his time away, Gryph devised a plan to destroy the planetary exchange market on Metellos 3. He recruited Rohlan and Jarael to pose as natives of Italbos and ferry him to the moon. Gryph disguised himself as a professor of law, but the leader of the planetary exchange, Chevin Nunk Plaarvin, grew suspicious and wanted to rid himself of the three. Zayne saved Gryph by cutting down the droids. They went to the \"Negotiation Room\" and showed the Hot Prospect, which was bought by Slyssk. They dressed Slyssk up as a member of the Syndicate and tricked Nunk into believing the Syndicate knew about the credits he was laundering. They sent Nunk to the devastated planet of Jebble, allowing the Chev slaves to work free. Despite Jarael and Rohlan's warnings, they emerged unharmed and learned about Jarael's Force-sensitive nature. Zayne tried to tell the truth at the auction, but they bought Gryph's story and bought the planet anyway.\n\nThe crew of the Hot Prospect travels to Wor Tandell to rest and discuss Jarael's slavery origins. Jarael was kidnapped by the Crucible and forced to fight in slave pens to train for dueling. She was eventually rescued by Camper. Zayne offers to help her track down the Crucible, but she refuses. Zayne later visits the town of Gantra Lea and meets Ferroh, a Cathar Jedi who tells him about joining the war against the Mandalorians. Ferroh discovers that his entire species vanished, and the Revanchist leaders, Revan and Malak, investigate the planet. They are told the Cathars likely left due to disease and should quit their investigation. As they disperse, Revan and the rest of the Jedi have a vision of a massacre of Cathar refugees by Cassus Fett and his Mandalorian Crusaders. The Mandalorian forces herd the Cathar into the ocean, killing the Cathar and one Mandalorian. Revan takes up the fallen Mandalorian's mask, claiming to take up the deceased's cause and take the moniker Revan. After the revelation of the genocide, the Jedi High Council grants the Revanchists permission to join the war. Malak and Rohlan were battling in the Hot Prospect when Zayne, Ferroh, and Telettoh returned. Malak tried to recruit Jarael to the Revanchists' cause, but Rohlan disapproved. Malak attacked Rohlan, causing him to be disabled. Zayne agreed to be his ally but later kissed her. Malak and Gryph were surprised, as they had different plans for the war. Zayne helped Jarael run from the Covenant and prepare for it, allowing him to refuse Malak's recruitment. The two agreed to go after the Crucible, and Zayne had contacts to help finish the slaving organization.\n\nAfter the events on Volgax, Jarael, and Rohlan left the Hot Prospect to testify against the recently reawakened Demagol. Carrick learned that certain members of his crew were keeping secrets from him, including Elbee's secret about Rohlan's escape from Flashpoint. Zayne decided to break Rohlan out of custody, as the rest of the galaxy was under the impression that the prisoner was Demagol. During the trial, Rohlan broke his restraints and was recruited by Malak. The Mandalorian was questioned by the Jedi, who appealed to the crowd's emotions by demonizing the Mandalorians. The Mandalorian was eventually taken away to a security speeder for his protection. The two guards accompanying Rohlan revealed themselves as Carrick and Hierogryph, who needed his help to stop Demagol. Demagol, originally named Antos Wyrick, was a Zeltron who was abducted by Iskalloni slavers and later freed by a Mandalorian raid. Wyrick took the DNA of Arkanian Jedi Master Arca Jeth and began experimenting on children, creating Force-sensitive individuals. He later became a Mandalorian Crusader under the alias of Doctor Demagol. As Rohlan finished his tale, Shel Jelavan and Slyssk arrived, bringing replacement armor for Rohlan. Zayne informed Gryph of the existence of the Rogue Moon Project and showed the organization's plans. Shel gave Zayne his lightsaber, now engraved with the names of his former classmates. Slyssk recalls a microtag from Demagol's vessel, revealing a double-bladed lightsaber. Carrick discovers Demagol and Jarael are on Osadia, but lacks planet coordinates. To capture Dace Golliard, Carrick asks Rohlan to contact Cassus Fett, hoping to repay his debt.\n\nEventually, they end up finishing the mission and rescuing Jarael. They, together, returned to Coruscant to return Jarael to her family. Zayne returned to his planet for a few days but ultimately came back for his beloved.\n\n# Personality and Traits\nHe was very dedicated to the Order but was unsure about his position. He believed in the Order's ideals and was willing to sacrifice himself for his peers. However, both times he faced death, he willingly surrendered to evict it. He did not like using violence; he was capable of doing his missions without suffering a loss or producing a loss. With time, he grew and matured, making him more confident and decisive in battle. His confidence even grew bigger after he lied to Malak by kissing Jarael and making him believe she would join them.\n\n# Powers and abilities\nFrom a young age, Zayne's clumsiness, and inaptitude with the Force were clear; however, he possessed the ability to make friends, something that would help him in the future. During his training as a padawan, he learned a very rare skill: a natural connection to the Living Force. He also had the possibility of foreseeing the future very clearly. Unlike most Jedi, whose capacity was limited from the moment they were born due to Midichlorians, Zayne didn´t possess that limit. His natural connection to the Living Force made him capable of continuously becoming stronger. He even learned to use telekinesis. However, his very poor starting point in the Force, made him unable to properly train with lightsabers and never actually learn properly.\n\n","meta":{"index":154,"author":"Craked10","name":"Zayne Carrick","release_year":2023}},"Marka Ragnos":{"content":"# Section I\nBorn a sith-human hybrid, Marka Ragnos was a direct descendant of the Dark Jedi who would flee from the Republic after the Hundred Year Darkness. Ragnos was admired, feared, wise and powerful, and obeyed among the Sith. He was even considered to be the best Dark Lord of the Sith during his time. Ragnos was born a long time before 5100 BBY. When another Dark Lord of the Sith died, Ragnos and Simus, another Sith Lord, took up the mantle. In order to claim the rank for himself, Ragnos had to fight Simus, a formidable warrior in combat. Ragnos eventually won the duel, defeating Simus and becoming a Dark Lord of the Sith. As a Dark Lord of the Sith, Marka Ragnos would lead many campaigns against his Sith enemies, pitting his opponents against each other to ensure his right to the throne. He would rule for over a century with an iron-fist. Ragnos composed his own Epistle, a document of literary work authored by Ragnos, which would eventually be destroyed by Celeste Morne at some point prior to 3963 BBY. Ragnos also created a Scepter, nicknamed the Scepter of Ragnos capable of drawing out the Force from many different places, which could be utilized to empower other Force-users around him. Ragnos then created a pair of gauntlets capable of increasing the strength of the Force in its users. Many years later, a thirteen-year-old boy named Tenebrae would show himself and petition himself before Marka Ragnos and the ruler of the Sith Council of the Sith Empire at the time. He asked for Marka Ragnos to train him in the arts of the Sith and bestow upon him ruler of his father’s domain, the planet known as Medriaas. Although Ragnos did take him on as a Sith Apprentice, he was impressed by the courage and ambition of Tenebrae, granting him ruler of Medriaas along with the rank of Sith Lord which would grant him the name known as Vitiate. After his rule, Ragnos passed away in the year 5000 BBY. His death marked the end of a golden age for the Sith even though the Sith Empire was still in its expansion after his death. He was truly the greatest Dark Lord of the Sith during his time.# Section II\nHowever, Marka Ragnos’ legacy as a Dark Lord of the Sith continued on after his death, the Ragnos Lakes, on the planet Kesh for instance, were named after the Dark Lord. Two Sith Lords, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh emerged as favorites among the Sith who soon would duel in order to reach the throne as the newest Dark Lord of the Sith. The two engaged in a duel of Sith swords, after a disagreement as to who would better serve the Sith Empire. Ragnos’ spirit appeared before the dueling Sith, proclaiming in a great speech that only the most worthy could succeed him on the throne. After the duel, Naga Sadow emerged victorious and reached the title of Dark Lord of the Sith. Vitiate, however, did not join in on the succession of Marka Ragnos, he remained hidden until he saw the time to be right. About a millennium after his death, Marka Ragnos was unintentionally summoned from his grave by Sith Lord Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma with the assistance of Sith talismans. He claimed that Exar Kun would become the new Dark Lord of the Sith, and Ulic Qel-Droma would be the first of his Sith Apprentices all in an attempt to restore the lost empire of a thousand years prior. The Great Sith War devastated the galaxy, but the Sith Empire, however, was not restored. A few decades after Ragnos’ death, Vitiate reconstituted the Sith Empire once again, lighting a new war upon the Galactic Republic 1,319 years after Marka Ragnos’ death. By the time of the Galactic War, the Force Ghost of Marka Ragnos would appear on the Fourth moon of Yavin Prime, roaming a cave known as the Architect’s Hollow.\n\n# Section III\nThousands of years after Marka Ragnos’ actual death, during the time of the New Republic era, in 14 ABY, the Disciples of Ragnos, a Sith Cult, rose up in an attempt to resurrect Marka Ragnos from the grave and summon him as a Spirit. The Leader of this cult was Tavion Axmis, Desann’s student. Tavion used a Scepter, once used by Marka Ragnos, to siphon Force energy from many Force Nexuses around the galaxy and use it on the members of the Disciples of Ragnos to empower their Force abilities. Once Tavion collected the amount of Force energy needed, he would use the remainder of it to resurrect the Dark Lord. However, the New Jedi Order was tracking the Disciples across the galaxy. Jedi Luke Skywalker and Kyle Katarn were in charge of the campaign to find the Disciples of Ragnos on Korriban; they dispatched any and all available Jedi from the Temple on Yavin 4. Among them, a Jedi named Jaden Korr, would participate in the missions against the Disciples of Ragnos for almost the entirety of the campaign. Korr managed to enter Ragnos’ tomb on Korriban during the time of the Battle of Korriban when Axmis managed to resurrect the spirit of Marka Ragnos, but Ragnos would ultimately and inevitably be defeated by Korr herself, forcing his spirit back into the sarcophagus as he screamed out that he would return.\n\n","meta":{"index":179,"author":"PhaseSpectr","name":"Marka Ragnos","release_year":2021}},"Darth Lokess":{"content":"# Overview\nDarth Lokess was a female being of either human or Pureblood descent, who served the reconstituted Sith Empire as a Dark Council member.

However, he would not align himself with his native culture. Instead, Desann sought power and mastery of the Force, ultimately becoming a Dark Jedi. He became a member of the Imperial Remnant, the faction that emerged following the defeat of the Galactic Empire at the Battle of Endor. Desann's notoriety grew during the years following the Galactic Civil War, as he became a prominent figure within the ranks of the Shadow Academy, an organization dedicated to training Dark Jedi. Under the guidance of the Dark Jedi Master, Tavion Axmis, Desann honed his combat skills and delved deeper into the dark side of the Force.

Krennic would later become a supervisor of large onworld and deep space construction projects in the Republic’s Corps of Engineers, Erso would focus on applied sciences and Kyber Crystal research.\n\nAfter the fall of the Republic and the creation of the Galactic Empire, Krennic became an officer in the army. His research and continued secret construction work of the DS-1 Death Star Battle Station was going as it was planned but some setbacks have caused delays, such as the Malpaz Disaster where a research facility got destroyed and a major loss of life and intelligence occurred. His work was supervised by Grand Moff Gideon Tarkin who expected Krennic to create this superweapon one way or another. \n\nWith Galen Erso in Krennic’s grip, Krennic managed to get a prototype of the weapon he has been working on since Erso began his research on Kyber Crystals provided by Krennic.

Palpatine manufactured him, and he was appointed Guardian of the Imperial warehouse at Mount Tantiss on Wayland. Grand Admiral Thrawn visited Wayland after learning of the storehouse's existence. With the assurance that he would have new apprentices including the likes of Luke Skywalker, he was successful in persuading the Dark Jedi to assist him in his effort to destroy the New Republic. Thrawn would later order that C'Baoth be held captive in Mount Tantiss as he became conscious of the clone’s true danger. His life was ended by Mara Jade and his body would erupt in a dark force explosion.# Biography\nIt was said that the Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth had a tissue sample taken from him just before he boarded the Outbound Flight in 27 BBY to travel to the Unknown Regions and beyond. Extracted from every passenger on the outbound flight, it was justified by the possibility of viruses or epidemics developing while they were in space. These were utilized to produce a clone from a sample of C'Baoth's tissue. Shortly after the extraction, C'baoth and his fellow travelers boarded Outbound Flight for their journey, but Thrawn's actions prevented the ship from carrying out its purpose. Emperor Palpatine once sent a Guardian to the planet Wayland to watch over his secret warehouses and cargo atop Mount Tantiss. The Guardian was neglected for the following five years after the Battle of Endor and Palpatine's passing, during which time he became bored. The Guardian was then challenged to a battle by Joruus C'baoth, who had just arrived on the planet. The Guardian was dead, and C'baoth assumed his position, utilizing the Force to maintain control over the people of Wayland.\nC'baoth received orders from the reincarnated Emperor Palpatine at some time before or after his combat with the Guardian, the identical orders issued to all of Palpatine's Dark Jedi.\nBut clone mania caused him to disobey or forget these directives, and like Thrawn, he would function as a diversion to hide the Emperor's increasing power. Later, with the goal of using everything there to further his battle against the New Republic, Thrawn managed to locate the Emperor's private storeroom on Wayland. He was aware that a Dark Jedi Guardian was present under Palpatine's rule and that it would be advantageous for his cause. They traveled to a settlement close to Mount Tantiss, where they were greeted by an elderly man who revealed to the Imperials that he had murdered the mountain's guardian long ago and had since taken over the planet. He took them to a tomb where he attempted to murder them by unleashing a lethal blast of Force lightning. He was only spared death by the Grand Admiral's cautious usage of Ysalamiri. The mad Dark Jedi was persuaded to join forces with Thrawn by making him a promise that his apprentices would be his to shape whatever he pleased. C'baoth has grand plans to rule the galaxy by building an army of Dark Jedi. The first of his Jedi would be Skywalker, his sister, and the kids of the Solo family.  In multiple engagements, C'baoth fought alongside Thrawn, boosting the effectiveness of the Imperial troops by 40%. When the Jedi approached him on Jomark, he also succeeded in one of his primary objectives: capturing Luke Skywalker. C'baoth had sensed Skywalker's presence during the First Battle of Nomad City earlier in the campaign and had spoken with the Jedi. At the same time, rumors that a Jedi was on Jomark were being propagated by Imperial soldiers. Skywalker finally visited Jomark, despite his skepticism about the existence of a Jedi who had not only survived the Great Jedi Purge but also hadn't helped the Rebel Alliance or even disclosed himself after Palpatine's death. He encountered C'baoth there, who identified himself as a Jedi Master. He started Skywalker's instruction, imparting knowledge on him that was at odds with what the young Jedi had previously learned from Yoda. Skywalker was taught by C'baoth that Jedi should utilize their authority to rule inferiors since they were superior to everyone else. He also taught him that in order to govern those who are not Force-sensitive, Jedi should utilize force and pain as their teaching tools. Skywalker made an effort to treat C'baoth and bring him around after realizing that he was both psychotic and a practitioner of the dark side of the Force. After some time had passed, C'baoth informed Skywalker that he had detected the presence of a second Force-sensitive individual, one whom Skywalker had already met: the smuggler and former Emperor's Hand Mara Jade. She would eventually be his killer when C’baoth attempted to clone her. Many years after his passing, C'baoth's memory continued to frighten those who had experienced his insanity.\n\n# Personality and traits\nThe clone shared the same level of haughtiness as the Jedi Master, thinking that being a Jedi inevitably gave one supremacy over others. C'baoth was similarly overconfident, thinking that the might of the Force would let him to do practically any endeavor.  C'baoth was adamant that Thrawn was wrong to define power in terms of reigning over entire worlds rather than over specific individuals, and that authority over such individuals came from understanding them.  Thrawn was sure that he could keep C'baoth under control with the ysalamiri and thoughtfully planned instructions until he was no longer required. C'baoth, who subsequently revolted against Thrawn and tried to seize leadership for himself, had been misjudged by Thrawn.  Few were aware that Joruus C'baoth was a clone since the Great Jedi Purge had destroyed the majority of documents pertaining to the Jedi and the planet Wayland was kept a well guarded secret.\nThrawn only knew this, in reality, since he had been present when Outbound Flight was shattered and the actual Jorus C'baoth was killed. The irony of this hidden reality is that even Joruus C'baoth lost his true ancestry and thought he was the original Jorus C'baoth due to years of solitude and failing sanity.\n\n# Powers and abilities\nThe clone was equally as deadly as Darth Vader because, like Jorus C'baoth, he was incredibly powerful with the Force and had access to a wide range of Force abilities. He was a brilliant practitioner of the discipline of war meditation, and he utilized it to direct Thrawn's armies and plan assaults. He could wield Force lightning, and he regularly did.  The C'baoth clone desired to be able to manipulate other people's brains, though.He also possessed the ability to seize control of other people's brains and actually remodel them in his own image, which was a very challenging task. In addition, he was capable of inducing lethargy and weariness as well as using Force Scream, a destructive sonic weapon.\n\n","meta":{"index":143,"author":"Craked10","name":"Joruus C'baoth","release_year":2023}},"Borsk Fey'lya":{"content":"# Introduction\nBorsk Fey’lya, born to the Bothan species, was a political activist, whose career played out throughout the New Republic Era. He was one of the Alliance's main figures that helped restore the Republic. He led the government as Chief of State, during Yuuzhan Vong's invasion of the galaxy. During the weaker days, when Coruscant was conquered, he became a martyr by suiciding and taking 25000 invaders with him. During his political career, Borsk earned a lot of friends but also enemies. His most notorious enemy was Admiral Ackbar. His reputation was not the best, as his lust for power and the fear to lose it, his bad relations with the New Jedi Order, and his emotionless behavior didn’t make him the best of candidates. It was made even more clear when he wasn't capable of maintaining order during the Thrawn Campaign.# Biography\nBorsk Fey'lya, a young Bothan colony world member, turned to politics at a young age due to his lack of abilities in any other thing. He gained political support through deals and eventually became Chief Councilor of the Bothan Council. Fearing the Empire's laws with certain species, Fey'lya joined the Bothan Spynet and became a diplomat. After the end of Emperor Palpatine's rule, Fey'lya joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He led a large group of Bothans in fleeing Kothlis and joining the Alliance. Fey'lya became one of the most important figures in the Alliance. \n\nFey'lya aimed to gain recognition. He secretly planned to re-establish Bel Iblis' position, but failed. He then led a delegation to meet Alliance Fleet members before the Battle of Endor, but did not gain Bel Iblis' alliance. He was escorted to a Star Cruiser, but was attacked by mercenaries. The Bothan Spynet supported the rebel cause, with Borsk involved in the theft of the Death Star II plans. His rise to power was fueled by the information he gained that revealed the existence and location of the second Death Star. He signed the Declaration of the Alliance of Free Planets and became a member of the New Republic's Provisional Council and Inner Council. He was an effective administrator and always debated Ackbar on every decision or proposal he brought to the Council.\n\nFey'lya attempted to monopolize power by dominating the New Republic's response to the Krytos virus. Fey'lya wanted to remove Ackbar as a rival during the war against Grand Admiral Thrawn. He suggested that the loss of an Elomin task force was a sign of Ackbar's lack of ability as Supreme Commander of the military. His actions were carried out to annoy Ackbar, and his position as a member of the Inner Council allowed him to do this all too often.\n\nFey'lya regained power as the New Republic reorganized, becoming Head of the Justice Council and a member of the Ruling Council. After Leia Organa Solo's resignation, Fey'lya was elected as the successor to the Chief of State. He faced challenges in maintaining peace, diplomatic relations with the Yuuzhan Vong, and controlling Luke Skywalker's Jedi. Fey'lya initially rejected the existence of the Yuuzhan Vong but eventually accepted their existence. He was also suspicious of the New Jedi Order, as they had already failed to prevent the rise of the Empire and Darth Vader. He wasn’t alone, as over an entire generation had grown up with no memory of the Jedi being considered champions of justice and peace. Fey'lya eventually gave up and sent the Republic to war, but his bad relations with the Jedi and the military severely reduced their winning possibilities.\n\nEventually, he was forced to accept that there was no way of making peace with the Yuuzhan Vong and finally understood that the Jedi were the only hope. The Yuuzhan Vong launched their attack on Coruscant, forcing its evacuation. Believing that he had lost everything, and that he only had a life of shame waiting for him if he lived, he stayed behind, attaching a bomb to his heart. He was killed when he refused to surrender and this detonated the bomb, killing over twenty-five thousand Yuuzhan Vong Warriors. Although the invasion was a success for the Yuuzhan Vong, their losses were heavy.\n\n# Legacy\nNo one can actually say he was a good person, his reputation was irredeemable indeed however no one can question whether he died a hero. He earned the respect not only of his people but also of his enemies, even Yuuzhan Vong recognized him. His sacrifice made him a martyr for his people.\n\n","meta":{"index":142,"author":"Craked10","name":"Borsk Fey'lya","release_year":2023}},"Tulak Hord":{"content":"# Introduction\nTulak Hord was an ancient Dark Lord of the Sith who would become known as one of the greatest lightsaber duellists in galactic history. The Dark Lord would utilize his lightsaber with such speed and ferocity that even in his earliest days as a student within the Sith Empire, the young Sith aspirant would inspire fear amongst his peers and those above him, leaving in his wake a legacy of destruction and power unrivalled by even the most powerful Dark Lords who would come after him.# Part I\nTulak Hord began his life as a Sith student within the earliest version of the Sith Empire. He displayed a natural mastery of the Force and martial combat that allowed him a swift ascension through the Sith Academy. His skills were so great that it even caused his instructors to fear him, and none of his peers stood any chance of rivalling him. \n\nBefore Tulak Hord became a Dark Lord of the Sith he would duel and defeat a Dashade named Khem Val. This is no small feat as the Dashade species had a notable immunity to the Force and had garnered a reputation as ruthless assassins and feared warriors. Defeating Khem Val gained Tulak Hord his eternal respect and undying allegiance. This gave Tulak Hord an even greater advantage during his early Sith career, granting him access to one of the deadliest assassins and warriors in the galaxy.\n\n# Part II\nThe specifics of Tulak Hord’s rise to power are unknown, but we do know of one action that gained him the reputation as the most feared warrior in the galaxy. During the early days of the Sith Empire, even before the Dromund system was conquered, Tulak Hord would be forced to deal with rebellion. Sith rule at the time was barbaric and almost tribal in nature, as so many planets had a habit of rebelling against lesser Sith Lords who governed them. Tulak Hord would put the terror of the dark side in these rebellious planets, amassing an army of Sith loyalists, Tulak Hord along with his right hand warrior and general, Khem Val, travelled to the worlds of Yn and Chabosh and waged a campaign of terror against the rebels.\n\nDuring the reign of Tulak Hord he would go on to conquer the Dromund system which would later serve as the capital of the Sith Empire and seat of Imperial power. During this time, Jedi and Sith alike both challenged Tulak Hord’s power but his mastery of lightsaber combat and almost unnatural mastery of the dark side allowed him to cut down swaths of Jedi and Sith with little effort.\n\n# Part III\nTulak Hord was unique amongst Sith warriors in that he maintained a mastery of the Force and dark side alchemy that was typically unheard of by those so gifted in lightsaber combat. When Tulak Hord was not waging war he would study alchemy, create holocrons of teachings and even write various books and journals regarding his experiences and what he’s learned. Tulak Hord was a staunch traditionalist, being known for participating in the ancient Sith tradition called the ‘’Kaggath’’. He was an honourable warrior despite being a Sith Lord and would expect the same from his Generals. \n\nWhen a Sith Lord requested to become a General in Tulak Hord’s army he was initially dismissed, but the Sith Lord would challenge Tulak Hord in a Kaggath to which the Dark Lord was forced to accept. Upon defeating the General, Tulak Hord granted the young Sith Lord his deserved honour and made him a General in his army. Tulak Hord was not above deception however, often utilizing his follower, Khem Val to conduct assassinations against rivals and threats.\n\n# Part IV\nAfter conquering the Dromund system, Tulak Hord believed it was time to take an apprentice, an heir worthy of succeeding him as Dark Lord of the Sith Empire. This was perhaps his greatest mistake. Tulak Hord chose a young Sith named Ortan Cela who was particularly deceptive in nature and was not naturally gifted or exceptional in any particular way. Tulak Hord would pass on many teachings to Ortan Cela but in typical Sith fashion, Ortan Cela betrayed his master. Tulak Hord was so feared and so powerful that Ortan Cela would be incredibly foolish to challenge his master. Knowing this fact, Ortan Cela would stab Tulak Hord in the back, killing the most feared warlord in the galaxy in perhaps the most controversial fashion. \n\nIt is unknown what became of Ortan Cela, but due to Sith tradition at the time it is unlikely Ortan was strong enough or considered worthy enough to take Tulak Hord’s mantle. The death of the Lord of Hate caused a power struggle and plunged the Sith Empire into one of its most natural states, that of civil war.\n\n# Part V\nTulak Hord was considered to be the greatest Sith blademaster for millenia, his teachings and abilities being renowned and studied even during the days of the Cold War and Old Republic. Most of his journals, holocrons and belongings would be hidden and spread across the galaxy prior to his death and many Sith believed Tulak Hord had discovered immortality before he died. \n\nHis teachings and belongings would be sought after for centuries. His lightsaber would end up in the hands of Darth Marr prior to his ascension to the Dark Council. Some of his holocrons and even his terrifying mask would end up in the possession of Revan. And his tomb stood forever as one of the grandest in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban. \n\nThe spirit of Tulak Hord would return on Yavin IV for a short while, alongside many other Sith Lords such as Freedon Nadd, Naga Sadow and Exar Kun. But the purpose of the spirit’s existence is unknown, though likely sinister.\n\n","meta":{"index":13,"author":"Seko1111","name":"Tulak Hord","release_year":2021}},"Darth Vilus":{"content":"# Overview\nDarth Vilus was a Sith Lord of either human or Sith Pureblood descent, who served the resurgent Sith Empire and died before the start of the Cold War. Vilus wrote a lot during his life, having written three thousand writings. It is also said that he had many apprentices, even killing his fourth one, after he caught him spying on the Sith Lord. Vilus was very powerful and he proved this by using the rare Force walk ability. After he performed the ritual, just like many others, Vilus started to hear Force Ghosts in his head. Annoyed by this, he set out to find  a cure. Vilus had heard of a cure that could heal damaged minds, with its supposed location being on the planet Voss. Vilus went to Voss to find this cure, but went insane before finding it.. Darth Vilus had made a few writings on the cure before his death, and fortunately, the young Sith Lord Kallig, who would later join the Dark Council and become a Dark Lord of the Sith that served as the Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, read about Vilus’ writings. Kallig, also known as Darth Nox, learned about this in the secret library that belonged to the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Thanaton.

There, Sariss first met her future master, Jerec of the Inquisitorius in the Galactic Empire. Because Cronal held to a creed of violent nihilism, the mere existence of his daughter constituted a shocking offense, as it was a tribute to creation instead of destruction. Consequently, Sariss was disavowed by her father in the most horrid way he could conspire; Cronal not only allowed his fellow Prophets to freely engage her in carnal relations against her will, but he also partook himself.# Biography\nSariss's life was shrouded in tragedy and darkness, beginning with her upbringing as the daughter of Lord Cronal, a prominent figure among the Prophets of the Dark Side. Raised on the desolate world of Dromund Kaas, Sariss underwent rigorous training in the dark arts of the Force. Little did she know that her existence as Cronal's daughter was seen as an affront to his nihilistic beliefs, leading to her disavowal and subjecting her to unspeakable abuse at the hands of her father and his fellow Prophets. Seeking refuge on Tatooine, Sariss assumed the persona of the \"Prophetess,\" working alongside local Governor Tour Aryon. While her cover as a fortune teller allowed her to gather information, she also served as a spy for the Secret Order of the Empire. During her time on Tatooine, Sariss encountered Wuher, a person she claimed was the reincarnation of Cedo Partu, and engaged in a game of manipulation and deception. Driven by her allegiance to the Empire, Sariss eventually abandoned her post to become a Dark Jedi under the tutelage of Jerec. Although she outwardly professed devotion to the Empire's Church of the Dark Side, Sariss secretly trained as a disciple of Jerec, seducing and manipulating individuals to further her own goals. One such instance involved engaging a wealthy Epicanthix mineral baron and his son, Yun, whom she eventually convinced to murder his own father. Sariss presented Yun to Jerec as an Apprentice, solidifying her loyalty and furthering her own ascent. With the death of Emperor Palpatine, Sariss and Jerec worked to rebuild the crumbling Empire while simultaneously searching for the legendary Valley of the Jedi. Their efforts led them to Dorlo, where they pursued Jedi Master Qu Rahn, who possessed knowledge of the Valley's location. In a series of encounters, Sariss and her fellow Dark Jedi engaged in battles with Rahn and his Rebel allies. Despite their initial setbacks, Sariss and her companions regrouped and eventually captured Rahn. Following their success, Sariss and her allies embarked on a mission to gather the hidden map fragments that would lead them to the Valley of the Jedi. They traveled to Sulon, where they recovered the map pieces hidden within the Katarn homestead. Sariss dismissed the concerns of her comrade, Boc, who sensed a powerful presence watching them, believing it to be nothing more than their own significance drawing attention. As their search progressed, Sariss reported their progress to Jerec. The digitized map was transmitted and the original destroyed, thwarting the efforts of another Jedi, Kyle Katarn, who sought to reach the Valley before Jerec. Upon identifying Ruusan as the location of the Valley of the Jedi, Jerec promptly mobilized his forces to establish an excavation site there. During the course of their mission, Sariss interacted with Yun and entrusted him with assignments. However, tragedy struck when Sariss attempted to execute Kyle Katarn, resulting in Yun sacrificing himself to save the Jedi. Witnessing her Apprentice's selfless act, Sariss realized the truth in Yun's final words, acknowledging Katarn as a true Jedi of the light side. Enraged by the loss of Yun, Sariss engaged Kyle Katarn in a lightsaber duel. Despite initially holding the advantage, she ultimately fell victim to Katarn's skill and was fatally wounded. Sariss's death marked the end of her journey as a Dark Jedi, while Kyle went on to rescue his partner and defeat the remaining members of the Dark Jedi cadre. Sariss's tragic story serves as a reminder of the destructive path one can be led down when consumed by darkness and manipulation. Her journey highlights the consequences of loyalty to power-hungry masters and the fleeting nature of allegiance in a galaxy torn apart by conflict.\n\n# Personality and traits\nSariss possessed an average height and adhered to a fashion style similar to Jerec, always dressed in black with a striking red collar, while also applying red lipstick and nail polish in line with human female trends. Notably, she maintained short hair, resembling the style commonly seen among human males. Among Jerec's assembly of ruthless Dark Jedi, Sariss stood out for her insatiable hunger for power, a quality that earned her Jerec's trust and placed her in a close position among his trusted lieutenants. She held a unique distinction as the only one to address Jerec as \"My lord.\" Displaying a cunning nature, Sariss would stealthily eavesdrop on her fellow Dark Jedi's discussions and opportunistically interrupt them. In moments when Yun was caught off-guard, she would reprimand him, attributing his lack of sensing abilities as the cause.\n\n# Powers and abilities\nDespite her quiet and reserved demeanor, Sariss proved to be an incredibly formidable adversary, particularly in combat situations. Among the seven Dark Jedi, she was widely recognized as the most skilled lightsaber fighter, relying heavily on her exceptional fencing abilities rather than relying on a wide array of Force powers. Notably, Sariss possessed a unique technique known as Deadly Sight, which granted her a distinct advantage by enabling her to execute ranged attacks against her opponents. This rare ability further emphasized her versatility and prowess as a Dark Jedi.\n\n","meta":{"index":133,"author":"SkyPanik","name":"Sariss","release_year":2023}},"Sev'rance Tann":{"content":"# Overview\nSev'rance Tann, a Force-sensitive Chiss female, became a Dark Acolyte and a trusted general in the Confederacy during the Clone Wars. Trained by Count Dooku, she excelled in battles, stealing powerful Republic technology, the Decimators. Her audacious attack on Sarapin left Core Worlds in darkness. Pursued by Jedi Master Echuu Shen-Jon, she met her end in a final confrontation. Despite her short service, Tann's strategic brilliance and dark side prowess left a lasting impact on the war.# Biography\nSev'rance Tann, a rare Force-sensitive Chiss female born on the distant planet Csilla during the waning days of the Galactic Republic, possessed a unique gift - the ability to predict her enemy's movements with uncanny precision. Recognizing her potential, she attended the prestigious Chiss Academy, where she honed her skills in military strategy and tactics. One remarkable incident during her time at the academy showcased her brilliance. When challenged to train the notoriously untrainable Yresilini species into an organized army, Tann demonstrated her prowess by appointing one of the creatures as her \"general.\" When the first general failed to cooperate, she executed him in front of his comrades, sending a clear message that defiance would not be tolerated. The second general complied, leading the troops to follow her orders implicitly. This achievement earned Tann high marks and fueled stories of her exceptional abilities among those under her command. Tann's abilities caught the attention of Count Dooku, the Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious, who sought skilled commanders to aid the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) during the Separatist Crisis. Dooku, aware of her existence through Chiss contacts like Thrawn, invited her and her lover, Vandalor, to join the CIS. Tann became a Dark Acolyte under Dooku's tutelage, delving into the dark side of the Force and mastering lightsaber combat. Quickly rising through the ranks, Tann earned the trust of Dooku and other prominent Separatist leaders, becoming a general in the CIS military and the leader of Dooku's Dark Acolytes. When the Clone Wars began in 22 BBY, Tann received orders from Dooku to secure his escape from the planet Geonosis. This battle marked the start of the galactic conflict, with the Jedi and their newly formed Grand Army of the Republic clashing with the CIS forces. Tann's tactical genius shone in subsequent missions. She oversaw the construction of the CIS's own Decimators, powerful weapons based on Republic technology. With her forces, she attacked the heavily fortified planet Sarapin, plunging many Core Worlds into darkness by destroying its geothermal generators. The Republic, determined to counter Tann's threat, launched a counterattack on Sarapin. Jedi Master Echuu Shen-Jon, seeking vengeance for his slain Padawan at Geonosis, led the charge. Despite valiant efforts, Tann's mastery of the Decimators and her tactical brilliance thwarted the Republic's initial efforts. Shen-Jon, guided by his desire for revenge, fell to the dark side during his pursuit of Tann. In their final confrontation on Krant, Tann underestimated Shen-Jon's newfound power, and he ultimately killed her. This marked the end of Tann's service in the Clone Wars, but her impact on the conflict and the fate of the Decimators continued to reverberate. Despite her short tenure, Sev'rance Tann's exceptional abilities and strategic prowess made her one of the Confederacy's most formidable commanders. Her mysterious departure from Chiss Space and her intriguing legacy left an enduring mark on the history of the Clone Wars.\n\n# Personality and traits\nSev'rance Tann exuded confidence in her abilities, displaying unwavering faith in her capacity to fulfill Count Dooku's orders. She held herself in high regard and boasted about her swift conquest of Sarapin when tasked with its capture. Her overconfidence and underestimation of her adversaries led to her downfall, as she faced Jedi Knight Jor Drakas and Echuu Shen-Jon without any hesitation, ultimately meeting her end at the hands of Shen-Jon. Tann was known for her mocking and disrespectful demeanor towards her enemies. After killing Stam Reath during the Battle of Geonosis, she taunted his master, and during her final duel with Shen-Jon, she ridiculed him, even provoking him about losing another Padawan to her. Her persuasive nature enabled her to rally Separatist forces not under her command and negotiate with Boorka the Hutt to consider trading with the CIS. In her past, Tann displayed ruthless behavior during her time at the Chiss Academy, where she executed a Yresilini creature as an example to instill fear and obedience among its comrades. This method proved effective, as her actions ensured absolute compliance with her orders without any questions. Sev'rance Tann's audacious personality, sharp wit, and unyielding determination made her a formidable commander within the ranks of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However, her overconfidence and penchant for mockery ultimately led to her demise in the Clone Wars.\n\n# Power and abilities\nSev'rance Tann possessed a wealth of military knowledge, making her a skilled strategist and tactician, evident in her successful command of various battles throughout the Clone Wars. As a Chiss general, she showcased remarkable expertise in maneuvering her forces and outwitting her opponents on the battlefield. In addition to her commanding abilities, Tann was a formidable combatant, actively engaging in fights alongside the Separatist infantry. Trained in the dark side of the Force by Count Dooku, she wielded a yellow-bladed lightsaber and demonstrated proficiency with it, defeating multiple Jedi in lightsaber duels during the Clone Wars. Despite her Force sensitivity and training as a Dark Acolyte, Tann's true strength lay in her military prowess as a general. Her tactical acumen allowed her to outmaneuver her enemies, earning the praise and recognition of Count Dooku himself. However, in her final confrontation, Master Echuu Shen-Jon proved to be her match, defeating her in lightsaber combat, and ultimately bringing an end to her service in the Clone Wars.\n\n","meta":{"index":138,"author":"SkyPanik","name":"Sev'rance Tann","release_year":2023}},"Dread Master Calphayus":{"content":"# Section I\nCalphayus, also known as “The Prophet of the Masters”, was a Sith assassin and wielded a cyan bladed saberstaff.

Calphayus dispatched three of the most powerful Dread Host Commanders, whose names were Ciphas, Kel’sara, and Heirad. The three Commanders ultimately proved themselves in battle, but through the intensity of the fight, they were defeated. Through Kel’sara’s death, Calphayus stated that “The Shield is broken, but the sword is drawn.” After Styrak’s death on Darvannis, Calphayus was one of the first Dread Masters to feel the intensity of the effects caused by his death, beginning to go insane. He began to witness visions of great pain, becoming stronger and more detailed, but his overconfidence led him to believe that they were truthful.

Additionally, during a period of stasis, Wyyrlok assumed the role of Voice. His tenure marked the beginning of a lineage of Darth Wyyrloks dedicated to serving Darth Krayt, spanning several generations over the course of a century following the Yuuzhan Vong War. Notably, he was the father of the second Wyyrlok, grandfather of the third Wyyrlok, and great-grandfather of Saarai, who was destined to carry on the legacy as the next Wyyrlok.# Biography\nIn the realm of the One Sith, Darth Wyyrlok emerged as a prominent figure several decades after the Galactic Civil War and the downfall of the Order of the Sith Lords. Notably scarred from a previous injury that claimed his right horn, Wyyrlok assumed a crucial role as the executor of Darth Krayt's commands during the Dark Lord's prolonged stasis. In 41 ABY, Krayt experienced a vision involving a frozen moon, prompting Wyyrlok to dispatch the Anzat assassin, Kell Douro, to the planet Fhost. Douro was entrusted with the task of uncovering the hidden truth behind the vision, which Wyyrlok imprinted into the assassin's mind. Soon after, Douro contacted Wyyrlok to relay information about pursuing the Jedi known as Jaden Korr into the Unknown Regions. Recognizing Korr as a former apprentice of Kyle Katarn and therefore a formidable adversary, Wyyrlok acknowledged the threat posed by the Jedi. Douro eventually located Korr at an Imperial research facility on the frozen moon but met his demise at the hands of Korr's associate, Khedryn Faal. The encounter was captured by a recording device implanted in Douro's optic nerve, which Wyyrlok and the Umbaran Sith agent, Nyss Nenn, reviewed on Korriban. The footage revealed a duel between Korr and the clone Alpha, witnessed by Douro before his demise. In response, Wyyrlok provided Nenn with mindspears, ancient Rakatan technology capable of transferring memories into individuals. He instructed Nenn to awaken an Iteration—a Sith-engineered clone of Jaden Korr—and, with the assistance of Nenn's sister, Syll, locate the real Korr.

As a child, she was surrendered by her coven to Hal’Sek, a Siniteen criminal who took Ventress as his own personal slave on the planet Rattatak. Her servitude wouldn’t last long, as Hal’Sek was later killed by Weequay pirates, orphaning the young night-sister. She was later discovered by Jedi Knight Ky Narec, who was stranded on the planet. Narec took her as a padawan learner and taught her in the ways of the Force. As master and apprentice, the two Jedi protected the people of Rattatak against pirates and warlords. After ten years of this, Ky Narec would be killed by warlords who sought to kill the Jedi and end his crusade. Enraged by the death of her master, Ventress embraced the dark side of the Force, killing the warlords and taking their place. At some point before the Clone Wars, Ventress was discovered by the Sith Lord Count Dooku, who began her training as a secret Sith apprentice. \n\nAt the time of the Clone Wars, Asajj Ventress was assigned as a commander of the CIS droid army and secret assassin. Her deeds caught the attention of the Jedi Order, bringing her into conflict with the order; particularly Obi-Wan Kenobi and his protege Anakin Skywalker (to whom she allegedly gave a scar near his right-eye). Dooku’s master Darth Sidious also became increasingly wary of Ventress. Fearing that she was a threat to his plans for galactic domination, Sidious ordered his apprentice to eliminate the Dathomirian. Dooku complied, turning against her at the Battle of Sullust. Ventress managed to escape her death, returning to Dathomir and plotting revenge on the Sith Lord. She would eventually hire Savage Opress, a male Dathomirian Zabrak and brother of Darth Maul to train under Dooku in order to become strong enough in the dark side of the Force to help Ventress kill Dooku. This plan failed after Opress betrayed and nearly killed them both. After narrowly escaping death for the second time, Ventress returned to Dathomir to rejoin the Nightsister Clan. Unfortunately, Dooku was enraged at the attempt on his life, sending Grievous and a detachment of battle droids to eliminate the Nightsisters. Mother Talzan and Asajj Ventress were among few who managed to escape.\n\nSaddened by the loss of her new family, Asajj left Dathomir in search of purpose. She eventually took up bounty hunting, where she grew her hair out and traded her dual red lightsabers for a single-bladed yellow lightsaber. During her time as a bounty hunter, Asajj met Quinlan Vos, a Jedi Master who was undercover, having been sent by the Jedi Order to assassinate Count Dooku. The two reluctantly became friends and later fell in love, after Vos revealed his identity as a Jedi to Ventress. Vos ultimately left the Jedi Order to be with Ventress, after which the two set out to assassinate Dooku as Vos had initially been assigned to do. After a brief skirmish with the Sith Lord, Ventress was forced to flee and Quinlan Vos was taken hostage by Dooku who tortured the Jedi for months and revealed to him the secrets of Ventress’ past. Enraged by this news and having been tortured for months on end, Vos turned to the dark side. Knowing this, Ventress turned to the Jedi Council. The council did not believe Vos had actually turned to the dark side and once again tasked Vos with assassinating Dooku. Ventress reluctantly helped Vos and Dooku escape Jedi prosecution, where she sacrificed herself to save Quinlan Vos from death at the hands of Dooku. The death of his lover gave Quinlan the motivation to return to the light. The Jedi Council would later reinstate Vos as a Jedi and pardon Ventress of her crimes against the order to honour her sacrifice.

He would become prominent as a Sith Lord who served within the Empire during the times of the Great Galactic War all the way to the Third Galactic War.# History and Conflict\nDarkness would be imbued into Veradun from a young age, killing his Twi’lek servant in his father’s estate. This prompt incident would reveal his sensitivity to the Force and he would subsequently be taken to the Sith Academy in the Empire's capital of Dromund Kaas to study the ways of the Sith, becoming a successful Sith Warrior and a commander of the Imperial Military. In his venture to the planet of Geonosis, he would discover a Twi’lek slave by the name of Eleena Daru. His affections would take hold as he would fall in love with her despite her being subservient to him. He would take her in, as they fought together in many battles across the Great Galactic War with the Republic.\n\n\tHe would take up the name Darth Malgus doing away with his former name and thus his former self. He would take part in the Sith recapture of the planet of Korriban, \na planet bearing much importance to the Sith. În this battle he would battle Jedi Master Kao Cen Daragh, who would gravely wound his own master, Darth Vindican. Master Kao Cen Daragh’s apprentice, the future Grandmaster Satele Shan would escape from the battle in the Ebon Hawk. As his master Darth Vindican lay injured, Malgus would kill him in a single stroke. At the pinnacle times of the conflict, Darth Malgus would lead the sudden strike unto the Republic’s core world of Alderaan, where Republic forces would match his in a sudden ambush on the planet’s surface, ensuing a great battle. In this battle, he would once again meet Satele Shan, his archnemesis from Korriban. He would be severely injured from the battle forcing him to wear a respirator permanently. By 3653 BBY, the Empire would enter peace talks and negotiations, in truth, however, these were nothing more but mere lies to lower the Republic’s guard and allow for the Sith to bring their plan to fruition; the capture of the Republic’s capital of Coruscant.\n\n# Fruition & Betrayal\nDarth Angral would select Darth Malgus as the commander of the Sith strike force that would begin their attack upon the capital, taking charge of the initial spearhead of Sith forces unto Coruscant. His sudden attack upon the Jedi Temple on Coruscant would force the Jedi into a pinpoint, eventually losing the Sith as they are overcome by their numbers and surprise advantage. Malgus himself would be successful in killing scores of Jedi defenders, the most reputable of whom would be Jedi Master Ven Zallow, renowned as Malgus’ most prestigious kill. With this, the Sith armada would arrive and level the planet’s surface bringing chaos and pandemonium to Coruscant itself. \n\n\tThis sudden strike upon the capital of the Republic itself would leave it humiliated and its forces off-guard and without morale, as the Jedi Order themselves are left in utter chaos with their Temple on the capitol destroyed, most of the Jedi High Council killed and the Senate effectively rifted with the Order, with their reputation not recovering for some time. Malgus believed that the Imperial Armada would use this advantage to level the world itself to decimation and desecrate the capital of the Republic; however, the Empire only used this victory to ensure peace negotiations in Alderaan. This disappointed Malgus, however, he would be given command over the Sith’s orbital security ensuring the occupation on the planet.\n\n\tThe Sith Lord defied his superiors, instead, choosing to go after a renegade Jedi Aryn Leneer, apprentice of his prized kill, Master Ven Zallow. Leneer’s attempts to kill Malgus would not come into fruition, however, this then instigated distrust and soon dread against the Empire within Malgus, who would begin to disagree with Imperial policies and its adherence to the true ways of the Sith. He also began to see his affections with Daru as a weakness to himself, an obstacle to ascension. He kills his Twi’lek lover as a result and utilizes his power and position to ‘cleanse’ the Empire of politicians and bureaucrats whom he blames for the failure of allowing the Republic to retain its sovereignty. \n\nMalgus continued on to gain command over the Sith forces tasked with expansion into the Unknown Regions, capturing and conquering territories unknown to the Empire’s boundaries. Soon after, the presumed death of the Sith Emperor and with his ascension to the Dark Council, he declared his own Sith Order in opposition to the former hierarchy; an Order free of the Dark Council. This of course never passed as he would be defeated by both the Republic and the Empire.\n\n\tHe then serves under Emperor Vowrawn’s Sith Empire in their Third Galactic War, participating in the Invasion of Ossus as a military commander. Due to his distrust and the attack on the Meridian Complex, Malgus soon went rogue against the Empire, aiming to break his limitations and attain acclimation.\n\n","meta":{"index":36,"author":"C_aladria","name":"Darth Malgus","release_year":2022}},"Banok Ral":{"content":"# Overview\nBanok Ral was a Dread Commander of the Dread Host during the Dread War, which resulted in defeat.

She has come into conflict with the Sith Order on numerous occasions, varying between friend and foe. She is also extremely strong in the force, her Nightsister Magicks allowing her to rival the power of the Sith Emperor, Darth Sidious.# History |\nAround the end of the Old Republic, Talzin was born into a Nightsister Clan and continued to live for hundreds of years, serving as a spiritual guide to her sisters. In 54BBY, she gave birth to her first son who was known as Maul. Over the years, she gave birth to two other sons; Savage Opress and Feral. One day, a man known as Darth Sidious visited the planet, as her dark side abilities had caught his eye. The two talked and intermingled their differing abilities, Talzin showing off her magic while Sidious displayed his knowledge of the dark side of the force, He then claimed that he would take on Talzin as his apprentice but he instead abducted her son, Maul after sensing his potential for the dark side.\n\nEver since that day, Talzin wished to take revenge on Palpatine but decided to lead her clan in the meantime. Her opportunity for revenge eventually came in the form of Asajj Ventress, a Dark Jedi Assassin who was originally a member of her Nightsister clan and was sold into slavery to protect the clan. After taking her back in and healing her, she discovered that Ventress had been betrayed by her master, the Sith known as Count Dooku also known as the apprentice of Darth Sidious. Using this to her advantage, Talzin plotted a scheme to kill Count Dooku. \n\nFirstly, she sent Ventress and two other Nightsisters to attack Dooku’s castle on Serreno, having them disguised as Jedi. They were not meant to kill him, but instead strike fear in him so that he’d desperately look for an apprentice. With the plan going successfully, she meets with Dooku to negotiate; giving him a new apprentice. After Ventress hosted a trial between the Nightbrothers of Dathomir to decide on the apprentice, they selected her middle child; Savage Opress. They enchanted Savage with enhanced strength and delivered him to Dooku, waiting until the right moment to have him strike. The scheme eventually failed whenever Savage betrayed both Dooku and Ventress, the two Dathomirians retreating from Dooku’s ship.\n\nSavage returned to Talzin injured. She then gave him a mystic amulet to help him find his brother Maul, who had been supposedly killed after a duel with the Jedi on Naboo. While Savage was on his journey, Ventress returned to the planet as well and she was given a proper baptism to make her a true Nightsister. They celebrated the ceremony afterward, but the planet was suddenly attacked by the Separatists that serve Dooku. As the Nightsisters battled to protect Ventress and their clan, Mother Talzin visited Old Daka, another sorceress in the clan to summon the undead sisters. As her followers forced the Separatists back, Talzin used a lock of Dooku’s hair she had previously obtained to perform a voodoo ritual upon him for insurance. Eventually, the Separatist leader, General Grievous broke through the defenses of the Nightsisters and breached Old Daka’s hidden room, killing the sorceress and forcing Talzin into retreat. Nearly all of the Nightsisters were massacred, apart from Ventress and a few others.\n\nSavage Opress returned to the planet with a deranged Maul in hand. She met with her son and took him to an altar to heal Maul, explaining the tragedy that had taken place. Luring him to the altar, she incapacitated Maul and performed a ritual to cleanse his mind of corruption and give him better cybernetic legs. Once her job was done, she vanished into the aether to continue her work.\n\nShe started working with the Fangrawl Cult of Bardotta, assuming the role of ‘The Great Mother’. She plotted a scheme to harvest the living force from the Daogoyan Masters in order to give herself a stronger connection to the force, as the Bardottan people are strongly connected to the living force. She met with her followers on the moon of Zardossa Stix to perform a ritual involving the Bardottan Queen Julia, extracting her living force to give her unlimited power. This ritual was disrupted by Jedi Master Mace Windu and Junior Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar Binks. During the ritual, the crystal ball containing the living force of the Dagoyan Masters was shattered and unleashed a massive explosion which resulted in Mother Talzin’s physical form becoming compromised and vanishing.\n\nMother Talzin’s final scheme took place when she informed Maul that he was being used by Darth Sidious to track her down. Maul followed her orders and eventually found Count Dooku, bringing the Sith Lord to Dathomi and forcing him into a ritual where his body was sacrificed to Talzin to possess. While the ritual took place, both General Grievous and Darth Sidious arrived on the planet. Maul dueled Grievous while Sidious fought the possessed Dooku. Talzin soon left his body as she had attained her full strength again, engaging Sidious in a duel of force lightning. Once recovered, Dooku assisted his master in fighting her and after saving Maul’s life, Mother Talzin grew weak which allowed General Grievous to bypass her forcefield and strike the witch down.\n\n","meta":{"index":42,"author":"samsungcharger","name":"Mother Talzin","release_year":2022}},"Dread Master Bestia":{"content":"# Section I\nKnown as the “Keeper of the Dread Seeds”, Bestia was a member of the powerful Sorcerers known as the Dread Masters.

His base of operations, dubbed Xizor’s Palace, was situated on Coruscant, the capital planet, and demonstrated his extravagant monetary status. He was known to be an extremely competitive businessman and was very highly regarded by the high society, rivaling even the Emperor, Lord Vader and the Galactic Empire, with whom he had an economic partnership.# Early life\nOn Falleen, Xizor was born as the heir of a rich royal family. His spoiled personality was made clear from a very young age. He was the leader of his planet’s transport system and had already reached the trillionaire status before the start of the Clone Wars. To demonstrate his power, he built his palace in the middle of the ecumenopolis of Coruscant, burning to ashes the Farfalla Skyscraper that was there and rivaling the presidential villa situated west of the palace. During this time, he also rose to the inner circle of an underground organization named Black Sun; the organization nearly disappeared approaching the end of the Galactic Republic due to the breaking of a deal with the Hutts.\n\n# Black Sun\nA little while after the establishment of the Galactic Empire, there were two contenders for the Vigo position inside the organization, a role which directly reported to the Underlord - Xizor and a Nedji assassin whose known name was Kaird. To determine the Vigo, the Underlord Dal Perhi gave each a mission. Both set decoys and set-up each other in order to win, even lying about the mission given to make the other lose the Lord’s favor. The prince won the little competition or so he thought, and was sent for a last mission to reclaim 10-4TO, a droid that was pursued by both the Galactic Empire and a resistance organization named Whiplash. The true purpose this mission had was for Kaird to kill Xizor since he represented more of a danger to the Underlord’s throne. However, the attempt on his life failed and a turn of events saw the capture of Kaird by the prince. There, Whiplash also appeared, led by Jedi Knight Jax Pavan. Soon, Xizor revealed his true plan of murdering the current Underlord, which unbeknownst to him, had already failed after the assassination of his scientist team. A few moments later, Nick Rostu helped the prince find Pavan’s group and incapacitate them. At the brink of ending the Jedi Knight’s life, Rostu betrayed and attacked him, although the assault was easily deflected. In the distraction, Jax Pavan was able to use the Force and compelled the Falleen to escape.\n\n# Family Tragedy\nThe instauration of the Empire came with consequences for Falleen. Previously home to one of the richest families in the galaxy and one of the most stable economies throughout the Mid Rim, the focus shifted to a laboratory for Lord Vader. However, a breach in the laboratory caused a biological weapon to reach the population nearby. To keep this concealed, Vader ordered a bombardment upon the world and this murdered millions, including various Xizor’s family members. Making the prince’s cold blood boil, he would promise to kill the Sith Lord, yet never revealed this publicly. To masquerade his secret, he seemingly helped the Darth hide the Bombardment of Falleen under the guise of gaining the Emperor's favor.\n\n# Hutt Politics\nAs a fan of money, he was interested in the Hutt clan, knowing they had monopolized the illegal market for decades. An opportunity to have a partnership arose, after a sudden confrontation occurred between two Hutt clans, the Besadii and Desilijic. Following the death of the Besadii clan’s leader, Xizor offered himself to its heir. The agreement consisted of ridding the internal threats upon the heir, and in doing so, maintaining his succession for the whole clan, in exchange for acquiring a certain amount of spice operation profits on Ylesia. Years later, he would earn an even higher percentage by providing Black Sun security for the Ylesian enterprise. His connections even spanned to an economic relationship with Jabba the Hutt, leader of the Desilijic clan.\n\n# Death\nAfter a failed attempt to seduce Leia Organa and the subsequent destruction of his palace, he used his StarViper and tried to shoot down the Millenium Falcon. However, a Rebel fleet appeared to assist them, which prompted the prince to request aid using his skyhook. Unbeknown to him, Darth Vader, who had previously told him not to attack the Falcon, intercepted his comms and heard him say the name Skywalker. The Sith sent TIE Fighters to attack the Falleen ship, first giving him an ultimatum - cease the attack or die. No response was given and the ship was destroyed, killing Xizor and also destroying the skyhook. His death led to his niece taking over the Black Sun.\n\n# Personality and Traits\nIt is assumed that the Falleen Prince depended too heavily on his ability to read others. This ability was truly magnificent but made him believe to be superior to everyone else. This superiority complex made him underestimate the Force itself. His body was capable of creating certain pheromones that affected females and made them easier to seduce. He also maintained his body at peak condition, not by exercising but instead with the usage of Myostim units and martial arts. He was a man of high life, enjoying priceless expenses and even pardoning rivals if they gifted him well. The prince’s superiority complex was also fueled by his emotional control, considering those races influenced by their emotion, inferior. He even stated that whilst those races searched for revenge instantly, he meticulously enacted every step he took.\n\n","meta":{"index":164,"author":"Craked10","name":"Prince Xizor","release_year":2023}},"Dengar":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Corellian Human called Dengar or Dengar the Demolisher was a bounty hunter during the early times of the Clone Wars.

But not much was known about his upbringing. He competed in the swoop racing scene of Corellia as a child, racing swoop speeder bikes. Moreover, he participated in swoop racing with a friend of his named Hill Purpura. Subsequently, they would dispute each other over who had won more frequently. Later on, Dengar would say that he had raced swoop bikes professionally. Dengar was a gladiator before he turned into a bounty hunter. It was thought that Dengar's bounty-hunting career peaked during the Clone Wars, a galactic conflict in which he achieved an incredible record.\n\n# Section 2\nDengar participated in a mission as a member of Krayt's Claw with hunters Boba Fett, Bossk, Latts Razzi, C-21 Highsinger, and Oked. The chief of the Quarzite Belugan people, Otua Blank, engaged the hunters to guard a subtram carrying precious cargo. Asajj Ventress, a deviant dark side user, killed Oked during preparations for the mission in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina. Ventress then volunteered to replace the deceased hunter on the mission list.\n\n# Section 3\nLater, Dengar worked as protection on Nal Hutta for the Hutts, along with Latts, Embo, and Sugi. They were there when Pre Vizsla, the leader of Death Watch, and the rebel Sith Lords Maul and Savage Opress came to join forces with the Hutts.

Jas was able to obtain full pardons for Dengar, Embo, and Jeeta as well as some cash from the New Republic once the Galactic Concordance was signed.

His death came after he sacrificed to save Rebel leaders Rahm Kota, Bail Organa, Garm Bel Iblis and Mon Mothma from the hands of Darth Vader and his master, Darth Sidious. \n\nHowever, it wasn’t just the Rebellion that suffered after Galen’s death. Darth Vader also had been set back. His chance of overthrowing Palpatine had evaporated before his eyes. That’s what Palpatine thought anyway. After the wounds dealt by his former apprentice were healed, Vader ordered Galen’s body be brought to Timira City, a cloning facility on the planet Kamino. There, Vader ordered the creation of multiple clones of Galen Marek. This operation was incredibly secretive, known only to a select few. \n\nTime and time again, the clones failed. They were deemed too mentally and/or physically unstable for service, and were immediately terminated upon creation. That was until Subject 1138 was created. Subject 1138 made quick progress, which initially led Vader to conclude he had finally made the perfect genetic clone. However, this proved to be an optimistic assessment, as it was quickly realised that Subject 1138, codenamed “Starkiller”, suffered from the emotional imprints inherited from his template. This led to a sudden obsession over Galen Marek’s former lover, Juno Eclipse. Seeing this as a sign of weakness, Vader attempted to execute Starkiller. However, sensing this betrayal, the clone was able to overpower Vader with a torrent of Force Lightning and escape.# Section II\nThe clone eventually ventured to Cato Neimoidia to rescue General Rahm Kota, Galen Marek’s Jedi Master, from Imperial captivity. Upon a successful rescue, General Kota refused to believe that Subject 1138 was a clone at all, believing him to be Marek himself.\nThe clone refused to rejoin the Rebellion, instead telling Kota that his only mission was to find and ensure the safety of Juno Eclipse. During a previous battle however, Eclipse had fallen into Imperial hands, captured by Boba Fett and his unit of Imperial Terror Troopers. Starkiller later turned over all the needed data for a Rebel invasion of Kamino, hoping to use the opportunity to find Juno and free her from Vader. The mission was a success at first, with Starkiller causing a Rebel frigate to crash straight into Timira City itself. This gave Kota and his team of Rebel Commandos the ability to breach the city and re-route as many Imperial forces as possible from Starkiller’s position while he searched for Juno. \n\nSubject 1138 eventually came into contact with Vader. He originally seemed to be winning the fight, however Vader gained the upper hand by choking Juno and threatening to kill her right in front of Starkiller. Using his feelings for her to his advantage, Vader forced the clone to submit to his will. However, Juno would use this chance to attack Vader. She was of course unsuccessful, which led her to be thrown from a window. This caused Starkiller to erupt into a fit of rage, as he attacked Vader with everything he had. Using a lightning storm and electrical conduits to his advantage, he was able to bring Vader into submission with ease, disarming him and placing Vader at the clone’s mercy. As he went to strike Vader down, he was stopped by Rahm Kota, who encouraged Starkiller to spare Vader as a way of gaining information. Starkiller complied, and was reunited with his love, Juno Eclipse. Vader was brought into Alliance custody as a prisoner of war.\n\nHowever, Subject 1138 is not the only clone of Galen Marek in existence.

His rank ascended to Sith Lord within the order, and eventually, he became Darth Krayt's hand. During a confrontation with Cade Skywalker and his allies on Abbadon, Stryfe was defeated, and his master was killed, though he wasn't aware of this at the time. Darth Wyyrlok, Krayt's killer, tricked Stryfe into pledging allegiance to his galaxy unification plan. Stryfe embarked on a mission to Dac, but was unsuccessful. His retreat was prompted by the unexpected arrival of the Empire-in-exile, who came to assist Admiral Stazi with evacuation. When Stryfe discovered Darth Krayt was alive, he eliminated the traitor and regained his status. His life ended on Coruscant after a victorious but costly battle against Jedi Master Wolf Sazen, whose inflicted injuries ultimately led to Stryfe's death.# Biography\nDarth Stryfe, a One Sith member under Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, took control of Ossus in 137 ABY to locate a hidden temple. Despite initial failed efforts due to the Jedi's intervention, Stryfe's potent force sensitivity signaled the Jedi's presence, resuming the search. An attack on the found Jedi Academy led to injuring Jedi Master K’Kruhk, though the Jedi fled to the Hidden Temple.The same year, Cade Skywalker's escape from captivity prompted Stryfe's promotion to Krayt's hand. Skywalker's assassination attempt on Krayt at a Sith Outpost resulted in his mutation into a Rakghoul. Stryfe decapitated the mutated Skywalker while defending the outpost. Following these events, the spirit of ancient Sith Lord Karness Muur manipulated Celeste Morne, a Jedi from the Old Republic era, using the Muur Talisman. Muur offered Krayt his dark side healing knowledge and captured Cade Skywalker to lure Krayt to Had Abbadon. A heated battle ensued, which Stryfe joined, defending Krayt and eventually clashing with Skywalker.Post-battle, Krayt was presumed injured but was actually killed by Darth Wyyrlock, who then initiated an unsuccessful attack on Dac. When Krayt's survival was revealed, he quickly reclaimed power, eliminating the traitor Wyyrlok. With knowledge of the Hidden Temple's location, the Sith launched an attack, which was thwarted by the Empire-In-Exile. Retreating to their Coruscant temple, they were followed by Skywalker, who along with Jedi Master Wolf Sazen, confronted Stryfe and Darth Talon. Despite Stryfe's victory over Sazen, the battle injuries he suffered caused his death.\n\n# Personality and traits\nDarth Stryfe, characterized by his black and red tattoos, black hair, and orange irises, was a brutal and ruthless Sith. His military prowess earned him fear and respect, making him Darth Krayt's hand due to his unmatched competency. This honor instilled in him an unshakeable loyalty, even to the point of laying down his life for his master. However, his overconfidence led him to dismiss Saarai as a non-threat, a miscalculation that contributed to his downfall. He also had a quick temper, losing focus when goaded, a weakness that was exposed during his duel with Cade Skywalker.\n\n# Powers and abilities\nKnown for his usage of raw power, intensity and a one handed lightsaber, Darth Stryfe was capable of sweeping through hordes of rakghouls without breaking a sweat. Against tradition in the One Sith, he used a smooth and metallic hilt contrary to the coral hilts his peers used. However, what differentiated him from the rest was his proficiency with the force. With a wide range of abilities such as telekinesis, force sense and Force Lighting. With these three Stryfe could overpower almost any opponent, but it wasn't enough to save him from defeat at the hands of his apprentice Saarai.\n\n","meta":{"index":3,"author":"Craked10","name":"Darth Stryfe","release_year":2023}},"Ludo Kressh":{"content":"# Overview\nLudo Kressh was a male half-breed Sith species born in the Outer Rim territories. He was classified as a Sith hybrid because his parents were different species. Ludo had light red skin and red eyes and he trained a secret apprentice, Skarok-Nur. Kressh was a very powerful Sith Lord and was constantly in battle with his arch nemesis, Naga Sadow. Sadow and Kressh, after the tragic death of Dark Lord Marka Ragnos, were fighting for the title of Dark Lord of the Sith. Sadow, trying to claim the title in order to expand the Sith Empire and go to war with the Republic, tricked Kressh into believing that there was a Republic attack and he sent Sith Lords Horak-Mul and Dor Gal-ram, his most trusted allies, to defend against them. Sadly Horak and Gal both died by their own crew who were secretly working for Sadow the entire time. Infuriated, Kressh attacked Sadow’s fortress on the planet Khar Delba. Kressh was outsmarted by Sadow yet he would survive the confrontation by faking his death. Sadow then was titled Dark Lord of the Sith and staged an attack against the Republic thus starting a Great Hyperspace War. Sadow’s attack failed and once he returned, Kressh revealed himself and informed Sadow that he faked his death. Sadow was then infuriated and sent one of his ships on a suicide mission to clash into Kressh’s ship. Unfortunately for Kressh, the ship crashed into them and killed Kressh. Ludo had a son, Elcho Kressh also known as Kressh the younger, who he adored and believed they shared many of the same traits. Ludo was scared that Sadow would come for his son so he designed a device that could prevent anyone from touching him without his will; it was known as the gauntlet of Kressh.# Personality and Abilities\nLudo Kressh was a very passionate Sith Lord and was determined to be crowned Dark Lord of the Sith. He believed in the Sith Empire’s welfare and didn’t want to stage an attack on the Republic and instead he wanted to wait for them to attack the Sith so the Empire’s defence could be stronger. He was very cautious and cunning. He cared very little about his slaves and his alcoholic influence was negative on the slaves. He’d beat his slaves and drive them insane. The only thing he truly cared for was his son. Kressh was trained in the manipulative ways of the Dark side of the Force and possessed bits of knowledge on Sith alchemy but an even broader knowledge on Sith Magic. Through alchemy and magic he created the special device for his son’s safety. Kressh was able to use battle mind powers and could regain his strength, speed and ferocity by accessing his rage through the Force. He could speak a few languages like Massassi, the old Sith language and he was good at combat. He would use the Force and connect that with his Sith sword in order to make it more powerful. When he duelled Naga Sadow they both had the same wounds and both had the upper hand at one point. Therefore Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh were equally skilled at combat, hence why they both went into more manipulative ways in defeating each other from Sadow’s false atack to Kressh’s false death. The two of them showed extreme power and wit during the rivalry. Kressh was later buried after his death in a cave in the upper section of the Valley of Dark Lords.\n\n","meta":{"index":57,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Ludo Kressh","release_year":2022}},"Barriss Offee":{"content":"# Introduction\nBarriss Offee transitioned from a Jedi Knight to a disillusioned figure who ultimately committed a devastating act of violence.

Her disillusionment grew as she saw the Jedi being manipulated and used as political pawns. This led her to commit a heinous act, the bombing of the Jedi Temple, which resulted in the loss of innocent lives and fellow Jedi.\n\n# Section 2\nBarriss Offee’s actions did not go unnoticed, and she was eventually captured and brought to trial. The trial exposed the growing divide within the Jedi Order and forced them to confront their shortcomings. Although Barriss had acted with noble intentions, her methods were deemed unacceptable, and she was found guilty of treason. The consequences of her actions extended beyond her fate, as they further shattered public trust in the Jedi Order. The aftermath of Barriss Offeee’s trial and her ultimate fate remains uncertain.

Kopecz, a former Jedi, joined the Sith and left the Jedi Order, becoming one of the founding members of Lord Skere Kaan's Brotherhood of Darkness. He devoted a significant portion of his time to leading the Brotherhood's wars against the Galactic Republic, which included the pivotal conflicts on Ruusan and in orbit around it. \n\nStrong Sith Lord Kopecz was frequently the first to criticise Kaan, inciting the other Sith to turn against him over topics like the protracted struggle for control of Ruusan. However, Kaan always managed to persuade Kopecz to support him, as he did when he explained the thought bomb attack strategy at the Seventh Battle of Ruusan.\nWhen the Brotherhood was assembled in a maze of caves, Kopecz, on the other hand, saw the absurdity of Kaan's use of such a contraption. \n\nKopecz snuck out of the crowd, joined the cave mouth defences, and was fatally wounded as the Jedi's Army of Light attacked. Lord Valenthyne Farfalla, a Jedi Master who knew Kopecz to be a former Jedi, found him. Kopecz persuaded the Jedi to fight him in exchange for disclosing Kaan's scheme, refusing to submit and insisting that Farfalla promise him death in battle. Farfalla concurred, knowing the Twi'lek had little time left given his wounds. Farfalla and Kopecz engaged in combat after Kopecz had explained the mind bomb to the latter. The Sith Lord was quickly dispatched by his erstwhile ally.# Biography\nKopecz snuck out of the crowd, joined the cave mouth defences, and was fatally wounded as the Jedi's Army of Light attacked. A masculine Twi'lek named He Kopecz existed during the New Sith Wars. Kopecz was a popular moniker for men of his species and meant \"philosopher\" in his native tongue. An individual with Force abilities from Ryloth,  Kopecz joined the Jedi Order and underwent years of training. Kopecz finally abandoned the Order's teachings in favour of the ways of the dark side as he lost faith in them over time. Kopecz defected because he thought the Sith gave the best opportunity to create a stable galaxy with them ascendant throughout the galaxy. \n\nHe had a bitter feud with Qordis, a Human Dark Lord, while he was still a Sith.\nBecause of his strong character and skill set, Kopecz earned the respect of his fellow Sith for whom he served as a source of authority and a mentor. He also earned the respect of individuals on the other side of the struggle. Kopecz was respected by both Jedi Lords Hoth and Valenthyne Farfalla. \n\nAs each Sith Lord fought for dominance over the others, conflicts between Lords akin to the one between Kopecz and Qordis were frequent among the Sith.\nThe Brotherhood of Darkness was established at this time by the charismatic Dark Lord Skere Kaan, wherein each lesser Lord would be given the title of Dark Lord of the Sith and all would pool their resources to form a single, unified front.\nKaan understood that fighting between one another among the Sith Lords would only lead to defeat from within their ranks given that the Sith were at war with both the Galactic Republic and the Jedi. Both Kopecz and Qordis were valuable assets to the Sith war effort, so Kaan urged them to join his new Brotherhood.\n\nBoth parties accepted Kaan's offer, and the Brotherhood's claim of newfound equality was sufficient to keep the two sides in an iffy ceasefire. The three Dark Lords planned to reclaim Korriban, the former Sith homeworld, in 1006 BBY in order to reopen the Sith Academy and raise new Dark Lords for the Brotherhood there.The Sith defeated the Jedi and Republic in a bloody ground fight led by Kaan, Qordis, and Kopecz; in the aftermath, Qordis remained on Korriban to oversee the Academy's rebuilding, where he would also serve as headmaster. However, Kopecz stayed with Kaan to carry on the conflict with the Republic.  \n\nAlthough the Brotherhood promised that all Dark Lords would be treated equally, in practise there were always Sith Masters who assumed leadership roles and relayed orders between Kaan and the other Dark Lords during various battles during the New Sith Wars. Kopecz was one of the Sith Masters present at these battles. One such figurehead who oversaw the Sith army was Kopecz. Kaan's leadership was tarnished by numerous setbacks, and many Sith believed that Kopecz's skills as a military leader were the only thing keeping the Sith from losing numerous wars.  During the Battle of Phaseera, Kopecz was in charge of every military force in existence, including the Gloom Walkers, a specialist unit of the Brotherhood.\n\nIn order to save his team from a suicide mission that Ulabore had agreed to, Dessel had taken action. Under Dessel's leadership, the Gloom Walkers broke the rules established for their mission yet still managed to complete it effectively and with few casualties. Despite the mission's success, Kopecz was tasked with managing Dessel's punishment for his misdeeds. The Human's seemingly extraordinary exploits were detailed in numerous stories in his dossier, which he also examined when he felt the strength of the Force within Dessel. Instead of bringing him before a court-martial, Kopecz transported the Human soldier to Korriban, where he informed him he would be trained as an apprentice with the potential to become a Sith Lord.Dessel then adopted the moniker Bane—Bane of the Sith\n\n# Personality and Traits\nThe soldier Dessel thought Kopecz to be the biggest Twi'lek he had ever seen because of his height and physique. Kopecz was deeply distrustful of the Brotherhood of Darkness's other powerful Sith Lords. He consented to join the Brotherhood, but he had never trusted its leader, Kaan. Kopecz was aware of Kaan's desire to rule the Sith while still considering himself to be their leader, and he frequently reminded Kaan of his own assurances of equality within the Brotherhood. Lord Qordis and the Twi'lek had a similar hatred for one another as they had been rivals before joining the Brotherhood. This was made clear when Qordis ordered the other Sith Masters at the Academy to stop giving Bane, the apprentice Kopecz sent him, special treatment.\n\n# Power and Abilities\nKopecz was regarded as having a good grasp of the Force by both the Jedi and the Sith. In addition to his power, Kopecz's stubbornness made him challenging to control with the Force, as Kaan discovered when he tried to convince the Dark Lords of his viewpoints. He was a skilled pilot who piloted a Buzzard fighter during the First Battle of Ruusan. He was also skilled with speeder bikes, riding one of them during the ground fighting at Ruusan. Kopecz thought his own lightsaber proficiency to be so great that he believed it was beneath him to challenge two Selkath Padawans to a duel.\n\nInstead, he demonstrated his command of the evil side by using the Force.\none of the Padawans was choked to death, and the other was put to death by a flash of Force lightning. When he recognised the potential in the Gloom Walker sergeant, Dessel, for example, he was able to detect the might of the Force in others.\n\n","meta":{"index":116,"author":"iMirones","name":"Sith Lord Kopecz","release_year":2022}},"Poggle the Lesser":{"content":"# Overview\nPoggle The Lesser was an influential figure within both the geonosian’s society and the confederacy of independent systems. As an archduke of the Stalgasin hive, the most powerful hive within Geonosian homeworld Geonosis, he commanded great authority over the vast majority of the Geonosians while still under the rule of Queen Karina the Great. However, his power and influence did not stop at Geonosis. Later on he would become one of the most prominent figures within the confederacy of independent systems, tasked with overseeing droid armies production and strategies against the Galactic Republic in the Clone Wars.# Origin\nPoggle the lesser was originally a drone who rose through hierarchy to his current position with an assist from the ingenious Sith Lord Darth Sidous. While he was in his quest for power, he seized control over many droid factories within Geonosis which later would become the powerhouses for the Separatist droid armies production. To ensure the integrity- \nof his position, he would eliminate Hadiss the Vaulted, the current leader of Geonosian. With his position secured, he drove the Geonosian to join the Confederacy of independent systems.\n\n# The First Battle of Geonosis\nPoggle the lesser had always been the true believer of the Confederacy of independent systems’ cause as he led his people and droids to the battles with the Galactic Republic. With a new bond between him and his new ally, the former Jedi Count Dooku, which the count helped the Geonosian guarantee the firm grip on Baktoid Armor Workshop. Provided the Seperatist with sufficient weapons and armies.  \nHis involvement became clear again while he as well as count Dooku and other separatist conspirators visited the execution of the Galactic Republic’s puppets, Senator Padmé Amidala, Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Padawan Anakin Skywalker at Petranaki Arena, also known as Arena of Justice, at the Stalgasin hive’s spire on Geonosis. The execution however was unsuccessful as the Grand Master Yoda along with the clone troopers interrupted and rescued the prisoners. \nAs the clone troopers as well as Jedi broke into the arena, he led his associates to the Underground Geonosian Command Center to strategize in an attempt to repeal the Galactic Republic forces. Unfortunately, despite their combined effort, the invasion of the Galactic Republic was a success. Many geonosians and the separatists had been forced to flee from their homeworld into the uncertainty.\nDespite the dark time they had faced, the Galactic Republic had failed to secure one of the most important pieces of intelligence, the plan for the Ultimate Weapon. Poggle the lesser entrusted the weapons schematic to the Sith Lord, the future of the Confederacy of independent systems had been secured.\n\n# The Second Battle of Geonosis\nFollowing the end of the first invasion by the Galactic Republic, Poggle the lesser and his fellow Separatists did not take too long to gather their forces and returned to Geonosis. This time they successfully opened the Geonosis primary droid Foundry with Poggle the lesser, overseeing the production. One of the projects of the Foundry is the Super Tank, designed to eradicate the clone trooper forces. They were indeed effective against the clone troopers as the battle shifted into the Confederacy’s favor.\nHowever, the disruption from Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Luminara Unduli would diminish their effort as the two Jedi successfully infiltrated the Reactor room inside the Geonosis primary droid Foundry. After realized this transgression , he ordered his men to use the bombs to demolished the foundry in a hope to eliminate the Jedi threat.\nAfter the explosion, Poggle the lesser and his subordinates traveled to the Progate Temple, the sacred site where Queen Karina the Great resided within, guarded by the undead armies reanimated by the brain worms. The surviving Jedi followed them through their trail to the Progate temple. The Jedi entered the temple in an attempt to capture Poggle the lesser, their attempt would fail as they had been greeted by the undeads. While in chaos, the geonosians successfully captured the Jedi Luminara Unduli. They send her to Queen Karina the Great as a gift.\nLater on the Jedi General Anakin Skywalker with Jedi master Obi-wan Kenobi came to rescue the Jedi Luminara Unduli and killed Queen Karina the Great by collapsing the sacred Progate temple. The fate of Poggle the lesser had been put into the hands of the Galactic Republic as he had been held captive and brutally interrogated by the Jedi General Anakin Skywalker. His destination was the Republic Center for Military Operation at Coruscant where he would be routinely interrogated to reveal the information regarding the Confederacy of Independent systems.\n\n# The Imprisonment\nDuring the time of his imprisonment, the Galactic Republic intelligence did not give up about the Ultimate Weapon as they continued to interrogate Poggle the lesser. With his deep loyalty toward the Confederacy, Poggle upheld the secret with all he could do until the Lieutenant Commander Orson Krennic offered his freedom in exchange for the Ultimate Weapon’s plan. He agreed to this offer but without true loyalty. \nThe Ultimate Weapon began its construction after the release of Poggle to his homeworld. With much retaliation from his fellow geonosian, the archduke united his people and began the building of the Ultimate Weapon. While under the stage of construction, Poggle the lesser ordered his drones to initiate the chaos in order to make a distraction for his escape. After his successful escape, the archduke would join the Confederacy once more.\n\n# The Last Effort\nEven with all he could do, the defeat of the Confederacy of Independent systems is imminent. General Grievous hid him as well as others Speratist Councilors at the planet Utapau for their own safety. After the cyborg general had failed to attack Coruscant and the death of Count Dooku.

He was well-known and acknowledged among the Jedi due to his red Dathomirian Zabrak skin covered in pitch-black tattoos and his double-bladed lightsaber that matched the tint of his face.# History\nDarth Maul was born in 54 BBY when the Galactic Republic was around. He had two brothers and one of them would play a key role in the future. He began his apprenticeship at 40 BBY when he was still a child. He was raised in a way to despise every single Jedi Knight who served within the Jedi Order. He desired to see the Jedi Order fall, thanks to his master he desired it so much that he started training for the day where the Sith would take revenge on the Jedi. Afterward, he encountered Master Qui-Gon-Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi He managed to defeat the Jedi Master, but he was defeated by the Padawan. Thanks to Opress and Nightsister Mother Talzin, he managed to survive. Despite that Darth Tyranus was his former master - Darth Sidious - new apprentice, he still thought he was a Sith Lord.

She began her life as a Jedi though it is not known which title she held or her specific masteries, though it can be safe to assume due to her interest in Sith alchemy and her desire to influence biology, as well as her desire to write and study philosophy that Sorzus Syn was either a Jedi Consular or a likely aspirant of that path. Alongside numerous other Jedi including Ajunta Pall and XoXaan she was exiled from the Jedi Order by the Jedi Council for studying the dark side of the Force.# Part I\nSorzus Syn fought in the conflict known as the Hundred-Year darkness, in which she rose to become one of the most influential and highest ranking Dark Jedi. Her role in the war was unique, having altered biological chemistry to create creatures that would serve as living weapons against the Jedi Order.\n\n# Part II\nThroughout the war Sorzus Syn would collect numerous materials regarding the existence of the Sith species and the planet Korriban. It can easily be credited to Sorzus Syn for the founding of Korriban by the Dark Jedi for it was these materials that convinced her fellow Dark Jedi to travel there. \n\nSorzus Syn took part in removing the Sith King of Korriban who at the time was King Hakagram Graush and would later be dubbed in Ajunta Pall’s new Empire as one of his Shadow Hands. However in one of Sorzus Syn’s diaries she would display the desire to become the next Dark Lord of the Sith after Ajunta Pall though failed to elaborate further on how she might wish to achieve this. She did make it clear however that she hoped Adjunta Pall’s reign would be short.\n\nThe Dark Jedi, now dubbed the first Sith Lords, would collectively build what became the first Sith Empire. Sorzus Syn’s personal part in this is relatively unknown though yet again we can make safe assumption that she became some form of chronicler, historian or philosopher, likely being an early predecessor to the Sith Inquisitor.\n\n# Part III\nSorzus Syn would be responsible for crafting the three Great Amulets of the Sith. These amulets were Sith talismans designed to greatly enhance the power of Sith magic and the powers of the dark side, these three amulets would be some of the most powerful in Sith history with power so feared even Luke Skywalker hoped that they had not survived the passage of time.\n\nSorzus Syn would later discover that the biological makeup of the Sith species and the Dark Jedi’s were similar enough to allow for crossbreeding with the use of alchemy. This discovery would lead to the evolution of the Sith Pureblood species. Sith such as Naga Sadow and Darth Vitiate would be of Sith Pureblood origin, showing the true testament of the power this discovery held and the effect it would have on the galaxy for millenia to come. \n\nAfter Ajunta Pall’s Sith Empire settled on Ziost, Sorzus Syn would return to Korriban to open many of the ancient tombs scattered across its valleys. These tombs served as the burial grounds of ancient Kings such as King Adas as well as many other senior and influential members of the Sith species. Sorzus Syn made a hobby of delving into these ruins along with Kissai Priests and Sith slaves to find their hidden secrets, often a perilous task. \n\nAfter a lengthy and difficult delve into the sanctuary of Sakkra-Kla, Sorzus Syn discovered that the Sith of old under the rule of King Adas had attacked and conquered numerous worlds before them, she made it a personal goal to pinpoint every world the Sith had raided so that she could search for any knowledge they may have left behind.\n\n# Part IV\nSorzus Syn would author the Book of the Sith, a diary that would describe her thoughts on the Jedi Order, Jedi Code, Sith Code, ancient Sith and everything she had discovered throughout her various expeditions. This book would become sought after due to its insightful descriptions of the founding of the first Sith Empire, as well as Sorzus Syn’s numerous descriptions of ancient Sith alchemy and her many different discoveries regarding the ancient Sith, most notably of King Adas of Korriban.\n\n# Part V\nIt is not known how Sorzus Syn died however her legacy lived on until the days of Luke Skywalker and the First Galactic Empire. Some of her ancient texts would end up in the hands of Darth Sidious who would note that these texts would easily be the oldest Sith writings in existence. These texts would later come into the hands of Luke Skywalker while he was Grand Master of The New Jedi Order.\n\nHer personal holocron which she had made at the end of her life was discovered by the Jedi Order and stored in their archives, it would later be stolen by Darth Bane however the purpose it served him and where it ended up is currently unknown.\n\n# Part VI\nWhat Sorzus Syn was like as a Jedi is unknown however her personality as a Sith could be described as stereotypical. She was cold, calculated and uncaring. She had little regard for the lives of others and would often sacrifice slaves and servants during her many expeditions. She believed that operating on the biological makeup of a dead creature was more effective and easier than that of a live one and as such, often killed individuals to operate on them.\n\n","meta":{"index":14,"author":"Seko1111","name":"Sorzus Syn","release_year":2021}},"0-0-0":{"content":"# Section I\n0-0-0 also referred to as just Triple-Zero, was a protocol droid that like any other, had expertise in problem-solving, etiquette, and translation.

If a soldier attempted to harm their commander, the intended wound would instead be inflicted upon the soldier, thanks to the battlelord's Force bonding capabilities.  \n\nThe Darkstaff, a potent artefact that can sap the Force-essence from a living thing, was a weapon that Darth Rivan was renowned for using. In order to change the planet's surface and climate and make it breathable, Darth Rivan also invented the Kaluthin grass. Almas was transformed by the Kaluthin into a garden-like environment, but it would never have an entirely pure atmosphere because they were unable to get rid of the toxic local gases.\n\nBefore the year 1250 BBY, Rivan spent many years residing in Almas before the Jedi Knights forced him to leave. Rivan's fortress was completely destroyed by the Jedi during the Battle of Almas, although the blaster-proof core tower managed to withstand the attack.\n\nIt became clear in the end that Rivan's attempt to achieve physical immortality was never fully successful. Initially, it was thought that Darth Rivan, who had been forced off Almas by a tremendous Jedi/Republic assault, had narrowly averted death before being betrayed by a fellow Sith—specifically, his own apprentice, Darsin.\n\nHowever, in reality, Darsin was left behind by Rivan when he left the citadel, and Darsin passed away before Rivan, his body having been altered by Rivan's alchemies to create a slave Force spirit. When the Jedi Army of Light and the Sith Brotherhood of Darkness clashed several millennia later, Rivan was able to use the Darkstaff's strength to summon a Force storm that carried him through time and space to the planet Ruusan.\n\n# Power and abilities\nThe ability of Rivan to create the Sith battlelords was well known. Rivan's fortress is a testament to how hard he worked at taming the evil side. The Kaluthin grass, which Rivan developed to make the atmosphere of the planet Almas breathable, is his most notable invention.\n\n","meta":{"index":50,"author":"iMirones","name":"Darth Rivan","release_year":2022}},"Xendor":{"content":"# Overview\nXendor was a Dark Jedi who, as his affiliation suggests, denied the Light Side of the Force and decided to follow the philosophy of the Dark Side. Xendor was the leader of the Legions of Lettow, an organization of Fallen Jedi and persons from the Kashi Mer Dynasty. Xendor died during the First Great Schism in 24,500 BBY after dueling Jedi Master Awdrysta Pina.# History\nXendor was once a respected Jedi Knight, but his desire to train both sides of the Force made him leave the ancient Jedi Order. After leaving the Jedi Order, Xendor opened a Jedi academy that taught students the way of the Bogan, alongside Force traditions, such as the Dai Bendu, the Baran Do, the Chatos Academy, etc. Xendor’s academy grew due to his teachings, and the students in the academy changed its name to the Legions of Lettow. This new group aimed to defend their traditions and philosophy from the Jedi High Council. \nXendor served as the general of the Legions of Lettow during the First Great Schism in 24,500 BBY. One of the many battles he led the Legions of Lettow on was the Battle of Ossus, where he was forced to retreat. Despite his defeat on Ossus, he tried to ally with the Galactic Republic to go against the Jedi Order, but was unsuccessful.

Qel-Droma was skilled with the Force, mastering abilities such as Mind Trick, Force Barrier, Force Scream, Force Choke, and Sever Force. Ulic was also talented in lightsaber combat, mastering Form V, also known as Djem-So.# Fall to the Dark Side\nThe reason Qel-Droma joined the Krath and the Sith Empire wasn’t because he wanted to be as powerful as any other person. Instead, he wanted to avenge all of the Jedi who died at the hands of the Krath group. He did let his teammates know about his idea, and although everyone disagreed with it, he ignored them and left the Jedi Order. Before leaving for Empress Teta, he went to Ossus’ library to meet his brother, Cay Qel-Droma, for the last time before departing. Even though Cay knew his brother wouldn’t come back to the Light Side of the Force, he trusted Ulic.\nAfter disguising as a smuggler, Ulic Qel-Droma went to the planet Empress Teta to infiltrate its capital city, Cinnagar. He was surprised when he saw the Krath was holding a public execution against those who disagreed with their rule. Qel-Droma watched the execution in secret until a carbonite trader known as Farng threw a knife at Aleema Keto, the co-founder of Krath. Seeing his plan was in danger, he killed Farng with a lightsaber swing in an attempt to showcase loyalty to the Krath. Aleema was impressed with the Fallen Jedi’s skill and brought Qel-Droma to Krath’s Iron Citadel. However, he was betrayed by the female Krath member who knocked Ulic down.\nAfter waking up, Ulic Qel-Droma was questioned by Satal and Aleema keto and tortured by an interrogation droid. Qel-Droma was punished heavily by the Ketos, but thanks to a massive outburst of Force Energy, he freed himself but fell unconscious again. After waking up once again, he was informed that a female Jedi was taken prisoner by the Krath; her name was Nomi Sunrider, a Jedi who came to Empress Teta to save the Jedi Knight. Surprised by this notice, Ulic told Satal Keto he would execute her. As expected, Ulic Qel-Droma wouldn’t kill a fellow teammate and sent her a message through a servant droid. Satal eventually found out Qel-Droma failed Krath and sent an assassin known as Norgor to kill the traitor. The assassin tried to shoot Qel-Droma but was killed easily by the Jedi Knight. During that time, Sunrider escaped the captors and went to the Iron Citadel, where Qel-Droma’s brother and Tott Doneeta were waiting for her. As expected, Krath forces were notified about the escape and engaged the Jedi. As well, Qel-Droma went to Satal Keto’s to avenge Arca Jeth and finally kill him. Satal Keto knew what he was doing and slowly manipulated the Jedi Knight into the Dark Side of the Force through hatred and anger. The outcome of this duel ended with Qel-Droma successfully killing the Krath Ruler.\nQel-Droma then returned to the Iron Citadel with Aleema Keto, his new lover. While they talked about the future of their relationship, they heard sounds of laser fire; a battle in the sky was happening between the Jedi Forces and the Krath. This battle occurred because the fugitive Sunrider, along with Cay Qel-Droma, and Tott Doneeta, were trying to rescue the Jedi Knight by telling them he was under a Dark Illusion attack. Ulic didn’t believe them and didn’t go with them. After leaving the rescuers aside, he met a Fallen Jedi known as Exar Kun. Aleema attempted to kill Exar but failed, and instead, Ulic did. These two possessed an amulet, both of which started glowing during the fight. These amulets invoked a ghost image of Marka Ragnos, who told them to stop fighting. He then named Exar Kun as the new Dark Lord of the Sith, and Ulic Qel-Droma as Exar Kun’s Sith Apprentice.\n\n# Serving under Exar Kun\nDuring the Great Sith War, Exar Kun’s Sith Apprentice was tasked to form an army, something he did in 3996 BBY after meeting a Mandalorian clan and their leader, Mandalore the Indomitable. Instead of surrendering, the Mand’alor challenged the new Sith Lord to a duel; if the Mand’alor won, he would get the seven worlds of the Empress system, but if Qel-Droma won, Mand’alor and his crusaders would have to swear loyalty to him, and the Sith Empire. After a tough battle between both individuals, Qel-Droma was the winner. Mandalore the Indomitable would act as a Lieutenant of Qel-Droma’s forces while he would act as a Commander. During an attack on Foerost, Qel-Droma, along with his forces, decided to assault Coruscant. After arriving at the Republic’s capital, he and his troops moved into the Republic war room to crush their central military command. Unfortunately for him, his lover, Aleema Keto, betrayed Qel-Droma by telling his forces to retreat, leaving him alone with his personal guardsmen. Before destroying the Republic Navy, he was arrested and put on trial by the Senate.\nDuring this trial, Qel-Droma was accused of all his crimes against the galaxy, the most important one being him breaking the oath of allegiance to the Republic. While this trial was going on, Exar Kun and Mandalorian the Indomitable interrupted the tribunal with their forces. Ulic was rescued successfully, and along with Exar Kun, they cleared the courtroom. Mandalorian then told his commander that Aleema Keto had betrayed him and that she could no longer be trusted. After this, both Master and Apprentice headed to the Jedi Library on Ossus for Jedi treasures. During this mission, Ulic met his brother, Cay Qel-Droma, who he tried to bring down. Cay survived the strike. However, he later died in a duel between him and his brother. Ulic Qel-Droma fell to tears after realizing what he had done. Nomi and Tott arrived after the fight and saw what the Sith Lord did. After seeing one of her teammates was dead, Nomi projected a Sever Force attack on Qel-Droma that stripped his connection through the Force.\n\n# Redemption and Death\nUlic Qel-Droma decided to exile himself eight years after the death of his brother. Although he was alone now, he couldn’t achieve peace and thought the Force had abandoned him. Qel-Droma was in fact, not alone, because the Force Spirit of his Jedi Master, Arca Jeth, appeared to him and told Qel-Droma to keep going. During his time on the planet Rhen Var, Qel-Droma met the girl who would be later his apprentice, Vima Sunrider. Vima was as expected from Qel-Droma, his first lover’s daughter. The young girl asked Ulic Qel-Droma to be her master, something he thought wouldn’t be appropriate because he no longer held a connection to the Force. Qel-Droma agreed in the end and taught his new apprentice everything he knew. Although he was no longer a Force user, Qel-Droma taught Vima the ways of the Force. The young apprentice learned Qel-Droma’s teachings really fast, and her master decided it was time to build her lightsaber. After using an Adegan Crystal from his father, Andur Sunrider, they started dueling.\nDuring a sparring session, Qel-Droma decided to teach his apprentice about the burdens of being a Jedi. During the talk, Vima sensed her mother was close to the fortress they were inside. Nomi told her daughter to leave Qel-Droma, but she refused because her master taught her a lot. While Vima was showcasing to her mother what he learned, Qel-Droma thanked his Jedi Master for convincing him of living. During the talk both master and padawan had, a Cathar Jediknown as Sylvar called Qel-Droma out and engaged him into a lightsaber fight. Qel-Droma lost the duel, but Sylvar let him live because she avenged her lover. However, a blaster bolt from Hoggon assassinated the exiled Sith Lord, who died in Nomi’s arms.\n\n","meta":{"index":64,"author":"ValenTemenos","name":"Ulic Qel-Droma","release_year":2022}},"Starkiller":{"content":"# Overview\nBorn in Kashyyyk, Galen Marek or also known as Starkiller, was a Force-Sensitive human male who was strong with the force. \nGalen was Darth Vader’s secret apprentice due to the Rule of Two. Since Vader was still Sidious’ apprentice, Galen couldn’t consider himself a Sith until Darth Vader killed the Emperor. Although he was extremely loyal to his mentor, he was betrayed by Darth Vader after Sidious confronted them.# Training under Darth Vader\nAfter being taken by Darth Vader as his “secret” apprentice, Starkiller fulfilled the role of Vader’s secret assassin. As part of his training to become a Sith, he was subjected to brutal training against PROXY, who would try to keep him sharp during every session.\nDuring a sparring duel in 3 BBY, at the end of said fight, Vader ordered Starkiller to kneel before him to recognize Galen as his new apprentice. His first test was to go to Nar Shaddaa to kill Jedi Master Rahm Kota. Vader also ordered him to not leave any witnesses in the shipyard Rahm Kota was attacking by killing everyone in it.\n\nOnce Starkiller arrived at the shipyard, Jedi General Kota felt disappointed because he expected to meet Darth Vader instead of a little boy. After a short talk from Kota, Starkiller decided to start the battle with a Force Lightning attack, and the fight began. After a tough duel, Rahm Kota noticed he was being surpassed by the young apprentice, and decided to leave by dropping his lightsaber and unleashing a telekinetic blast. Following this decision made by Rahm Kota, Starkiller took the Jedi General’s lightsaber and gave it to his master after getting out of Nar Shaddaa.\nAfter this mission was finished, Starkiller kept training and being loyal to Darth Vader by following his orders. His new mission was established; he had to go to Raxus Prime and kill Kazdan Paratus, who was way stronger than the young apprentice. \n\nAfter a very long trip to Raxus Prime, Starkiller arrived in his search for the Jedi Master. After making his way into the Jedi Temple, he was attacked by Paratus’ droid sentries who he killed easily. Following this, a Golem Tore attacked Starkiller and started a fight that moved to Paratus’ mock Jedi Council. Eventually, he disabled the Golem, where he later met Kazdan Paratus, and the fight started. \nDuring this duel, Starkiller took advantage of Paratus’ mock Jedi Council mannequins, and threw Yoda’s one at him, leaving the Jedi Master distraught. After this, Starkiller took control of the battle, evading Kazdan’s telekinetic assaults. In the attempt to kill Starkiller, Paratus threw a machinery chunk at the young apprentice, who in turn caught it and threw it back, killing Paratus and completing his mission successfully.\n\n# Betrayal\nThe Emperor, Darth Sidious, noticed Darth Vader had been training an apprentice behind his back and obligated him to assassinate Starkiller. Once the Apprentice arrived at Vader’s chambers, he stabbed him from the back with his lightsaber. Starkiller was confused because he thought Darth Vader lured the emperor, but instead, he was there to see him die.\nAfter Sidious left, Vader ordered his droids to get his apprentice’s body back to the Dark Lord’s science vessel from the vacuum of space. After Starkiller woke up, he accused his master of trying to kill him, but Vader said he was obligated by his master, Darth Sidious. Vader offered Starkiller to keep being his secret apprentice, and he accepted because his other choice was to die. \n\nAs his last betrayal, Starkiller was called by Darth Vader to notify him about the Rebels' situation. Juno was worried and questioned Vader’s intentions, but Starkiller told her everything would be fine.\nA meeting between Starkiller and other Rebels was interrupted by the Imperial Military along with Darth Vader. Vader ordered the Troopers to keep the rebels alive, as they were going to get killed personally by the Emperor. After Vader defeated Kota and all the Rebels surrendered, he advanced on Starkiller, accusing him of revealing his status as the Dark Lord of the Sith’s secret apprentice. Vader afterward threw the stone table at Starkiller, making him go to the snow. The young apprentice managed to survive the fall due to his body rebuild and asked Darth Vader why he interfered with the meeting when he agreed not to. Vader responded by saying not only his mission, but his apprenticeship was a lie. Starkiller told him that without him, he would never be free. Following this, Darth Vader was prepared to strike and kill his disciple but was saved by PROXY, who was using Obi-Wan Kenobi’s combat module.\nStarkiller went through a lie the entire time during his training under Darth Vader and was ready to make his former master pay.\n\n","meta":{"index":59,"author":"ValenTemenos","name":"Starkiller","release_year":2022}},"Karness Muur":{"content":"# Overview\nKarness Muur was one of the eight fallen Jedi that were exiled to Korriban to pursue the ways of the Dark Side of the Force.

After enslaving the Sith in Korriban, Sorzus Syn, one of the eight Dark Jedi, gave Karness Muur the Muur Talisman artifact. This artifact allowed Karness to possess the being of the person who wore his device. Karness Muur’s knowledge and power eventually gained him new enemies, one of them being Remulus Dreypa, who captured and put him into his oubliette along with his Muur Talisman.\n\nKarness Muur survived by binding his spirit to his Talisman device. During 3963 BBY, Muur’s spirit bonded with Jedi Master Celeste Morne through the Muur Talisman. Zayne Carrick, who was in the same place as Celeste Morne, placed her in Dreypa’s oubliette so she couldn’t cause any problem while controlled by the ancient Sith Lord.\nFour thousand years later, Vader discovered the Muur Talisman device, but unfortunately for him, it was inside of an oubliette. He opened Dreypa’s oubliette, but while he tried to take the Talisman artifact, he woke Muur and Morne up. Karness noticed that the new Dark Lord of the Sith’s power was incredible and begged Morne to let him wear the Talisman, but Celeste ignored him and fought the Sith Lord. Celeste Morne turned Vader’s clone troopers into rakghouls, making them go against Vader. This decision made Muur mad, as he was imprisoned in a weak Jedi’s body. \nTwenty years later after the meeting of Vader and Celestia, Karness Muur saw a new opportunity to get into a new being’s body, and the candidates were Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa. Muur tried to dominate Leia, but unfortunately for him, Celestia took the Muur Talisman out of Leia’s neck. \nA century later, Celestia Morne and Karness Muur traveled to Had Abaddon. There, they met Darth Krayt and Cade Skywalker, who went to Had Abaddon to ‘negotiate’. The deal they both made was actually a trap against Darth Krayt. Darth Krayt was considered dead as he was stabbed by Azlyn Rae, so Muur decided to go against Cade Skywalker. Cade Skywalker killed Celeste Morne and made her disintegrate, leaving the Muur Talisman.

Darth Marr was born in 3702 BBY and would later assume his seat on the Dark Council in his early twentys. Darth Marr would lead the Sphere of Defense of the Empire during the Great Galactic War as he would drive back Republic offensives. Darth Marr would later watch the numbers of the Dark Council dwindle due to some members dying out on the battlefield and others dying due to infighting amount the Dark Council. Due to this Darth Marr would later be put as the sole leader of the Imperial Military until his Death.# Early Career\nDarth Marrs History is shrouded in lots of mystery. Darth Marr decided to train down the path of a Sith Warrior. Darth Marr adopted an armored-type battlesuit with a mask and hood the mask he wore was emotionless thus invoking the idea of a monstrous sithspawn creature. Darth Marr recovered his Lightsaber from the ancient  Sith Lord Tulak Hord on the planet Dromund Fels shortly before he would take his seat on the Dark Council. Around the year 3678 BBY Darth Marr and several other Dark Council Members would head to Korriban to confront the Sith Lord Calypho. Later the Sith Lord Calypho would be arrested for heresy.\n\n# Defender of the Empire\nDarth Marr would also take part in the Great Galactic War. During this time he would earn a fearsome reputation among both Empire and Republic. Darth Marr would lead countless forces in the conquest of Republic planets as well as lead the defense forces of Korriban and Ziost two planets the Republic tried to invade however Darth Marr would repel each invitation by the Republic. Later as the Great Galactic War would come to an end and peace between Empire and Republic was forged tensions between both sides were still very high. Darth Marr took it upon himself to build up and strengthen Imperial holdings on planets so the Empire would be well prepared for the next Galactic War.\n\n# Empire on the Brink\nIn 3638 BBY Darth Marr would get word of Hutt Cartel's activity on Makeb. Darth Marr would call upon the Empire Hero’s to help in the matter as the Emperor was absent and he himself needed to attend to the war. While Darth Marr was attending to the war he tasked the Hero’s and their small team to recover the Hutt’s supply of Isotope 5 so Imperial ships could be powered by it.

With the Isotope 5 all used up Darth Marr tasked the Hero’s team to find a way to get Isotope 5 or they would face his wrath. Later on, the Hero’s and their team would find a way to stabilize Makebs core and continue mining Isotope 5.\n\n# Against the Emperor\nLater during the War Darth Marr and the Empire would enter into an uneasy alliance with the Republic in order to stop Reven and his Order from bringing Emperor Vitiate back to life. Reven sought to bring the Emperor back to life to finally kill the Emperor once and for all. What was unclear was that all the death and destruction on Yavin 4 brought the Emperor back to life just like Reven wanted but not how Reven envisioned Reven brought the Emperor’s spirit back and unleashed it on the galaxy causing lots of problems. Emperor Vitiate would later attack the planet of Ziost wreaking havoc and possessing millions of people of equipment killing thousands before finally taking all life on Ziost.

Phanius diverged from the Jedi ideology, leading him on an alternative path that led him to the dark side-the way of the Sith, which ultimately led him to abandon the Jedi Order in pursuit of his individualistic ideology.\n\n Trying to create a new empire by re-igniting the Sith, Phanius rallied various Sith clans under his leadership to formalise this new Sith empire. Quite a few years later, under the new name of Darth Ruin, the former Jedi Master declared himself to be a Dark Lord of the Sith. Additionally, fifty more Jedi were converted as a result of the Fourth Great Schism. With Lord Ruin's final act of resurgence and the emergence of the New Sith Wars, the Sith resurgence has culminated in a galactic-scale conflict against the Jedi Order and the Old Republic. \n\nDue to the Dark Lord's own ruthless egomania, which was a direct result of the Dark Lord's own ruthless egomania, the reign of Darth Ruin ended in untimely death following the assassination of the Dark Lord. Though Ruin had tragically perished, the bloody legacy of his machinations has endured for a millennium. The Sith crusades, despite their frequent disagreements and back stabbings, have continued for a millennium in his absence, and have brought galactic civilization to the brink of extinction.# Darth Ruin's Legacy\nAs a result of the actions of the late Darth Ruin the Sith have been given a new era of expansion and renaissance. While he was not around, the New Sith Wars continued for thousands of years despite his absence. A number of prominent Dark Lords rose to power during this time and were brought to prominence through various destructive campaigns against the Jedi and the Republic, pushing the latter to the brink of collapse. It was Darth Rivan, the infamous Sith Lord who had at one time possessed a text passage titled the \"creed of ruin\" which was reminiscent of Ruin's solipsistic philosophy which was among these leading figures of the Sith. \n\nThe treachery which had originally led to Ruin's death continued to plague the Sith ranks despite the string of crushing victories Ruin's successors achieved, with many subsequent Dark Lords succumbing to the same fate as their predecessor. The Sith finally turned against one another at some point during the Republic Dark Age, which began in 1100 BBY, causing the empire founded by Ruin to fracture. After the remnants of the Sith were reorganised into the Brotherhood of Darkness in 1000 BBY, they succumbed to the New Sith Wars and ultimately perished. \n\nDarth Bane, a lone survivor from the Brotherhood, went on to establish a revised conception of Sith doctrine to combat the traps which destroyed Ruin and his successors, and Bane explained the study of the Sith in the Book of Sith, a compilation of historical evidence. Ruin's legacy was portrayed with a very grim view by the Jedi Order in a guide titled The Jedi Path, arguing that his revival of the Sith nearly led to the demise of the galactic civilization. Jedi historian Tionne Solusar compiled an encyclopaedic compendium about the Force in 40 ABY, a volume in which she outlined Ruin's former life as a Jedi Master as well as his motivations for leaving the Order to establish the New Sith.\n\n# Personality & Traits\nIn addition to being one of the most charismatic and talented Jedi in his time, Master Phanius was also a pale blue-skinned member of the Umbaran species. Despite the challenges, however, the Jedi Master stirred controversy with his intellectual pursuits. He was especially fascinated with the philosophy of solipsism during this period. Phanius was ambitious, abstract, and believed that what he saw as the essence of all existence was actually made up of his own perceptions, meaning that from his perspective, he was essentially the universe's all-embracing essence. As a result of his self-centred attitude, Phanius came to resent the Jedi Order, which he felt was a hindrance in his vision. He believed the Jedi teachings were one of the things that was hindering the Umbaran from recognizing the totality of who he was in reality. Phanius became determined to obliterate these inhibitions and so he took on the identity of Darth Ruin as a dark lord, a path that would take him down the dark path of the Sith. He became increasingly consumed by his individualistic obsessions as he sought to revive the Sith, gradually connecting with his Sith followers only in a way that was detachable from their actions. As a result of Ruin's ruthless ambition and ruthless impulses, he became a widely despised leader, an assassination target, and he eventually fell from grace. However, that did not stop the Dark Lord from remaining unwaveringly confident in his monomaniacal pursuit, leaving him completely blind to the treachery which would eventually bring about his death\n\n","meta":{"index":48,"author":"2lu0","name":"Darth Ruin","release_year":2022}},"Exar Kun":{"content":"# Section I\nRaised in the Jedi, Exar Kun had surprisingly little control over his anger. As a young Padawan, Exar showed immense potential in the Force. None of his fellow Padawan peers could contest with him when it came to lightsaber or Force powers. Exar’s very own master, Vodo Siosk-Baas, had taken notice of his Padawans' barely controlled rage. At one point in Exar’s training, his master had to step in to stop a duel between Exar and a fellow peer Padawan due to Exar nearly killing her. Exar Kun eventually took on a second saber and with it used the art of Jar’Kai to defeat his very master.# Section II\nOnce Exar finished his training, he set out to find the dark power of the Sith. His curiosity overwhelmed him, and he believed himself immune to the Dark Side's temptation. Exar’s search led him to Dxun, a moon of Onderon. There, Exar found the tomb and spirit of the ancient Sith Lord Freedon Nadd. Freedom tempted Exar to the Dark, and took him on as an apprentice. Exar grew in power quickly, and eventually destroyed Freedon’s spirit. With his ambitions set on becoming a Dark Lord, he set out to destroy the other disciples of Freedon Nadd, so he would have little competition. Exar Kun eventually came to find the Krath Sith Cult. There, he encountered their warlord, Ulic Qel-Droma. During this encounter, the spirit of Marka Ragnos appared, and announced they had completed their full true initiations as Sith.\n\n# Section III\nExar Kun was dubbed Dark Lord by Marka, with Ulic becoming his Sith apprentice. Together, they formed the Brotherhood of The Sith, and waged war on the galaxy. Focused on destroying the ancient lore of the Jedi on Ossus, Exar’s apprentice betrayed him for the Jedi and prepared an assault against him at Yavin 4. As Exar returned to Yavin 4, he was attacked by thousands of Jedi. Using a technique he did not fully understand or master, he separated his spirit from his body in an attempt to escape. Unfortunately, the Jedi Nomi Sunrider led the Jedi to create the Wall of Light, a power that destroyed the landscape of Yavin 4, trapping the spirit of Exar inside his temple.\n\n","meta":{"index":23,"author":"Ruvjaal","name":"Exar Kun","release_year":2022}},"Darth Sidious":{"content":"# Introduction\nDarth Sidious was a powerful Dark Lord of the Sith. He began his life on the planet of Naboo where Sidious would be born and raised by the House of Palpatine. Through his time on Naboo Sidious also known as Sheev Palpatine would collect many Sith Artifacts and would be confronted by a Muun called Hego Damask also known as the Dark Lord, Darth Plagueis. Plagueis would task the Young Palpatine into eliminating his father, and without hesitation, Palpatine would agree to this task and be officially named Darth Sidious.# His Appearance during the Sith\nDarth Sidious was a very awful look for a Sith, during the Clone Wars he had a fierce battle against the Jedi and Master of the Order Mace Windu, which resulted in him almost taking out everyone but lost in combat to Mace Windu, Luckily he would be saved by Darth Vader but unfortunately, his face and body became scarred and wrinkled due to his desperate attempt of Force lightning was reflected into him burning him and making his face pale with many veins and wrinkles, and his use of the Dark Side affected his eyes turning them Dark Red, He was always hooded as his appearance would surely scare the residence and give discomfort towards the galaxy.\n\n# House of Palpatine\nSidious was born to a wealthy and powerful family on the planet of Naboo. Born to Cosinga Palpatine He was known to be early into the politics of the Naboo system however he also contained a kind of Insane mentality and would be known to have the urge to eliminate many people without hesitation. This frightened his Father and allowed the fall of Sheev Palpatine and learned about the true nature of the Dark Side, through finding and collecting many Sith Artifacts.\n\n# The Slaughter\nDuring Palpatine's time in an academy for politics, He was confronted by a muun named Hego Damask, This Muun would later be known as the Sith Lord Darth Plagueis and would convince Palpatine that he was strong in the Dark Side of the Force and would attempt to lure him by any means necessary. Cosinga Palpatine would learn of his son's treachery and would ban Plagueis from entering House Palpatine, This enraged Sidious and would allow Plagueis to fuel Sheev into finally snapping on his family allowing him to go deep into the Dark Side slaughtering the family and guards that protected the House. This would cement Sheev’s legacy,  officially known as Darth Sidious.\n\n# The Nabbo Crisis\nDarth Sidious began an alliance with the Trade Federation, a money-hungry and deceitful organization that looked nothing better than to trade many goods whether it was illegal or not. This alliance led them to start trading into the Naboo system resulting in war against the Naboo resistance and the Gungans. Palpatine during this time had gotten himself a new Apprentice by the name of Darth Maul, a Powerful Zarbrak who could maul his way through any Jedi and army. During the war the Jedi got involved with the war resulting in the defeat of the Trade Federation and the end of Darth Maul, however, this was all a part of Palpatine's plans for the better of the wars to come.\n\n# The Chancellor\nDarth Sidious began his journey as a Sith Lord in secret, He lived both lives as Sheev Palpatine who was an Ambassador, representing Naboo, and live the life of Darth Sidious who was a very deceitful and manipulative Lord and would play a role in both sides of the coming wars to follow. he orchestrated the Naboo Crisis and resulted in the manipulation of Queen Amidala to allow Palpatine to not only be allowed to be elected for Chancellor but to also be known as the leader of the Republic. Palpatine would orchestrate this entire course of action involving his true intentions to be set in the journey to come, He would plan the future wars and showcase a manipulation from both the Trade Federation, soon to be the Separatist, and the Republic.\n\n# The Clone Wars\nThe coming wars that would begin under Sidious’s influence were immeasurable. The coming wars would be started on both sides through Sidious who both led the Separatists and the Republic. In time the wars would lead to Sidious getting himself a new apprentice after the fall of his former apprentice Darth Maul, his apprentice would be far more powerful and leadership worthy and was a former Jedi Master known as Count Dooku, now known as Darth Tyranus. Through Tyranus’s help, they would orchestrate the new war through a clone army. They would attempt to make the Jedi feel desperate for an army which led to the formation of the new clone wars. a war that resulted in the many ongoing battles between the Republic and the Separatists.\n\n# The Order\nThe clone wars would be fierce in the coming times to come, in the last final days of the clone wars, the Jedi were on the brink of victory and was letting their guards down until, the commanding officers of every clone squad began the following order, the execution of Order 66, a horrifying time for the Jedi but a glorious day for the Sith, Order 66 resulted in manipulating the Clone Army through chips stored in their brains at birth allowed their brains to be tricked into believing that the Jedi were traitors of the Republic and they fired their blasters at every Jedi they laid their eyes upon. This would bring the end of the Jedi Temple and result in the fall of the Jedi as a whole, very few Jedi survived, and if they did, they were hunted down by Darth Vader, Sidious’s new apprentice.\n\n# The Empire\nThe last days of the Jedi were enough to allow Darth Sidious, now titled Emperor Palpatine, to bring order across the galaxy and bring everlasting peace to the people of the galaxy. Because of Emperor Palpatine's new rule his new apprentice Darth Vader would now be tasked with eliminating the Jedi without the disapproval of the citizens of the planets. resulting in very easy eliminations of the many Jedi Vader would meet. Through Palpatine's time as Emperor, he would begin construction of the newly created space station, the Death Star, a powerful station capable of destroying entire planets. through the time of the Death Star, however, the newly formed Rebel Alliance would foil the Death Stars capabilities and result in the very early destruction of the Death Star. With this knowledge, Palpatine would play a very risky attempt to destroy the Rebels and finally bring Order back to the Galaxy. Ultimately this would result in his demise as while building another Death Star, he would attempt to turn Luke Skywalker, Vader's son into the Dark Side, which would be unsuccessful and resulted in Palpatine attempting to eliminate Skywalker with Force Lightning. Vader however could not watch his son be eliminated in front of him, so Vader turned to the Light side and eliminated Darth Sidious.\n\n# The Final Chance\nDarth Sidious was eliminated that day, but he saved himself by attempting one final force move that was a very dark power, very ancient as well, he used the Dark Side of the force to transfer his Spirit into a whole new body. This resulted in Sidious becoming a Clone with force sensitivity. With the new body, Sidious would attempt one last time to turn Luke to the Dark Side, He was successful this time and it resulted in the redemption of his former life. However Luke was very quickly turned back to the Light and Palpatine was eliminated again, with one final attempt he used the Dark Side again to transfer himself into Luke's Nephew Anakin Solo, but would ultimately fail as a fallen Jedi by the name of EmpatoJayos Brand would intercept his spirit and drag him into the Depths of the Force finally removing Sidious from the face of the Galaxy.\n\n","meta":{"index":29,"author":"Redjaal","name":"Darth Sidious","release_year":2022}},"Lana Beniko":{"content":"# Overview\nLana Beinko was a female human Sith Lord of the reconstituted Sith Empire and served as an advisor to the Dark Council member, Darth Arkous, and served in the Sphere of Military Offense.

Alek was nicknamed “Squint” by his mates in the Jedi Enclave, he found solace by befriending another Padawan who would soon be known as “Revan”. Revan was known to be the stronger of the two, but Alek sought after knowledge rather than strength. Both of them would receive the rank of Jedi Knight around the time of 3964 BBY. Around the time they became Jedi Knights, the Mandalorian Wars had begun after the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders launched an attack against the Republic. Jedi Master Draay had sent Alek to look for his Padawan, named Zayne Carrick.

A group of Jedi tracked and followed Revan, Malak, and the Revanchists to Cathar, and attempted to tell them to disperse as the Masters had believed the Mandalorians were no threat to the Jedi Order. However, Revan, during the discussion, noticed a Mandalorian helmet underneath him and picked it up. It turned out to be a female’s battle armor, and once some light struck the helmet, a vision was seen by all the Jedi in the vicinity describing the efforts that the Mandalorian female had made to stop her own people from slaughtering the people of Cathar. She had tried to convince Cassus Fett, who led the attack on Cathar, to stop killing the Cathar people as they had already been defeated by the Mandalorians. Cassus Fett refused, turning to the Mandalorian female and ordering his men to kill the remainder of the Cathar people and cause devastation to their planet, killing the Mandalorian female as well. Revan made a promise to defeat the Mandalorians after witnessing the events that unfolded before all of their eyes. However, even after witnessing the vision, the Jedi remained true to what the Jedi Masters had told them, still believing Malak and Revan were headed down the wrong path. The Jedi Council allowed Revan, Malak, and the Revanchists, with the proof they had found, to participate in the Mandalorian Wars. Both Revan and Malak were promoted to General.\n\n# Section III\nMany conflicts later, Revan and Malak were on a mission in the Unknown Regions, where they had possibly encountered the Dark Lord of the Sith, known only as the Sith Emperor, Darth Vitiate. While there, the two Jedi, Malak and Revan were posing as mercenaries to learn whatever information about the Sith Emperor they could possibly learn. They became quite knowledgeable in the fact that the Emperor was raising an army to invade the Republic once again, but they were led into a trap after agreeing to be snuck into the Imperial Citadel by an Imperial Guard, who was bound to the Emperor’s will. Malak and Revan were overwhelmed by Vitiate’s power after attempting to take him on in a fight, The Emperor managed to break their wills and granted them both the title of “Darth”, successfully transferring them over to the Dark side of the Force. Vitiate requested them to find the Rakatan Star Maps and locate the Star Forge. In order to construct his Sith Armada in a timely manner, the Sith Emperor would use the Star Forge in order to do so. However, the power and will of Revan and Malak were far greater than Vitiate had thought, in which they both began to believe they were acting on their own accords, and were able to block their memories of the Sith and the Emperor. Revan and Malak found three additional Star Maps on the Sith tomb world of Korriban, the desolate desert planet Tatooine, and the Selkath’s oceanic homeplanet Manaan.\n\n","meta":{"index":2,"author":"PhaseSpectr","name":"Darth Malak","release_year":2021}},"Tawni Ames":{"content":"# Overview\nDuring the Imperial Era, Tawni Ames held the prestigious position of governor in the region of Desix.

Bandon became the first Shadow Hand of the new Dark Lord, making him second-in-command of the Sith Empire, sometime after Malak betrayed his Master, Revan, during an ambush by the Jedi and Republic troops seeking to arrest them.# Biography\nThe human being known as Darth Bandon was a Jedi Padawan who never fully embraced the Jedi Code's teachings. Bandon's strong emotions, such as rage and hatred, raged within him and fueled his strength even as the Force poured through him. His Jedi Master attempted to control these intense feelings, but the boisterous Padawan resented being controlled by his Master. \n\nThe heroes of the Mandalorian Wars and former Jedi Knights Revan and Malak discovered the Star Forge, a remnant of the Rakatan Infinite Empire that controlled the galaxy over 20,000 years earlier, and dubbed themselves the new Dark Lords of the Sith. The Jedi Civil War was started when Revan and Malak declared war on the Jedi Council and the Galactic Republic. Bandon abandoned the Jedi Order and his former teacher, running away to the revived Sith academy on Korriban, the former Sith homeworld. \n\nBandon accepted the dark side's and the Sith Code's teachings wholeheartedly as a pupil at the brand-new Korriban academy. This rapidly distinguished Bandon from his fellow students and caught the eye of Darth Malak, Revan's Sith apprentice. This was in addition to Bandon's strength with the Force, his inherent brutality, and his total ruthlessness in his pursuit of dominance. Malak finally developed a fondness for Bandon. The Jedi and Republic troops construct a trap for Revan and Malak two years into the Jedi Civil War in an effort to apprehend both Sith Lords. Malak gave the command for his flagship Leviathan to start firing on Revan's ship during the conflict, betraying his Sith Master. Malak took control of the Dark Lord of the Sith mantle after believing he had defeated Revan.  \n\nMalak searched among his followers for a single student who could acquire the Sith secrets and use them to effectively destroy the Jedi and the Republic. This was customary for the Sith Order. Malak chose the talented Bandon to be his Shadow Hand, elevating him to second place in the Sith Empire after only his Master. Bandon learned a lot about the Sith from the Dark Lord. Bandon murdered numerous Jedi throughout the conflict, therefore Malak was happy that he chose to take Bandon as his pupil.

His double-bladed lightsaber was effective in slaying many of his erstwhile Jedi colleagues. When he duelled the Cathar Jedi Juhani, he additionally demonstrated his prowess with just one lightsaber. Bandon hadn't faced an opponent who could match him in strength before facing Revan. \n\n\nBandon was skilled with the Force and had access to a variety of Force abilities.\nHe could modify the air currents around his opponent, turning it into a maelstrom, and use the Force to push them to the ground. An opponent would be propelled into the air, spun around, and rendered entirely immobile by this swirling tornado of Force energy. In his demonstration against Revan, Bandon was also able to harness the Force to temporarily make himself almost immune to most offensive Force powers. Because of his proficiency with the dark side of the Force, Bandon was able to use dark-sided abilities like Force lightning. He also channelled his wrath into the dark side and used it to attack. \n\nBandon built a saberstaff with a crimson crystal inside it after he joined the Sith.\nExar Kun, the Sith Lord who started the Great Sith War forty years before the conclusion of the Jedi Civil War, used a lightsaber that was similar to the one that he was wielding.

The mission was a success and he managed to eliminate the threat before being taken captive by the Yuuzhan Vong.\n\nSolo spent nearly a full year in captivity, facing harsh torture for weeks at a time. His captor, Vergere, wished to convert the young Solo to the dark side. Solo did eventually fall to the dark side, but only briefly, before coming up with the idea to show the universe unconditional love. He eventually escaped before rejoining the war effort against the Yuuzhan Vong. In the final battle of the war, Solo defeated Onimi, a Yuuzhan Vong who had taken control over the mind of Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane.# History\nFollowing the end of the war, Jacen Solo set out in search of mentorship from various force sects around the galaxy. His travels led to him meeting Luminya, who later revealed herself to be a former apprentice of Darth Vader. He also met the Mind Walkers, with whom he trained for a while. During his time with the Mind Walkers, Solo experienced a vision of a dark figure (later revealed to be Darth Krayt). He returned to the Jedi during the Dark Net Crisis. Hoping to find a way to prevent another galactic war at the hands of the Krillik and to protect his infant daughter Allana. In addition, Jacen received a vision of himself killing Luke Skywalker and plunging the galaxy into chaos. In order to avoid this, Jacen Solo agreed to become the Sith apprentice of Luminya, slowly turning against his former allies over the span of one year. Jacen eventually took control of the Galactic Alliance, killed Mara Jade Skywalker, tortured Ben Skywalker (his former Jedi padawan and son of Luke Skywalker), committed several atrocities, took a Sith apprentice of his own, and ascended to the position of Sith Lord, becoming Darth Caedus. After all this, Caedus was eventually killed at the hands of his twin sister, Jaida.\n\n","meta":{"index":151,"author":"KenjiVolt","name":"Darth Caedus","release_year":2022}},"Kell Douro":{"content":"# Overview\nKell Douro was an assassin and a spy that worked for the New Sith Order circa 41.5 ABY.

Once the Anzat assassin arrived on Fhost, he noticed that Jedi Knight Jaden Korr’s fate lines were intertwined with his fate lines. He secretly followed him, but during his search for the Anzati soup, he engaged in a fight with Khedryn Faal, who also followed the Jedi to Fhost. After defeating Faal, the Anzat assassin kept looking for his victim, Jaden Korr, who was tired, as he fought an Alpha clone prior to the meeting with Kell Douro. Due to Korr’s fatigue, it wasn’t hard for Douro to feed himself with the Jedi Knight.

His species is unknown, but it is the same mysterious, legendary species as the powerful Jedi Yoda and Yaddle. Grogu is the adorable child of the Mandalorian (Din Djarin). The two are not biologically related, but they do share a special bond. This bond they share prevents Grogu from becoming a powerful Jedi, but the bond makes sure that Grogu follows Din Djarin so they can work as a team to survive the harsh galaxy. Grogu was one of the only Jedi to survive Order 66, and was trained by many different masters when he grew up on Coruscant. It is unknown how he escaped Order 66, but someone must have rescued him because he witnessed the 501st Legion kill three Jedi before managing to escape. Eventually, he ended up finding Din Djarin.# Mando's child\nGrogu was quite old, even though he appeared to possess the physique of a child. Mando and an IG unit droid, IG-11, were bounty hunters, and their bounty was Grogu. They found Grogu in a Nikto encampment and saved him from them. Eventually, they found themselves on Tatooine. Mando was attacked by a Mudhorn during this time, but Grogu saved him by lifting the mudhorn so Mando could stab it, Grogu was then unconscious. Still venturing through the galaxy, Grogu found a silver ball, which was the knob for a control on the Razor Crest, which was Mando’s ship. Mando was then forced to deliver Grogu to the Imperial figure who sent him. The Imperial’s name was never mentioned but he was referred to as “the client”. Doctor Pershing, another Imperial, wanted to study Grogu because of his uniqueness which could be valuable to the Empire’s rise back to power. Pershing took Grogu, which left Mando skeptical about what they wanted to do with him. Mando didn’t like the idea of leaving Grogu with the Imperials, so he brought havoc upon the Imperials until he saved Grogu. They were then opposed by the Bounty Hunter’s Guild. Luckily for Mando, his tribe came to save him. Grogu and Mando escaped and once again Grogu reached out for the ball, this time Mando happily gave it to him. The two went on a lot of missions together so Mando could earn a few credits. Mando, Cara Dune, and Greef Karga were ambushed by Mopff Gideon and a squad of Death Troopers, Gideon wieldedthe legendary artifact, the Darksaber. Eventually, they found themselves face to face with the famous ex-Jedi, Ahsoka Tano, who tried to help Grogu use the Force. Grogu’s connection to Mando was so strong that if he became too powerful in the Force, his emotions might go flooding out and he would cause damage. Ahsoka couldn’t help Grogu. Once again, Grogu found himself in the hands of the Imperials and Moff Gideon took him aboard a Light Cruiser. Mando, Greef Karga, Dune, Fennec Shand, and the legendary Boba Fett went on a rescue mission to save Grogu from Gideon’s forces. Mando beat Gideon in combat and so he was given the precious Darksaber. Gideon had a few tricks up his sleeves, he dispatched a squad of Dark Troopers to trap Mando and his gang. They were all saved by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, who took Grogu so he could be trained.\n\n# Jedi or Mandalorian\nGrogu was once again trained by a Jedi. Luke trained Grogu and taught him a few things, which included Force jumping. Grogu was trained on the planet Ossus, where Luke started to build his own Jedi Order, but he wasn’t trained for long. Mando came to Ossus and made a small armor out of Beskar, which was meant for Grogu. He gave the armor to Ahsoka and she gave it to Luke. Grogu was faced with a choice, become the first Jedi in Luke’s new academy or join Mando. Obviously, Grogu chose Mando and returned to Tatooine. He found Peli Motto, a friend of Mando’s who was a mechanic, and fixed the Razor Crest a few times. Peli took Grogu to see Mando, but he was in the middle of a battle to help Boba Fett. Grogu helped in the battle. Boba and his allies defeated most of the enemy and his Rancor then went rogue. Grogu went to touch the Rancor and put him to sleep. After the battle was done, Mando decided to travel to Mandalore so he could go to a sacred river since he took off his helmet. Grogu, once again, had the significant silver ball and in Mando’s new ship, which was a Naboo Starfighter, Grogu tapped the ball against the window so Mando could jump to hyperspace, which Grogu loved. Mando at first told him to stop, but then he couldn’t help it and let Grogu convince him to.\n\n","meta":{"index":165,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Grogu","release_year":2022}}},"meta":{"name":"Persons of Interest","index":15}},"Sith Philosophy":{"articles":{"Sith'ari":{"content":"# Introduction\nMuch like the Jedi Order, the Sith are beings of prophecy and belief and hold a variety of titles, relics and prophecies as sacred.

The title of Sith’ari by definition implies that the Sith must be destroyed in order to be reborn again, however, very few Sith would like to be the ones involved in this Sith Purge, and so it would overtime become more apparent to Sith Lords that the worship or dictation of the Sith’ari might in fact be very dangerous for them. \n\nThe title and prophecy would remain well known throughout all of Sith history, however it would rarely be claimed or play any significant role beyond the era of King Adas.\n\n","meta":{"index":5,"author":"seko1111","name":"Sith'ari","release_year":2021}},"Sith Holocrons":{"content":"# Article\nSith holocrons contained knowledge and lore of the Sith from generations of great and powerful Sith Lords.

Such as the case with Darth Revan’s holocron, Freedon Nadd’s Holocron, and Darth Bane’s holocron, only when one was deemed worthy by the Gatekeeper could one access the ancient knowledge and near-sentient teachings of the Sith. The unworthy or determinations of heresy resulted in cold refusal and insults from the Holocron’s keeper. \n\nThe Rite of Commencement was a key factor in the construction of a Sith holocron, and was the process by which one’s cognitive essence was bound to the capstone and fueled with Dark Side energy to last for many millennia. Only the most powerful Sith Lords imbued and in tune with dark energies could manage to navigate the web of the cognitive network that was designed to house and preserve the knowledge of the holocron’s creator.  Once the Rite was invoked and completed, one simply had to close the holocron and lock it in place to complete the long and arduous process.

It is the untapped potential of all things which crave power and is the pathway by which the Sith Order posits itself as powerful warriors and cunning strategists. The Light teaches those who follow it to serve as docile golems - to submit to the Force and allow it to flow like the strong current of a river. The Dark Side is anathema to this in requiring one to dominate it and take hold of it as one would a tool of combat to allow the Force to fuel your power without allowing it to overwhelm you. This is the fundamental difference in the natures of the Force - one must break their chains and take their destiny into their own hands to truly grasp why the Sith follow the Dark Side, and why the Light holds you back.# Nature of the Dark Side\nWhat many in the Jedi Order fail to understand of the Sith is that use of the Dark Side is a means to an end; each Sith likely has goals and ambitions of their own that they seek to fulfill within the Order, and the power to do so lies in their own hands. Many are simply drawn to it naturally as emotional and idealistic beings. There is nothing inherently ‘evil’ about the Sith, it is simply that those who seek to repress emotion, passion, and craving naturally see those who encourage these traits as an enemy. The Jedi believe that the Force is a power in and of itself, with a will and morality, while the Sith view it as a means to power and glory. There can be no peace without action, and the peace of the Jedi is therefore a lie.\n\n# Fear of the Dark Side\nThe Jedi fear the Dark Side as a child fears the dark and silent places of their home -  it is an unknown variable that cannot be controlled without either overcoming one's own innate aversion or by assistance of an outside force - a light for example. The same can be said of the Force: Jedi fear that they will lose control over those who they allow to explore all aspects of the Force. They fear the freedom that comes with breaking one’s chains and seeking victory at all costs, for this victory deprives them of their artificial peace and perverse necessity for unearned respect to the Masters of the Order. \nThe Jedi profess equality but strip it from those who deviate from a chosen and set path, they offer harmony yet sow discord through deprivation of attachment and emotion - of the central aspect of sentience. They claim a higher understanding of the Force while refusing to study every aspect of what it has to offer the individual, opting rather for cowardice and inaction in the face of new discoveries. The Jedi fear knowledge of these realities as they lead to individuality and competition, which is in conflict with their Code. The Sith have no such reservations, and this fear simply serves the will of the Order as a motivator and a pathway to anger at one’s own lack of ability.\n\n","meta":{"index":17,"author":"Reavion","name":"Dark Side of the Force","release_year":2021}},"Sith Code":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe code of the Sith has remained largely unchanged for the entirety of the history of the Sith, starting with Sorzus Syn and the Hundred-Year Darkness and continuing through the Rule of Two.

This is the essential truth of the Sith Code, and should be known and understood by every member of the Order.# 'Peace is a lie, there is only passion.'\n‘Peace is a lie, there is only passion.’\nConflict is the truth of existence, and this conflict stems from the passions of living things. Peace is stagnation and apathy towards the universe; strife and struggle is the source of progress for every being and civilization throughout recorded history. The deepest nature of the Sith is that of craving, and this craving cannot exist with peace.\n\n# 'Through passion I gain strength'\n‘Through passion, I gain strength.’\nLust for power and the passion to guide one’s journey towards it is an essential tenet of being Sith. Nature is a story of predation on the weak; only those with strength may survive to fight another day. Every creature has passions, and to be devoid of these passions is to rob oneself of strength.\n\n# 'Through strength, I gain power'\n‘Through strength, I gain power.’\nTo be strong is to be at the pinnacle of your potential. Power is a natural byproduct of this state, and when individual Sith are strong, they may draw on power to break through barriers and subdue their opposition. Strength is a means to an end, and the strength of the individual contributes to the overall power of the Sith Order and the goals of the Council.\n\n# 'Through power, I gain victory'\n‘Through power, I gain victory.’\nThere is no defeat for a Sith, there is only humiliation and a loss of power. All Sith seek to earn victory, and it is vital to obtain the immense quantity of respect and obedience required from those under them. To be powerful is to inherently be at the highest of positions, and therefore worthy of victory and respect. To lose is to let these qualities slip away, which is a fate worse than death should one be unable to overcome its sting.\n\n# 'Through victory, my chains are broken. The Force shall free me.'\n‘Through victory, my chains are broken.’\n‘The Force shall free me’\nThe Dark Side is what defines a Sith. Their mastery of their emotions to control the Force, their power and strength to subdue their enemies and to seek glory and victory, all of these ends are a result of their channeling of the Dark Side. There is no opposition from equals at the very top, only those under you may levy a challenge. You are released from the chains of the hierarchy and may forge your own path.

Although the Rule Of Two’s philosophy defended the Sith for a while, it was later declared by Darth Sidious that the Rule of Two was nothing more than a fake, a counterfeit of Doctrine of the Dyad. \n\nSidious wasn’t the only one who thought that this is a great prophecy, the Sith Eternal’s ideals of the Doctrine of the Dyad was that it was significant and would lead the Sith order to flourish and thrive in the dark side of the Force.\n\nThe Sith tried to create a dyad through their determination but failed multiple times; Darth Plagueis tried to form one with his apprentice, Sidious, who also tried to have a force dyad too later on with his apprentice, Vader.\n\nIt took an enormous amount of time before a dyad that was known appeared and was formed between Kylo Ren and Rey, the descendants of Sidious and his apprentice.

The practice would be maintained by the Sith as one of their oldest traditions and would make for devastating appearances throughout galactic history.# Part I: Rules\nThe rules behind a Kaggath are quite vague, allowing each participant a wide variety of methods to succeed. Despite the tradition of the Kaggath being ancient, it is one of the few traditions taken very seriously by all Sith. The rules of the Kaggath can never be broken. \n\nParticipants may not request aid from outside of their resources. This would mean that a Sith could not approach another Sith outside of their network of associates for assistance. However, Sith could utilize any resource they did have. Such as fleets, armies, apprentices, fellow Sith who serve them, and more. This would often result in destructive Kaggaths and could run the risk of sabotaging Sith activities by infighting, hence why the challenge of a Kaggath was rarely issued. \n\nKaggaths must be approved by the Dark Council. This rule only applied during the existence of the Reconstituted Sith Empire. This was likely to prevent large-scale infighting amongst the Sith Order that would likely involve large amounts of Imperial resources. \n\n\nOn the rare occasion that an individual would find themselves in breach of the rules, they would typically be executed for doing so by Sith not involved in the Kaggath to ensure the purity of the tradition. \n\nSith who win by forcing their opponent to surrender can choose to spare them or let them live in humiliation, though to prevent the possibility of their opponent taking any revenge, Sith would almost always execute their opponent. \n\nSith may also absorb the resources of their deceased or humiliated opponent, in the case of a lower ranked Sith being declared the victor, they would traditionally absorb their opponent’s rank as well. \nThe arguably worst condition a Sith may decide to use against their defeated opponent is the choice to completely wipe the records of their defeated opponents' existence. This would often destroy the legacy of the Sith who lost.\n\n# Part II: Notable Kaggaths\nDuring the time of the Reconstituted Sith Empire, two Dark Councillors by the names of Darth Qalar and Darth Victun would fight a Kaggath against each other in the Imperial Citadel upon Dromund Kaas. The damage caused to the Imperial Citadel was so horrendous that the remaining members of the Dark Council chose to execute both participants of the Kaggath. The resources held by both Dark Councillors would be used in the reconstruction effort of the Imperial Citadel and the Dark Council would decide to wipe the records of both of their ex-colleagues. \n\nOnce again during the time of the Reconstituted Sith Empire, Darth Thanaton would challenge Lord Kallig to a Kaggath and would be defeated on Corellia. As a result of this defeat, Darth Thanaton would flee Corellia and seek help from the Dark Council on Korriban. Knowing this to be in direct violation of the Kaggath’s rules, Darth Thanaton was then promptly executed by Darth Mortis, his fellow on the Dark Council.

The Jedi are shameless in spreading this alarmist propaganda.\n  Under the Rule of Two, the Sith will operate in secrecy, feeding the belief that the Sith are a thing of the past, forgotten in their graves on Ruusan. They must not make their presence known. The Dark Side of the Force is finally concentrated. It gives the two beings unlimited power, but the Sith cannot afford the loss of either of you. Do not make yourselves targets. Even a Sith Lord can be felled by a thousand enemies.\n  If there exists a single being who believes in the continued existence of the Sith, kill them. If a group learns the secret, you must resort to subterfuge and misdirection. At one point, the Jedi believed they had evidence of Darth Bane’s own survival after Ruusan. His apprentice and himself concocted a ruse in which she drove her brother insane and made him appear to be the terrible Sith Lord. This satisfied the Jedi need to assign blame and they moved on.\n  The Sith Order is now a lineage. Given your skills, you should find it a simple matter to amass wealth and thus, with each succession the resources of the Sith will increase. Do not build palaces, for they will draw attention. Use your money to hire spies, scholars, assassins, trainers, guards and thieves. All will prove useful and the shine of credits will distract them from your true nature.\n\n","meta":{"index":23,"author":"jaketstone34","name":"Striking from the shadows","release_year":2023}},"Rule by the Strong":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Rule by the Strong was the name given to a Sith philosophy created by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Skere Kaan, following the events of the Sith Civil War. This rule was adopted by Lord Skere Kaan’s Brotherhood of Darkness and Darth Millenial’s Dark Force religion.# Information\nThis rule gave more power to the higher ranks within a Sith Order, making this philosophy a dictatorship for the lower ranks, who were weaker. Every Dark Lord in the Sith Order had the same power, making it an equal rule for the governors.\n\n# History\nThe Brotherhood of Darkness was the first Sith organization to adopt this new rule. Skere Kaan tried to fix the mistakes of Darth Ruin’s Sith Empire by giving the Brotherhood of Darkness’ Sith Council an equal power. Although every Sith Lord in Kaan’s Brotherhood of Darkness was powerful on their own, they couldn’t become stronger than the other because everyone was equal in the Brotherhood of Darkness, making the Dark Lords weaker. Dark Lord of the Sith Skere Kaan’s point wasn’t proven successfully, as he and his Brotherhood of Darkness perished in the Seventh Battle of Ruusan after the projection of the Thought Bomb. The Army of Light had defeated the Brotherhood of Darkness, however, there was one Sith left; Dessel.\nDessel, who would be known later as Darth Bane, saw the mistakes in Skere Kaan’s Brotherhood of Darkness, saying he turned his back on the teachings of the ancient Sith. Due to Darth Revan’s teachings through his own Holocron, Darth Bane decided to create a new rule or philosophy called the Rule of Two. This philosophy created by Darth Bane through Revan’s teachings allowed the Sith to work in secret, as they wouldn’t defeat the Republic and the Jedi Order through thousands of wars. Bane’s new system allowed only two Sith at a time, a master and an apprentice. The Sith Master was in charge of embodying the power, while the Sith Apprentice had to crave it. Whenever the Sith Apprentice thought he was ready to become the Dark Lord, they would attempt to kill their master.\nKaan’s rule wouldn’t come to an end at all, because Darth Millennial followed his legacy after leaving his master, Darth Cognus, aside.

Opposed to many other languages, the Sith language formed words through the integration of words or phrases to construct sentences with great meaning. Many other dialects existed within this form of communication such as Massassi and Balc speech as well as other forms of writing. In spite of the more common languages such as Galactic Basic Standard, this ancient tongue is speculated to have remained in use since the post-imperial era, yet there remain the many possibilities that it may have been used for even longer periods of time.# History\nSince all of its time, the Sith language was spoken only by the Sith Purebloods that resided within the Sith Worlds. It remained unchanged for quite some time, that is until the Dark Jedi exiles arrived on the planet Korriban and chose to enslave the Sith species for their own benefit. The verbilization was able to keep its primitive nature, yet was altered by Ajunta Pall and his followers in order to represent a founded Sith Order. In order for the Dark Jedi to understand and translate the form of speaking of the Sith, they forged translation talismans which allowed them to more fluently decipher the writing and words of the Sith language as if it was their nature. Sorzus Syn, a Dark Jedi that studied the Sith devised a series of different philosophies and writings in Sith Language such as the Code of the Sith, also known as Qotsisajak entirely written in Basic.\n\n\nThousands of years later in 5000 BBY, the Sith Dreadnaught known as Omen crash-landed on the planet Kresh. The red Sith on board at the time made desperate attempts to repair the ship for flight into space but were unsuccessful. Despite their failure, they were forced to influence the native Kreshiri species who, just like the Sith did with the Dark Jedi, looked up to them as their gods. Realizing that they could not return, the Sith formed the Lost Tribe of the Sith and constructed a temple on Kresh to further establish their dominance. Due to this event, the Sith language saw few adjustments and would be known as the “Old Tongue” to the Lost Tribe of the Sith.\n\n\nThe writings and dialect of the Sith language were preserved in holocrons throughout history, yet many failed to translate its contents. Only a select few had been capable of translation and even pronunciation of the different phrases and words that were present in this ancient form of speaking. Darth Bane, a notable Sith Lord that founded the Rule of Two, learned from these holocrons during his time in the Sith Academy so that he could enlighten himself with Sith knowledge in order to grow his strength also going as far as learning from the dead Sith Lords before him, bounded within the tombs.\n\n# Massassi Language\nMassassi was a primitive dialect of the Sith language used by the warrior caste known as the Massassi, which was later replaced by Sith especially seen within the Books of Massassi. Symbols and other forms of writing did not always translate to the usual Galactic alphabets.\n\n# Accent\nThis tongue consisted of 23 different speech sounds, the majority of which were obstruents. The obstruents would be known as:\n [  /t/, /d/, /k/, /q/, /m/, /n/, /ts/, /dz/, /s/, /z/, /h/, /t??/,/j/ /?/, [?/l], /w/, /?/. ] \n\nGraphemic system represented these terms as: \n[ t, d, k, q, m, n, ts, dz, s, z, h, ch, j, sh, r/l, w, y.]\n\nJust like plenty of other forms of speech in the galaxy, the Sith language expressed a total of 6 clear vowels:\n\n[ â, i, û, o, a, u, ]\n\nExamples of Pronunciation:\n\nâ = Crash\n\ni = Fleet\n\nû = Pub\n\no = Erode\n\na = Kumumgah \n\nu = Pursuit\n\n","meta":{"index":11,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Sith Language","release_year":2022}},"Rule of Two":{"content":"# The Rule of Two\nThe Rule of Two is the name given to a Sith philosophy created by Darth Bane after conflict with the Jedi killed all the Sith Lords except for him. Bane had seen how the infighting amongst the Sith had caused their defeat, so he developed the philosophy to prevent those factors in the future. \n\nDarth Bane declared that there could only be two Sith Lords at any given time, a master and an apprentice. The master was supposed to “embody” the power of the Dark Side, while the apprentice would “covet” that power. The apprentice would train until he was strong enough to kill his master, at which point he would become even more powerful and take on an apprentice of his own. Alternatively, a master could take on a new apprentice and have them kill the old one, taking the former apprentice’s place. Through this process, each generation of Sith would be more powerful than the last, and the infighting that had previously plagued the Sith Order would hopefully cease to exist.# Order of Sith Lords\nBane took on an apprentice named Darth Zannah and rebuilt the Sith while following the Rule of Two. By following this rule, he deceived the Jedi and kept the Sith hidden, even after his death (possibly at the hands of Darth Zannah). The Sith would continue to exist in secret for years until a Sith Master grew strong enough to take control of the Galaxy. This master was Darth Sidious, apprentice of Darth Plagueis.\n\n# Darth Sidious\nDarth Plagueis and Darth Sidious worked tirelessly to learn everything there is to know about the force. They were able to harness even more of the power of the Dark Side, including the power to triumph over death. Later, Sidious took on a pupil named Darth Maul and killed Darth Plagueis, taking his place as master. Darth Maul became Darth Sidious’s apprentice but was replaced by Darth Tyranus after a fatal duel with a Jedi Knight.\n\nAfter decades of being followed, the Rule of Two was broken by Darth Tyranus, who took on an apprentice of his own without killing Darth Sidious. Sidious had Tyranus kill his apprentice, only for him to take on yet another one. After the death of the second apprentice, things were further complicated when Darth Maul reappeared, alive, and took on an apprentice of his own, creating two rivaling pairs of Sith Lords. Sidious hunted this pair down and killed them, restoring the Rule of Two. Later, Darth Tyranus was killed by Anakin Skywalker who became Darth Sidious’s new apprentice: Darth Vader.\n\n# Darth Vader\nIn the years that followed this, the Sith finally came out of hiding. Darth Vader became powerful and respected as the Galactic Empire grew. Darth Sidious, taking the role of Emperor, continued to mentor Vader and used him to help conquer the Galaxy. When Vader learned of the existence of his son, Luke Skywalker, he began plotting to turn Luke to the Dark Side and replace Darth Sidious as master with Luke as his apprentice. Eventually, Luke was brought before Darth Sidious who caused them to fight, trying to have Luke replace Vader as his apprentice, however, this fight ended with Vader killing Sidious and then dying. With no more Sith Lords left alive, the Sith were presumed extinct once more. However, Darth Sidious was not dead.\n\n# Snoke, Ren, and Rey\nUsing the powers gained from Darth Plagueis, Darth Sidious revived himself into a new body and set about trying to find an apprentice once more. This time he used a clone, Snoke, to coax Ben Solo towards the dark side. Snoke took on Ben Solo as an apprentice who took the name, Kylo Ren. Ren would eventually kill Snoke, ascending to master, however, because he did not kill Sidious, Sidious remained master as well. Darth Sidious had used a loophole in the Rule of Two to allow Ren to ascend to master without Sidious having to be killed. Sidious would eventually try to recruit his granddaughter Rey Palpatine as his new apprentice, but she rejected his offer and destroyed him.

The ones who followed the light side of the Force and the ones who had appropriate training could get a form of immortality by retaining their own consciousness after their physical deaths. The Jedi Master known as Qui-Gon Jinn, had discovered this immortality ability; he in turn, taught Jedi Master Yoda and his apprentice that time, Obi-Wan Kenobi, how to attain this ability.

The Dark Jedi exiles who enslaved the species millenia ago and founded the Sith Orders combined these alchemical and magical rituals with their own mastery of the Force to bring forth advanced techniques which had scant been touched since the time of the Rakata. Force lightning, dark-side healing, necromancy, and the imbuement of weapons and artifacts with immense power were all domains of Sith magic and alchemy, and have been discovered, lost, and rediscovered countless times spanning the history of every Sith Order to have ever existed. Notable practitioners, such as Darth Sidious, Naga Sadow, Freedon Nadd, and Exar Kun were able to use these ancient rites and spells to enhance their own biotic sciences and dark side Force abilities to varying degrees of effect.# The Nature of Sith Magic\nThe strength of Sith magic is derived from many of the same forces that empowered the Dark Side of Force powers, and in many ways were one and the same. The Dark Jedi Exiles of the Hundred-Year Darkness incorporated many of the rites and magics of the Kissai priests into their own mastery of the dark side. Sith sorcerers in subsequent eras and Orders also gained the knowledge to combine these spells with traditional Sith powers in the midst of battle to devastating effect. These powers were especially effective at penetrating and warping a beings mind and perception of reality, making them far harder to defend against without full and unbridled concentration in combating the effects. As such, in the heat of battle, many of those who fell to Sith magic were powerful Jedi and Force wielders, but simply did not have the mental fortitude to withstand such attacks. The caveat being that such concentrated resistance also required equal concentration from the user, making them vulnerable to interruption or distraction.\n\n# The Application of Sith Magic\nThe practitioners of Sith magic were focused on using its abilities to bring their ambitions to reality. Some wielders focused on the mind-altering effects to turn the tides of major battles, while others used it to look inward and attempt to control life and death itself. The applications were wildly varied, but the unifying reason for seeking out and controlling this power was to enhance one’s connection to the Dark Side and to pursue ever-growing power over others. Many of the masters of the Sith, including Darth Bane and King Ommin of Onderon believed that Sith magic was the ultimate and maximum effect of dark side Force expression, and one could only attain such mastery through the breaking of an internal barrier and letting the Dark consume the individual - hatred of all things, even the Dark Side itself, were necessary to unlocking the true potential of Sith magic. Sacrifice of control over the self to become a conduit of fel powers and abilities was a slim price for the most advanced of Masters, who had long ago pledged themselves fully to the secrets of the Dark Side of the Force.\n\n# Artifacts and Rituals\nMuch of the strength that lay in the practice and innate ability of Sith magic were the rituals and incantations which made possible the powers used by its practicioners. Monuments and obelisks, amulets and talismans, and even entire moons have been erected, crafted, and repurposed by the Sith sorcerers through the ages in order to act as a lodestone and focal center for their power and necessary rituals. The Talisman of Muur, designed and crafted by Sorzus Syn for Lord Karness Muur held the ability to turn the minds of weaker beings into thralls of the amulet’s holder. The first of many Great Amulets, it is among the most well known artifacts of Sith magic and alchemical practice at their zenith and point of combination.\n\n# Temple on Yavin IV\nThe temple on Yavin IV was erected by Naga Sadow and his Massassi slaves to serve as a fortress and a centering point for the dark side energy by which he turned the Massassi into bestial slaves and predators. Here he encased himself in a sarcophagus and waited nearly 600 years for a  worthy dark side practitioner to awaken him and renew the legacy of the Sith. This power and longevity were the result of Sadow’s knowledge of Sith sorcery and alchemy, and served to illustrate the immense power of the dark side to Freedon Nadd, who awoke Sadow and slew him after learning all he could.\n\n","meta":{"index":3,"author":"Reavion","name":"Sith Magic & Alchemy","release_year":2021}},"Rite of Blood and Bone":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Rite of Blood and Bone was an ancient rite that was performed in the Sith Academy located on Korriban.

Finally, for the acolyte to complete the rite successfully, they would have to prove their worth by defeating the monster.# History\nThroughout history, several Dark Lords performed the ritual of blood and bone.

This scheme was created to eradicate the Jedi and the Galactic Republic from the galaxy so the Dark Side would govern it. The Grand Plan was successful after the Great Jedi Purge occurred as they left the galaxy with no members of the Jedi Order.# History\nFollowing the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, the recent Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Bane, thought about a new plan to take revenge against the Jedi Order for almost exterminating the Sith. This plan wouldn’t be executed instantly because the Sith were weak, and new technology was needed to reach his goal; eradicate the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic. Due to the Sith being only two because of Darth Bane’s Rule of Two, he and the next generation of Sith had to work in secret. \nThis plan was already in danger because a Sith known as Darth Gravid almost turned to the Light Side of the Force, but was stopped and killed by Darth Gean, his Sith Apprentice. As well, Darth Tenebrous’ Sith Master made the Jedi Order feel the Dark Side of the Force by opening a hole in the Force, letting them know the Sith were still alive.\n\nOne of the most important events from this plan was the ascent of the Sith Apprentice known as Darth Sidious to Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. This allowed the Sith to work on a political level in the order. In 22 BBY, the Clone Wars started with the Battle of Geonosis. The start of this war came along with great benefits for the Sith Empire, as many Jedi left their order because of a philosophical impact on them. This happened because instead of keeping the peace, they did the opposite. \nTwo years after the Battle of Geonosis, the Order 66 was executed by Darth Sidious. This protocol made the Clones turn against the Jedi Order because Darth Sidious activated their inhibitor chips. Along with this, the Supreme Chancellor known as Palpatine or Darth Sidious was going to get arrested by 4 Jedi Masters. These Jedi Masters went to his office, but all of them were killed by the Emperor. During this showdown, a Jedi Knight known as Anakin Skywalker turned to the Dark Side to become the Emperor’s Sith Apprentice, being named as Darth Vader. Darth Sidious then ordered Darth Vader to command the 501st legion in an attack on the Jedi Temple. Following this event, the Jedi were purged from the galaxy. What was remaining was conquering the Galactic Republic. In 19 BBY, Darth Sidious announced the New Order and declared himself the Galactic Emperor.

A notable achievement of the Sith Order, it was built on the sacrifice and labour of those who pushed themselves to their very being, carving into the rock and building the enclave in reverence of the Dark Lord. Their sacrifice would not go unseen, as for each life lost in the ongoing construction, a statue would be built and put up in their honour. With the architectural design overseen by Meka Odullu, a close advisor of Darth Validus, construction of the enclave would eventually be finished and go down in Sith history mainly labelled as 'The Great Creation'.\n\nIn the Dark Council chambers, there was a large and unique kyber crystal, corrupted by Darth Validus himself and maintained by his powerbase with a ritual in order to keep the presence of the dark side strong in Koratas and make it a Force nexus. The power the crystal had was so great that it stopped the moon from rotating around Dathomir despite being in its gravitational orbit, effectively suspending Koratas in space. Because it was suspended, Koratas was in a permanent state where only the area where the enclave was located had been given sunlight providing warmth and suitable living conditions, whilst the rest of the moon was suspended in intense cold and darkness. Sith who violated the doctrine and in some cases lost a kaggath were sent here to die a slow, cold, and painful demise. It was impossible to survive in its conditions, and the area eventually became named by the Sith as 'Qorit', or the end.\n\nThe Dark Lord's powerbase existed to empower him, with a large portion of his strength being sustained by the Hand and Will. Because Darth Bellicus and Darth Reavion stepped down at the same time, Darth Validus was in a state of weakness, and the stability of the large kyber crystal could no longer be properly preserved and Koratas was no longer suspended. However, all of the potential energy had been stored and the unnatural amount of such energy caused all of it to be released, making the moon move at such a speed that day and night had become a few minutes long with each full rotation moving the moon closer into Dathomir. All the Sith on Koratas were fully aware of the catastrophe that could ensue if the impending crash wasn't stopped or contained, but with the Dark Lord vulnerable and nobody strong or smart enough to prevent the disaster, Darth Validus used a last resort. He rallied the Sith Honor Guard, every available member. Using a special ritual involving Sith magic provided to him by the Sphere of Mysteries and Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, he took the life force from most members of the Honor Guard and the Force itself from the rest of Koratas.\n\nWith this new overwhelming and terrifying power, Darth Validus minimised the damages of what would have killed all the members of the Sith Order in a fatal crash, instead landing the structure in a fitting location.

It is unknown if he ever deceased or disappeared into the galaxy, but many believe him to have died with the Expansion and Diplomacy strike team he was assigned to during an Ossus invasion; however, countless Sith that served Darth Validus still claimed to see potential traces of the elegant being across the star systems.# Early Days\nWith an extreme sacrifice of both a Jedi Knight and a Jedi Master known as Tykaar and Mika who abandoned the Jedi Order to pursue their relationship, Meni was able to enter the world on the planet of Ach-to where he was born with a midichlorian count of 19,000 coursing through his veins. Despite the efforts of the former Jedi to live their lives in peace and keep their presences unknown, that all changed when the Sith Order conducted the attack on Ach-to that not only forced the Jedi Order to relocate but also deprived the planet of most of its features that made it habitable. With great valor, the Jedi Knight and Jedi Master fought to keep themselves and Meni alive by attempting to escape via a stolen Sith shuttle; though they were left with no choice but to toss the baby Meni into an escape pod before their ship met destruction. The escape pod set on a course to the planet Dathomir, where a Sith Enclave resided. Upon crashing into the dismal and red terrain of Dathomir, the Sith Order's members discovered Meni and they would forcefully abduct him into the Sith Order where he would presumably spend the rest of his life.\n\n# Sith Order\nYears would go by, transforming Meni into a full-fledged and official Sith of the Order after completing his journey in the academy as well as the Trials of the Sith. Meni made himself acquainted with the Sphere of Sith Philosophy due to his interest in wanting to promote change and betterment for the Sith Order through academics. With his interest realized, the Sith Overlord Darth Praefectus would admit Meni into the sphere where the two shared a mutual bond and vision for the future of the Sith Order. Despite growing into an academic teacher, Meni was able to become an elegant, powerful, and formidable Sith - one of the Order's best both through lightsaber combat and the Force. He would maintain his status while also earning himself a reputation through his teaching method in which he enjoyed a laid-back, yet serious and straightforward style of instruction that carried for generations of Sith. With such a reputation, Meni was able to ascend into the hierarchy of the Sith Order rather quickly moving from the Assembly of Overseers up to the rank of Sith Lord where he entered the Inner Circle of Darth Praefectus.\n\n# A Presumed Demise\nMeni's time as a Sith Lord was deemed to be his greatest era of success and glory as he led various defenses against the Jedi Order who sought justice upon the Sith that destroyed their former temple; however, this success was short-lived after the Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy conducted an invasion of the new Jedi Library on Ossus hoping to pirate and even destroy the archives so that the Jedi tradition would come to a halt. Meni met his presumed end when he was assigned to the second strike team and vanished. The Sith Juggernauts discovered their strike team deceased but never found the body of Meni and presumed he met his demise. An abundance of Sith weren't happy hearing the news that Meni had seemingly died on Ossus, some even denying it themselves and spending their time to locate any potential traces. The Dark Council was heavily displeased, especially Darth Praefectus who had hoped Meni would live out the rest of his vision. Following decades of searches, individuals only discovered very doubtful leads to the disappearance of Meni, some even raising suspicion that Darth Zinwrath, the former Overlord of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy to be connected to the entire mystery.\n\n","meta":{"index":7,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Meni's Tale","release_year":2023}},"A Duel of Fate":{"content":"# Entry 1\nIt was a day unlike any I had experienced prior… the air was thick, and… miasmic, as I emerged from the mighty doors of the Temple, that... Smell, it hit me once more. I covered my nose with the dorsal of my hand and peered through the mist.\n\nIt was Kel Routila, my long-time rival. His aura was almost overpowering. Routila seemed almost pleased with himself, his ancient frame was not how you would ordinarily picture a man of his age, he was colossal. This was the first time in a while I had truly feared for my safety.\n\nThe bodies of my fellow Sith littered the catwalk. \n\nI glared directly into the source of this primordial being, My body was twitching and I was suddenly engulfed in fury… pure fury.  \n\nI signalled for the Honour Guard, although their face was covered I could feel the dread emanating from their helmets. The ground shook, they had begun to approach… that... Monster. Almost as if rehearsed, Routila sliced through the Guardsman with ease. \n\nIt was as if my body was no longer my own, \n“What is it that makes you so hard to destroy, old man?” I exclaimed.\n My hand swiftly moved to the hilt of my Lightsaber. \nI sauntered towards him.\n\n“You have lived your life in that cave, surrounded by those who look to you for guidance… Are you going to die in a place where you are despised, Jedi?” \nmy voice bellowed through the landscape, Routila’s expression changed.\n\nI had never detested an individual the way I did Kel. Countless duels ended in a stalemate, and many of our companions were murdered, despite all this, I looked forward to when we would next clash. Although, at this point, my veneration for this ‘Master of the Jedi’ had been subdued and devoured by my wrath.\n\n\n“Someone is.” \nRoutila spoke with a tone of sadness\n\nRoutila ignited his Lightsaber, \n“That old thing still works, really, Kel?” I laughed to myself \nThis had given Kel time to dart up the staircase and into his stance. \nI wasted no time, I unleashed a flurry of attacks on him, and the noise of the clashing rumbled throughout Dathomir. It was like Yin and Yang, perfectly mirroring each other's attacks. I began to fill up with excitement, \n“What is this I'm feeling?”\nThis feeling was alien to me, I felt conflicted. Part of me wanted to tear Routila to smithereens but part of me wanted this to never end.\n\nI began to pick up speed, each attack heavier than the other, faster than before... But it was met with an evenly matched block or perfectly timed parry. As we progressed through the courtyard, the pillars would fall due to a misplaced attack by one or a perfect reflection of the other. Growing tired of this, I used the power of the force to raise part of a pillar and drill it into Routila with zero remorse. Routila had been knocked from the platform onto the desolate planes of Dathomir.\n\nI didn’t want to waste this opportunity, this was a chance for me to end everything. I flipped off of the platform, my arm positioned behind me in hopes to plunge my blade through his chest. Kel snapped back into reality, he had recalled his Lightsaber and with pinpoint timing, he deflected my attack and kicked me over him.\n\n“How could you miss, that was the perfect opportunity and you failed. You call yourself a Master of the Darkside?”\nThe voice inside of my head was harsh, it had no remorse. It fueled my hatred for Kel more than any person should experience. I grew stronger, I broke my chains right there, at that moment.\n\nKel and I had trouble standing upright as we fought on the hillside of the lifeless pond. Our blades clashed, each attack more ferocious than the previous. I was the predator and Kel was my prey. After a well-timed parry, I kicked him into the pond below.\n\nAs Kel emerged from the other side of the pond he was greeted by my Lightsaber crashing down onto him, he quickly reacted and collided with me, putting us both in a deadlock position. I was furious, how could an old man like this be so equal to me? \n\nKel glared down at me, his determined gaze carried the hope of a thousand Jedi,\n“I will not let any more minds be corrupted by evil!” he proclaimed. \n\n\n“You call yourself righteous, Jedi! You are vermin, and like any vermin, I will be your exterminator” \nMy voice bellowed out across the barren land, waking up any fauna that has somehow survived this planet.\nI stabbed and prodded at Kel’s defence, trying to find any weakness I could,\nThe fight grew longer, and the distance between us and the temple grew further.\n\nKel suddenly retaliated, he had been waiting for this moment to strike, almost as if he had adapted the technique of a mantis. I had to think fast, the attack was coming for my throat and fast, his colossal arms bearing power I had never experienced before. In a desperate attempt to save my own life I raised my blade once more and guided his attack into the mighty wooden beam behind me.","meta":{"index":8,"author":"LuciferTemenos","name":"A Duel of Fate","release_year":2022}},"Legends of the Loremaster: Secrets of the Shadows":{"content":"# Overview:\nTo serve the Dark Lord of the Sith is to be a tool. A tool of his passion, a tool of his strength, and a tool of his will. None understands this more than his loyal Dark Honour Guard, powerful servants clad in fashionable and sturdy red armour resembling the same colour that most sentient beings bleed. When they kill, they kill in his name. When they conquer, they do so in reverence of the Dark Lord and his ambitions. Guardsmen of the Dark Honour Guard put their superiors first, their ambitions second, and their lives third. They train their bodies to withstand strikes from even the deadliest blaster bolts and perfect their martial skills with the lightsaber pike, a weapon of range that demands mastery and precision.\n\nSome found clarity within serving the Guard by being held to high standards and being respected by even Dark Councilors, but one cared not for the recognition nor the glory, simply grateful for his life and his given purpose. He served as a Guardsman for some time, obeying the commands of the officers and showing no concept of mercy to people he would once think of as allies. He was unfamiliar with the traditions and conformities of the Order he found himself sewn to by the strings of fate, and he desired to turn the unknown into known. He spent what spare time he had studying texts found in the archives of the Enclave, finding himself immersed in the lore and philosophy of the Sith. From ancient savages pitting war against each other to armies of considerable power that conquered for the sake of it, waging war against the rest of the galaxy. The new ideas and old philosophies of the past were something the Guardsman realised he found more answers in rather than the mysterious, vague teachings of peacekeepers that whispered of hope. What good was hope if it was misplaced? What good is peace if it brings complacency?\n\nThe Guardsman had more questions than answers dwelling within his mind, he possessed the curiosity of a child regarding the history of the Sith. It interested him, the traditions of several millennia ago remained resilient in the modern Order, the preservation of such knowledge was astounding. More notably, the people who maintained such wisdom were mostly Sith that kept to themselves, a curious set of traits in a society based around boasting strength and putting power above all else. The strict lifestyle of the Guard was wearing him out, as great of a meaning it gave him, learning about Spheres gave the Guardsman more insight into the Sith and how every gear intertwined with another. Anything rusted or malfunctional was thrown out and replaced. It made him realise there were more uses for his skills and passion other than escorting people capable of defending themselves.\nIt was a known fact within the Dark Honour Guard that those who wanted to discharge from it were allowed to if they had served enough time, but kidnapped former Jedi didn’t exactly have as much of a luxury to have it so simple for them. It was still worth the try, in order to further a journey to satiate a new hunger for knowledge, to delve further into the secrets of the Sith. A few days and a completed assignment later, the Guardsman spoke to his superior and mentor, Captain Astaroth.\n\n“Considering your rank and how long you served, you are eligible for a discharge, but there's no telling whether you’ll defect back to the Jedi or not.”\n\n“I don’t plan to, nor do I want to. I have an ambition in the Sith, but it’s not with the Guard.”\n\n“... You will be discharged and become a Sith Knight for your service, but any notice of you defecting to the Jedi or performing acts of treason will have you executed. Dismissed.”\n\nIf he was lying, Astaroth would have known. The latter was excellent at sensing falsities from speech, and not one lie was detected. The Guardsman was either a good liar, or speaking the truth, and it was known to the Captain that deception wasn’t exactly a strong suit of the Guardsman. The unceremoniously knighted man emerged from the quarters of the Dark Honour Guard, no armour on him. Simply the everyday attire of a Sith Knight. Each step along the stone path of the temple made a presence known, the distant chatter of people were apparent and the presence of the dark side something the Knight was accustomed to. He approached a certain section of the temple, where artefacts were on display and holo-texts were available. People who chose to dress in ornate robes and wear metal visages walked around the Sith archives, where all information that was recorded was on public display. This was what he desired. To contribute to an eternal cause, to be a name in a never-ending scroll of benefactors. What kind of journey he’d have along the way, that was his fate to follow. The Knight approached a man who simply exuded wisdom, power, and leadership quality. He briefly explained what he wanted, and what his true purposes were.\n\n“I see… I like that. Our Sphere is a small one, but those with ambitions like you are needed. I welcome you into the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge. I’m the 3rd Keeper of Records and the current protector of these archives, Darth Invictus. You are now part of the group of people who preserve our history, our traditions, and our secrets.”","meta":{"index":1,"author":"Daedima","name":"Legends of the Loremaster: Secrets of the Shadows","release_year":2022}},"Tales of Scrawl: Homeland":{"content":"# Article\nScrawl's body was built exactly how a humanoid alligator would look: scales, an elongated snout, but his eyes were unlike any other Kuvok, His eyes were a bright orange while most of Kuvoks eyes were either green, blue, or even sometimes both.  He wore a brown tattered cloak with steel armor underneath it.\n   \nIt was raining, the cold rain dropped on Scrawl's snout as he stared into the clouds. He had always admired rain, it reminded him that life wasn't so repetitive, it isn't so….. Dull. Hunting day was always his favorite day. Kuvoks only hunted on days with rain out of tradition from when the first recorded kill on planet Antro was made on a day of rain. Though they did not happen often they would hunt for the whole day never stopping till the rain had come to a halt. Scrawl gathered with his hunting squad and began. Unlike any other kuvoks Scrawl was cunning; he would lay out traps for the animals of Antro and lure them in with the animal's primary diet, unlike the others that just tracked and killed. He also would hide out in the trees waiting for the animals to come to him so he could save energy for when he needed to chase an animal. At the end of hunting day, Scrawl goes around everywhere and collects all the animals that were hung in traps or in spiked holes that he had dug. Once all the harvesting was done he would take the animals back to his mud hut for harvesting. First, he would skin the creatures and hang them up so they could be used later for any clothing repair or weaponry he would use to fix. The meat would be stored in a preserving bin. This meat would usually last him a couple of weeks. He would sort the organs into vases and line them up in the preserving bin. His favorite organ, the lungs, would be kept on top of a pedestal in a black pottery jar.\n\nAfter hunting day, Scrawl would often return to his job as a constructor. day in and day out he would collect and create mud bricks to build huts for future Kuvoks. They did have large births after all. One day when Scrawl was gathering mud to get bricks for a family of 12 he found a droid well what was left of one. He looked around to see if it belonged to anybody or maybe if anybody wanted it. Kuvoks were very old school so they weren't a fan of droids, ships, or any other technological advances. When he brought them to their doors they were quick to say no and shut their straw doors. With no other options he brought the droid back to his place and decided to fix it up, he thought maybe it could help me with collecting bricks. He grabbed some tools he found while collecting mud in the past and quickly got to work. While working through the chest cavity, he saw a red glow coming out of the seam of the chest door. He took a rusted crowbar and tried to pry the door open but couldn't. Whatever this droid was made of was a tough material. Scrawl came up with a plan to heat up the droid's metal so it could make the metal more flexible.\n\nTo heat up the metal he would need a very large heat source, thankfully Antro was known for having the largest volcano in the Korvec Sector. He grabbed a pickaxe and headed toward the volcano. While he was there his was on his way to the volcano he met a young girl Kuvok in the deepest part of the jungle her name was Stup she was also on her way to the volcano for a tourist kind of thing as they were exchanging pleasantries they decided to head to the volcano together after all it is very dangerous in this part of the swamp. It was home to the leviathan, a great huge creature with scales and skin more tough than the strongest of metals on Antro. When they reached the volcano Scrawl and Stup started hacking at the middle of the volcano so they could slowly reel the droid into the lava to melt the chest cavity. When they came through the other side the heat was intense so they wanted to get in and out ASAP. he lowered it down into the lava with a rope Stup conveniently had tied around her waist. After keeping the droid hung for about two minutes and bringing it back up, the steel still hadn't melted. Scrawl was astonished this was surely a powerful material. He thought maybe if he could find the source of this material he could use it to make weapons for his tribe it would make hunting much more efficient. They decided to lower it further to get more heat. That's when he felt a huge tug on the rope and started to get pulled by the powerful creature pulling on the droid. The creature arose from the volcano with hunger in its eyes. It was the leviathan. The creature lunged at them with so much force that the sound rippled in the air and the roar could be heard around the entire planet. Scrawl covered Stup and put his hand up in defense. To Scrawl's surprise, the leviathan was… frozen in place. Like some kind of Force was keeping it from moving. Scrawl was intrigued, he wondered did he do this? Was he the reason it stopped? He forcefully shoved out his hand and it pushed the beast back for miles so far that it was out of sight.\n\nThey went back to the center of the volcano and continued to lower it further. Even after dipping it in the smoldering magma, the metal would not bend. Then Scrawl came up with a plan. The beast's scales are the toughest and strongest substance on this planet. If he could go find it and bring it back he could maybe slice into the droid's chest cavity. He left in the direction of where he had thrown the leviathan thankfully it left a trail of broken trees and a huge trench. On his way, his head was full of questions of how he was able to throw the leviathan such a distance. Could he do it again? What else could he do? These questions clouded his mind and before he knew it he was almost at his destination. He heard the moans of the monster he followed the noise and the leviathan was pierced by a spike from a mountain he had crashed into. One of the scales lay on top of the blood-filled water. He grabbed it and put it in his satchel and started to walk off but before he left he thought about giving the creature some mercy and ending its life. He thought about it and decided to leave it to its suffering after all it had caused so much pain and agony to this planet it doesn't deserve peace. He was following the track back to the volcano when he came across a hut he went inside out of curiosity and found an old Kuvok sitting in the middle of the mud hut. She claimed that she was an oracle and she was expecting him. Scrawl took this as a scam after all he didn't believe in oracles or fate. She told him if he were to continue the path he is currently on he would suffer for it. A life full of hatred, grief, and agony would await him. He brushed it off and told the oracle that it was a hoax and stormed out of the mud hut. \n\nHe arrived at the volcano again and Stup was asleep next to the droid. He woke her up for help holding the droid still just in case it rolled and he broke the object inside. He grabbed the scale from his satchel and stabbed the droid into the chest cavity and sliced down the middle he then cut out a square. The object inside was some sort of red crystal. Its glow was immense. He put it in his satchel and Stup and Scrawl split ways. He returned home and put his satchel to the side on his makeshift desk and laid on his thatch bed and went to sleep and tomorrow he would further test his powers and study this crystal.","meta":{"index":10,"author":"Long_Guy27","name":"Tales of Scrawl: Homeland","release_year":2022}},"Legends of the Loremaster: Path of Blood":{"content":"# Overview:\nThree hours and still no indication of any actual people, the hopes of finding the origin of the distress call for help were diminishing. The Jedi Knight was the closest to the Yavin system which was why he had received the emergency signal coming from Yavin 4, which he promptly confirmed and set for the general coordinates. He was a human with black, wavy hair and a curiosity about his place in the galaxy, particularly on how important he was in the big picture. He was taught to be compassionate and to never turn down an opportunity to help. The Knight exhaled a heavy sigh, his faith was draining by the minute; with every place, he ended up being filled with the purple-barked trees that the moon’s dense forests were known for. The whole moon was chock full of flourishing life and swamps. He carefully clutched onto his lightsaber and tread his path, his consciousness reminding him constantly to trust in the Force. It would guide him, it would reveal the path, no matter how much he struggled. He forced the mantra to repeat itself in his mind as he continued his increasingly futile search.\n\nThe Knight heard a flock of yelping reptile-birds fly from a direction that could only mean danger, but it was the only hint he had been given since he wandered across the planet. He still clung onto what little hope he had, and it would turn out to be a mistake that drove him in another direction. In the belief that he would fulfil his obligation to help those that needed it, the Knight made a life-altering decision. He approached the noise of two plasma-based weapons clashing against one another; the familiar sounds of a lightsaber, yet a distinct roar that a tool of peace could never make. It was in an instant that the Knight’s instinct to escape had alerted him, but he was too late. The last thing the Knight had seen before he was rendered unconscious was an armoured figure of renown and elite training, a Dark Honour Guardsman.\n\nThe smell of the room was dank and wet, the faint sounds of rodent-like creatures squeaked and scurried around. The Knight was no longer in the wild terrain of Yavin 4, this was a space in an unfamiliar building. His memory was recollecting, but it was slow, and he was even slower to notice that he was bound with chains to the ground of a small cell of stone and moss with a force field barrier that ensured him captured. His lightsaber was nowhere to be seen, and the robes he proudly wore as a Jedi were replaced by simpler rags. It wasn’t just the smell of the room that sickened him, he could feel the dark side permeating the very air, he deduced he was in the vicinity of a dark side nexus. Simply sitting in the prison cell made him want to vomit, his mind in a state of confusion and severe unrest. Being there was wrong.\n\n“Jedi. Under normal circumstances, you would have been executed. However, we have other plans for you.”\n\nA deep voice boomed, and the Knight’s eyes averted from staring at the ground up to the plasma wall that separated him from freedom. A black-haired man with a middle part haircut and a beard was standing beyond the door, he was the one speaking. He wore the armour of the Dark Honour Guard, with two other Guardsmen accompanying him. If this didn’t scream importance, nothing did.\n\n“I am Commander Arcanum, and you have two options. Either die here a man devout to weak ideals or join the Dark Honour Guard and serve a higher purpose. Live a life of meaning.”\n\nHis tone was cold, he had an aura of precise calculation and planning. Everything he said seemed to be careful and deliberate. The door was deactivated and the Commander approached, looking down at the Knight. He pulled out a lightsaber, the one the Knight was found with and activated it. The green blade illuminated the dark room, its light shining like a beacon of hope. As much of a symbol of hope as it was, it was still a weapon that cut through flesh like nothing. The Knight looked up at the Commander, still deciding before he opened his mouth to speak.\n\n“I want to live.”\n\nThe Commander showed a small grin, deactivating the lightsaber and crushing it with his fist. The components of the lightsaber, now broken and cracked, were dropped onto the floor. The green kyber crystal dropped onto the floor, it's light fainter than before. It was suffocating in the presence of the dark side. The Commander dusted his gloved hands and glanced at the Dark Honour Guardsman to his right before looking back down at the Knight.\n\n“Your training won’t be simple, there’s a good chance you’ll die. It won’t be easy. But, I think you have what it takes to survive. You’ll be under the tutelage of Captain Astaroth. Goodbye, Initiate.”\n\nAll endings lead to a beginning, a never-ending cycle of destruction to creation. While a Jedi Knight died on Yavin 4 with doubt and fear, a new member of the Dark Honour Guard emerged from the smoke of the past.","meta":{"index":3,"author":"Daedima","name":"Legends of the Loremaster: Path of Blood","release_year":2022}},"He Who Shattered The Silence":{"content":"# Preface\nA prestigious, respected and loved Commandant of the Temple Guard\n whose dedication is so profound that many Jedi could do nothing but dream\nto one day come anywhere close to the resolve he carried within his soul. \nOne whose love is so great, only love itself could ever make his will waver.\nOne willing to sacrifice anything that he’s able to claim to be his, \njust for those around him.

While giving a gaze into the Dark Lord’s temple guard past. Guaranteed to reserve bloodshed, heartbreak, \ngrief, abandonment, suspense and much more to those who find \nthe guts to read it whole, from start… to finish.# Submission:\nThe silence was deafening. Omega was standing atop a sandy hill, outlooking the Sith Enclave entrance. The air was heavy, not solely due to the hostile and tenebrous atmosphere of the planet, but from the weight of the circumstances that mission had brought upon him. His second hand, his brother within the Force, the one he trusted the most in the Temple Guard had disappeared with no trace.\nHe was perfectly aware of the risks his mission carried; rarely do Temple Guards venture outside the subject of their guard itself. Despite being an unshakable man, the thought alone of what could be happening back on Ossus while his entire force was outside was making him tightly clutch his gold-embellished lightsaber hilt in concern. As if hundreds of voices were crying out in his own skull to turn back, each yell echoing back in his cranium, amplifying with feedback. And yet one question in his head remained; \nWhere had his Captain… Vermened, disappeared to? \n«Commandant…» His thoughts were interrupted by a familiar voice. The newly nominated captain Theorem, while skilled, was the walking and breathing reminder to Omega that his own chosen was gone. He reluctantly turned around to face him. \n«Captain…» - he spoke slowly but decisively - «This is it. Once we enter the enclave, we are not coming out if not with Vermened.» The rest of the guard was looking directly at him, rallied in two rows, with Theorem standing at the front. The force comprised a total of twenty-six men, new Guardsmen and Veterans alike, all motivated by one objective. \nOmega faced his men, observing them with almost pitiful eyes under his timeworn mask. «I know that when I informed you that I would come here to look for your Captain, you all offered me your sabers and your lives. I appreciate your righteousness, but this is my battle to take. Do you all truly wish to continue?»\nThe Guards did not flinch an inch. \n\n\n\nTheorem was the first to break eye contact, to suddenly turn away; To look onto his fellow guards as well. «Has fear obstructed your ears? Let us answer; are we going to abandon our brother on this bulwark of corruption, greed and darkness?»\nA deafening “NO!” was answered in unison by all of them. \nEnergetically, he continued; «Are we all going to struggle until we leave victorious, or fall trying?»\nThe men nodded their heads. Theorem then turned back, looking at his Commandant, before speaking with a tone of almost exasperation: «You have heard every single one of us, what more evidence do you need?» before elegantly unsheathing his lightsaber hilt, with rays shimmering on its golden details, as if the air itself around them all was leaking full of resolve. «We will let the Guard be complete again.»\nSpeechless for a fleeting second, Omega then nodded back. «In that case, may the Force be with us.»\nAnd as soon as he completed that sentence, he slid down that brief hill overlooking the capital of Evil, the Babylon of the Jedi; Dathomir’s Sith Enclave. They confidently marched toward the entrance, hoping their numbers would be enough to negotiate any information. \n\n\n\nAs they neared the entrance, they noticed an odd lack of Sith presence that gloomy morning. An ongoing ritual of some sort, perhaps? After all, the Dark Lord, known as Fedlz, had been missing for a few weeks as well. None of the Jedi recons could gather and report enough information on the matter, as they all met their fate before the chance to return. They all formed one long column, about four feet of distance from each other, rhythmically marching together. They walked through the arch of the entrance, before coming to the middle intersection. Step after step. They found the Dark Council’s door wide open; just what was going on that day? \nThey stepped in, Guard after Guard after Guard. As soon as the last one put his foot through the entrance to the room, the bright red holodoor would flash into existence, closing them in. «BOX!» As soon as those words came out of Omega’s mouth, the men rearranged in a square, igniting their lightsabers, the amber lighting coming from their blades being the only opposition to the overwhelming darkness of that room. \nNone of them dared to utter a word, as it was their tradition not to\n\n\n\n\ncommunicate with the enemy unless absolutely necessary. \nThat’s when a maniacal, heart-wrenching laughter came from the darkness of that cubicle. \n«You never were a man of words, Commandant!» \nThat’s when his blade ignited, the only issue being that it had done so while already traveling through the air. When they had realized, there it was; the head of a Guardsman fell to the ground, cut from his soldiers, as the rest of the body delayedly collapsed to the ground with a silent ompf. \nAnd then there were twenty-five. \nThe lightsaber then returned in its owner’s hand, its sinister red lighting revealing the face of its user. He seemed to be an oddly composed, yet clearly corrupted and consumed by the Dark Side individual. His stare was maniacal, but his posture gentle. His face appeared clever and belonging to an individual of light, yet there laid the lifeless head of a Jedi… because of him. «Where are my manners? That’d be… Darth Notom, to you.» The Guards were trying to hold their composure, almost forced to hear that man’s speech, as focusing on the question at hand and on the likelihood of their death could’ve been enough to cause their immediate flight.\n\n\n\n\nSo they simply stared back, their contempt for that murderer deeply hidden within their hearts. \n«Seems like you’ve not been updated, have you? A few things have been happening to the order… in the past few months.»\nSuddenly, another red lightsaber would light up in the dark, before doing so again on its opposite end. A double lightsaber… unusual, but not too uncommon. The Guards looked at each other confused. \nThen, another, slightly around the first. and another. and another.\nThey were now encircled by a circumference of Sith Honor Guardsmen, all seamlessly moving in an unnervingly perfect symphony of death. The Guards had not seen those individuals before; their blades were similar, but their entire appearance was different. Their masks were pointed and of a lucid - almost feeling unreal - bright red armor. Their eyes had a black opening, but unlike the Temple Guard’s masks, theirs were… lifeless. Completely obedient. Flawless. Breaking from the pressure, one of the Temple’s Guardsmen thrust his blade forward against one of his encirclers. The blade’s point would easily pierce \n\n\n\nright through the soldier’s torso, as the red guard fell dead in utter silence. The others did nothing but stare. \nThen, like a flash, it happened. The closest one dashed forward, holding up his blade, cutting off the Temple Guard’s arm in a single swift movement, as he briefly held his cauterized stump in disbelief. Two others charged towards him like rabid animals, before beginning to sink their lightsabers into the Temple Guardsman’s back, over and over again, until his torso had enough holes it could barely be called one. A gruesome and agonizing death. \nAnd then there were twenty-four. \n«Like them? Let’s say they’re a bit of a new addition, the new Dark Lord wanted to have them this way.» Notom continued. \nWas that their fate? Were the prestigious Temple Guard simply going to be slain like cattle, harvested like grain in summer? No, they had not come there to die. \n«Leader of the Sith.» interrupted Theorem, much to Notom’s disdain who looked at him with a grimace. «We have come here to be returned Captain Vermened. Do so and you won’t be annihilated.» Notom then stepped forward, holding his single hilt in front of him in an elegant opening of the Second Form, before flourishing it. «Make my day.» And then all hell broke loose. The Temple Guard focused on fighting their \n\n\n\nmindless counterparts, while trying to resist Notom’s vigorous throws and attacks. \nOmega lunged forward, delivering a seamless fatal hit to a nearby Sith Guard. Sparks from every direction caused from the clashing blades lit up that theater of war. Guardsmen killed and fell, in a clashing of gold and ruby within that bloody amphitheater. \nAnd then there were fifteen. The Templar’s movements were swift and agile, the Honormen’s were calculated and lethal. Men fell left and right, when suddenly Omega freed himself to flip into a hit towards Darth Notom…\nBut he was ready; and quickly pushed him away through his Force, with his hilt flying out of his hand and falling onto the ground, the chromium falling and making noise. «Nice try, but I believe it’s time to retire you. I’d like to make someone spectate your demise!»\nAnd in a corner, there he was. Vermened himself was sitting, bound to one of the thrones. Had he always been there and they never noticed? The sight of his own captain shot millions of thoughts rushing through his head, to the point he almost forgot that Notom was approaching to strike him down. The noise of fighting nearby him \n\n\n\nsuddenly felt so distant, as his surroundings felt more and more fuzzy. Guardsmen of both sides fell left and right. Notom raised his blade above his head, as Omega’s last thoughts were confused and fearful…\n«NO!» Theorem emerged from the crowd, holding his blade lowly. And like a flash, Notom’s upper half was separated from his lower, as they both fell lifeless to the ground. Hearing him not speak anymore was almost eerie, as if he would start talking with that same maniacal tone at any second.  \nThe fighting slowly died down, as the last of the red guardsmen fell. Unfortunately, the victory came at its cost. Omega counted the Temple Guards that remained. Seven, eight…\nNine. And then there were only nine.\nHis other seven guardsmen gathered around Vermened, many barely believing it was himself, still alive. He appeared to be bound to an ancient sith mechanism, with some odd inscriptions. As one of the guardsmen approached to free him, the contraptions opened up themselves. Vermened was now free, as he slowly began to open his eyes. He… accomplished his objective. So why did something within Omega’s heart tell \n\n\n\nhim something was very wrong? But Theorem didn’t feel that. «CAPTAIN! We must leave immediately!» As he clutched his hand and tried to pull him away. That is when Vermened stared back at him; yellow-contourned piercing eyes, within a consumed and pale face. And as soon as he understood, Vermened’s blade ignited and pierced through his midsection. «Brother…» he panted out frantically, as he, too, fell. \nAnd then there were eight. \nVermened then quietly stood up, and looked at the Guardsmen, before stopping his gaze at Omega. Without a word, he immediately began to choke through his newfound powers all seven remaining guardsmen of Omega, as he was powerlessly on the ground. His hilt was on the other side of the room, and all he could do was watch. Vermened stared back at him, before holding back his blade, and sinking it into the first guardsman. \nSeven.\nThe second…\nSix.\nFive.\n«Vermened… Please…»\nHe decapitated another, and disemboweled another with his blade. \n\n\n\nFour.\n«Stop…»\nThree. \n«CAPTAIN!» A cold, hopeless scream breaking that silence.\nTwo.  \nAnd so the last temple guard fell, his body limping on the floor of that room. \nAnd then there was One.    \nOmega could do nothing more than stare back at what once was his trusted man. In a fit of rage, he called back upon his lightsaber. \n«YOU!»\nHe held it up, and prepared to strike…\nBefore his hit stopped midair. \n\nThere was no magic, no force. He just couldn’t.\nHe truly just couldn’t. \nOmega desperately fell to his knees, his mask tainted with the blood of those who fell trying to follow him. \n«Commandant.»\nOmega looked up to Vermened… clearly, the new Dark Lord.\n«It seems you have unfortunately caused the death of one of the men empowering me.»\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was he even talking about? Omega had no idea, but he couldn’t even bring himself to question what was happening. \n«And yet, you are strong. Could be so much stronger, if only you understood the potential of your inner darkness.»\nOmega had no words left to say. \nVermened just looked around him, observing the bloody disaster created by his past Powerbase and the Guardsmen he was guiding with his mind. The absolute havoc caused pleased him greatly. He then rested his hand upon Omega’s shoulder, before almost imperceptibly moving it up to remove his blood-tinted temple guard mask. «From now on, you shall be known… As Darth Havok.»\n\n\n\n«The Will of the Dark Lord.»\n\n\n\n\nAnd then there were none.\n\n","meta":{"index":6,"author":"Remalior","name":"He Who Shattered The Silence","release_year":2023}},"A Grand Disclosure":{"content":"# Article\nA mysterious force plane, one that many advised against entering due to its dangerous complications; detachment of one’s mind from their physical body. The Sith Lord felt that time was absent, as if every moment lasted for eternity. There was no future, no past, and each action was characterized by its lack of history. Moving forward, the Lord traverses the thick fog, eventually hearing footsteps that didn’t come from himself.\n\nBeyond the fog, his sight meets a dark figure. The individual represents a humanoid but his entire body head-to-toe, is still shadowed; nothing but darkness.\n\nThe figure speaks,\n\n“I’ve been here for longer than I can remember. You came for the same reason I did generations ago, you seek to abolish the new generation of the Sith and return to the traditional methods used by ancient Sith.”\n\nThe entity takes a few steps, practically circling the Sith Lord as he continues to speak,\n\n“I can show you the landscape you may be attempting to discover–it’s a…. Series of tombs shrouded by the Dark Side, fueled by its force vergences and whatnot.”\n\nThe Sith Lord responds as his eyes follow the figure,\n\n“If you know of this place, why didn’t you go there yourself?”\n\nThe figure halts his movement swiftly,\n\n“I’m sure you’re aware of the dangers that come with being in this realm, you see, I’ve been trapped here for generations. My original body has been long-deceased. For eons, I laid dormant, a new set of tombs awaiting discovery for the benefit of the Sith just outside my reach.”\n\nHe continues speaking with a passive-aggressive tone, indicating his frustrations at being within Beyond Shadows for what seemed like an eternity until now,\n“I’ll reveal the path to get there, but I can’t do it alone as we both must use the full extent of our midichlorians to sense the vergence and determine where it resides within the galaxy, that will lead us to the planet.”\n\nThe Sith Lord gives a nod,\n\n“Very well, I believe I can make a Holocron out of this so let’s speed up this process. I’m not looking to stay here for as long as you have.”\n\nThe Lord turns to face the entity, the entity turns to the Lord, and both individuals enter a meditation. By merely placing their hands on their temples, both begin to enter an intense focus as the fog grows thicker as their powers merge, and with that, the eyes close. Their minds become connected, detached from their respective bodies to form an essence of the Force that floats above them. \n\nA series of visions of various locations in the galaxy are observed, they come and go–Dathomir, Ossus, the Sanctum, Ilum, Korriban. The final vision becomes a blur as all that can be seen is–\n\n“Valleys and mountains, a barren frozen landscape.”\n\nBoth bodies chant at the same time.\n\n“Barrens, given light by a green spectacle.” \n\n“A Sith World, forgotten after the control of pureblood Sith.”\n\n“A Sith world, corrupted by the Dark Side.”\n\nOnly one voice can be heard now as the chant continues,\n\n“It can only be found in the Esstran Sector–it resides within the Sith Worlds.”\n\nThe essence leaves its position, it is slowly coaxed to the body of the entity.\n\nFrom there, only one long, horrific, and chilling scream can be heard.\n\nHe opens his eyes, and the first thing that meets his gaze is a Holocron. With a glance, it is revealed that he is in a private meditation chamber. Upon observing his appearance, the Dark Side begins to corrupt his body. In a matter of seconds, the strands have left the body–the human characterizations removed entirely.

Ignis was a human male Sith who was on his way to the Temple on Dathomir to learn the ways of the Dark Side. Jinqxd (later known as Ignis) first learned of his abilities a year before, when he went hunting in the dark forests of his home planet, Alderaan. He lost his temper and accidentally unleashed a powerful and unexpected blast of fiery energy that erupted from his palm. All the life near the explosion was engulfed by the powerful blue energy, killing all life forms that it struck. Shocked, Jinqxd had no choice but to run home and avoid being seen in the forest. He returned home safely and unseen, or so he thought. A Sith Lord had witnessed Jinqxd’s power and studied him for the next few months. This Sith Lord was known as Darth Xenion and would soon become Jinqxd’s Master. Xenion took Jinqxd into his care and trained him in the Dark Side of the Force. Jinqxd was then reborn as Ignis of the Sith Order,  but there was only so much Xenion could teach Ignis. Xenion wasn’t very powerful in Sith Sorcery and Alchemy, his talents lay in other places. This made it quite tough for Xenion to teach Ignis, so Ignis joined the Sith Academy in hopes of learning more about Sorcery. Xenion decided to take Ignis to the newly built Sith Temple on Dathomir, a planet that wasn’t as strong in the Dark Side as Korriban, but strong enough. They boarded Xenion’s Fury-Class Interceptor and headed to Dathomir.\n\nEventually, Ignis and Xenion landed on Dathomir where Ignis felt the strong sensation of Dark Side energy that flowed through him like a river, cold and powerful. It truly made him more alive and much more eager. He saw the magnificent structure of the new Temple on Dathomir in absolute astonishment, never had he seen a building more sophisticated and shady. It was beautiful. He entered the Temple and the Force was even stronger, how was this possible? All the Sith were emanating their Dark Side abilities. Now, Ignis was waiting in the combat pit, terrified and eager for his first Sith training, his Rite of Passage. “Acolytes of the Dark Side.” the Teacher said. “You have all been selected to train in the prestigious Sith Academy on Dathomir. The first topic you will go over during your time here is combat.” the teacher stated. “Now, I want all of you to take out your vibroblades and follow my instructions carefully. Duel the person next to you in a fight to the death.”. This caught Ignis completely by surprise, his first day at the Academy and they already want him to fight to the death. The Twi’lek next to Ignis launched at him leaving Ignis barely enough time to parry the hit. Their blades clashed in whirlwind motion, the flashing of the blades was almost as fast as light itself, deflecting, striking, and parrying. Eventually, Ignis’ opponent made a fatal mistake that would cost him his life. The Twi’lek attempted to change fight styles giving Ignis a perfect opportunity to cut the Twi'lek’s throat. The Twi’lek fell to the ground, its blood illuminating the pit. Ignis felt the rush of adrenaline die down as his opponent was finally slain. His heart was beating rapidly and what seemed like an endless amount of sweat poured down his scarred face. The Twi’lek got him good, leaving a giant scar on his right cheek. “Good.” said the raspy voice of the teacher behind him. “You’ve passed your training, take a break, your next class isn’t as… gruesome.”. Ignis left the arena with no sympathy for the dead Twi’lek, he simply heard a voice in his voice repeating the words “Only the strong survive.”.\n\nAfter the training concluded, Ignis made his way to the Sith Archives and found it empty. Good, he thought. ‘I have the whole Archive to myself.’ He read through a few articles regarding Ancient Sith Tombs, Sith Temples, and his personal favorite, Darth Nihilus. Ignis was extremely fascinated by Darth Nihilus, one of the single greatest Dark Lords of the Sith to ever roam the Galaxy. Ignis read for hours and eventually fell asleep in his chair. A few hours later he woke up from an announcement informing him that his next class was about to start. Ignis’ head shot straight up and jumped out of his seat only to realize that he was already where he needed to be for his next training. “Did you have a good sleep, Ignis?” a deep voice said from behind him. A giant male Zabrak covered in orange tattoos shadowed Ignis. “Oh, uh, sorry, Teacher, I got too caught up in my studying and I lost track of time,” Ignis replied. “I don’t care what excuses you come up with, I only care that you listen to this class and shut up.” the Teacher said. “Yes, Teacher. Sorry, Teacher.” Ignis said. “Now, your second class is about the Archives and the Sith Code. You all have 1 minute to read the Sith Code and interpret it in your own words. GO!” the Zabrak yelled. Ignis wasn’t worried, he’d already read enough information about ancient Sith Philosophies and the Sith Code. “Confused are we, Ignis?” the Zabrak asked. “No, sir. I already know what the Code means.” Ignis replied. “If you’re so smart, Ignis, why don’t you mind explaining it to me?” the Zabrak said spitefully. Ignis did so and left the Zabrak in shock. “The Force shall free me: meaning that my talents in the Dark Side and my lust for power will eventually make me stronger in the Force and once I’ve mastered my talents I will turn the tables and make the Force my slave for me to achieve freedom.” Ignis ended. “Well… you sure know it all don’t you?” the Zabrak said mockingly. “You’ve passed, dismissed. You may want to hope you don’t have me as a teacher again.” the Zabrak said. Ignis left the Archives feeling nothing but pride, he successfully proved his teacher wrong and passed his second training, and the third won’t be much harder. Ignis headed back to his sleeping quarters and got a good rest.\nIgnis woke up and stretched. “I better head to class,” he thought. He made his way to the lecture rooms and took a seat. His teacher this time was a Sith Pureblood, Ignis felt the Dark Side of the Force emanating powerfully within this being. “Today is simple. I will just go through the different lightsaber forms and ranking system of the Order. Listen carefully and take notes.” the Pureblood said. The seminar took around an hour then the Pureblood ended by saying “There is a shuttle on its way to Korriban waiting for you outside the Temple. It leaves in 10 minutes, find it before it leaves or you are of no use to us in this Academy.”. Ignis bolted out of the room in search of the shuttle, he zigzagged through the hallways of the Temple until he was outside, in the freezing cold. He opened himself up to the Force and it guided him the way to the shuttle. Ignis made it with two minutes to spare. On the shuttle, Ignis met a young human male around his age, Daiku. Just like Ignis, Daiku wanted to join the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and the two talked about the ancients. “Do you know about the Blade of Fire?” Daiku asked Ignis. “That’s odd, I've never heard about that before,” Ignis replied. “Not many have,” said Daiku. “It’s a powerful blade that is constantly burning. The blade is lit with an eternal fire. It’s said that upon touching an opponent or their weapons it will instantly melt,” Daiku said. “Wow, how have I never heard about this?” Ignis asked. “As I said, not many people know about it,” Daiku replied. “Interesting,” Ignis murmured.  The shuttle departed and made its way to Korriban where the toughest challenge lay.# The beginning burn\nThe shuttle arrived out of Hyperspace and they began their descent onto the powerful, ancient Sith homeworld, Korriban. “I hope you are all ready to face the toughest challenge you’ve ever faced in your lives. You will be constructing your very own lightsaber, but it comes at a cost.” The Twi’lek teacher, Alask, exclaimed. The Rodian twitched in his seat and sat up straight. The three Zabraks glanced over at the only Rodian on the shuttle and began murmuring. Daiku and Ignis were the only humans on board, but there were also three Zabraks: Triz, Sibalena, and Brare. There was also a Rodian, he was Grax, and the Sith Pureblood, she was Haelusa. But what caught Ignis’ eyes the most was the colorful group of Twi’leks, orange, pink, blue, and green. The orange one was Chee, the green was Boc, the blue was Oola, and the pink was Nima. They reached Korriban’s surface. Ignis thought Dathomir was powerful in the Dark Side of the Force, compared to Korriban, Dathomir was weak. The Dark Side was even stronger here, Ignis could stay up for hours, and his starvation passed away replaced with hunger for power. “Follow me!” Alask said. The class wandered through the ruined Valley of Dark Lords. Sadly, all the tombs had been raided by ancient Sith and there was no use for them. They entered an old, ragged temple with a table on top. This was where we craft our lightsabers Ignis thought. “Step forward. I’m going to explain this once and only once. Listen at your peril” Alask said, his voice echoing throughout the massive, ruined structure. “You will be searching through these caves for a Kyber crystal, but be aware that you won’t be the only ones there, you might be unlucky and encounter dangerous creatures or worse, each other. Those who make it out alive within the said time will leave this planet alive, if you don’t make the timer we’d assume you died. There are only so few crystals, you will have to fight for them or die.” Alask said. The Twi’lek exchanged fearful looks. “Let the final trial begin!” Alask shouted. All the beings ran for the caves, some followed others and some chose their paths, Ignis was one of them.\n\nHe bolted through the caves, the Dark Side soaring through him, pumping him with what felt like an endless amount of exhilaration and accelerating his speed and mind. He opened himself up to the Force like Xenion always taught him during their training sessions and it guided him to an Amber-colored crystal. Unfortunately, Ignis also encountered Brare and before he could pick up the crystal, the Zabrak charged toward him. Acting swiftly, Ignis sidestepped out of the Zabrak’s way and used his left foot to trip the Zabrak. Brare jumped back on his feet in an instant and that’s when it happened again. With a snap of his fingers, Ignis managed to set Brare on fire. The Zabrak stood there for a second in astonishment, then he realized what was happening. Brare started screaming in agony, running around the cave with his hands waving in the air. Ignis heard a sudden growl, he picked up the crystal and started running, he glanced backward and saw a massive beast grab Brare and devour him in a single gulp, it was a rancor. The rancor lifted its head and charged toward Ignis, but Ignis was faster and focused on escaping. He zigzagged through the caves and ran into Boc. Boc fell to the ground but jumped right up again, sadly, he was too late. Ignis never stopped to help Bloc and left him there as a means to distract the blood-lustful rancor. Bloc was devoured. Luckily, this bought Ignis enough time to find the exit and make it out alive. He was the first one out and not long after him, Grax appeared. They waited a while.\n\n“This is pathetic. Taking you guys way too long” Alask said. “You’re lucky I didn’t leave without you all,” he said. Then, Daiku appeared, and following him was the loud cry of Triz. Oola and Chee emerged at the same time. Alask bought his index figure and his thumb together and all of a sudden Oola and Chee were dangling in the air, hands clasped around their throats for their windpipes were slowly being crushed by the power of the Dark Side. “When I said if you encountered each other it would be dangerous, I didn’t want you to help each other. Why did you come out together? A true Sith is independent and doesn’t require the help of each other. What you two have done is the complete opposite of how a Sith should act and because of this you will pay.” Alask yelled. The bodies of Oola and Chee fell to the ground, their lifeless eyes remained open wide. Nima came running out and tripped over the dead bodies. Once she realized who they were she screamed in horror. “Is there a problem, Nima?” Alask asked. “Wha-, I mean-, No, sir,” she replied, trembling at the sight of her dead friends. Sibalena also made it out alive with Haelusa’s head in her arm. She threw it towards Alask. “Well done, Sibalena. This is exactly what I wanted.” Alask said. “Thank you, Alask,” she said. “Now, anyone seen the others?” Alask asked. “I killed them,” Ignis said. “How did you manage to kill them?” Alask asked. “I burned Brare and was chased by rancor. I saw Boc and tripped him to distract the rancor. It devoured him.” Ignis said in a non-sympathetic tone. They were useless to him. The class stared at him. “Well done, Ignis!” Alask finally said, breaking the awkward silence. “Now, let the Force guide you in making your lightsabers,” Alask said. They started construction and straight after went back to the shuttle, Korriban was not safe at night and darkness was creeping overhead. “Now, once we return, find the Overlord of the Sphere you wish to join and talk to them,” Alask said as they took off.\n\n They arrived back on Dathomir and Ignis ran straight to the Archives, rumours were that the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge’s Overlord, Darth Lividus, had arrived on Dathomir and was in the Archives. Ignis approached Lividus. “Who are you?” the Overlord asked. “I am Adept Ignis of the Sith Order. I wish to join the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge.” Ignis said nervously. “Prove yourself worthy to me,” Lividus replied. “Explain to me why you want to join us and inform me of what you already know of our lore,” Lividus demanded. Ignis explained everything to him and finally, Lividus accepted him. Lividus left the Archives and from the shadows, Xenion emerged. “I see you have joined the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge,” he pointed out. “I still wish to learn from you, Master,” Ignis said. “Good, my apprentice.”...\n\n“Firstly,” Xenion said. “Due to your strong connection with Sith Alchemy and extraordinary ability of Pyrokinesis, I want you to practice every day conjuring up Fiery energy and brewing Sith Alchemy. Luckily, Dathomir is the best place for this.” Xenion said. “However, I can’t help you, my powers lie elsewhere and that’s why I’ve made this the last part of our training. After this, you will become a Sith Knight of the Order.” Xenion explained. “Yes, sir. I better get to work then.” Ignis said. “Indeed,” Xenion replied. Ignis spent that afternoon in the Archives reading as much as he could find about Sith Alchemy and Pyrokinesis. All he could find out was that Pyrokinesis was the ability used by very few Sith to conjure up and manipulate fire. They did this by heating up and rubbing air molecules to create a ball of fire, which they’d unleash on their opponents. Ignis read for hours and couldn’t find anything. He decided to take things into his own hands. He practiced heating air molecules for the next few weeks. Eventually, he learned how to create medium-sized balls of fire and could throw them at objects or people. After learning this, he moved on to an ability called Convection, which was pretty straightforward for Ignis. He meditated and would light things on fire. Firstly, he’d only be able to light smaller objects on fire with really good concentration and whilst meditating, but soon he could do it quicker and mastered the ability. Of course, however, he’d still practice both abilities every day. He wasn’t ready to master Sith Alchemy, that ability was complex and he’d require more time alone and in general. He informed Xenion of his new abilities and then the Trials of Knighthood began.\n\nTwo years later:\nIgnis was finally a Sith Knight, who had mastered Pyrokinesis and Convection and had joined the Sphere of Mysteries with his master, Xenion. He’d been there for two weeks and was about to do his Advanced Sith Knight Trials/Inquisitor Trials on the planet of Dromund Kaas, this was where most of the Sphere's activities were held... Darth Renavus hosted it for him. He passed, but he didn’t want to stay in the Sphere for too much longer, he missed his days in the Archives with his friends, Carmesi, Long, and Gallius, from the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge. Gallius and Carmesi ascended to Lord, which made Ignis regret his decision to leave. After a few days, Ignis decided it was time to go back, he requested it from Darth Kaderim and said his goodbyes. “Good luck, my dear apprentice,” Xenion told him. “Thank you, Master,” Ignis replied and he left Dromund Kaas. He boarded his new ship, the Flame, and set a course to Dathomir. Lividus had left the Order and he was replaced by Darth Nodt, a young but extremely intelligent Overlord. Lucky for Ignis, Nodt was a close ally and friend to him so he welcomed Ignis back with open arms via holo-communications. Ignis was promoted to Sith Curator, which was good because Gallius and Carmesi were Curators too. However, Ignis was surprised when his friend from the Sphere of Mysteries, Vederium, joined Ancient Knowledge as a Curator too. “I would have never guessed you’d join Ancient Knowledge,” Ignis said to Vederium. “Thought a change was necessary,” Vederium replied. “Great to see you anyway,” Ignis said. “Likewise,” Vederium remarked. There were new faces, Remalior, who Ignis had already met shortly before leaving, was now a Loremaster, and Daiku, who he had joined the Sphere with, disappeared. This shocked Ignis, but doesn’t matter now, Ignis and Daiku had grown apart over the years. “Welcome back!” Gallius and Carmesi said as they approached the landing pad. “Good to see you guys!” Ignis said. “Where’s Long?” Ignis asked. “He’s a Loremaster now and has more pressing matters, but he sent his regards,” Gallius replied. “Great!” Ignis said. “Let’s get to work,” Nodt said as he revealed himself.\n\nFive years later:\nIgnis was in the Archives, downhearted when he heard the news about Carmesi. His old friend had perished and right after Gallius moved Spheres as well. At least Long was still here, Ignis thought. He got up as Nodt entered. “What happened to Carmesi and the timing of it is truly a tragedy,” Nodt said. “But we must not let it stop us from serving the Order.”. “Yes, sir,” Ignis said. Ignis saw Nodt accompanied by Darth Invictus and Darth Bellicus. Bellicus used to be a part of the Dark Lord’s Powerbase and Invictus had been a part of the Sphere for quite some time now after leaving the Sphere of Sith Philosophy as a Darth and switching to Ancient Knowledge. Remalior was also promoted to Lord and there were three new members: Daedima, Jake, and Mateo. Ignis became allies with them too, but he spent most of his time with Long now. Jake and Mateo were also Curators and good ones at it as well. As Ignis was the oldest current Curator, Jake looked up to him as an idol. Ignis helped the two new Curators and they learned fast. “New mission I assume, sir?” Ignis said after remembering he was with Nodt and the Inner Circle. “You could say that,” Nodt said. “What do you mean?” Ignis asked. “I mean I’ve talked to my Inner Circle and the Dark Council about you,” Nodt said. “Sir, I can do better, I’ve been trying my best-” Ignis was interrupted by Nodt. “Relax, Ignis. It’s nothing bad, kneel before me.”. Ignis did so. “With the support of the Dark Council and the Inner Circle, I announce Inquisitor Ignis, a Sith Lord. Rise Lord Ignis,” Nodt said. Ignis rose but his legs could barely hold his weight. Was he hearing this right? Sith Lord? Him? “I-, I-, I’m honored, sir.” Ignis stuttered. “You should be, it’s a big responsibility and I know you will please me,” Nodt said. “Absolutely,” Ignis replied. “Now onto the more pressing matter,” Nodt said. “You and Jake have an important mission. I want you guys to venture to Korriban and spend a few weeks there searching for anything that could be useful for our cause. “Yes, sir.” Ignis said. “Jake has already made his way to your ship, it’s time you went as well.” Invictus said. “Oh, and Ignis.” Nodt said. “Gallius is waiting for you guys there,” he said. “Wait what?” Ignis asked. To think his day couldn’t get any better, Gallius finally returned to the Sphere. “Yes, he has decided to rejoin us and I immediately sent him to Korriban.” Nodt said. “I’ll leave right away,” Ignis said.\n\n# The Tomb of Darth Blaze\nJake and Ignis landed on Korriban. The planet got Ignis excited and as usual, alive. “Where is Gallius meeting us?” Jake asked. “I have no idea,” Ignis admitted. “I’m sure he’ll know where to look,” Ignis said. Something was off about the planet this time, a growing sense of power lingered in Ignis, boiling inside. He thought he heard a voice calling out to him, it was probably just the Dark Side, Ignis thought. This planet has been deserted for years, the only people who ever set foot here are the Acolytes constructing their lightsabers, which rarely happens. The two Sith walked for hours in silence, Ignis was calling on the Force to find Gallius. Eventually, they came across a Temple where Gallius lay meditating at the entrance. He looked up to see Jake and Ignis. “Took you long enough,” he said. “We only realized of the mission not long ago,” Jake said. “I heard of your promotion, Ignis. Congratulations!” Gallius said. “Thank you,” Ignis replied. “Now, let’s stop wasting time and get to work,” Ignis said.\n\nThe three of them split up and started walking through the Temple. They kept their comms on just in case. Ignis found a small beam of light coming from the tunnel on the left. He followed the light and found himself in a small cave with a giant red tomb with a four-sided pyramid on top, a Sith Holocron. Ignis read about Sith Holocrons, they contained teachings from one of the greatest Sith Lords and Dark Lords of the Sith. Dathomir had a Holocron, the Holoron of Darth Nox, and only the Overlord was allowed to see it because of the power it contained inside. Ignis had never seen the Holocron nor any Holocrons in general, he merely heard it from rumors. Now, however, he was face to face with a real one, the question was whether he should take it for himself or bring it to the Inner Circle. Ignis approached the Holocron and clasped it in both hands, the floor started to rumble, the tomb was opened, and out came a giant blue spirit. Ignis attempted to run but the cave entrance collapsed right before he could leave. “Who are you?” the deep voice asked. The Spirit’s voice caused a fiery feeling inside Ignis. “I am Lord Ignis of the Sphere of Ancient knowledge. Who are you?” Ignis replied. “I am the great Lord of Fire, I am Darth Blaze.” the Spirit said. “Darth Blaze?” Ignis asked. “Never heard of you,” he said. “That’s because all records of my existence have been destroyed, I have been erased from history, like many of my fellow Sith Lords before you,” Blaze said. “I was once part of a prophecy, I was said to lead the Sith in annihilating the Jedi and control the Army of Fire. They called me the Lord of Fire, sadly, I was exiled and assassinated by my apprentice. I have waited a long time for someone to find my tomb and my Holocron.” Blaze said. “Finally, you come before me. The question is, are you worthy of becoming my successor and has the Army of Fire chosen you to lead them?” Blaze asked. “I have no idea what kind of trick this is, but I don’t want to be a part of it,” Ignis replied. “This is no trick. If it was, my power in the art of deception would’ve fooled you by now.” Blaze said. “I’ll prove it to you,” Blaze said. He lit up the candles in the room and started meditating. All of a sudden, a giant sword emerged from the ground. The sword was lit on Fire. Ignis remembered. A few years ago when he was an Acolyte, Daiku had spoken of a Sword of Fire. Was this it? “Is this the Sword of Fire?” Ignis asked. “Heard of it?” Blaze asked. “My friend found a text in the Archives that only mentioned the sword and its ability to constantly be lit on fire,” Ignis replied. “Perhaps you are the one who has been chosen to inherit my legacy,” Blaze said. “What legacy is that?” Ignis asked. “To wield the power sword, control the Army of Fire, and wipe out every Jedi from the Galaxy,” Blaze said cackling. “Prove yourself worthy to me, complete the Four Fiery tasks, and then I shall give you the power of the Sword of Fire,” Blaze said. “It will be done, Darth Blaze. Where do I begin?” Ignois asked. “Take my Holocron, learn everything I have to teach you, and then the Holocron will guide you with your tasks. Show this to not a soul.” Blaze replied. He opened the cave entrance. “Leave,” he said. Ignis ran out of the tomb with the Holocron secured in his satchel and ran into Jake. “Where were you, my Lord?” Jake asked. “What do you mean?”. “We were trying to contact you, but your comms must’ve lost signal,” Jake said. “Oh, right. Sorry, I was searching the caves,” Ignis replied. “Find anything interesting?” Jake asked. “No, nothing that could be of any use to the Inner Circle,” Ignis said. “Very well,” Jake said. They left the Temple, and once again when darkness poured over Korriban the three Sith needed a place to camp, so they headed to the ruins of the ancient Sith Academy and slept.\n\nThree months later:\nThere was much to do today and Ignis got up at the crack of dawn. He watched as the sun rose from the east and woke up the other two. They sprang up and got to work, today they were to look for the Valley of the Dark Lords and it was their last day on the deserted planet. Ignis, however, had kept learning from Blaze and finished his training; he was now waiting to leave the planet so he could go off in secret to complete the fiery tasks. They navigated their way to the Valley of the Dark Lords and each went their separate ways in different tombs. Ignis’ tomb was completely dark, his only source of light was the fireball he had made using pyrokinesis. He walked through the tombs and just as he expected, found the tomb was already open and there were no artifacts scattered around. He departed the tomb and went to the next, only to find the same results. After searching 5 tombs, Ignis realized it was pointless. Jake and Gallius came to a similar conclusion and they headed back to the ship to contact Darth Nodt. In the course of the three months, Gallius had ascended to Darth due to the retirements of Invictus and Bellicus. They spent that week on Dathomir attending the service and went straight back to Korriban. Finally, they were returning to Dathomir for good. All except Ignis, who would complete Blaze’s training in secret. They contacted Nodt. “Anything new?” he asked. “No, sir,” Gallius replied. “That’s a shame,” Nodt said. “You all did your best and that I am thankful for. You may return to Dathomir and we will speak of this in the next Sphere meeting.” Nodt said. “Yes, sir.” the three said in unison. They turned off the comms and made a course for Dathomir. Home sweet home, but for how much longer?\n\nUpon their arrival home, they caught up with Nodt and made their way to the Chamber of Ancient Knowledge where their meeting would be held. “It is with a heavy heart that I must announce my retirement from the Order and the Sphere,” Nodt said all of a sudden. “What?” asked Jake. “Retirement? There’s still so much to be achieved, we are on the verge of greatness” Ignis replied. “I am aware, but fear not my replacement will be just as good as leading the Sphere as I was. It is none other than the legendary Darth Zinwrath himself.” Nodt said. Zinwrath? The Overlord of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy? He had been the second oldest current member of the Dark Council and had always been in the Sphere of Sith Philosophy. He was an extremely close ally with the Dark Lord of the Sith. “Who’s looking after the Sphere of Philosophy now?” asked Gallius. “I am not sure, all I know is Zinwrath is your new Overlord. Oh, look, here he comes!” Nodt exclaimed. “Hello, everyone,” Zinwrath said in what seemed like a friendly tone but judging by the look on his face it was hard to tell if he was genuine. “I am your new Overlord, I am open to any ideas you all may have,” he said. “Very well, I must be on my way. My shuttle departs in a few hours and I must get ready.” Nodt said. They all embraced him and said their farewells. He left the Chambers. “Now, let’s see, what should we start with?” Zinwrath asked. “Hm, for now, I think I’ll get you all to start training the newbies until I make any further adjustments to the Sphere. We have no time to lose, everyone but Gallius and Ignis may leave.” Zinwrath said. The crowd left the Chambers, it was silent. Not the good kind of silence, a cold silence. Zinwrath’s eyes darted back and forth between Gallius and Ignis. “You two know how the Inner Circle system works within the Sphere I presume,” Zinwrath stated. “Of course!” they both said. “Good, I am yet to decide what adjustments to make but I’d love both of you to help me out. As you know I was a part of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and changing Spheres is a lot to wrap my head around,” he said. “We’ll be here for you, sir,” Gallius said. “I am thankful for that. I am also looking to fill up the Inner Circle positions, I understand this Sphere has never had a full Inner Circle, correct?” Zinwrath asked. “Indeed,” Ignis said. “Good, my first act as an Overlord is to ascend you, Ignis, to Darth at the next Sith Rally in a few days,” Zinwrath said casually. “Wait, what? Me?” Ignis asked. “Who else would I be talking about?” Zinwrath asked. “Oh- this is unexpected.” Ignis replied. ‘Thank you.” he blurted out. “Let’s get to work,” Zinwrath demanded. \n\nIt was a busy week for Ignis and Ancient Knowledge. The Rally had finally come and Ignis was going to become a Darth. Wow! This was perfect timing as well. As a Darth, Ignis could be excused from traveling off-world and could assign himself his tasks. “Join me in congratulating the newest Darth of the Order, Ignis, who has been a Lord for quite some time now and has served the Sphere for a very long time. He has shown his worthiness throughout the artifacts he’s collected, tombs, and temples he’s found, but most of all, Ignis has written more articles for the Sphere than anyone in its history. He has earned this title.” Zinwrath said. Ignis walked up to Zinwrath and bowed. “Thank you!” he whispered. “Anytime,” Zinwrath said. Ignis walked back. The Rally was over and Ignis was approached by various Sith all congratulating him on his recent success. Ignis thanked them all but needed to complete his tasks. He remembered what Darth Blaze said to him about finding a student, someone he could mentor, and trust to hold the legacy if he were to be killed. Jake approached Ignis and embraced him. “Congratulations, my Lord,” he said. “Thank you, Jake,” Ignis replied. Then it hit him. Jake had been his friend for years, he was much younger than Ignis and was powerful in the art of Sith Alchemy. Ignis pulled Jake aside. “Something wrong, my Lord?” Jake asked. “No, remember our first day in Korriban and you asked me if I had found anything in the Temple?” Ignis asked. “Why, of course!” Jake replied. “Good, follow me,” Ignis said. He told Jake about the prophecy, Blaze’s tomb, the Holocron, the Sword of Fire, and the Army of Fire. It took a while for Jake to wrap his head around everything but then he realized. “I want you to become my student. I would ask Gallius but he is slightly older than me and it wouldn’t work, that’s why I have come to you. I can feel that Sith Alchemy is a great talent of yours. I may not have mastered it yet, but you certainly have.” Ignis remarked. “I would be honored, my Lord,” Jake said. “Kneel before me and rise as my successor,” Ignis demanded. “Where to now, Master?” Jake asked. “We must complete the three fiery tasks, I must seek out ancient Sith Sorcerer’s tombs and I must claim the Sword of Fire,” Ignis replied. “So-” Jake was interrupted by Ignis. “We are headed to Mustafar,” Ignis said.\n\n# Scorch of the Republic\nThe two Sith arrived on Mustafar. Ignis was recently promoted to Darth and told the Inner Circle that he and Jake were looking for anything that might come in handy to them on the volcanic planet. Zinwrath insisted he sent more members with them, the current generation of Ancient Knowledge never set foot on the planet and Ignis was eager to complete his training with Blaze. Firstly, Ignis was to find the Temple of Darth Blaze, then he’d have to make it to the core of the Temple without being killed, and lastly, Ignis was to steal the Sword of Fire successfully. The one Blaze showed Ignis was merely an illusion just like the tomb, Ignis was to find and steal the natural thing to become the Lord of Fire. “Stay with the ship,” he said to Jake. “If I am not back in five standard days tell the Inner Circle I perished,” Ignis said. “Yes, Master,” Jake replied. Ignis started his journey, the Holocron held a secret map of the Temple inside and so all Ignis had to worry about was any traps within. Ignis traveled for a few hours and eventually found himself at the Temple of Darth Blaze. The Temple was surrounded by lava and was fiery red. Ignis flipped over the lava and reached the Temple. He landed on the island and all of a sudden, a giant long came crashing down to knock Ignis into the lava, he barely avoided it. He jumped up and sliced both ropes that held the log in a single slash. The log collapsed in the lava and Ignis entered the Temple. He realized that one of the tiles was higher than the other, so he avoided the tile. \n\nHe found himself in a large room with a giant throne that was lit on fire. This must be the core, Ignis thought. He walked up to the throne and was completely oblivious to the cage to the left. He took a seat on the throne and the cage opened. Ignis heard loud growls. He looked to his left to see four hounds. The hounds were bright red with fiery eyes. They charged at Ignis and left a trail of fire where they moved. Ignis ignited his lightsaber, and the bright amber of his blade flashed all over the room. He tried to strike down the hounds but they were quick. One of them bit his left leg, and Ignis screamed in agony. He snapped his fingers and the hound was lit on fire. Nothing happened. Ignis’ fire abilities did not affect the hounds. The throne that Ignis was sitting on dissolved and in the exact spot where the throne had disappeared from a bright sword appeared, the Sword of Fire. Ignis ran to the Sword and took it, it burned but with power. Ignis could feel it now, the power of the sword was flowing through him. The hounds stopped in their tracks and immediately bowed before Ignis. He left the Temple and went back to the ship. It was time. He would destroy the Jedi and the Republic with this sword. “Is that the Sword of Fire?” Jake asked as Ignis boarded the ship. “Indeed,” Ignis replied. “Set a course for Dathomir, I must speak with the Dark Council,” Ignis demanded. “Right away, my Lord,” Jake responded. \n\nThey arrived on Dathomir and Ignis bolted to the Council Chambers. “What is the meaning of this?” Zinwrath demanded. “I’ve found a powerful tool that can help our cause,” Ignis said. The Overlord of the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy, Darth Surge, who was also the oldest Dark Councillor, saw the weapon. “How did you get that?” he asked. “It’s the Sword of Fire,” Ignis said. “I know what it is, I asked you how you obtained it,” Surge said quickly. “I spoke with Darth Blaze a while back and he guided me. I’ve been training with him for a while.” Ignis replied. “What is this Sword of Fire?” Darth Ugwae, Overlord of the Sphere of Philosophy asked. “It’s the most powerful sword ever forged,” Surge said. “It was created by Sith Sorcery and the Eternal Flame.”. “Why have I not heard of this?” Darth Tythen, the Overlord of Sphere of Mysteries, asked. “It’s been erased from all documents, except one,” Surge said. “So what should we do with this sword? How can we destroy the Jedi?” Darth Kelemvor, the Overlord of the Sphere of Law & Justice, asked. “I control the Army of Fire, I will lead them to battle with the Jedi,” Ignis replied. “Then it’s settled,” Zinwrath said. “You will lead a team of Sith and destroy the Jedi,” Zinwrath said. “I will accompany you, and so will the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy,” Surge said. The Council all agreed and so Surge and Ignis left. Zinwrath caught up with ignis. “Take a few people from Ancient Knowledge with you,” he said. “I’ll bring Gallius and Jake.” ignis replied. “Good, you have done the Order well,” Zinwrath said. “Thanks, sir,” Ignis said and hurried to inform Jake and Gallius.\n\nSurge was waiting for Ignis outside the Temple. “As commander of this mission, you will need your command ship. This was your Master’s, Darth Xenion, Harrower-class dreadnought. It belongs to you now.” Surge said. “Thanks, sir,” Ignis replied. He boarded the ship. On his new ship was a naval crew. “At ease!” the Captain said. Ignis smiled, all of this was for him. “What is your name?” Ignis asked. “I am Captain Pelgrim. I am in charge of the crew and the second in command of the vessel.” Pelgrim stated. “Good. I hope you are all ready, we are about to embark.” Ignis said and they began their ascent into space. Ignis watched out the viewport and saw a speck, the Temple. He was leaving Dathomir and possibly for good. “Set a course for Ossus. It’s time to destroy the Republic.” Ignis commanded. The bridge burst into cheers as they prepared for the biggest battle of their lives.\n\nThe ship, which Ignis had named “Combustion”, had exited hyperspace and they waited for the rest of the fleet. “Incoming transmission.” Ensign Renk shouted. “Put them through,” Ignis demanded. “This is Darth Surge, can you hear me Ignis?” Surge’s voice came from the comms. “Yes, Ignis here,” he said. “All twelve ships have come out of hyperspace. Each of them contains a hundred Sith. Warriors, Inquisitors, Raiders, and some of my Inner Circle are here. They are all at your command.” Surge said. “I’m ready. How about everyone else?” Ignis asked.”I’ve heard from Darths Vican, Apteryx, and Tremulus that they have their soldiers ready. Darth Gallius’ ship is ready and so are the others. Are the other two Ancient Knowledge ships ready?” Surge asked. “Yes,” Ignis replied. “Deploy all your ships and round them all up,” Ignis said. “We’re going to strike at the dead of night, we will burn their Temple.”.\n\nThe ships all landed a few thousand kilometers from the Temple, so they wouldn’t be seen. Ignis and Surge stood on top of a rock and in front of them were rows of Sith Warriors, Inquisitors, Raiders, Sorcerers, and even Knights. There were also thousands of Sith Empire Troopers gathered. It was the entire Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy along with several members of each Sphere. There were thousands of them, all at the command of Ignis and Surge. “My fellow Sith,” Ignis started. “Today, we gather on Ossus to destroy the Republic and the Jedi Temple. They will suffer heavy casualties and so will we, but this battle will result in a fatal blow to our enemies. Those who die will die for freedom and the Empire. We will not and cannot lose this fight. We attack in the dead of night, so prepare your soldiers.” Ignis shouted. Jake, Gallius, Vican, Tremulus, and Aptetryx were all in a line in front of the soldiers and Sith. The crowd all split and hundreds of Sith and soldiers entered the ships and grabbed anything they could find that would help the cause. \n\nA few hours later, the entire army was standing in rows again. They waited for Ignis’ command. “Deploy!” Ignis said. The army all charged in different directions. Some ignited their lightsabers, others cocked their guns. In a matter of seconds, the camp was completely desolated, except for Surge and Ignis. “If you excuse me, sir, I have to meet with a few of the Jedi High Councillors,” Ignis said in a joyful tone. “I wish you the best of luck, Ignis,” Surge replied. “Thank you, my lord,” Ignis said as he bolted to the Temple. He ran for ages, the Force boosted his energy and the Dark Side flowed through him so strongly, his will was too powerful. He felt invincible, nothing would stop him from destroying the Council. Ignis had found a secret entrance during his time with Blaze. He’d have to go to the waterfall and there was an unexpected cave right next to it. However, the occasional Temple Guards were patrolling this area, but Ignis could take care of them. He reached the cave entrance, there were only two present guards. Ignis showed himself from the darkness. The guards were mute, however, then ignited their lightsabers. They were too late, Ignis had already conjured up a giant ball of fire and had shot it toward the guards. Their hands waved in the air, and the heat of the blood-orange fire consumed their bodies, burning their flesh. Ignis strode to the secret chambers of the Council. He could hear the shouts of Jedi, Sith, and soldiers. His army had reached the inside. However, he hadn’t conjured the Army of Fire yet. Now was the time. Ignis held the sword high in the air and chanted an ancient Sith ritual in the Sith language. Arms began to poke out from the floor, the rugs burned and the deadly servants rose from the floor, not just in the chambers, but all over the Temple. Ignis had made sure that they spread out so that they could help the Sith Empire. Only ten of them stood with him. “Help the others. I’ll take care of the Councillors myself.” Ignis said to the creatures. They scattered out of sight and he entered the Chambers. The entire Council wasn’t there. The Grandmaster, Quartermasters, and a few other Councillors. They were away at Coruscant. He saw mostly humans, they were Va; Senko, Dylan Malvern, Vanestic, Excubiarum Tenebris Net but also a Kel Dor, Master Cha-Koon, and a red Togruta, Master Audila Zavros. “What is the meaning of this?” Master Val Senko demanded. “Your time is up Jedi. The Jedi Order is about to experience a fatal blow. Right now, thousands of Sith and soldiers are attacking your surprised Order on Ossus. The Temple will burn down in a matter of hours or minutes even. You can either join us or die.” Ignis exclaimed. “This is outrageous!” Master Dylan shouted. “You have no right to barge into the Temple like this.” Master Audila Zavros said. Ignis looked at her. He lifted his right hand and made a choking gesture. The Master was afloat in the air choking. The other Masters rose from their seats and prepared to attack. “Now now. There’s no need for that. Put your weapons away and I’ll let her go.” Ignis said. They all looked at each other reluctantly and put away their lightsabers. “Good,” Ignis said. He threw Master Audila at the other Councillors and lit Master Cha-Koon on fire. The Kel Dor’s flesh melted away. The other Masters got into their fighting positions. Ignis chose Form IV, the aggressive form Ataru. He wasn’t good at lightsaber combat but his will was strong. The room erupted into bright colors and the sound of lightsabers clanking was deafening. Ignis opened the Chamber door and led the Masters outside. Master Dylan attempted to slash Ignis’ legs, but Ignis was too fast and parried his blow. Ignis flipped back and unleashed a powerful Force push on the Jedi. Everyone but Master Val Senko fell. Val charged at Ignis and tried breaking through Ignis’ defense. Ignis kicked the Master’s ribs and the others all jumped back up. Ignis couldn’t take on five Masters on his own. He had no help. He had to use Sith Alchemy, but he had no time. Master Net disarmed Ignis and his lightsaber rolled across the floor. “Now tell us who you are, Sith.” Net demanded. “I am Darth Ignis of Ancient Knowledge, I lead the Curators, I am one of the most powerful Sith Alchemists, but most of all… I am the Lord of Fire. Chosen by Darth Blaze himself.” Ignis said. Ignis couldn’t see who it was but all of a sudden everything turned black and Ignis lay unconscious on the floor. \n\nMeanwhile, Jake was in the Jedi Library with Darth Gallius and a few Sith Raiders. He was stealing their knowledge and setting the place on fire. He had learned a few tricks from Darth Ignis on how to conjure fiery energy, set things on fire, and how to make a ball of fire. He used all his training in the Temple. However, he wanted to prove himself. Ignis saw a Twi’lek Jedi wearing the robe of a Jedi Master. “Fight me, Master Jedi,” he shouted to the Twi’lek on the other side of the library. The two locked eyes and destroyed everyone in their paths. Jake reached the Twi’lek and began the attack. He easily parried the Twi’lek’s blows and blocked all his strikes. Jake kicked Twi'lek in the knee and the Twi’lek fell. Jake lit the Twi’lek on fire and he burned to death. Jake was completely oblivious to the fact that all the Jedi in the library lay dead on the floor. The Sith had won this fight and they set the entire thing ablaze. Jake looked into the fire pleased, he did it. Ignis would be very pleased with their success. I wonder how Ignis is going, Jake thought. Ignis hadn’t told anyone but Surge where he’d be and Surge kept it a secret. Wherever he was, Jake couldn’t feel the burning feeling of his presence. He could smell the smokey body of Ignis nearby anywhere. Where was he? If he had failed, Jake would have to claim the sword and finish Ignis’ goal. Jake knew he wasn’t ready for this and so he went to look for Ignis. After setting the Library on fire, Gallius and Jake went to search for Ignis, worried about their loyal friend’s fate. \n\nIgnis woke up. He glanced around and saw the Councillors surrounding him, all of them were meditating. What were they doing, he thought to himself. “Welcome back, Jinqxd.” Master Val said. “I am Ignis, Jinqxd is long dead. Do not ever refer to me by that name again or I will cut your tongue.” Ignis said angrily. “So much hatred, so much anger.” Master Net pointed out. “Anger and hatred lead to power, that’s why the Jedi are weak and the Sith are strong,” Ignis said. “Do you truly believe that?” Master Net asked him. “Think back to the time you spent with Master Creation.” Master Val said. “Yes, we know you’ve communicated with him in a non-lethal way,” Vanestic said. “I was brainwashed, I underestimated the Dark Side. I was lied to.” Ignis said. “No, Master Creation was helping you. He guided you, he saw the good in you.” Master Tenebris said. “No!” Ignis shouted. “You are all; lying, trying to turn me,” Ignis said. “You’re too dangerous, Ignis. It’s time Jinqxd returned. It’s time you joined the Jedi.” Dylan said. Ignis knew they were conducting mind tricks, he felt the soothing tranquillity inside of him. These Councillors were powerful and trying to tempt him. “I will never join you!” Ignis shouted. The Councillors grew silent, focussed too much on turning him to the Light. Finally, the silence broke. “We have someone who’d like to talk with you.” Master Net said. A strange figure with ruffled hair and a blindfold across his eyes emerged into the Chambers. “Master Creation…” Ignis gasped. “Yes, it is me, Jinqxd. Do you not remember our talk?” he asked. “No, this is all a lie. That was a lie. You Jedi are filled with lies.” Ignis protested. “No, Jinqxd. I unlocked the good in you. I can still see it. Please join us Ignis, and serve as my Padawan. I can teach you to control your emotions.” Creation said trying to persuade Ignis. “Stop calling me Jinqxd, he’s dead,” Ignis said. “No, he’s just lost. You’ve lost yourself. Find the light inside of you, embrace it.” Master Creation said. “Darth Blaze is lying to you, he plans to resurrect himself. He is using you.” Creation said. Ignis considered this. Was this true? Surely not. “No, he can’t be resurrected. That’s impossible.” Ignis told himself aloud. “An army of fiery creatures should be impossible too, and a sword made of a fire that never dies. Yet it exists.” Creation said. Ignis refused to betray the Sith. They were his family, the only home he’d have for a very long time. He could smell the smokey debris of the Temple as it consumed the Chambers. The Temple was going down. His mission was a success. Ignis heard the shouting of Sith Lords calling to soldiers and Sith. “Back to the ships!” he heard. “Time to leave these Jedi scums to burn!”. “It would seem that your fellow Sith is leaving without you.” Master Dylan pointed out. Surely they thought he was dead. They wouldn’t just leave Ignis here. He got rid of that thought. “Follow us.” Master Creation said. \n\nThey walked for a while. “Why aren’t you helping any fellow Jedi?” Ignis asked. “We are, there’s just nothing us Councillors can do to help. We have a bigger problem.” Master Val said. They reached the shore. “Across the island is a special cave, it goes back to the Je'daii Order.” Master Val stated. They swam across the island and reached a giant boulder. The master said a secret password that opened the cave entrance. They entered. Inside was a bright light. But the thing that caught Ignis’ eyes was the lightsaber. “This belonged to one of the first Jedi after the Je’daii Order was replaced.” Master Val said. “One of the very first lightsabers made. It stays in this cave with us so we can teach people of the ancient Jedi.”. “Why are you showing me this?” Ignis asked. “We are confident you will join our Order.” Master Creation said. “Why?” Ignis asked. “You’re not all dark, Jinqxd. There is a powerful light emanating from inside of you. Stop trying to ignore it. You know it’s there, you know it’s growing.” Master Creation said. “So what? Do I just give up the Sith teachings and become a Jedi?” Ignis asked. “Yes.” the Masters said. For some reason, Ignis felt light inside of him. It’s the cave. The Light Side was flowing powerfully through this cave. It was consuming Ignis. No. It was just the cave, it was the Masters too. They were all trying to turn him to the light. They are performing a ritual, Ignis thought. Trying to remove the darkness from inside me. It was working. Ignis couldn’t feel barely any of it left inside him. Just light. The Light Side now flowed through him powerfully. It felt like a burning fire inside of him, endless warmth. He was completely oblivious to the fact that his eyes were closed. He opened them. Everything was so much different. “Welcome, Padawan Jinqxd.” Master Creation said. “What happened to my Dark Side powers?” he demanded. “Ignis is dead, Jinqxd has been reborn.” Master Tenebris said. “Am I your Padawan, Master Creation?” Jinqxd asked. “You have been ever since you were that curious Sith Lord who approached me.” Master Creation said. They left the cave and headed back to the Temple. It was all burned down. Flames engulfed the once elegant, beautiful Temple. “You don’t seem sad.” Ignis pointed out. “No, it is time we built a new Temple. The Temple of Dawn.” Master Creation said. “I will assist,” Jinqxd said. “Thank you, Padawan.”.\n\nJake and Gallius eventually lost hope of finding their friend. They boarded the ship and left the planet. They arrived back on Dathomir and mourned the loss of their friend. Jake had found the Sword of Fire lying down in the Jedi High Council Chambers. Ignis must’ve died fighting the Masters, Jake thought. “He would’ve wanted me to continue his legacy,” Jake said quietly to himself. “I won’t let him down.”. A few months after the attack on Ossus, the Dathomir Temple was destroyed by the Nightsister Clan. The Sith had to move to Crucible Prime and construct a new Temple. The Temple contained a special tomb, the tomb of Darth Nox. They had found his burial sight on Crucible Prime and had made it a Dark Side monument. Many had visited the millennia-year-old Dark Lord of the Sith. His ghost patrolled the tomb. One day, Jake and Gallius set out to Ossus. They heard of the new Temple of Dawn constructed by the Jedi. During their time on Ossus, they encountered something remarkable, but disgusting. They saw Ignis, wearing the customary Jedi robes. His lightsaber still looked the same, but was a new colour. Silver. They encountered him and a human wearing the Jedi Master’s robes in the forest. They confronted the two. “What happened to Darth Ignis?” Jake demanded. “Ignis is dead, Jinqxd has been reborn,” he said. “Traitor!” Gallius and Jake screamed. Jake lunged towards the Jedi but Jinqxd was still as powerful in the Force as ever. He hadn’t improved his lightsaber combat, but he was growing stronger in the Force and the silver blade danced in front of him. Jake and Gallius retreated to the ship. Jinqxd and the Master didn’t chase after them. Jinqxd was training for his upcoming Jedi Knight Trials back in the forest with Master Creation. He had only hours before it commenced. Master Creation kept reassuring him that it would be alright. Jinqxd was still young and active. He was in his early twenties and full of life. Also, he was powerful on the Light Side. Later that day he met with the Jedi High Council. He passed his trials and was deemed worthy of becoming a Jedi Knight. “I told you it was easy.” Master Creation said. “Thank you, Master,” Jinqxd said. All the Jedi in the hall congratulated him. Jinqxd was responsible for the destruction of the Dathomir Temple. He had persuaded the Nightsister clan to attack the Sith. Although the Masters were weary of this, some of the other Jedi viewed Jinqxd as a hero. He didn’t care about fame. He was focused on other matters. Jinqxd would be headed to Tython with Master Creation to uncover ancient Jedi artifacts. Jinqxd left the Temple only to return again in a few weeks. He and Master Creation headed for the ship. They entered the cockpit and took off. They made the jump for hyperspace, and the blue flashing light still left Jinqxd in aw. It never ceases to amaze him. “Are you ready for an adventure, Jedi Knight Jinqxd?” Master Creation asked. “Always,” Jinqxd said.\n\n","meta":{"index":5,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Lord of Fire: The Saga","release_year":2023}},"The Death of a Master ":{"content":"# Article\nAn acrid smoke filled the sky around the Sith Temple on Dathomir. The broken bodies of Jedi and Sith decorated the landscape like a macabre confetti, each body a celebration of victory to one tormented soul who would quickly join the deceased.\nObserving the scene stood the terrifying form of Darth Invictus, dominating the structure at the temple steps.\n\nGritting his teeth in rage, Invictus stared into the very essence of the seemingly ancient man at the base of the stairs.\nIt was Kel Routila.   \n\nThe ground began to tremble as 3 Dark Honor Guards approached the hooded Master Routila, before several hands, lightsabers, and finally heads, slumped to the ground by Routila’s feet.\n\n“What is it that makes you so hard to destroy, old man?” barked Invictus, his hand hovering over the hilt of his lightsaber.\n\nRoutila’s confident expression twisted into a blend of hopeful optimism and pure fear at the sight of the Dark Lord above him.\n\n“You have lived your life in that cave, surrounded by those who look to you for guidance… Are you going to die in a place where you are despised, Jedi?” \n\nInvictus hated Routila, as any Sith should, but the two warriors had fought on numerous occasions. Respect was inevitable one day.\n\n“Someone is.” replied the old Jedi, as a hopeful green flash burst from within his hilt, only to be rivalled by the sickening blood red blade of the Sith erupting like fresh magma.\n\nWithin a fraction of a second, Routila sprang upwards to the top of the staircase, and adopted a defensive stance as Invictus sent a barrage of sweeping attacks at the Jedi Master, who countered them with his own forceful flurry of blows. Both Jedi and Sith seemed to fade from reality, leaving behind a swirling mass of green and red flashes, accompanied by roars of anger and the deafening clashing of blades.\n\nThe two warriors ferociously fought back and forth on the platform, each cut and thrust met by the other’s impenetrable parry or block. As the two enemies moved through the courtyard, several pillars would crumble on the ground, the result of a wayward swing cutting them down. \n\nRoutila was abruptly knocked from the platform as a large chunk of rock was sent spinning through the air at him by Invictus, making contact with the Jedi’s torso. \n\nInvictus wasted no time, diving head first to the ground where Routila had landed, his outstretched lightsaber narrowly missing Routila’s head as the Jedi deflected the attack, kicking the Sith from the ground and sending him barreling over him. \n\nSliding down the rocks to the bank of a stagnant pond, their blades clashed yet again, each warrior slamming them together like a blacksmith’s hammer on durasteel. The duel progressed throughout the landscape surrounding the temple, with a well placed kick to Routila’s chest sending the Jedi into the water below.\n\nThe bitter enemies collided in a Saber lock at the other side of the water, and Invictus’ eyes of fiery orange pierced the green of Routila’s gaze, the Jedi’s superhuman size and strength bearing down on the Sith like an avalanche. \n\n“I will not let any more minds be corrupted by evil!” proclaimed Routila, pushing the Sith into the soil, before stepping back from the soul-eating cold that emanated from Invictus.\n\n“You call yourself righteous, Jedi! You are vermin, and like any vermin, I will be your exterminator” screamed Invictus, who bludgeoned at Routila’s defences as the two continued to battle through the tunnels of Dathomir’s landscape.\n\nThe fight had continued on far longer than Invictus had realised, and it had now exited the tunnel and began to devastate the ridges of the hills and mountain passes that the two warriors stood on. \n\nAn exhausted Routila continued to dodge and weave between Invictus’ lightning fast Makashi strikes, drawing on both the light and dark sides of the Force to propel his Niman fighting style to unparalleled speeds. Both men, acrobatic and strong. Both men were beyond masters of their form. \n\nInvictus, with youth on his side, began to spot small gaps in Routila’s defence, with the two century old Jedi Master beginning to show his age. \nBoth men made one last dive at each other, Invictus spinning like a whirlwind of blood, and Routila a beacon of hope, before both warriors felt a searing pain in their chests. \n\nRoutila had made contact with the Sith’s body, swinging the blade past his face, Routila and Invictus flipped backwards before both letting out a blood curdling warcry. Kel lunged at him before plunging his lightsaber into Invictus’ guts with a defiant roar. \n\nHowever, he too had suffered a direct hit, one that Invictus had planted directly into his chest, evaporating one of his hearts and rupturing every other organ in his torso. \n\nA wincing Invictus rose over the Jedi Master, who was now on one knee, clutching at his chest wound. Staring at the defeated Routila, Invictus raised his blade in the air, as the Jedi muttered “There is… no death… there is only… the Force”.\n\nThe Sith Lord, for the first time in his life, responded with one tiny fragment of mercy, swiftly bringing the blood red blade down at Routila’s neck, before the Jedi’s head hit the floor.\n\nKel Routila was dead.\n\n“Your faith in the light was misplaced, Routila” remarked Invictus, as he pulled Routila’s hilt to his hand with the Force. In a sentimental moment, Invictus bowed to the Jedi’s corpse, before kicking it down to the rocks below. \n\nSlowly making his way back to the Temple, Invictus hung Routila’s lightsaber on his waist, the weapon that had defeated so many of his kind, this weapon was symbolic, the rivalry between the two had finally come to an end. Invictus mumbled under his breath as he staggered inside the temple, “Do not fear the Jedi, but be on guard for Routila.”","meta":{"index":12,"author":"LuciferTemenos","name":"The Death of a Master ","release_year":2022}},"Dead by Dawn":{"content":"# Article\nJark was on a ship for a mission along with some other stormtroopers. They were sent to the planet Atlas for a guarding mission. For Jark this was nothing new, he has been on several guarding missions and none are eventful. It was like guarding a manikin with a target on its back. He had never been to Atlas before so maybe this could be an experience. They didn't give him much, after all, it was only for a couple of days, what else could he need? The ship landed and he grabbed his E-11 Blaster Rifle and headed down to formation. Turns out they were only sending five stormtroopers, usually guarding missions took up to ten to fifteen stormtroopers. This made his mood less enthusiastic; he could tell he had a long day ahead of him. When he arrived he was met by Slag, Anon, Bova, and Krat. They were given the coordinates needed to find the person to protect. They were told that he lives in a vault that leads underground and that they would need the password to get in. The password was cement. They got their orders and set off. It was a pretty far distance, luckily they had enough water and food to make it through the frozen tundra that Atlas was accustomed to. While going through the trees they felt as if they were being watched, Slag being himself started to shout at the trees. Bova told him to quit if they are being followed, making loud noises would not help. While the two bickered further, Krat, Anon, and Jark were discussing the shifts they were gonna take and where they would be stationed. The real question was what was the target being protected from? They decided to have 3 guards during the day and 2 at night. This was so that the target would be kept safe during the day and be followed and at night two would just guard the target's quarters while they slept. They had arrived at the coordinates and saw a steel-made vault door embedded into the mountain. The door had a slot on it. They approached the door and proceeded to knock twice and someone opened the latch and asked for the password. Jark went up and muttered the phrase ¨Nark¨.  The door had opened and 3 personnel waited at the opening. They filled them in on the schedule for the target for the next couple of days. They went to their quarters and had begun setting their bags and supply in the storage boxes. Jark and Krat took the night shift and stood outside the door waiting till the clock hit nine am.\n\nAs they were waiting noises began to come out of the vents,  loud bangs, rattling were constant. Jark and Krat with concern decided to check, Jark lifted Krat to the vent. Krat looked in the vent and suddenly he was dragged into the vent. All Jark saw was blood, screaming, and darkness. He yanked Krat out of the vent. All that was left was mangled meat and legs. Jark felt sick to his stomach. His stomach was so heavy it felt like his stomach was made of carbon steel.  It was turning like a windmill. He ran before the monster tried to return and take him along with his dismembered friend. Along running in the halls he could hear the banging of the monsters running with him above. Fear flooded his mind. He started to shoot the vents aimlessly until his rifle overheated. The rattling stopped, maybe he got it. Just then he heard screaming coming from the squad's sleeping quarters. He rushed down the hall and into the room. when entering the room he had seen Bova being sucked into the vent on the floor. He was being torn into pieces being dragged down before Slag's grip gave way and Bova was sucked into the vent screaming and leaving a bloody trail within the ventilation. Then it hit Jark, the target, he was alone. He rushed back to the room with no time wasted. The door was opened with blood everywhere but no sign of the target. All that was left was some tattered clothes on the sleeping pod. That was the most Jark could take before throwing up. It was clear to him, they needed to leave as soon as possible. Slag, Anon, and Jark met back up at the quarters to grab other things before they head out. They could still hear the rambling of these monsters. Just then the emergency sequence came in and all the doors were sealed shut, flashing red lights and smoke spewing out of the vents like a fog machine. Anon began to freak out uncontrollably and started to shoot. The rest ducked down telling him nothing was there and that he needed to calm down. But he kept screaming ¨THERE IN MY HEAD I CAN HEAR THEM.¨ Just then Slag shot Anon in the heart with his blaster rifle. He claimed that he was a threat and it was the best course of action. Jark reluctantly agreed but he never wanted Anon dead. On the back of the bed was a flat metal rod. They took the rod and tried to pry the metal door open with it but it didn't work. It was sealed and wasn't gonna move. The only other way out was the vent. That was the last place Jark wanted to go. Either way, they had the same chance of dying. They cautiously hopped into the very large ventilation system and moved slowly to the supply room. As they were crawling they heard noise from the opposite side of the vent. They quickly hopped into a different room as they heard another monster dragging somebody through the vents. It was non-stop screaming. This was a nightmare that come to life.  They ran through the corridors and slid into the cafeteria where they found a man with no arms. They went to assist him but the loss of blood was getting to him. He told them the only way out is through the main exit. They looked on their holo map and it wasn't too far. It was time to leave this personal hell. \n\nThey headed down to the opened door when Slag was grabbed by something that was being slid into the next room. Jark started to spray out of panic and the unseen beast and accidentally shot Slag. The beast ran off and left Slag there dead on the cold floor. Jark kneeled to the ground and wept, every time he thinks he's gonna be free another man dies. He knew that even if he ran the monster would eventually catch up to him. The only way to really escape is to kill the beast, but his blaster is fried. He headed to the armory and grabbed a metal spear and shield that they had in case of blasters were not in work. As he walked down the halls he made mass amounts of noises, he would hit the shield against the spear. He reached the end of the main exit. The door was closed. The creature leaped out of the vents at the other end. It looked like something out of a nightmare. Its yellow soul-piercing eyes. Its skinny flexible body. The teeth were so sharp they could have been swords. The creature had a black mist surrounding it that could just make you sick. They stood there looking each other in the eyes.  They both ran at each other both with the intent to kill. The monster jumped at him. Jark smacked him away with his shield and pierced his leg to the ground with his spear. The demon struggled to get up. The spear came loose then the creature jumped on Jark and bit his arm repeatedly Jark threw him off and grabbed his arm in pain. The monster stood there and watched his prey wept in pain. The monster jumped at him once more and in the same sequence, Jark threw his spear. The spear missed. The creature had him by the arm and tore it off his body. Just then a siren played so loud it shook the base the monster freaked out grabbing its ears in pain and roaring. JArk slowly got up and yanked the spear out of the siren wall and pierced the creature in the head to the ground. The creature died. The nightmare is over. He grabbed the nub that used to be his arm and headed towards the gate slowly. After all this, he won. He was at the gate and collapsed. The lack of blood was getting to him. And there was nowhere to heal it. He turned on his back, looked at the ceiling, and closed his eyes.","meta":{"index":9,"author":"Long_guy27","name":"Dead by Dawn","release_year":2022}},"The Return of the Sith: Prologue":{"content":"# Overview:\nLong have we waited.

The Empire boiled into complete civil war, as hundreds of thousands of Rakatans perished to infighting. The worst was yet to come; A mysterious plague formed by one of the slave races under the Rakata caused a purge of the Rakatans, decimating their majority and leaving them unable to use the Force; forever insensitive to it. This provoked weakness from the slave worlds and species, resulting in an open revolt that would liberate themselves and formally end the Infinite Empire as the preeminent hegemon in the galaxy.\n\n\tYears later, they were replaced promptly by the Galactic Republic after its formation, as many of the worlds under the Empire would be placed under their sway.

This war mainly pitted the Rebel Alliance against the Galactic Empire. The Rebel Alliance consisted of various species and factions opposing Galactic Empire rule while their aim was to restore democracy, freedom and justice back into the galaxy.# Section 1\nThe Galactic Empire, led by Emperor Palpatine and Sith figures like Darth Vader, sought to maintain its authoritarian control of the galaxy through fear and military might. Stormtroopers represented the face of the Empire's military; massive war machines like the Death Star (a planet-destroying superweapon) also played an integral role. Furthermore, the Galactic Civil War had its roots planted during the Clone Wars that preceded it. Additionally, this war saw the turn of the Republic into the Empire due to Palpatine manipulating events for his power grab.\n\n# Section 2\nOne of the pivotal moments in the Galactic Civil War occurred at the Yavin Battle, when Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa made history by destroying the Death Star. This victory buoyed their morale while marking an epic setback for the Galactic Empire. Furthermore, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa emerged as symbols of hope for the rebellion as the war progressed.\n\n# Section 3\nNotable figures such as Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Lando Calrissian joined the Rebel Alliance, lending their unique skills and experiences to its cause. Furthermore, the Rebellion made alliances with other groups, such as the Ewoks of Endor, who became key to winning the Battle of Endor. While the Galactic Empire possessed superior military might, the Rebel Alliance relied on determination, resourcefulness, and an unyielding belief in freedom to combat their oppressors through guerrilla tactics, sabotage acts, and acts of heroism that gradually chipped away at its control.\n\n# Section 4\nAt Endor, the pivotal battle was won by the Rebel Alliance when they destroyed the second Death Star and dealt an incredible blow to Imperial morale, ultimately leading to Palpatine's downfall and fragmenting Imperial power. After the conclusion of the war, the New Republic was formed, which sought peace, justice, and reconciliation across the galaxy, although the transition was not without difficulties as remnants of the Empire still posed threats that threatened its fragile peace.\n\n# Conclusion\nOverall, the Galactic Civil War was more than mere warfare. It represented an ideological clash, the desire for freedom, and hope for a better future, with heroes making sacrifices that changed galactic history and laid a path for new hope.\n\n","meta":{"index":27,"author":"AlexJackz","name":"The Galactic Civil War","release_year":2024}},"Treaty of Coruscant":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Treaty of Coruscant was a treaty of peace to attempt to put the Great Galactic War to an end. This treaty was established in 3653 BBY, with an agreement that the Republic would withdraw their troops and the Jedi forces would abandon their claimed systems to their enemies. However, most powerhouses and factions of the Republic refused to recognize the Treaty of Coruscant, and continued to battle the Sith Empire.# Description\nThe Treaty of Coruscant was firstly proposed by the Dark Council, under leadership of the Sith Emperor, with this agreement stating that both the Sith Empire and the Republic would cease hostility between themselves, and that the Republic and the Jedi forces have to withdraw captured systems. It was eventually implemented in 3653 BBY, when the Republic’s Galactic Senate finally gave in out of desolation, even though they knew that it was possibly a sham, or that the Sith Empire had other motives behind this treaty. \n\nAfter a meeting was accepted by the Republic’s Galactic Senate, the Sith Empire and the Republic had their representatives and the conference was held on the planet Alderaan, with the goals of discussing the terms of peace. During the conference, the Sith Empire launched an unexpected assault on Coruscant, led by Darth Malgus. This conflict would later be known as Sacking of Coruscant, and this successfully placed Coruscant under the Sith Empire’s control. After this assault, the Republic reluctantly agreed on the treaty and the Sith Lord, who would later be known as Darth Baras, presented the signatures of the Republic’s officials, thus leading to an end of the Galactic Great War. The Treaty of Coruscant had harsh conditions, and the Republic’s officials were assigned a protocol droid to remind them of the terms that were agreed.\n\nFollowing the establishment of the Treaty of Coruscant, the Sith Empire was able to thrive, with no factions or opposing governing bodies able to object to it. This would lead to increased expansion of the Sith Empire. However, this agreement had raised opposing voices within the Republic, including the Jedi Master Dar’Nala, General Elin Garza of the Republic Military, and the Royal House of Alderaan. Due to the clashes in thought between many influential individuals, this created a new war, which then would be known as Galactic Cold War, between the Republic and the Sith Empire, with battles being both direct and by proxy.\n\n","meta":{"index":47,"author":"ShineEpic","name":"Treaty of Coruscant","release_year":2023}},"Origin of the Dreads":{"content":"# Article\nFollowing their study into the mysterious Phobis devices, they gained their reputation for surviving the observation of the devices. Even the most powerful and wicked of the Sith would go mad with terror due to the power of this artifact. They mastered their abilities over these artifacts and gained a powerful ally in the Sith Emperor whom they would begin to serve in the near future as generals, advisors, commanders, and even as prophets. They had spent many years in secluded meditation on Dromund Kaas, and were only interrupted to bring crucial wisdom to the Emperor or receive gifts in the form of supplicants. These powerful Sorcerers learned that they were now inseparable, remaining together as the Phobis devices bounded their power to the six of them. They would receive immense power when working in union together. They served in the front lines of the Great Galactic War, inflicting pain and projecting their terror upon their opponents. Such power allowed the Dreads to destroy entire fleets of the Republic. However, in order to secretly keep them protected from the Republic, the Dread Masters were stationed aboard an Imperial Dreadnaught. Their Dreadnaught’s location was eventually discovered by a Jedi Knight, Jaric Kaedan. Kaedan led a team of the Republic Special Forces division to infiltrate the Dreadnaught and capture the Six Sith Lords. The Six Sith were captured by the Republic, yet resisted all attempts at being interrogated, in which the Jedi soon learned they were centuries old at this point. The Sith Dreadnaught was destroyed, the Jedi relayed a false message stating that the Dread Masters were killed in action, but they were in fact, being held captive. The Jedi Council had hoped that because of this information, the Emperor would not send help to save the Dreads. The Jedi Council believed the Dreads were too valuable to the Republic, and could not be eliminated. Their imprisonment was the only probable answer for the Council, in which they would place the Dread Masters on Belsavis, where they would remain until way after the end of the Great Galactic War.

Billions upon billions of deaths, injuries, and casualties would be witnessed across the galaxy as a result of this brutal conflict leading to the downfall of the Sith Empire. It was also around this time that the Dark Lord of the Sith Naga Sadow exiled himself to the gas giant known as Yavin IV. A necessary conflict to allow for the rise of many notable Sith Lords such as Darth Vitiate to come into power in order to reestablish a better and reformed Sith Empire.# Prologue\nUpon suffering loss from their previous conflicts with the Galactic Republic known as the Great Schisms, the exiled Dark Jedi fled to the world of Korriban where they would enslave the native Sith species to do their bidding. With the usage of biotechnology alongside Sith Alchemy, the native species of Korriban was able to interbreed with the exiles, formulating a powerful sect of Dark Side users and leading to the creation of a Sith Empire trained in the Dark Side with the assistance of thriving technology and philosophy. As the years went on, the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic continued their operations, both factions unaware that the other even existed.\nThe existence of the Sith Empire remained a secret until two Republic explorers found themselves in the Sith-infested world of Korriban. Gav and Jori Daragon, the siblings that discovered this planet for themselves, had been in great debt for their antics in the past. As a way to make up for it, they were assigned to discover new and quicker hyperspace travel routes. Putting their trust in The Force, they had set random coordinates for hyperspace, hoping to find something to get them out of their dilemma. Their arrival was not a welcome one at all, seeing as they were just witnessing one of the greatest ascensions in history, the death of Marka Ragnos, and the challenges to succeed him amid battle known as Ludo Kressh and Naga Sadow. It wasn’t long until the siblings were captured and taken to the remote world of Ziost for interrogation. Believing the prisoners were Republic spies, Kressh and his powerbase proposed they be sentenced to death. Though Naga Sadow disagreed, instead he deduced that it may be possible to act as an ally to the siblings, grooming them as a resource for his use, and to deceive the Sith Lords that chose to sentence them to death. With the assistance of his Massassi warriors enhanced by alchemy, Sadow formed an escape plan for the siblings, claiming that they had been rescued by Republic agents in hopes that the Sith Lords would be given reason to engage in conflict with the Republic. However, that was a ploy of Naga Sadow so that he may take the explorers to his personal fortress located on the moon Khar Shian where he would delude them into thinking he was their ally. To do this, he taught Gav the ways of Dark sorcery, devising different reasons to keep Gav’s sister in the fortress.\n\nEventually, Kressh figured out the intentions of Naga Sadow and gathered his followers to rally on Sadow’s fortress to put a stop to his foolery. This is exactly what Naga Sadow wished for, a chance to defeat his rival for the Dark Lord of the Sith by wiping out Kressh and his followers at once. Sadow gave the directory for Jori to flee from the fortress to warn the Republic of a soon-to-come invasion. With Jori out the way, the Sith Lord let off a force that was swift to defeat his competition. With the death of his rival, Naga Sadow claimed the title of the Dark Lord of the Sith, succeeding Marka Ragnos. As for Gav, he would serve as the Apprentice to the Dark Lord, acting as the commander of all of the Sith Lord’s fleets. Making use of the homing beacon he had placed on the sibling’s ship, he began to rally his forces to begin the invasion of the Galactic Republic. Jori on the other hand made her way to the Koros system, where she would warn its Empress known as Teta of the coming Sith invasions. Empress Teta wasn’t so certain at first, but with the advice given to her by her Jedi Councilor Memit Nadill and his other fellow Jedi Masters, she decided to deliver warnings to Coruscant about the Sith invasion.\n\n# Sith Invasion\nThe Dark Lord established his base over the red supergiant at Primus Goluud, his eye meditation sphere being located right around the star. From there, he would deploy his fleets to conduct invasion upon multiple Republic spaces. Naga Sadow relied on quick and short victories, as well as surprise attacks on smaller Republic forces as he was well aware he could not take on the Republic Navy head-on. Opposed to deploying himself on the battlefield, Sadow used battle meditation to empower his invading forces. Over time, the Republic Navy was pushed back bit by bit, turning the tide of battle into the Dark Lord's favor. The Sith and the Republic engaged in a series of vital and crucial battles within the Coruscant System and the Koros System up until the major turning point of the war during the Battle of Koros.\n\n\nGav commanded and directed Sith forces during the Battle of Koros, such a conflict he attempted to seek out his sister Jori, knowing she would be present. The Dark Lord’s apprentice found his way into Arraba the Hutt’s starship repair dock. Gav’s Massassi warrior guards struck down Arraba believing he was a threat. Just as this occurred, Jori entered the sector leading her to the false conclusion that it was her twin brother that killed Arraba, a great friend of the family. Out of vengeance, Jori charged at her brother with a flurry of attacks using the lightsaber given to her by Jedi Padawan Odun-Urr. Gav survived the encounter and fled from the battle leaving the Sith without directory in battle which ultimately altered the conflict into the hands of the Republic. The apprentice of the Dark Lord returned to Sadow and decided to attack his meditation sphere, thus severing the focus he applied upon the Battle of Coruscant, transpiring quite a ways away. Once more, the Republic gained the advantage in the war as a result of disorganization among the Sith.\n\n# Destruction of the Sith Empire\nThere was something more to the Republic’s advantages, the knowledge that Naga Sadow used Force illusions to make it appear as if his armies were massive. The Republic Navy made use of this information and rallied on the fortress world Anaxes to launch a counterattack to drive the Sith Empire’s forces away from Coruscant. To do this, the Republic conducted a multitude of counterattacks on Kirrek and Thokos. Of course, the battles were not easy considering the billions of casualties, sacrifices had to be made. Jedi Master Ooroo was among those that made great sacrifices, as he managed to defeat a massive army of Massassi warriors during the Battle of Kirrek but met his fate and died in the hands of Odun-Urr in doing so. Due to this sacrifice, the Republic Navy was now able to deploy defense on Coruscant, forcing the Sith Empire to fall back to Koros Major. Sadow returned his forces to Primus Goluud but was pursued by Jori alongside Empress Teta and her fleet. Realizing that he was no match for Empress Teta and her fleet, he retreated off of his base in Primus Goluud, leaving Gav trapped within. The Dark Lord then used a superweapon on his flagship to destroy the giant star. Gav remained trapped, prepared to perish at any moment, but before his death, he transmitted both a warning to depart from the system and the coordinates to locate the Sith Empire to Empress Teta just moments before the star imploded destroying the base, Sadow’s meditation sphere, and Gav. \n\n\nNaga Sadow returned to the Sith Empire, met with the surprise that Ludo Kressh had survived and that his rally upon Sadow’s fortress was just a ruse formulated from his discovery of Sadow’s plan to make the Dark Lord believe that he had been dead all along. Even with the antics of Kressh, he died anyway when one of Naga Sadow’s ships collided with his own during the Battle over Korriban. The death of Ludo Kressh mattered not, he still had allies willing to fight in his name and thus, the Sith would battle each other on and over Korriban. Occupied by battle, the Sith fleets were annihilated by the Republic forces that had arrived over Korriban. Sadow fled once more and managed to barely survive, using his prowess in the Force and sorcery to destroy those that attempted to pursue him. The Sith Lord that pledged his fleet of Ch’hodos to Naga Sadow’s cause, Shar Dakhan would also retreat with the Dark Lord to assist his escape. With Sadow gone, the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic issued an invasion of all Sith worlds in order to eradicate any remaining bases or traces of the Sith. The Republic with the help of the Jedi Order traveled across the galaxy to conquer the remaining Sith territories. Shar Dakhan ordered his people to launch suicide attacks against the Republic and the Jedi Order to halt their invasions of Sith space. An abundance of Sith was killed in the process, but it was enough to drive off the invading Republic from Sith worlds.\n\n# The End of the War and the Aftermath\nBy the end of the Great Hyperspace War, a museum inspired by the valor of Master Ooroo was established by Odan-Urr. This museum’s foundation occurred on Ossus and would house a variety of libraries and artifacts both from Urr’s master and even Sith artifacts gathered from the war. In time, Ossus grew to be a fountain of knowledge consisting of Jedi archives, libraries, and even an academy. As a reward for the wonderful support provided to the Republic by the Jedi Order, the Galactic Senate provided an ancient mountain to the Jedi Order that would go from being just a simple meditation chamber to transformation into Jedi Temple on Coruscant following the Great Sith War in 3996 BBY. Empress Teta also received praise for her efforts in leading and defending her star system during the war, because of this, the star system was named after her.\n\n\n\nThe Sith were shattered at the end of the Great Hyperspace War, many of them being exiled to other planets such as Tund and Thule. Some even crash landing on planets such as Kesh where the Lost Tribe of the Sith was founded. Though, it was this war that allowed the Sith to reinforce and ensure the functionality of their tradition and custom among the galaxy. As for the Dark Lord of the Sith, Naga Sadow, he retreated to the fourth moon of Yavin where he remained hidden with his most loyal Massassi. He conducted many different gruesome experiments in hopes to extend his power but ultimately made the decision to use his sorcery to place his body in a state of inactivity. 600 years later, he would awaken and be killed by the former Jedi Freedon Nadd after he had gained the wisdom of the Dark Lord. The war would also lead to the rise of one of the most powerful Sith Lords known in history, Lord Vitiate. Vitiate had been one of the survivors of this devastating conflict and had coaxed thousands upon thousands of other Sith Lords to his homeworld of Nathema to engage in a ritual that allowed him to not only consume the essence of the Sith Lords, but the essence of the planet and its lifeforms entirely. With enough time, Vitiate led the remainder of the Sith Empire throughout the Unknown Regions where they discovered Dromund Kaas and a Sith colony that resided within. Utilizing his resources, Vitiate claimed himself as the Sith Emperor and reformed the Sith Empire on Dromund Kaas to what was known as the “Reconstituted Sith Empire,” a successor to the previous that had been demolished in the Great Hyperspace War.\n\n","meta":{"index":5,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Great Hyperspace War","release_year":2022}},"Tionese War":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Tionese War began around 24,000 BBY and ended at approximately 23,900 BBY. It ended in Republic victory and the dissolution of the Honorable Union of Desevro and Tion. Major skirmishes involved the Battle of Coruscant and Abhean.# Origins of the War\nAfter the demise of Xim the Despot to the Hutts in their wars, the Tionese were oppressed by the Hutts. This oppression led to a lack of technological advancements, meaning that the Tionese were falling behind other civilisations. Furthermore, the Hutts committed the “Devouring” of several Tionese expansions in the Kiirium Reaches. This assault on the Tionese was a result of the Tionese trying to ally with the powerful, industrial Galactic Republic.\n\nThe Galactic Republic was formed in 25,000 BBY by the Core Worlds. They had wealth and lots of industrial power but lacked military prowess. This was discovered by the Tionese when Republic scout ships were encountered transiting through the Perlemian Trade Route and contact was made. This led Desevro leaders to persuade the rest of the Tionese states to go to war with the wealthy, unprotected Republic, as they were seen as an easy target. The Jedi saw this alliance of Tionese states amass battle fleets and warned the newly founded Republic of possible Tionese action; this advice was ignored, and the Republic was caught unaware when the attacks began.\n\n# History of the War\nThe first act of war occurred down the Perlemian Trade Route, where the Tionise were successful in capturing Abhean, Roche, Lantilles, and Tirahann. They were met with little to no resistance, as the Republic was severely under defended. These captured planets spurred the Republic into mass production of battleships to create fleets to protect. The Tionese were successful in destroying a few of the stations where the ships were produced using new pressure bombs, but not all of them were destroyed. Now that the Republic had a force to defend with, along with the help of the Hutts, a century of war occurred along the Perlemian Trade Route. Eventually, the Jedi joined to lead the Republic forces to try and maintain a galactic rule. Due to the superior industrial might of the Republic, it was inevitable that the Tionese lost this war. This led to the Tionese resorting to sneak and suicide attacks on planets in the Divide.\nThese actions only angered the Republic which adopted a total war doctrine. Key Tionese worlds and Deservo were pounded with pressure bombs and bombardment from the Republic battle fleets, and the offer of unconditional surrender by Deservo was ignored; the attacks continued. This was the tactic used to try and get the other Tionese states to surrender through intimidation.\n\n# Afterrmath of the War\nThe Jedi were appalled by the treatment of Deservo and removed themselves from the Republic, yet still offered protection in particular locations. The Honorable Union of Deservo and Tion joined the Galactic Republic by 23,900 BBY, except for the independent Deservo, and became a standard sector of the Republic.\n\nThe aggression created by a centralised military produced by the Republic led Core regions to believe that a centralised military would bring instability to the Republic. This was met with many objections, notably the Jedi and the more vulnerable Rimworld systems, yet the fleets were downsized, and the next time a centralised force would be created was 15,000 BBY.\n\n","meta":{"index":61,"author":"gamer_doritos1","name":"Tionese War","release_year":2022}},"Darth Desolous Skirmishes":{"content":"# Introduction |\nThe Darth Desolous Skirmishes were a series of minor attacks against the Jedi Order led by the Pau’an Darth Desolous. These attacks occurred sometime after 3522 BBY but prior to the New Sith Wars. They have no certified start date or end date due to the overall insignificance of the skirmishes compared to other galactic conflicts.# Prelude |\nThe event which sparked this conflict was the expulsion of Desolous from the Jedi Order. This was done after Desolous began to enthrall himself in the teachings of the Sith and consequently fell to the Dark Side. Upon his expulsion, Desolous swore revenge against the whole Jedi Order and thus crowned himself Darth Desolous and the Dark Lord of the Sith. \n\nTo fuel his revenge, Desolous turned to his people, the Pau’ans. With their assistance, he raised an army that would be personally trained by him in his personal form of martial arts. This form utilized a cortosis shield in one hand and a melee weapon in the other. This style of combat was highly effective at countering the primary weapon of the Jedi; the Lightsaber.\n\n# The Skirmishes |\nWith his army assembled Darth Desolous began to enact his plan. This involved the strategic ambushing and assassination of Jedi Knights all across the galaxy. The martial art of the Pau’ans proved highly effective, allowing groups of Pau’ans to overwhelm and murder Jedi on a multitude of planets, their cortosis shields proving insurmountable to the unprepared Jedi. This targeted hit and run strategy led to an overwhelming number of victories for Darth Desolous, in all nearly 2,000 Jedi were snuffed out by his forces.\n\n# Decisive Strike |\nDesolous would not bask in his victories for long as despite the Jedi’s losses and their lack of planning for the conflict they were quick to adapt. This adaptation came in the form of exploiting Desolous’ biggest weakness; his hubris. With every victory, Desolous grew more prideful and as such bolder. This would be his downfall when Desolous deployed his forces and himself on the planet of Yaga Minor to confront a small group of Jedi Knights.\n\nAs soon as he had deployed his forces on the planet the trap was sprung. The Jedi emerged their fleet from hyperspace and cut off all avenues of escape from the planet. From there it was only a matter of time until Desolous and all of his men were cut down by the Jedi and their fleet. \n\nIt was alleged however that it took the entire Jedi Council to finish off Desolous, yet this statement was merely a ramble from the Simulacrum which held the visage of Desolous, yet to be disproven.\n\n","meta":{"index":46,"author":"ard1974","name":"Darth Desolous Skirmishes","release_year":2022}},"Sith-Imperial War":{"content":"# Introduction\nAfter their defeat during the First Galactic Civil War, the Sith-Imperial War would see the Galactic Empire return as the dominant power in the Galaxy. Darth Krayt, Dark Lord of the One Sith also known as the New Sith Order, would set out to destroy the New Jedi Order.\n\nFollowing the war, the Galactic Alliance would surrender, however it would save portions of its military and would be reforged into the Galactic Alliance Remnants. The Galactic Alliance Remnants were set on keeping up opposition against the Galactic Empire and the One Sith. However, the Sith would reveal their deception and take control of the Galactic Empire, thus causing Emperor Roan Fel and his followers to form the True Empire.# Section 1\nThe routes of the war could be traced back to the Ossus Project, during which the New Jedi Order would convince the Galatic Alliance to allow Yuuzhan Vong Shapers, to be headed by Master Shaper Nei Rin, to use a desolate part of Ossus where one of the Order ancient strongholds as a test site.\n\nThe intent of those who championed the project; such as Jedi Master Kol Skywalker wanted to see if the Yuuzha Vong terraforming methods, like those used centuries before to turn the planet of Coruscant into a temporary homeworld for the Yuuzhan Vong, could save and restore the desolate part of Ossus. Kol Skywalker thought that the terraforming method could be used to save and restore ailing worlds while also transforming the galaxy's view of the Yuzzhan Vong. The Project appeared to be work as the desolate part of Ossus was being restored to a vibrant life-bearing portion of the planate once more. With the Ultimate success of the initial part of the project, one hundred planets were selected for terraforming. The initial results were wondrous to watch. However, no one would think the One Sith would intervene, but the One Sith under the rule of Darth Krayt, and assisted by a renegade Yuuzhan Vong named Zenoc Quah would start to sabotage the terraforming projects. The sabotage would cause the planets to become deformed and start to grow painful bony growth not seen since the Yuuzhan Vong forcefully took populations as slaves.\n\nThe Yuuzhan Vong were shocked as the Ossus Project showed great success. However, the Jedi would suspect foul play, but both citizens and members of the Galatic Alliance would start to point fingers at the Yuuzhan Vong and blame them for the planets starting to become deformed. This was the Sith’s plan and it was working in their favor greatly. The Jedi knew the Yuuzhan Vong were innocent however the Jedi Order would ask the Alliance to accept the Project despite large public resistance to allow the Yuuzhan Vong to terraform planets. Eventually, the Alliance allowed the Yuuzhan Vong to work but once the Sith plan went into effect and started to show results members of the Alliance started to get angry and would leave the Alliance and declare neutrality.\n\nThis would lead to the Empire eventually declaring war against the Galactic Alliance.\n\n# Section 2\nFrom the beginning of the war, the Alliance was at a disadvantage. With the Alliance defending the Yuuzhan Vong it would lead many planets to leave the Alliance thus weakening them. Suddenly the Alliance was faced with suggestion movement as well as a war with the Empire. Thus the war began with the Empire holding every advantage. However, Emperor Roan Fel did not support the war he declared war reluctantly against the Alliance. His lack of support for the war would lead to him preventing his Imperial Knights from participating in the war. This would lead to the Empire despite having every advantage to start the war off on the wrong foot and take more losses than expected.\n\nMeanwhile, the Alliance would contact the Mandalorian, now under the leadership of Mand’alor Chernan Ordo. Ordo was contacted by the Alliance to hold the planet Botajef and its shipyards against the Imperial Military until the Alliance fleet could arrive to reinforce. However, during the Battle of Botajef, the Manalorians had a traitor among them by the name of Yaga Auchs. Yaga Auchs served an unknown master and was ordered to sabotage the communications between the Alliance and the Manadlorians. This sabotage would lead to the death of Mandalore and Yaga Auchs would take the title and become the next Mandalore. With Yaga Auchs as Mandalore, he would order a retreat and withdrawal of Mandalorian forces. This would leave Botajef for the Imperials to take and it would leave a few Manadlorians who refused to follow him stranded on Botajef with the Imperials closing in.\n\n# Section 3\nIn the year 128 ABY, one year into the war, things for the Empire were not going well despite the Alliance's disadvantage; the Jedi were more than making up for any loss of Alliance planets and military power. Another reason the war was going badly for the Empire was the fact that Emperor Fell refused to send his Imperial Knights into battle. This would cause the Empire to not have enough ability to counter the Jedi. Through the ruthlessness and ambition of the Director of Imperial Intelligence Grand Moff Nyna Calixte, the Sith would approach the Imperials and lend their aid to the Imperial Cause. Once the Sith openly voiced themselves the Jedi knew they were behind the sabotage of the terraforming projects, but due to how quickly events progressed the Jedi were unable to prove that the Sith were behind the sabotage of the Yuuzhan Vong’s terraforming. Eventually, members of the Imperial Camp, where even Emperor Fel himself would realize what was done, but it was far too late to halt the plans of the Sith. Emperor Fel personally hated the Sith but he was overruled in objections of an alliance with the Sith by the Moff Council as no Emperor had ruled absolutely since the days of Palpatine. The Moff Council was eager to use any advantage they had at their disposal so they could bring Imperial dominance to the galaxy once more. Once the Yuuzhan Vong knew of the Sith sabotage they knew it was no longer the work of their gods and they were determined to reverse the effects of the sabotage of the Sith.\n\n# Section 4\nThe Battle of Caamas took place after three bloody years of war had raged on. The Alliance was all but a spent force while the Sith only grew in power and strength and would eventually start producing their starfighters. Under the command of Grand Admiral Morlish Veed, who was Calixte’s lover and participant in the Sith conspiracy. Grand Admiral Veed would deal a crushing blow to the Alliance fleet at Caamas causing Admiral Gar Stazi to order a fighting retreat to save his ships. Veed’s victory announcement essentially brought an end to the war altogether. With the Alliance forces in tatters, the Alliance was left with nothing to defend Coruscant and was forced to surrender.\n\n\nWith the war coming to an end the Jedi still stood in defiance of the Empire and the Sith. Emperor Fel would call upon the Jedi Order to surrender itself to the will of the Empire; some Jedi would surrender and join the Imperial Knights while others refused to surrender. The Jedi who refused to ally with the Empire and the Sith would withdraw from Coruscant to their Temple on Ossus. The Sith would eventually follow the Jedi to Ossus, where Darth Nihl would lead a brutal attack with the Imperial forces under the command of Moff Rulf Yage. The massacre left the Jedi scattered across the galaxy but not fully defeated as the Sith attacked before the whole order could gather on Ossus. This would cause various Jedi to go into hiding across the Galaxy.\n\n# Section 5\nShortly after the war the Sith were determined to rule the galaxy directly. This would lead to the Sith launching a deadly palace coup against Emperor Fel and his Imperial Knights. This attack launched on Emperor Fel and his Imperial Knights was successful and would lead to Darth Krayt taking the Imperial Throne and reestablishing a New Sith Empire for the first time in over a century.\n\nHowever, some worlds and systems choose to stay loyal to Emperor Fel and his Imperial Knights. Emperor Fel would eventually manage to the fortified world of Bastion and would turn it into the new Imperial capital. By taking Bastion and making it the Empire’s capital, he created a racial faction to fight against the Sith–thus plunging the galaxy into Civil War once again. Later Emperor Fell would create an Alliance with the Galactic Alliance Remnants to fight against the Sith. The Jedi would later join the Alliance created between Fel’s Empire and the Alliance Remnants, but in an unanticipated event, Darth Krayt himself was seemingly killed by his advisor after a duel with a female Jedi and an ancient Sith Lord.\n\n","meta":{"index":57,"author":"AlexanderWestley","name":"Sith-Imperial War","release_year":2024}},"The Fall of the Galactic Empire":{"content":"# Section 1\nThe Battle of Endor marked the initiation of the collapse of the Galactic Empire’s collapse. Emperor Palpatine had planned a trap to eliminate the rebels and end the Galactic Civil War at Endor. However, the Rebel Alliance proved to be the stronger, or at least luckier, force. The Battle of Endor led to the rebels destroying the second version of the Death Star with help from Luke Skywalker and events within the Death Star itself. This event also resulted in  Palpatine’s death.# Section 2\nWith  Palpatine’s death,  the Empire began a small spiral of chaos,  later escalating to complete collapse and defeat.  Emperor Plapatine's death led many to continuously revolt against the Empire. The Imperial forces rushed to restore and maintain or keep authority in the galaxy,  aiming to control resources. Remnants of the Empire faced difficulties retaining control over planets,  resulting in the loss of territories and entire systems over time.\n\n# Section 3\nEmperor Palpatine had formulated a contingency plan for his death. Unbeknownst to the Empire, this plan called for the full destruction of the Empire via orbital bombardment. This plan was devised and implemented because Palpatine believed the Empire couldn’t thrive after his death. Emperor Palpatine also considered the destruction of the Empire vitally important to pave the way for a new order to rise in its place of the Empire.\n\n# Section 4\nThe Battle of Jakku marked the final official battle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. Despite the Empire being in complete disarray, their forces rallied to challenge the Rebel Alliance. If the Empire were to beat the Rebel Fleet and Army at Jakku, they might stand a chance to execute the Emperor’s contingency plan. However, the Rebel Alliance proved to be the better force at Jakku that day. The defeat of Imperial forces at Jakku signaled the end of the official Imperial faction. However, the Empire's small forces and holdout factions persisted, attempting to prosper and even attack and raid rebel forces.\n\n","meta":{"index":59,"author":"tiger0989","name":"The Fall of the Galactic Empire","release_year":2024}},"First Alsakan Conflict":{"content":"# Overview\nThe First Alsakan Conflict was the first of seventeen engagements between Alsakan and Coruscant, planets that fought over the expansion region for colonization and natural resources.

The species eventually left their ruined galaxy after destroying their own between war and resource hunting. It got so bad they weren't even able to use the force because their home planet wouldn't let them after dying out.# Section 1\nThe Yuuzhan Vong were a very powerful race known for being warriors and force users. They infamously hated machines and went on a crusade taking over the Yuuzhan Vong galaxy while exterminating all droid races and other general life forms. But with so much of the galaxy in their hands, other factions of the Yuuzhan Vong galaxy began to clash, destroying many planets in the process. One of the planets they destroyed was their home planet, Yuuzhan'tar. The exact way it was destroyed is unknown, but due to the symbiotic relationship they had to the planet, when it was destroyed they lost the ability to connect to the force and experienced great pain.\n\n# Section 2\nThe end of the war came when Yo’gand dropped a moon on a planet Steng was allied with. After the war, the race once again united as one and became the Supreme Overlord of the Yuuzhan Von. After the war, Yo’gand was seen as a war hero and was greatly acknowledged for dropping the moon on Steng. Unfortunately, not long after the war, the Yuuzhan Vong became extremely violent, especially towards each other. It got so bad that Yo’gand had to strip them of the ability to even \ntouch the force. Yo’gands solution to this problem was to use pain and worship it, as well as find ways to “heal” through it.\n\n# Section 3\nA member of the Intendant caste, Shimrra Jamaane, slowly started to realize his foolishness and began trying to find another way to unite his race.

He is a Tionese nobleman who became a pirate chief. These campaigns happened during the Pre-Republic Era; specifically between 25,150 BBY and 25,130 BBY. The outcome of these events allowed Xer to become King of Cron and conquer all of the Tion Cluster, located within the Outer Rim territories.# Context  |\nThousands of years before the campaigns came to be; specifically during 27,000 BBY, human colonists arrived and settled on the planets within the Tion Cluster, which was back then ruled by the Rakata Infinite Empire; the first major galactic power before the Republic. After the Rakatan Civil War was over, the Empire was expelled from the majority of its colonies and left its advanced technology to its slaves. By the time it was 25,200 BBY; the year Xer was born, the humans who resided in the Tion Cluster had formed three states: The Kingdom of Cron, The Kingdom of Barseg, and the Livien League. All three Empires rule specific areas of the Cluster, but Cron had the biggest territories out of the three.\n\nXer was born on the planet Argai, a planet belonging to the Kingdom of Cron. Although he was born into nobility, he shifted to piracy–something commonly done in Argai–and later became a pirate chieftain. To seize the attention of the Lord of Argai, he went out to conquer the planet Dravione and proclaimed himself the leader of the Kingdom of Argai. Xer then decided to expand his kingdom further and began to move into the Ihala Route, where he managed to expand his kingdom into Panna within a decade. Noticing the Kingdom of Argai’s rapidly increasing power, King Ferece of Cron summoned Xer to offer him the pirate-lord title in exchange for his fealty. Xer took offense to the offer and began to perceive Ferece and his court as weak and therefore decided to take over the Kingdom of Cron.\n\n# Xer's Conquests |\nThe first move Xer made for the conquest of Cron was to assemble at Panna, where he destroyed a Cronese fleet at Duinarbulon. He then proceeded to conquer the planet Chandaar, which forced King Ferece to flee. As the newly proclaimed King of Cron, Xer began taking noble heirs and warlords as hostages because he found them useful. Those who were deemed otherwise had their entire families destroyed by Xer’s hand. Within his time as King, Xer had a son named Xim, who quickly gained a fearful reputation within the Coronese Sweeps because of the massacre he did on Timber Palace of Pasmin and also eradicating the High Fane of Xo on Nuswatta, who then converted it into a theocracy to his father’s service. \n\nXer and his fleet managed to expand his kingdom into the entirety of the Coronese Sweeps, housing a destructive navy under his command. He wanted to conquer beyond his territory and planned to target the Three Allied Kingdoms. With the help of his alliance of Cadinth, Jaminere, and Barseg, Xer did a flank and later moved along the Cadinth Run, which resulted in conquering the three kingdoms and additional planets such as Arcan IV, Corlax 4, and Lianna. Regardless of his recent victory, Xer went out and conquered regions beyond the Ihala Spiral, moving up the spiral from Algor, he managed to conquer the planets Caluula, Brigia, and Tion. In the aftermath of his conquest, Xer and his army settled on Raxus Prime and began building royal palaces, and used its inhabitants as his concubines and retainers. Raxus Prime then lost its name and came to be known as the Circlet of Tion. \nDuring Xer’s conquests, one faction managed to successfully defy Xer’s kingdom: the Livien League. They were a confederation built around the planets of Livien, Desvero, and Kanaver. Xer attempted to conquer the faction while moving into them through Corlax and Barseg, but was unfortunately defeated by the League; therefore pausing his overall conquests.\n\n# Aftermath |\nXer realized that he over-stretched himself after his defeat against the Livien League, which prompted the suspension of his conquests to rebuild and forge Cron into a more powerful Empire. He managed to extend his kingdom’s hyperspace beacons along the Black Spiral and Cadinth Run and successfully created a bureaucracy. Even though he managed to create a successful and powerful Empire, Xer was hungry for more territory and still wished to conquer the Livien League. Fortunately, his son, later on, went out and managed to defeat the League and satisfied his father’s original goals.\n\n","meta":{"index":16,"author":"RavMalvern","name":"Xer's Campaigns","release_year":2022}},"The Ruusan Reformation":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Ruusan Reformation was an event that would restructure the entire Galactic Republic following the New Sith Wars. The purpose of the Ruusan Reformation was to take all power away from the Supreme Chancellor and give it to the Galactic Senate in an effort to demonstrate more democracy.# Reformation\nThe reforms were enacted by the then-Chancellor Tarsus Valorum, where the reformation  would cause the Republic Measures & Standards Bureau to rest the year to zero to the year of the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, which would later be known as 1000 BBY by the Galactic Standard Calendar.\n\nWith the reformation, it seemed that the system of government didn’t change too drastically. However, the Jedi Order underwent heavy adjustments. The Jedi would take symbolic measures, largely to convince the Republic that they would not become a conquering army. The Jedi would abandon their Battle Armor and would dissolve their Commander-in-Chief rank and other titles like “Jedi Lord”. The Jedi would also dissolve all army, naval, and starfighter forces and place themselves under the watch of the Supreme Chancellor and the Judicial Department, which would effectively dissolve the military.\n\n\nTo lessen the chance of Sith resurgence, the Jedi Order would start training children from birth. In addition, all Padawans would be centralized on Coruscant to prevent unsupervised Padawans from delving into forbidden Sith knowledge.\n\nPolitically, the reformation would affect the representation within the Senate to help reduce corruption and decentralize power away from the powerful Core world sectors that would hold the most representation within the Senate. Chancellor Valorum would take the then-millions of sectors, and would reformulate them to an orderly 1,024 sectors. With the reductions of sectors, Chancellor Valorum would grant each sector a Senator. However, there would be a few exceptions made for more powerful core worlds to retain their representation.\n\n# Conclusion\nThe Ruusan Reformation would put an end to the Republic Dark Age, where it would be considered the start of a Golden Age of the  Republic. Eventually,Palpatine's declaration of a new order thus marked the transition from the Galactic Republic to the Galactic Empire. Simultaneously, Darth Bane’s Sith Order would undergo its own reformation–thus organizing the Rule of Two.\n\n","meta":{"index":56,"author":"AlexanderWestley","name":"The Ruusan Reformation","release_year":2024}},"First Jedi Purge":{"content":"# Introduction |\nSometime after the Jedi Civil War ended, the First Jedi Purge took place. From 3,954 BBY to 3,951 BBY, almost the entire Jedi Order disappeared from the galaxy, disbanded and slain by the Sith. The purge began during the events of the Sith Civil War when Darths Traya, Sion, and Nihilus took command of what remained of Revan’s Sith Empire. Shortly after Darth Traya was exiled from control, Darth Sion led his Sith Assassins to search and destroy the Jedi, while Nihilus consumed the life of a planet in an attempt to exterminate the present Jedi. Although the purge was branded a success, it came to an end when the Jedi Exile, Meetra Surik, killed the three perpetrators of the purge and trained a new generation of Jedi.# Context - The Fall of the Jedi |\nBy the time it was 3,956 BBY, the Jedi had experienced three galaxy-spanning wars in a span of fifty years and were heavily worn out. The aftermath of all those conflicts weakened the Jedi and became a shadow of their former selves. The following events that led to their status were the following: the Great Sith War, the Mandalorian Wars, and the Jedi Civil War. Due to how sudden and close these wars were, the Jedi never got the opportunity to rebuild and were unable to sustain their impactful losses. \n\nAside from a weakened force, the Jedi suffered a major loss of knowledge, because of the destruction of learning centers such as the Great Jedi Library of Ossus & the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine. Within these incidents, holocrons, records, and histories were lost, destroyed, or stolen during the previous battles. This resulted in numerous Jedi who lacked the proper experience to teach aspiring students and a lack of knowledge to use for their training.\n\nWhen the Jedi Civil War ended, the Jedi Order barely any Jedi remained alive, as less than 100 individuals survived and attempted to rebuild their faction. Because the Galactic Republic was also on the brink of collapse, the Jedi crumbled alongside them. They offered the recently redeemed Revan assistance to rebuild, but he denied their pleas. The overall status of the Jedi Order provoked high levels of disillusion amongst their ranks, and the Jedi themselves–including the High Council– began to lose faith, because most of their numbers had fallen to the Dark Side.\n\nContext - Rise of the Perpetrators\n\nEver since Darth Malak died and the Star Forge was decimated, the Sith Empire also began to suffer collateral damage within their infrastructure. The surviving Dark Jedi–Jedi who have recently fallen to the Dark Side–killed each other in an attempt to assert dominance, while the remaining followers of Revan’s Empire secretly remained in power; some of them still lingering on the Sith planet Malachor V. One of the bases they resided in was the Trayus Core, the heart of the Trayus Academy. Inside, the Sith Lords; Darth Traya, Darth Nihilus, and Darth Sion, developed a strategy to rebuild their numbers. In doing so, the Sith Triumvirate was founded and proceeded to conduct a shadow war with only one goal: Exterminating every living Jedi throughout the galaxy.

As time passed, their actions began to escalate and affect the few remaining members of the Jedi order.\n\nWhile the Sith Triumvirate was recently founded, the Jedi were undergoing a chaotic period. Surviving members began to step down and go off-grid, never to be heard of again. Ongoing gatherings began to disappear as well, which suddenly left a high disturbance in the Force that few high-ranking members–the Jedi High Council– could sense. This disturbance led to a prediction that they were being hunted. This gave rise to a secret conclave on the planet Katarr, hosted by Jedi Master Atris, though its secrecy came to disappear. Atris intentionally leaked information about the conclave to draw their attackers out from the shadows. To answer that grave mistake, Darth Nihilus arrived on the planet and consumed the life force of Karr and every living being residing in it. Only one survived this catastrophe, Visas Marr, who was then taken as an apprentice by Darth Nihilus. Based on the Conclave of Katarr’s aftermath, the remaining Jedi High Councilors went into exile, believing that the Triumvirate would be baited into a false victory and reveal themselves.\n\n# Context - Rise of the Perpetrators |\nEver since Darth Malak died and the Star Forge was decimated, the Sith Empire also began to suffer collateral damage within their infrastructure. The surviving Dark Jedi–Jedi who have recently fallen to the Dark Side–killed each other in an attempt to assert dominance, while the remaining followers of Revan’s Empire secretly remained in power; some of them still lingering on the Sith planet Malachor V. One of the bases they resided in was the Trayus Core, the heart of the Trayus Academy. Inside, the Sith Lords; Darth Traya, Darth Nihilus, and Darth Sion, developed a strategy to rebuild their numbers. In doing so, the Sith Triumvirate was founded and proceeded to conduct a shadow war with only one goal: Exterminating every living Jedi throughout the galaxy. They began manipulating incidents from the shadows, arising on Republic planets that can highly jeopardize them should they fall. As time passed, their actions began to escalate and affect the few remaining members of the Jedi order.\n\nWhile the Sith Triumvirate was recently founded, the Jedi were undergoing a chaotic period.

One of the known survivors of the purge was Meetra Surik, who was given the alias of the Jedi Exile–for disobeying the orders of the High Council during the Mandalorian Wars– returned to aid the Galactic Republic. She was picked up by The Harbinger Republic Cruiser, where they suddenly received a distress call to assist a vessel. Arriving at the coordinated location, they discovered the Ebon Hawk and a Sith warship adrift in space, where they boarded the warship in search of survivors. The results of the boarding were that it was empty, but brought aboard a corpse; unbeknownst it was Darth Sion they allowed into their ship. The next few days that were spent roaming space, the Harbinger’s crew felt they were being watched and experienced suspicious activity. As such activities became a common thing within the cruiser, Darth Sion finally awoke and began killing all Republic officers on board alongside concealed Sith Assassins; who secretly boarded the ship. The Harbinger was then taken over by the Sith and jumped into hyperspace, bringing everyone on board to their unknown destination. During this incident, Surik was extracted via the Ebon Hawk and attempted to flee the massacre.\n\nDays after the takeover, Meetra Surik woke up in a mining facility, unsure of how she arrived. She met an old woman who introduced herself as Jedi Master Kreia–Darth Traya–and guided Surik to escape the facility. Their prison was abandoned, except for a prisoner named Atton Rand and a droid. It did not take long for a Sith Lord to arrive at the mine. Kreia, Surik, and Atton managed to board the Ebon Hawk and set a course for Telos IV, and survived a chase from Sion and an explosion within an asteroid field; only to once more get trailed by the Sith.\n\nWhen the Ebon Hawk arrived at the orbital station of Telos, they were detained for the mining facility’s destruction. Fortunately, they were cleared off by security, but their ship got stolen and they were refused to use another vessel. Being forced to go down into Telos, they were shot down by air turrets but were pulled out by its creator, a Zabarak named Bao-Dur. They learned that the Ebon Hawk was taken to the old planetary aqueducts in Telos’ polar region, so they journeyed to that location. \n\nWhen inside the system, they were detained by the Last Handmaiden–Brianna– and her three sisters, because they accidentally intruded into the secret Telosian Jedi Academy. Surik requested an audience with the facility head; Jedi Master Atris and was allowed to meet with her. After arguing about Surik’s actions within the Mandalorian Wars, they were allowed to leave, while also stealing Atris’ database and navigational charts. Thanks to the database, they were able to identify where the last five Jedi Masters were hiding: Atris (Telos), Kavar (Onderon), Vrook Lamar (Dantooine), Zez-Kai Ell (Nar Shaddaa), and Lonna Vash (Korriban). Surik decided to travel to those five planets in search of answers to why she was exiled.\n\n# The Lost Jedi |\nAfter finding and conversing with the Jedi Masters, Meetra Surik returned to Dantooine to find the ruined Jedi Enclave. She found all the masters she met–excluding Lonna Vash for she was killed in Korriban–where they would decide her fate. Before the newly formed Council could strip the Exile of the Force, Jedi Master Kreia barged into the meeting and made the Masters feel the pain Surik felt when she was in Malachor V; which left them dead and void from the Force.\n\nSurik was able to recover from her stasis and chased after Kreia, who once again took the mantle of Darth Traya. She traveled to Telos once again to search for her. Amid her chase, she was forced to fight against Atris, who was corrupted by the Dark Side by the academy’s holocrons. After being defeated by the Exile, Atris was persuaded to forgive her and see the truth behind the actions that led to her exile. Atris then informed Surik that Traya fled to Malachor V and was expecting her, and proceeded to exile herself after Surik left.\n\n# End of the Purge |\nShortly after Surik left Atris, a Sith fleet led by Darth Nihilus arrived at Telos, as he was drawn into the secret academy. With the help of Mandalore Canderous Ordo and his followers, Meetra Surik boarded and engaged Nihilus on his ship, so Telos does not meet the same fate as Katarr. Darth Nihilus’ apprentice, Visas Marr sided with Surik and her allies and successfully defeated the Sith Lord and later traveled alongside them to Malachor V.\n\nThe Exile and her allies arrived at Malachor V and later proceeded to the Trayus Academy, fighting off storm beasts, Sith Warriors & Assassins along the path. They later confronted Darth Sion, where he was defeated after a long and intense duel against Meetra Surik. She then helped Sion realize that his master, Darth Traya, was using him and did not care about his fate. Surik also convinced Sion to let go of his hate; the feeling that kept him alive, which caused him to succumb to all of his injuries and died out of fear of letting his power go. \n\nNow with Sion defeated, Meetra Surik finally confronted Darth Traya, where the Sith Lord was defeated. Surik decided to spare Traya’s life, but she did not wish to give up and attacked once more. She failed once more, but the Exile allowed Traya to redeem herself from the Dark Side. Before she gave her life to the Force, Kreia told Surik information about Revan’s location in the Unknown Regions, alongside the fates of her, her allies, and the planets they visited. With the Sith Triumvirate finally defeated, Meetra Surik restored the Jedi Order and left the Galactic Republic in the hands of the Lost Jedi that she trained, to find Revan, located within the Unknown Regions.\n\n","meta":{"index":18,"author":"RavMalvern","name":"First Jedi Purge","release_year":2022}},"Time of Rot":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Time of the Rot was a period of approximately nine hundred and sixty years of civil war between the various factions within the Lost Tribe of the Sith. The Rot began in the year 3960 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin) on the planet of Kesh shortly after the death of the Grand Lord Lillia Venn during the Night of the Upside-Down Meteor. The Night of the Upside-Down Meteor was a skirmish between a stranded Jedi and Lillia Venns troops. Lillia Venn ultimately perished in this battle and caused an enormous power vacuum to form within the Lost Tribe.# The Rot\nThe news of Lillia Venn’s death spread throughout the tribe like wildfire. Many of Lillia Venn’s former rivals, Lords, and High Lords all attempted to become the new Grand Lord. Eventually, one of Lillia’s former enemies managed to secure her place on the throne, Candra Kitai became the Grand Lord for a very short time. During this time the only achievement she managed was the closure of the zoo in Tahv, the capital city of Keshtah Minor. Kitai, being unable to unite the ever splintering factions of the tribe, was eventually overthrown and most likely killed. After this, two main factions, the Red Faction and the Gold Faction, formed and vied for the throne. It is unknown how long the Red and Gold Factions held together as much of the history during this time went undocumented or was destroyed in battles. By 3000 BBY, the Red and Gold Factions had splintered into around 20 factions.\n\n# Testament Day\nTestament Day was the singular day in all of the Time of the Rot where fighting would cease and all the factions leaders would meet. Testament Day was held in Tahv once every twenty-five years and all the leaders of the various factions would meet peacefully to hear a message from the founder of the tribe, Yaru Korsin. In the year 3000 BBY, a few days before Testament Day, Iliana Merko, the leader of one of the splinter factions, the Sisters of Seelah, attempted to coerce Varner Hilts, the current historian of the tribe, into opening the Sith Holocron that contained Korsin’s message and altering it to favor the Sisters of Seelah. Varner Hilts lied to Iliana, stating that the Holocron could only be opened on Testament Day. The Sisters presence in Tahv attracted the attention of three other factions, Force 57, the Korsinite League, and the Golden Destiny. The members of these factions ambushed the Sisters in the Circle Eternal, which was a sacred meeting place for the tribe. Varner Hilts attempted to end the fighting by offering to read the founder's testament early, however, the Korsinite League opposed the reading of the Testament prior to Testament Day. Hilt’s assistant, Jaye Vuhld, revealed that the calendar of Kesh was actually eight days behind the Galactic Standard Calendar. This new information allowed for the Testament to legally be read early. While the testament didn’t really do anything other than keep the factions from killing each other, Hilt discovered that Korsin’s message was actually recorded over a previous recording. Hilt managed to uncover this recording which revealed that the founders of the tribe were actually slaves to the Red Sith and the Sith Empire. This inglorious past discredited the widely believed theory that the founders were ancient conquerors. In a vain attempt to cover up this terrible truth, Iliana destroyed the Holocron herself.\n\n# The Great Crisis\nDespite the attempts to cover up the truth of their past, the tribe's factions quickly found out the truth of their ancestors. This news drove much of the tribe into a homicidal frenzy which resulted in many of Keshtah’s cities being burned to the ground and many, many, casualties from both warriors and civilians. This crisis  threatened the entire continent of Keshtah Minor and its occupants. While the tribe continued to riot and murder, Hilt, Jaye, and Iliana traveled to the long sealed Sith Temple of Kesh following the words spoken from the Holocron which mentioned secrets behind the throne. After much difficulty finding the vaults that held the secrets mentioned, the trio discovered that the secrets were actually a map that depicted a much larger continent on Kesh, known as Keshtah Major or Alanciar. Hilt quickly realized that this map and the idea of conquest could unite all the factions and bring an end to The Rot. Meanwhile, the crisis had begun to end with the majority of the Sith aligning with the Golden Destiny Faction so they could destroy the Omen, which was the ship the founders had crash landed on Kesh in, and expunge the terrible history of their ancestors. The Golden Destiny’s plan was to collapse the Sith Temple, which was directly above the Omen and would destroy it from above. On their way to the Sith Temple, they encountered Hilt’s trio. Golden Destiny engaged in a skirmish with Iliana which resulted in the death of Jaye before Hilt could reveal his new discovery and end the battle. Hilts successfully managed to convince the factions of the tribe to cease the fighting in order to conquer Keshtah Major. Hilts was subsequently elected as the new Grand Lord with Iliana becoming his Grand Consort and later the commander of the Tribes Military. With the Tribe successfully united under a common goal and a new Grand Lord, the Rot had come to an end in the year 3000 BBY.\n\n# The Legacy\nUnder Grand Lord Hilt’s leadership, the tribe quickly rebuilt Keshtah Minor and restored it to its previous glory. This time period of rebuilding would be remembered for generations to come as the Hilts Restoration. Hilts, taking the past mistakes into account, structured the order of the Tribe so that there would always be a successor to the Grand Lord so as to heavily reduce the possibility of a second Rot. In a testament meant to rule the Tribe, Hilts outlined the new structure of order and outright banned open warfare. Hilts also mandated that power would be earned and not inherited. This caused conflict within the ruling families to diminish over time. This testament led to the peace of the tribe for generations to come. Even through the first challenge of annexing Keshtah Major, which was a militaristic society molded specifically to keep the Sith out. In an invasion led by High Lord Bentado, the Sith managed to destroy the leaders of Keshtah Major and take the land for themselves.\n\n","meta":{"index":49,"author":"60328","name":"Time of Rot","release_year":2023}},"Candorian Plague":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Candorian Plague was a contagious disease that formed after the outbreak of the Blue Shadow Virus. The plague was well known because of  the constant epidemics it triggered.# Section I\nDuring the Draggulch Period, the plague had diminished multiple colonies within The Slice. A few years passed and then came the rise of the Republic Dark Age and the Old Republic was at the brink of death. Because of this, a strain of the Candorian Plague spread across the galaxy. This newfound strain wiped out two-thirds of the major cities across the galaxy. However, it seemed to hit the strongest in the Grumani sector, which later led to the demise of Sanrafsix and Alphoresis. Around 1060 BBY, Mandalore was the next victim of the plague and it was later found in ruins.\n\n# Section II\nIn 46 BBY, Candoria fell, which eventually led to the extinction of the disease. During the Clone Wars, a Separatist scientist, Nuvo Vindi, discovered a sample of the disease and used it to try and make a bioweapon. Which was later used by the Galactic Empire against rebellious planets such as Dentaal. The Galactic Empire attacked Dentaal in 0 ABY, after they expelled Governor Taliff and declaring independence from the Empire. Over the span of two months the whole planet had been wiped out and the Empire later claimed that the plague was a Rebel plot to use against the Empire.\n\n","meta":{"index":29,"author":"ElysiaLValkyrie","name":"Candorian Plague","release_year":2023}},"Darth Vader's Purge":{"content":"# Introduction\nAfter Order 66 comes into effect, a small group of Jedi, unwilling to live in constant fear, decide to meet and discuss what they can do against the Empire and the Sith.

The war started in 2000 BBY in the Fourth Great Schism and ended in 1000 BBY in the Seventh Battle of Ruusan. During these wars, the Sith rose to the point of almost overwhelming the Republic after the Battle of Mizra.# The Conflict\nAfter the last Alsakan Conflict, a former Jedi Master known as Phanius turned to the Dark Side as Darth Ruin because of his dark thoughts, being the first Dark Lord of the Sith after almost one thousand years. The New Sith Wars started with the Fourth Great Schism when Darth Ruin reformed the New Sith Empire by uniting Sith clans and converting Jedi Knights to the Dark Side. Although Darth Ruin was killed later by his teammates, the Republic was in danger; the Sith were back.\nThe Republic was defeated and overwhelmed in most of the wars that occurred, but the Sith units were fewer and fewer due to the Sith Civil War, making it easier for the Jedi. After the Sith Civil War, a new Sith group would emerge, and it was the Brotherhood of Darkness, created by former Jedi Master, Sith Lord Skere Kaan. \n\nAfter the Brotherhood of Darkness was created in 1010 BBY, a new conflict known as the Light and Darkness war started, where Kaan’s forces fought Hoth and Farfalla’s army in a decade of wars. During the last decade of the New Sith Wars, the Brotherhood of Darkness was inferior to the Army of Light and as a last recourse in their last engagement, Skere Kaan used the Thought Bomb to eradicate every Jedi and Sith in its radius. \nAfter such an explosion, the Jedi thought they had won the Seventh and last battle of Ruusan, but they were wrong, as only one Sith survived; Darth Bane. With the presumed destruction of the Sith, Darth Bane reformed the Sith with the new Rule of Two, taking Darth Zannah as his apprentice.\n\n# Timeline\n1800 BBY, Battle of Uba IV: The Republic bombarded the Uba system and almost eliminated the Ubease species.

Despite Anakin’s mixed feelings towards this, the young Jedi Knight had fallen victim to The Sith Lords deception and thus convinced him to fall to the dark side of the force. After Anakin had informed Mace Windu of the Chancellor's treachery, the Jedi Master along with some other Jedi had encountered him in his office hoping to strike him down and end his rule over the republic for good. Mace Windu had bested the Sith Lord in combat Leaving him severely scarred from his own force lightning and helpless. Unexpectedly, Anakin had entered the office in an attempt to convince the Jedi Master to stay his blade and instead allow him to stand trial. Mace Windu on the other hand was ready to strike down the Sith Lord and hastily Anakin had stepped in igniting his saber and cutting off the Jedi Master's hand allowing the soon to be Emperor to finish him off brutally. Shaken and unsure of what he had done Anakin had kneeled to the Sith Lord, officially becoming his apprentice and stepping into the dark side of the Force. Darth Sidious had set his new apprentice a task on the planet of Mustafar to slaughter the remaining members of the Confederacy Of Independent Systems.# Section 1\nUpon leaving Coruscant Anakin would take his flight to Mustafar eliminating the remaining Separatists alongside a few battle droids. During this however Jedi Master Kenobi would be informed of Anakin's treason shortly after killing General Grievous and arriving at the Coruscant Jedi Temple to seek Master Yoda in hopes of finding an explanation as to why the events of Order 66 have occured and why the clones had suddenly displayed such hostility towards the Jedi Master. Upon reaching the Archives Master Yoda would discover a recording of the Fallen Jedi Knight slaughtering the younglings. Obi-Wan, filled with disbelief, would seek out Padme in hopes of finding answers to Anakin's whereabouts. Padme, knowing where Anakin had gone, decided to fly to Mustafar seeking explanations for Anakin's betrayal. Anakin, surprised and filled with joy to see her, had tried explaining that the Jedi were corrupt and he and the Chancellor had plans for a new and safer empire. Padme did not understand this and had feared that Anakin was corrupted by the Chancellor, filled with rage Anakin started force choking Padme upon finding out that Obi-Wan had followed Padme believing that they were there to end him.\n\n# Section 2\nObi-Wan could not believe what he witnessed and fully convinced of Anakin's treason he ignited his saber provoking the Sith to strike back. The duel would carry on for quite some time with Obi-Wan trying to make attempts at bringing him back to the light.

This conflict took place a millennium after the Great Hyperspace War. These stories tell that the Crusade was led by the Krath, a dark side cult, going against the Jedi Order. The crusade was led from the Krath command center in the Iron Citadel, as a continuation of a military coup conducted by corrupt noble descendants inside of the Empress Teta system.# The Great Galactic War begins\nIn the Unknown Regions, Darth Vitiate decided to name himself the new Sith Emperor. He formed a new Dark Council and filled it with Dark Lords of the Sith, thus creating a New Sith Empire. This New Empire thrived for thousands of years while Emperor Vitiate kept himself alive by using the Dark Side of the Force. During this time the Republic had recently suffered from the betrayal of Exar Kun. Emperor Vitiate caught wind of this and decided to create a new conflict for the Republic. This went on for about three centuries before the Great Galactic War would begin. In his preparation, he influenced governments with puppets in the Outer Rim. He would first challenge the Mandalorians to attack the Republic which caused the Great Sith War. He would then begin the war by launching an attack on Korriban, liberating it in a raid from Jedi and Republic defenders. The Sith Empire gradually established a strong foothold across the worlds through small battles, and many would defect to join the Empire. This would make the Republic face heavy resistance from their former territories. Their armaments would be damaged after the Sith's invasion of the Sluis sector, which was crucial to the Republic Navy.\n\n# The downfall of the Sith\nHowever, the Jedi and Republic would reestablish their strengths, showing their prowess in the battle of Bothawui, where the entire Republic fleet was anticipating a Sith invasion. They would indeed face such an invasion and would defeat them numerous times, though sustaining a tremendous loss. This would force the Sith to look elsewhere, turning to the planet of Alderaan, a key planet in the Republic. Darth Malgus would be injured on Alderaan by Satele Shan, and they would lose their foothold on the planet.\n\nThe Republic with the Jedi would go on to capture the Sith Dread Masters, who were responsible for the disappearances of Republic fleets, and they would soon discover the Sith's capital on Dromund Kaas. The Sith Empire would enlist the Mandalorians for help, who damaged the supply and trade routes of the Republic. They would be defeated by a smuggler fleet led by Hylo Visz and would be forced to stay out of the war after the death of Mandalore the Lesser. The Sith would sustain heavy losses from the pyrrhic victory on Ord Radama, where the Republic would continue their counter-offensive campaigns.\n\n# The peace treaty and the plan\nThe Sith Empire was still intact and pushed for a peace treaty. Both sides sent representatives to Alderaan to discuss the possibility of achieving peace. During their deliberation, a Sith plan was underway, which would speed up the peace process under their terms. Darth Malgus led an attack on the Jedi Temple on Coruscant using a transport filled with Sith. This would reach the delegates on Alderaan, where they were forced to surrender. The Republic would give up huge tracts of territories to the Sith, and they would be left devastated economically and in stability.\n\nBoth sides would enter into a period of a Cold War, engaging in small proxy wars that would lead up to another war with the Empire.\n\n","meta":{"index":32,"author":"EternalTrinity","name":"Great Galactic War","release_year":2022}},"First Great Schism":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Great Schisms were a series of major occurrences that resulted in conflict and war between the Dark Jedi and the orthodox Jedi. There were a total of four Great Schisms in history, the earliest dating back to 24,500 BBY leading all the way up to the fourth and final Great Schism in 2000 BBY. These events in history allowed both the Jedi and Sith to witness advancement in all aspects but at times, also at the cost of their own structure and culture.# First Great Schism\nThe First Great Schism was the first set of events that divided the Jedi Order, creating groups of Jedi that didn’t wish to adhere to the Jedi’s hierarchy or rule sets. After the creation of the Je’daii Order, all of its members and inhabitants of Tython lived in peace and harmony. Roughly ten thousand years later in 24,500 BBY, two Jedi known as Xendor and Arden-Lyn grew disfavor for the strange functionality of the Order. Xendor chose to voice his opinions and statements before the leadership of the Jedi. He proposed to create a newer Academy off-world and integrate a variety of different practices of the Force such as Dai Bendu's philosophy and even the Way of the Dark.

These Jedi were not alone in their beliefs, as it didn’t take long for other members of the Jedi to leave Ossus and pledge their loyalty to Xendor and his cause for a newer Order. A new order of force-sensitive beings was established with the increasing influence of various beliefs across the galaxy known as the Legions of Lettow.\n\n\nThis legion preferred to be left out of the antics of the Jedi to delve deeper into their own practices and beliefs; however, the Jedi did not allow this to continue, and as tension arose, both the Jedi and Legions of Lettow created the first conflicts between the primary philosophies of the Force.\n\n","meta":{"index":9,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"First Great Schism","release_year":2022}},"Battle of Thule":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Battle of Thule was a vital mission for the jedi knights due to the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus also known as Count Dooku, was planning to use a new engineered weapon known as the Dark Reaper as a source to steal the force essence from the planet moon known as Thule.

This left the planet of Malachor V so devastated it turned the planet into what’s best described as a graveyard world, especially after Meetra Surik sacrificed a big portion of the Republic and Jedi forces to destroy the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. The battle was so devastating to the Mandalorians they referred to it as Ani’la Akaan, the “Great Last Battle” in the language of Mando’a.# History\nAfter countless battles, Commander Revan had forced a final confrontation with the Mandalorians above the planet Malachor V in the year 3960 BBY. Not only had he deployed a massive Republican fleet, but he also used a secret superweapon designed by an engineer called Bao-Dur, which was known as the “Mass Shadow Generator”.\n\nThe weapon was developed as a part of a trap that Revan had planned which he’d hoped would bring an end to the war. Overseeing the weapon and commanding the fleet was Jedi General, and soon to be Exile, Meetra Surik who had taken part in the recent battle and campaign on the planet Dxun. Revan then lured the Mandalorian fleet to Malachor V and a massive fleet battle ensued in the orbit of the planet.\nRevan was enroute to the battle, but had been delayed outside of the system due to engaging a Mandalorian scouting party. \n\nAfterwards, Revan eventually arrived to the planet and soon entered into the battle, however, he was late and the fleet of the Mandalorians weren’t anywhere near being defeated. Yet, Revan was able to draw out the leader of the Mandalorians, Mandalore the Ultimate, into a direct confrontation with him and swiftly made work of him when he cut the Mandalore down with a single strike.\n\nWhile that was happening, more Jedi, who at this time called themselves Revanchists and were still fighting in orbit, started to become affected by the dark power emitting from the planet below them and subsequently being affected by the Dark Side. \n\nThough Jedi can resist the Dark Side, the many years of fighting had worn down the Revanchists’ ability to resist the temptation and thus, they were drawn to it. This, however, enabled the Jedi and Revan to regain their vigor, pressing the fight to the Mandalorians, where they would stay for a bit in a stalemate until pushing the Mandalorian fleet back to Malachor V.\n\nAs the fighting started growing in intensity, General Meetra Surik had thought that the Mandalorians had fallen into their trap and that it was finally set to be sprung. She commanded Bao-Dur, the creator of the Mass Shadow Generator, to activate the contraption. But when it was activated, she watched in abstract horror as a significant portion of the fleets of both the Republic and the Mandalorians were drawn into the vortex that the Generator created, via gravity, and was strong enough to crack the planet's crust open and kill all who were aboard the ships.\n\nBecause of this, the once agricultural and lush world of Malachor V had been transformed into what was called a graveyard world. The Generator had transformed the planet also into a cluster of rocks and planetoids that were only held together due to the gravitational anomalies of the Malachor System. Not only did clusters of rocks orbit the now broken planet, but also broken and destroyed warships of the Republic and Mandalorians drifted along its orbit; some also say the surface of the planet is barren with only the echoes of thousands of dead Jedi, Republicans, and Mandalorians.\n\nAfter the battle had come to a close, Revan then disarmed and disbanded the Mandalorian Clans, allowing them to scatter across the galaxy, specifically the Outer Rim Territories. Devoid of both leadership and honor, some degenerated, though a select few returned to the Mandalore System while others, such as Canderous Ordo, became mercenaries and guns-for-hire. Others turned to banditry and piracy.\n\nAfter the victory at Malachor V and the defeat of the Mandalore, Revan and Malak were both hailed as heroes of the Republic, and soon after the battle, took their fleet and forces to the Unknown Regions with pretense on finding and defeating the remainder of the Mandalorian forces. They did not return, however, and also did not send word on their whereabouts or status. In time, the Republic feared they had been met with a terrible fate or lost in a tragic disaster, most likely caught in one of the many gravitational anomalies of the Unknown Regions, but in truth they were amassing their forces in preparations of conquering the Republic.\n\nAs for the Jedi General Meetra Surik, she couldn’t handle the backlash within the Force after the destruction of the planet and the deaths of many Republic, Jedi, and Mandalorian fighters and as such, she cut her connections off with the Force. The result of Malachor V wasn’t over though as it had created a Wound in the Force, which would go on to create Darth Nihilus.\n\n","meta":{"index":51,"author":"BoarGrills","name":"Battle of Malachor V","release_year":2023}},"Third Battle of Ruusan":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Third Battle of Ruusan was a conflict that occurred in 1001 BBY.

All the chancellor needed now was someone to carry out the plan and take charge of the clones.

The Mandalorian Wars would contain some of the most devastating battles in Republic history while also directly serving as the foundation on which numerous other notable galactic events would take place.# Beginnings\nThe Mandalorian Wars were some of the bloodiest conflicts in known history. Numerous genocides, war crimes, planet wide conflicts and many legends were both created and finished during the course of this conflict. Though it all began with a simple Taung warlord who we will come to know well as Mand’alor the Ultimate. \n\nMand’alor the Ultimate recovered the mask of his predecessor, Mand’alor the Indomitable after his death near the end of the Great Sith War and would continue the nomadic traditions of the Mandalorians. Mand’alor the Ultimate would use this time of peace after their defeat at the hands of the Galactic Republic just two decades earlier and rebuild many of the shattered Mandalorian Clans. At the same time, the Republic was also recovering from the Great Sith War and were in the process of rebuilding their Navy, as well as bringing the flourishing city world of Taris into the Galactic Republic. Taris would serve as a major importer and exporter of goods and materials that would be crucial to the success of the Republic war machine.\n\nLike many conflicts in the galaxy, the Mandalorian Wars were from the beginning a Sith plot. Just before the Wars began a Sith pureblood would contact Mand’alor the Ultimate, claiming that he represented a great Sith Lord. Together the Sith pureblood and Mand’alor the Ultimate would travel to the world of Rekkiad, where the Sith would inform Mand’alor the Ultimate that his master, who was the secret Sith Emperor, Darth Vitiate, had a vision of the Mandalorians conquering the Republic and becoming the most dominant force in the galaxy. What the Mand’alor was unaware of was that he was being manipulated through the force and as a result, believed that he was capable of destroying the Republic.\n\nAfter concluding his meeting with the Sith, Mand’alor the Ultimate, along with his right hand man, Field Marshal Cassus Field, began reorganising the Mandalorian clans into what would become known as the Neo-Crusader movement. This movement was designed to be a much more unified version of the earlier Mandalorian Crusaders, designed to place warriors as the rulers of society and adopt a much more open policy of recruiting non-Taung species into the ranks of the Neo-Crusaders.\n\nThe newly minted Neo-Crusaders also established a new strategy. Unlike their predecessors, the Mandalorian Crusaders, the Neo-Crusaders would raid worlds and actually hold them. This would allow the Neo-Crusaders the ability to conscript warriors and utilise the resources of dozens of planets to get their forces ready for the coming war, and by the time the Mandalorians invaded the Republic, they were indeed ready.\n\n# Conflict\nThe beginning of the Mandalorian Wars is often debated. From the point of view of the Republic, the war did not start until the Neo-Crusaders would invade Republic territory. However, from the point of view of the Neo-Crusaders, they had been raiding and conquering numerous worlds on the edge of Republic space and independent worlds and colonies within the Outer Rim for years. The Republic itself would not actually take part in the conflicts for over a decade from when they began. \n\nThe Mandalorians began the conflict by conquering the independent world of Althir III, in an invasion that lasted a total of 5 days, and to the credit of the Althiri, had a major stalemate. The Neo-Crusaders took the planet utilizing their famous Basilisk War Droids, conducting orbital shock trooper attacks, the planet was taken and served as a major producer of war materials for the Neo-Crusaders. \n\nIt wouldn’t be until three years later that the Neo-Crusaders would carry out their second major invasion of a territory, on the planet of Cathar. The Cathar species were not very war-like and the invasion commanded by Field Marshal Cassus Fett would quickly turn into a genocidal massacre. The Cathar put up little resistance and in a swift strike the planet fell to the Neo-Crusaders. Cassus Fett believed the planet’s inhabitants were weak and ordered that they be massacred, utilizing orbital bombardments, basilisk war droids and death squads, the Neo-Crusaders decimated over 90% of the Cathar population and literally drove them into the sea. The Republic was well aware of the events that took place, Cassus Fett made no effort to hide them, but out of fear of public unrest and a lack of desire to commit to war, the Republic hid the genocide from the media. \n\nThe genocide of Cathar did inspire the Republic Navy to blockade the trade world of Taris and the mostly Mandalorian inhabited moon of Dxun. Taris was crucial to the Republic war machine and economy, and Dxun was crucial as it was nearby a main Republic supply route but was also inhabited by dozens of Mandalorian Clans that the Republic did not wish to see rally to Mand’alor the Ultimate’s cause. \n\nAfter the Republic Navy established their blockades, Mand’alor the Ultimate began probing the Republic’s defence fleet by launching small strikes and provoking minor skirmishes. This caused some confusion amongst the ranks of the Neo-Crusaders who were used to large campaigns and major invasions, one particular Mandalorian, Commander Rohlan Dhyre would attempt to desert the Neo-Crusaders as a result of this, only to be forced back to the front lines. He would attempt to desert the Neo-Crusaders multiple times, but was never truly successful.\n\n# The Revanchists\nWhile the Neo-Crusaders were launching their various campaigns, capturing independent worlds and probing the Republic. A young Jedi Knight and his close friend and ally Alek were scouring the Jedi Order for Jedi who sought to retake the worlds lost to the Neo-Crusaders. His words were controversial and challenged the direct authority of the Jedi High Council, who at the time were seriously concerned about potential dark side influences within the Neo-Crusaders. Revan, being a man of action, did not wish to allocate any more time to meditation or discussion on the topic and against the wishes of the Jedi Council, took his followers of Jedi Padawans, Knights and even Masters and rallied to the aid of the Republic military. \n\nThe Revanchists amalgamated well into the ranks of the Republic military, adopting General and Commander positions, they would re-evaluate the strategies and tactics of the Republic Military and provide a serious advantage for when the Neo-Crusaders set their sights on Republic territory.\n\n# Padawan Massacre\nA small event took place that would indirectly cause the first defeat of the Republic and result in many of the early Revanchists, including Alek, being captured by the Neo-Crusaders. During their travels, the Revanchists sought other Jedi to join them from the various sub-councils and enclaves across the galaxy. The Jedi Masters and their Padawans that occupied the Jedi Tower on Taris denied Revan their aid in the war but still stood as the only Jedi defence of the world should the Neo-Crusaders attack. This changed when the Jedi Masters, who were part of a secret sub-sect of the Jedi Order that believed in the eradication of the dark side by any means necessary, decided after having a vision to slaughter their Padawans, who they believed would fall to the dark side and become a threat to the Republic. \n\nAfter news of this spread and the Masters, who tried to blame the act on a surviving Padawan were caught, they were summoned back to Coruscant to face judgement. The only problem with this is that it left Taris without any Jedi defence, something the Neo-Crusaders took immediate advantage of.\n\n# Invasion of the Republic\nThe Republic Navy’s blockade of Taris and numerous surrounding planets, known as the Jebble-Vanquo-Tarnith line was assaulted numerous times by the Neo-Crusaders but was never breached. The defences were so massive, containing a variety of large Republic fleets that the Neo-Crusaders were stuck in a stalemate. Numerous skirmishes and assaults were carried out but were ultimately fended off by Republic forces. During this stalemate the Padawan Massacre had taken place, and Revan had left behind many Revanchist Jedi on the planet of Suurja, a neighbouring planet of Taris. When news of the Padawan Massacre had spread to Mand’alor the Ultimate he took the news as a strategic opportunity and prepared his forces for a campaign with the objective of taking Taris. \n\nMand’alor the Ultimate also sent Commander Rohlan Dyre to Suurja to ambush and capture the Revanchists that were left there, successfully capturing Alek and numerous other Jedi. These Jedi would be taken to a captured space station known as Flashpoint, which had been repurposed by the Mandalorian scientist known as Demagol to conduct experiments on Jedi and force-sensitives, another war crime conducted by the Mandalorians. \n\nThis capture of Alek and his fellow Jedi would mark a small but still the first victory against Republic forces and allowed the Neo-Crusaders to learn more about Jedi capabilities from the experiments conducted. \nMand’alor the Ultimate rallied the Neo-Crusader fleet and ordered the invasion of the planet Vanquo, this would be the first large-scale engagement between the Neo-Crusader and Republic forces. The Neo-Crusaders would be victorious, sieging the planet and forcing the Republic Navy to withdraw and reform their defensive line around Taris. Numerous Republic Navy Admirals would be seriously wounded or die and the defensive line around Taris had to be made up of heavily damaged ships that would be no match for a full scale invasion. Many Mandalorians and the Republic saw this invasion as the true beginning of the Mandalorian Wars.\n\n# Seige of Taris\nThe Mandalorians laid siege to Taris and forced a complete withdrawal of the Republic Navy. Utilizing their infamous orbital bombardment tactics, the Neo-Crusader fleet would bomb critical military and civilian installations on the world prior to launching their ground invasion. The Mandalorians did not expect much resistance but were shocked to see local resistance forces rallied from civilians and Taris police units, as well as resistance from the underground swoop gangs who had united to battle the foreign invaders. Ultimately however these groups were no true match for the Neo-Crusaders, and other than a few attacks the Neo-Crusaders had conquered the world with relative ease.\n\nDuring the siege of Taris, Revan, now known simply as the Revanchist, was being labelled a hero of the Republic and had rallied a serious number of Jedi from various enclaves as well as independent military forces from worlds that were at risk of Neo-Crusader invasion. Revan would be contacted by a fellow Jedi and follower known as Ferroh, who was notably of the Cathar species and was concerned about the lack of Cathar on his homeworld as well as the lack of contact between him and his species. Revan, also concerned by this, travelled with Ferroh and his Jedi followers to the Cathar homeworld and found evidence of the genocide carried out by Cassus Fett and the Neo-Crusaders.\n\nThe Jedi Council, aware of Revan’s intent to investigate the world, travelled to meet Revan and demand that Revan and the Revanchists stand down before they truly got involved in the war. During these demands Revan would find the mask of a Mandalorian woman who had died protesting the genocide, executed by her fellow Neo-Crusaders. Revan and the Jedi on the planet had a collective force vision of the genocide and felt the losses suffered on the planet. Upon finishing the vision, Revan declared himself as the Revanchist and swore to defeat the Mandalorian threat, this inspired even more Jedi to join the cause and ultimately sealed the fate of the Jedi who would take part in the war, the Revanchists were finally going to join the fight.\n\n# The Onslaught\nAfter taking Taris and its surrounding worlds, the Neo-Crusaders launched a new campaign through a variety of trade and travel routes that would provide them a direct line of attack against crucial Republic systems. This invasion was so devastating for the Republic that it became known as the ‘’Onslaught’’. \n\n\nDuring the Onslaught the Mandalorians took an entire system of space known as the Zongorlu system, as well as the planet of Ord Mantell and Wayland. The Mandalorians also attempted an invasion of Ithor but were ultimately repelled by a unified force of Zabrak and Republic forces. As a result of the Zabrak resistance, the Mandalorians decided to invade their home of Iridonia and successfully captured it. Iridonia would serve as a recruitment ground due to the hardiness of their warriors. Iridonia would later be freed by Republic forces and Zabrak resistance fighters but a large presence of Mandalorians and their culture would remain. Even while the planet was technically back under Republic control, it still served as a large provider of warriors for the Neo-Crusaders. \n\nThe Neo-Crusaders would finally launch a successful invasion towards the corewards and would capture the ice planet of Jebble with relative ease. This planet would serve as an excellent staging ground for a larger invasion, the invasion of Alderaan. The Republic Senate in response to the Onslaught had recalled almost all of the Republic fleet from territories the Republic was responsible for policing and protecting in an effort to match the strength of the Neo-Crusader fleet. While this was being done, the Neo-Crusaders successfully captured Onderon and Dxun. This was a true testament to the strength and speed of the Neo-Crusader fleets, and Dxun was a particularly large blow to the Republic. Dozens of Mandalorian Clans that inhabited Dxun jumped at the chance to join the Neo-Crusaders and boltered the strength of the Neo-Crusader armies by a sizable margin. Onderon and Dxun would remain under Neo-Crusader control for almost the entirety of the war.\n\nThe invasion of Alderaan would be thwarted by the efforts of Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick and Jedi Shadow Celeste Morne. The two would recover a Sith artifact from Neo-Crusader hands that they would accidentally use to infect the Neo-Crusader army on Jebble with the Rakghoul plague. This accidental infection prevented the invasion of Alderaan.\n\n# Serroco\nWhile the Neo-Crusaders were rallying on Jebble, Mand’alor the Ultimate saw a need to continue their aggressive invasion strategy in an effort to leave the Republic with little time to rally. Mand’alor the Ultimate set his sights on Serroco which happened to be the staging ground for one of the largest elements of the Republic fleet. Mand’alor the Ultimate, with an oddly twisted sense of honour, saw the defense of the planet as dishonourable, he believed the Republic thought the Neo-Crusaders were not willing to attack the civilian population on the planet, he sought to prove them wrong.  \n\nMand’alor the Ultimate dropped his fleet out of hyperspace above Serroco and launched nuclear missiles towards the planet’s civilian populated areas. The Republic Navy believed the missiles were meant for them and raised their shields in defiance but were surprised to see the missiles hit the planet’s surface instead. Billions of civilians died in a matter of minutes, causing so much death that Revan and his Jedi followers felt the devastation through the force. \n\nThe Naval fleet defending Serroco was forced to withdraw, having too many refugees on board their battleships and being unable to defend the planet as many of their ships were stationed on the planet’s surface, unprepared for how swift the Neo-Crusaders would attack, many of their ships on Serreco were destroyed.\n\n# Mandalorian Triumph\nThe following campaign after Serroco would see a massive amount of territory come under Mandalorian control. A group of defiant Jedi Knights who believed in the Neo-Crusader movement had defected to the Neo-Crusaders and proposed a plan to Mand’alor the Ultimate to kidnap Jedi Younglings from the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine to be used as Mandalorian Knights in future invasions, the plan was given a go ahead and with the Mandalorian Knights at the helm, Mand’alor the Ultimate’s fleets took numerous systems from the Republic and conquered dozens of worlds. \n\nThe Mandalorian Knights with the aid of Neo-Crusaders had attempted to capture Dantooine, though due to the efforts of a survivor of the Padawan Massacre, Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick. The Mandalorian Knights would be unsuccessful and many of the Mandalorian Knights including their leader, Jedi Master Dorjander Kace, would be captured and face trial on Dantooine. Mand’alor the Ultimate would abandon his northern offensive and effort to take the planet of Dantooine. \n\nDespite a failed kidnapping attempt, the ultimate removal of the Mandalorian Knights from the war and the abandonment of the northern offensive, the Neo-Crusaders were still extremely victorious during this period of the war. During this period the Neo-Crusaders would launch roughly 18 separate offensives and ultimately reach Duro. The Neo-Crusaders would successful in destroying a large amount of shipyards surrounding the planet and also made an effort to steal many of the materials and plans used in building Republic ships, but were ultimately stopped when Revan arrived with his new fleet of prototype Republic interdictor-class battleships and stopped the Neo-Crusader invasion.\n\nAs a result of his efforts and with pressure from the Republic Military, Revan was made Supreme Commander of the Republic Military and was made responsible for the Republic war effort. The Jedi Council were forced to agree with this decision as a result of an idea Revan concocted. Revan had re-made the ‘’Mercy Corps’’, who were a large group of Jedi that attached themselves to the Republic Military during the Great Sith War to provide medical and support assistance during the war effort. The Revanchists were now given military positions with Revan himself at the helm of the Republic Military. \n\nThe Mandalorian Triumph resulted in the destruction of many shipyards crucial to the Republic war effort, as well the destruction of many of the Tibanna mining operations on Bespin. The Battle of Eres III was another battle of the Mandalorian triumph that would become another infamous controversy as a result of the destruction caused on the planet, which would cause fires so fierce from bombing attacks that even a decade after the end of the war, the fires were still rampant on the planet’s surface.\n\n# The Republic Counter-attack\nThe Republic Military, now with Revan as Supreme Commander and the officially sanctioned aid of the Revanchists Jedi decided that the Neo-Crusaders had gone on the offensive long enough. Revan planned a huge offensive against the Neo-Crusader forces that resulted for the first time since the war began, a huge spark of Republic victories. The Republic even managed to retake the world of Taris. Unfortunately for the Republic, Revan and Alak, now known as Malak, had begun discovering the ancient Rakatan Star Maps across a variety of the worlds they had invaded.\n\nRevan and Malak eventually discovered the world of Malachor V and found the ancient Sith Academy known as Traya’s Academy. There they discovered many Sith teachings and had fallen to the overwhelming allure of the darkside. Still identifying as Jedi, Revan and Malak continued their offensive but had become much more tolerable of casualties and sacrifice. \n\nMany Republic invasions were successful but came at a high cost, hundreds of ships and thousands of troops were being sacrificed to gain as much territory as possible. This most notably occurred on the moon of Dxun during the invasion of Onderon. General Meetra Surik, one of Revan’s closest followers, was responsible for taking Dxun from Neo-Crusader control. Unfortunately for the Republic the world was a dense jungle and Mandalorians had inhabited the moon for decades prior to the Mandalorian Wars, they were well prepared for invasion.\n\nDespite this, Revan ordered the invasion and General Surik obeyed, sacrificing many of her soldiers in an effort to take deeply entrenched anti-air gun emplacements and Neo-Crusader strongholds. It is said that ten Republic soldiers were lost for every Neo-Crusader killed, the invasion was a true blood bath. But ultimately successful, Dxun had fallen back under Republic control, the Neo-Crusaders lost a crucial staging ground and Onderon was retaken. \n\nThese victories cemented Revan’s fall to the dark side, he became increasingly aggressive in his tactics and the Neo-Crusaders even started to fear what tactics he might employ. Neo-Crusader warrior Canderous Ordo attested these tactics and Revan as being the sole reason the Republic would eventually win the war.\n\n# Final Confrontation\nRevan created a strategy that would force the Neo-Crusader fleet into a battle on the world of Malachor V. During the war, Republic scientists had crafted a weapon known as the Mass Shadow Generator. The weapon was essentially a mini-black hole machine, it would envelop and destroy almost everything surrounding its detonation and could be deployed with relative ease. Revan intended on using the Mass Shadow Generator on Malachor V, hopefully putting an end to the war.\n\nRevan rallied the largest elements of the Republic Fleet for this final battle and engaged the Neo-Crusaders on Malachor V. An epic battle ensued and Revan would board Mand’alor the Ultimate’s flagship to confront him directly. Revan would kill Mand’alor the Ultimate during the battle and during his final moments, Mand’alor the Ultimate confessed to Revan that the Mandalorian Wars were a Sith plot all along, and that an ancient Sith Lord existed in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy on the planet Rekkiad, the same planet Mand’alor the Ultimate and the mysterious Sith emissary had visited before the Mandalorian Wars. Revan would take the Mand’alor’s helmet to prevent anymore Mandalorians from taking the mantle of Mand’alor, putting an end to the potential of another united Mandalorian rising. \n\nRevan would then order General Meetra Surik to detonate the Mass Shadow Generator, despite thousands of Republic ships and soldiers still being in its range. Despite this, the Mass Shadow Generator was detonated by Republic commander and engineer Bao-Dur. killing an unspeakable number of Republic soldiers and Neo-Crusaders alike. \n\nThe blast was so harmful that Meetra Surik was forced to sever her own connection to the force to survive the blast, and the once forest covered world of Malachor V would be reduced to a dead world of darkness. Shortly after, the remaining Neo-Crusaders would contact the Republic Senate and announce an unconditional surrender, ending the 16 years conflict once and for all.\n\n# Aftermath and Legacy\nIn the aftermath of the war the Republic would set about regaining many of the worlds lost to the Neo-Crusaders and dozens of worlds that initially were not part of the Republic would admit themselves to the Republic Senate. The war was seen as a strategic success but almost collapsed the Republic’s economy and military. \n\nRevan and Malak would act on the information of a secret Sith Lord and disappear into the Unknown Regions for years, taking many followers with them. General Meetra Surik, now a hero of the Republic, would be the only Jedi to return to the Jedi Council to face judgement for her actions in the war. The Jedi Council exiled her and took her lightsaber, she would later become known as the Jedi ‘’Exile’’. \n\nThe Mandalorian Clans would scatter, removing their title as Neo-Crusaders; they would return to their nomadic and tribal ways for many years. The Mandalorian Wars would cement the Mandalorians forever as the most fearsome warriors in the galaxy. Multiple millennia later the Mandalorian Wars would still be discussed and the world of Mandalore would be decorated in murals of Mandalorians fighting and defeating the Jedi, even under pacifist rule. \n\nThe Mandalorians would begin fighting amongst themselves to try and rebuild the title of Mand’alor, but ultimately they were largely reunified under Canderous Ordo, veteran of the Mandalorian Wars in search of the mask. They would ultimately be successful and Canderous Ordo would become Mand’alor. The war was so fierce it essentially caused the extinction of the Taung species who would die out entirely not long after the Mandalorian Wars. \n\nThe Mandalorians were wounded by their defeat, but contrary to what most people expected, many Mandalorians were honoured to have fought against the Republic and the Jedi, and were honoured that they had lost to such a capable foe. \n\nAs a result of the Mass Shadow Generator, a wound in the force would be created. This wound would later become the infamous Darth Nihilus. Many Jedi, including Jedi Master Kreia would be blamed for Revan’s actions in the war and while they were not exiled, they were practically forced out of the Jedi Order and would find themselves on Malachor V, where Darth Nihilus, Darth Sion, Darth Traya and many Dark Jedi would would work on creating a new Sith Order, known as the Sith Triumvirate.\n\n","meta":{"index":21,"author":"seko1111","name":"Mandalorian Wars","release_year":2021}},"Treaty of Vontor":{"content":"# Introduction\nTreaty of Vontor was established in 25,100 BBY, with the goal of uniting three species of the Si’Klaata Cluster under Hutt rule, following their victory against Xim the Despot at the Third Battle of Vontor during the Xim Wars.# Description\nTreaty of Vontor was established at the conferences of the representatives of the Hutts, along with three representatives of three races, Barada M’Beg from the Klatooinians, D’we’mouk from the Nikto, and Kl’ientu Mutela from the Vodrans, at the Si’Klaata Cluster.

The Je’daii Order represented the light side of the wars whilst its Bogan followers represented the Dark Side. It is because of these conflicting ideals between the two main philosophies of the Force, that the Force Wars broke out. This event would be remembered in history as the initial rise of conflict between the two different primary philosophies of the Force.# Prelude |\nIn 28,000 BBY, a horrific Force Vision overcame the mind of Je’daii Master Daegen Lok and his fellow Je'daii Ranger Hawk Ryo. In this unfortunate vision, an individual with a single red eye and a legion of fighters, empowered by the Dark Side carrying Forcesabers rampaged through the world of Ska Gora, reigning havoc wherever they went. This vision caused Lok to fall to the Dark Side out of fear. As a result, his presence was made in front of the Je’daii Council to explain the potential future consequences he had deduced from his vision alone; however, the Je’daii Council believed his fear to be directly caused by the effects of the Dark Side, therefore the council sent him to the Bogan moon to put his mind at balance once more. Daegen Lok lived on Bogan for 7 years in exile, carrying the image of himself also wielding a large Forcesaber. Daegen’s exile served to provide him the reasoning to make the first steps in starting a war between Bogan and Ashla followers.\n\n# The Conflict |\nDaegen spent his time on Bogan building up followers that would become accustomed to his own beliefs. The Je’daii Council slowly came to realize the threat that this new faction presented; hence, a conflict between Ashla and Bogan followers made its beginning. Both sides engaged in various clashes with metal swords enhanced by the power of the Force in hopes to eliminate each other to establish a dominant philosophy of the Force and eliminate anything else that may have opposed said philosophies. Daegen’s Bogan followers also made use of the Forcesabers which were fairly similar to the ones seen within his vision.\n\n# The Start of the Jedi and Aftermath |\nBoth sides showed no intentions of giving up, the Je’daii on the other hand chose to reorganize into the Jedi Order in 25,783 BBY; a faction dedicated to peacekeeping and unification of force-sensitives through the Light Side of the Force. This was done to prevent a conflict like the Force Wars from ever arising again by disregarding the Dark Side of the Force entirely. Rajivari was one of the first High Councilors of this newer Order and served the main role in its foundation. Like Daegen, Rajivari eventually built a following that became enlightened by his principles and traditions. These philosophies of his conflicted with the very Jedi Order that he played a role in creating; therefore, he made it his intention to destroy the Jedi Order. The former Jedi Master’s plans did not turn out to be successful, as he was destroyed when Jedi forces invaded his fortress and killed him along with everything else within that was related to his legacy.\n\n\n\tEven after Rajivari’s death, Bogan followers still continued to ravage through Tython worlds. An astronomical disaster eventually occurred that deemed the planet of Tython inhabitable, thus, the Bogan philosophers made their way off of Tython space. The Jedi made attempts to tail these individuals; however, the Light Side adherent faction chose to settle on Ossus in 25.053 BBY, nearly 730 years later after the rise of the Force Wars.\n\n","meta":{"index":44,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Force Wars","release_year":2022}},"Hundred-Year Darkness":{"content":"# Article\nThe Hundred-Year Darkness, also known as the Second Great Schism, was a conflict that began in 7000 BBY and lasted for about 100 years; it began with the Dark Jedi's separation from the Jedi whilst creating a monstrous army to fight in their war against the Jedi. The conflict had started after a group of Jedi had taken the teachings of the Legions of Lettow, which were the rogue Jedi defeated during the First Great Schism. The Legions' legacy and teachings resulted in a new group emerging; this was a group of rogue Jedi led by Ajunta Pall, XoXaan and Karness Muur.\n\nThe exiled Jedi would retreat from Jedi worlds and start settling themselves on planets strong in the dark side; the rogue Jedi would start raising armies of the dead and creating abominations twisted with the dark side. Even with these armies, the rogue Jedi were pushed back by the Jedi and started losing ground whilst heavily outnumbered.\n\nThe rogue Jedi, now known as Dark Jedi, would start creating bioengineered dark side abominations and species that horrified the Jedi; the Dark Jedi’s Leviathan could suck the life essence out of Jedi and into blister traps where it contained the essence and knowledge. Eventually, the Jedi were able to unite with the combined strength of the Jedi and Republic, pushing them back to their final stand on Corbos.\n\nAfter their loss on Corbos and with many of the Dark Jedi killed, the Dark Jedi eventually surrendered as they were exiled to worlds far away from the Republic with seemingly no or little life. The Jedi hoped that the Dark Jedi would learn from their mistakes.\n\nThe Dark Jedi that did escape from the Republic’s grasp ended up settling on the planet of Korriban. After landing on Korriban, they found the Sith species who had a king as their leader. The Dark Jedi conspired with the king’s hand, together with the usage of their power, they made the Sith submit to them. The Sith would raise them to god-like creatures, with it becoming the rulers of the Sith people. Ajunta Pall would be the first to become the Dark Lord of the Sith, the strongest and ultimate leader.\n\nThe Dark Jedi would interbreed with the Sith species, and the Sith species would see technological advances, slowly turning the term Sith to be used for more than the original species, instead as a general term for dark side Force-users who followed Sith Lords their teachings. Large temples and buildings would be created by the Sith people, constructing a Sith homeworld and the breeding place of the newly found Sith Empire, which would later be known as the Original or Old Sith Empire.","meta":{"index":3,"author":"ThornedRedRose","name":"Hundred-Year Darkness","release_year":2021}},"Battle of Yavin":{"content":"# Pre Battle\nFor years, the Galactic Empire had been spreading its reign across the galaxy and putting fear in every soul they cross.

After sending droid R2-D2 off with the plans, she was held in captivity with Vader and his Stormtrooper crew, which was put to an end after Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan, and Chewbacca, who had received leia's distress signals asking for help. After successfully fleeing with Leia, the crew went to the rebel base on Yavin 4, where they devised a plan to blow up the Death Star.# Devising a Plan\nBecause the Death Star's security was meant to detect large-scale fleets, they would get past the security systems unnoticed.

The roots of the conflict stretch back to the fall of Freedom Nads from the Jedi way and his rise to become the Dark Lord of the Sith. Ulic Qel-Droma met another fallen Jedi-turned-Dark Jedi named Exar Kun while on the run. Kun and Qel-Droma helped the Republic suffer a series of devastating campaigns against it. The war reached the heart of the galaxy.# First Battle of Iridonia\nThe First Battle of Iridonia took place during the Great Sith War. It was a victory for the Galactic Republic that marked a turning point in the war. Little is known about the battle other than that the Jedi-led Republic military forces defeated a combined Krath and Sith forces.

Those that dared to oppose the process of unification were swiftly defeated and eliminated.# Conflict and Result\nAs a result of the revolution from the enslaved species of the Infinite Empire and a plague that wiped out the majority of the Rakata, the Rakata and their power were quickly taken off the charter of the galaxy, allowing for a newer supreme power to make itself known: The Galactic Republic. With the fall of the Infinite Empire, it can be assumed many individuals and organizations fought each other to claim control as the dominant power of the galaxy, but it was the Jedi Order, their allies, and potentially even the Dai Bendu Monks and their unification that emerged victorious to create the Galactic Republic. According to records, the opposing side was deemed as the forces of “evil,” but the true identity of this evil remains unknown. Zakrinand Minus would emerge as one of these leaders during this conflict, acting as a Warlord to then live to witness the emergence and foundation of the Galactic Republic. The history of Zakrinand was quite vague and is speculated by many historians that he was deemed invincible due to his efforts during this war.

Plenty of the Core Worlds unified as well to create the Galactic Constitution, marking the start of a brand new symbol of hope and peace among the galaxy. Planets such as Alderaan, Coruscant, Duro, and even Corellia became allies to assist this new Republic. The Jedi also integrated themselves nearly a hundred years later to act as the enforcers of peace for the Republic’s will. For the efforts and contribution the Jedi made as a whole during times of war and even centuries before, the Galactic Republic used the Dai Bendu symbol as a representation of harmony.

Sith Wyrms were previously exogorths that were changed through Sith alchemy to be guardians. Tarentateks were creatures native to the Sith planet Korriban which fed off the blood from force-sensitives. Once the Jedi Council enacted this decree, many hunts for these creatures would begin, many of which being failures as the Tarentateks grew back in their numbers very quickly. These hunts were not very effective and never truly worked.

Revan started this war to try and retake the Galactic Republic in hopes to change it for the better so they could fight back against a “Bigger Sith Empire''. Revan was almost successful as well until falling for a trap set up by the Jedi that caused him to be near death until he was taken in and brainwashed into believing he was a loyal Republic agent. The Jedi Civil War was galactic-wide and lasted around three years, with Revan being the main focus of it. The Jedi Civil War was also referred to as the Second Sith War, The Malak War, and The War of the Star Forge.# Section 1\nRevan started the Jedi Civil War in hopes he could overtake the Galactic Republic and change it for the better. He overtook Korriban and refounded the Sith Academy that used to take place there. Revan had many on his side before the war, including Veterans of the Mandalorian Wars, and Dark Jedi converts. After Revan fell for the Jedi’s trap, he was taken barely alive by a Jedi with the name of Bastila Shan, she and Revan would grow to become fond of each other. After being taken to Dantooine, where the Jedi Enclave was, Revan would be healed and brainwashed into believing he was a loyal Republic Agent, where he would be assigned under Bastila Shan.\n\n# Section 2\nWhen Revan finished recovering, he was placed on a ship by the name of Endar Spire. Revans ex-apprentice, Darth Malak, wasn't just going to leave him as a brainwashed agent, though. Malak had set up a fleet to ambush Revans ship in hopes he would bring out Revans memories of the Star Forge, which was where Revan and Malak got their resources for beginning the war. Unfortunately for Malak, his plan didn’t go well, and Revan, along with Bastile Shan and other Republic officers fled to Dantooine, where an old Jedi Academy was. This was when the Jedi Masters of Dantooine decided to retrain Revan in the ways of the force. After a few weeks, they sent Revan back out with a new fleet of old Ebon Hawk members to track down the Star Forge.\n\n# Section 3\nAfter Malak had retrieved numerous Star Maps, he sent out yet another fleet to attack the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine. While the Jedi managed to hold them off, it only weakened them in their already vulnerable state. After Malak had retrieved the final Star Map and found the homeworld of the Rakatan, Revan and the rest of the Republic launched the final battle.

After a lengthy battle, Revan managed to defeat Malak and destroy the Star Forge, putting an end to one of the most infamous wars of Star Wars history.\n\nEven though the Republic technically won the battle, the destruction was unignorable and it was so costly, that they could hardly rebuild what was lost.

It was one of the greatest victories in the history of the Sith, and one of the most devastating defeats in the history of the Jedi and Republic.# Section One\nThe battle took place near the end of the Great Galactic War between the Sith Empire and Galactic Republic. This Sith Empire arose from the unknown regions after the destruction of the previous Sith faction several centuries earlier. During the war, the Republic was slowly overwhelmed over the course of the several decades where the war took place, while the Sith Empire only continued to grow more powerful. The plan to invade Coruscant began when the Sith offered a sudden and surprising offer of peace to the Republic.\n\n# Section Two\nThe Republic cautiously accepted the offer, and delegations from both sides arrived on Alderaan to begin negotiations. Not long after, a Mandalorian who was employed by the Sith Empire arrived on Coruscant and disabled the planet’s defense grid. Due to this, Darth Malgus was able to enter the Jedi Temple, followed by a captured Republic shuttle filled with 50 Sith warriors. The Sith quickly dispatched the Jedi guarding the temple, and an Imperial fleet under the command of Lord Darth Angral arrived at the planet, and relentlessly bombarded the surface. They laid waste to much of Coruscant, with the Jedi Temple collapsing. Once they had finished bombarding the surface, Imperial troopers were deployed to clear out any remaining Republic defenses, and Darth Angral assassinated the Supreme Chancellor.\n\n# Section Three\nBy the aftermath of the battle, six members of the Jedi High Council had been killed, the Jedi Temple reduced to rubble, and the Supreme Chancellor had been assassinated. Darth Angral assumed control over the provisional government of Coruscant as Imperial forces settled in for an occupation. All communications into and out of Coruscant had been halted during the battle, and they remained closed during the occupation. All travel was heavily restricted, and the planet was blockaded. There was little to no defense remaining for surviving members of the Republic senate, and civilians. This led to many kidnappings, assassinations, lootings, and executions. The Republic was forced to sign the treaty of Coruscant, leading to a period of weakness, and the prolonging of the reconstruction of Coruscant.\n\n","meta":{"index":39,"author":"AwesomeO561","name":"Sacking of Coruscant","release_year":2023}},"Nathema Ritual":{"content":"# Introduction |\nThe Ritual of Nathema is the name of an event that took place in 4,999 BBY. The Sith Lord Vitiate performed a ritual that stripped the Force’s presence entirely off the planet Nathema. The Sith and its scholars viewed this event as one of the greatest achievements within the Sith Empire; however, the ritual was a result of Vitiate mentally enslaving more than eight thousand Sith Lords, forcing them to partake in the magic that killed every living thing on Nathema and therefore rendering Vitiate as immortal.# Context  |\nIn 5,000 BBY, the Sith Empire was destroyed by the Galactic Republic because of its defeat in the Great Hyperspace Wars. This caused the remaining Sith to fear that the Republic and Jedi Order will not rest until every Sith was wiped out, as they discovered that Supreme Chancellor Pultino was orchestrating a purge against what remained of the Sith and their Empire. Lord Vitiate took advantage of his follower’s increasing fear and proceeded to broadcast to the Empire that the Jedi will not stop until all Sith are eradicated and then followed up with an offer of hope. Vitiate arrived at Korriban and summoned all remaining Sith Lords to the planet Nathema, luring them by stating that he had a plan to conjure a magic ritual that would exterminate the entirety of the Jedi Order.\n\n# The Ritual |\nOn 4,999 BBY, Vitiate announced the beginning of his ritual and more than eight thousand Sith Lords answered his call, alongside surviving members of the Sith Council–past equivalent to the Dark Council– joining the event. When arriving at Nathema, each Sith Lord that arrived at Vitiate's palace had their minds controlled and their will bound to Vitiate; therefore giving him their strength. Once all Lords were under his control, Vitiate enacted a ritual that lasted for 10 days. \n\nTo fulfill the goal of his ritual, Vitiate used the Zildrog central computer; a superweapon that originated from the Iokath sphere, that allows the transfer of life energies. He used this machine to strengthen himself at the cost of consuming the life force of everything present within Nathema. This action later bestowed immortality to Vitiate, which gave him grand strength with the Force while exterminating a planet’s entire population.\n\n# Aftermath |\nAfter the ritual was over, Nathema was left without the presence of the Force, and its physical environment was completely altered. Its colors were removed, having Gray as the only present color. Its bright orange sun lost the majority of its light and became a dull brown star when in Nathema. As life faded away from the planet, Vitiate took on the immortal identity of the Sith Emperor and proceeded to blame Nathema’s demise on the Jedi. Afterward, he gathered his followers and embarked on a two-decade-long journey that led to the “discovery” of Dromund Kaas and the Empire’s reconstruction. After settling down in Kaas, Emperor Vitiate purged all data regarding the planet Nathema, so that nobody gets the opportunity to discover the truth about its fate. \n\nBy the time the Great Galactic War was ongoing, the Ritual of Nathema was considered a great achievement according to historians and was often celebrated by the Sith, completely ignorant of the truth behind it all. Unbeknownst to the Sith Order and the Dark Council, the Emperor continued to use Nathema for his experiments and maintained a sanitarium within it. In there, he secretly built the Eternal Empire of Zakuul and housed powerful force-users that opposed him so they could be experimented upon and have the Force drained from them. The sanitarium is also guarded by Nathema Zealots; a group of powerful Force-Sensitives that could withstand the horrors done within Nathema.\n\n","meta":{"index":15,"author":"RavMalvern","name":"Nathema Ritual","release_year":2022}},"Great Scourge of Malachor":{"content":"# Introduction\nDuring the time of 3699 BBY, the Sith Lord Darth Tanis created a powerful superweapon capable of eliminating all life in the range of its location. During the time of its creation the Jedi sought to destroy the weapon, they attacked the Sith Temple containing the weapons eliminating a Sith Witch, unfortunately, this weapon activated during the battle. In a short amount of time both sides turned to ash in the blink of an eye, the battle ended almost instantly and there were no survivors, only the memories of the fact that both Jedi and Sith never returned to tell the tales of what happened.# The Events\nThrough the years the many Jedi that remembered this event would be traumatized by the heavy casualties of the battle and said it as a reminder to the many Jedi Padawans and Jedi Younglings about the Malachor disaster and would use this knowledge to make sure it never happens again. In the year of the Galactic Republic, Darth Sidious would take his new Apprentice Darth Maul to the ashes of the battle, and tell him the story of how this was the result of what the Jedi and their arrogance can lead to. Darth Maul breathed in the ashes and proceeded to have visions of the Great Scourge of Malachor and witnessed the Jedi attacking the Sith and allowing the weapon to set off, and eliminate all the Jedi and Sith in the area. During the Imperial War, Darth Maul returned to Malachor to seek out the holocron that was used to create the superweapon. He would be stopped by Ezra Bridger, Kanan and Ahsoka however would strike Kanan resulting in him becoming blinded. The Sith holocron was then taken by Ezra but would almost be taken by a wrathful Darth Vader. Vader was eventually stopped by Ahsoka Tano however; by Ahsoka Tano would leave behind a legendary duel, presumably dead.

This central lie, upon which Kaan built his false Sith, is the reason behind their watery, diluted power.# Details\nThe so-called New Sith Wars lasted a thousand years. Many warlords during that time sought to control the destiny of the Sith Empire. They achieved victories without a clear line of succession. Every Sith wanted to be king and so they argued, while the Republic grew to fail  (its citizens sickened with plague) and became isolated by decaying infrastructure. Coruscant’s throat lay bare beneath the Sith blades, but the Sith plunged their knives into one another’s backs instead. Kaan was not the worst of these fools, only the last.\n  Kaan created the Brotherhood of Darkness to end this squabbling, but he chose a false egalitarianism over a strong central rule. Within the Brotherhood, all members with rank called themselves “Sith Lords”. This was Kaan’s first mistake.\n  Darth Bane served the Brotherhood of Darkness as a sergeant assigned to the Gloom Walkers and led his comrades in the capture of Phaseem. He claims that if they had maintained a sound military strategy and followed an orderly conquest, the Republic would have been theirs. Kaan though was impatient. He overreached and leaped into the Bormea sector, the Republic’s heart, before it was time. This was his second mistake.\n  Kaan’s third and final mistake came at Russan, a worthless world where he hoped to defeat Lord Hoth and the Jedi army of Light. He was instead goaded into a grinding land war of needless attrition. Bane watched it unfold and knew the Sith had become like the Jedi; too numerous and too weak. Kaan had lost his grip.\n  In the end, Kaan followed Darth Bane’s suggestion and pooled the abilities of the other Sith Lords to create a brute force wonder: the thought bomb. This was proof of what the Dark Side could achieve when it wasn’t split among thousands. However, the thought bomb consumed not only the Jedi combatants but also the Sith who had created it.

The Brotherhood of Darkness decided to start the battle by using Nightfall to destroy the Republic battleship, along with a bombardment, and the fall of two Hammerheads. \nThis advantage for the Dark Side didn’t last long, as a Jedi Master who was superior to Skere Kaan, used the Battle Meditation to help the Republic fleet, causing problems to the Brotherhood of Darkness and their forces.\n\nThe fate of this battle was altered once Sith Lord Kopecz arrived. After seeing Kaan’s Battle Meditation influence was no longer useful, he made his way into the Army of Light’s ship to kill the Jedi Master that was using the Battle Meditation against the Sith Army.

A legendary figure with a sizable influence on Korriban and Yavin 4, Exar Kun can be proclaimed one of the greats in the history of the Sith.# Description\nExar Kun’s rejection of the Jedi and ascension to the Dark Side of the Force and, in time, the Dark Lord of the Sith, were monumental, causing ripples throughout the galaxy that are still felt to this day. Having been turned to the Dark Side by the ancient Sith Lord Freedon Nadd, Exar Kun began his reign of terror and destruction. The most notable of his legacies was the effect that the Great Sith War in 3996 BBY had on the galaxy. Exar Kun was responsible for the deaths of millions, as well as the razing and pillaging of worlds such as Yavin 4 and Ossus. Having forced the Jedi to abandon Ossus with a supernova threatening to destroy the planet, Exar Kun was able to raid the Great Jedi Temple and reclaim many ancient Sith artifacts. Yavin 4, despite being razed, regrew its wildlife and forests back in a short amount of time, his legacy still remained; temples dedicated to Exar Kun still dotted the moon, and his influence remained long after his death, living mainly through the Massassi, whom he dominated and enslaved to his will, modifying and changing them into brutal, tribal beasts. Similar to the legacy he left with the Massassi, Exar Kun’s work with Sith alchemy can still be found around the galaxy, such as with terentateks and Sith wyrms, with attempts to cull and remove the Sithspawn from planets such as Korriban and Kashyyyk found futile, resulting in the deaths of many Jedi in what was dubbed the ‘Great Hunt’. Another of Exar Kun’s legacies was that of fighting; he created the first double-bladed lightsaber, now seen in use all around the galaxy. He first revealed it when fighting his old master, Vodo-Siosk-Baas, when attempting to turn him to the Dark Side failed. He killed Baas, and the double-bladed lightsaber was baptized in blood. One of the most notable users of the double-bladed lightsaber is Darth Maul, who copied Exar Kun’s saber as closely as he could. One of the most important aspects of his legacy was Korriban; while Exar Kun did not directly create the Sith Academy on Korriban, his disciples did, and tablets were found with his name on them in the academy, dedicated to remembering him. The Sith Academy, while going in and out of use, had been used by the Sith for thousands of years, and remained a stronghold for the Sith Empire, hosting the Dark Council and archeological digs in the Valley of the Dark Lords. Exar Kun’s legacy was impressive; he proved to the galaxy that Sith were the dominant force.\n\n","meta":{"index":62,"author":"deprav1ty","name":"The Search for Exar Kun's Legacy","release_year":2024}},"Korriban Incursion":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Korriban Incursion; also known as the Republic Occupation of Korriban, was an event that happened during 3,696 BBY within the Galactic War.

For this battle, the Republic set up the goal of retrieving data located inside the Dark Council’s Chamber on Korriban’s Academy and causing as much damage as possible.# Description\nThe assault within Korriban began through a Republic breach on the Valley of the Dark Lords; a sacred burial ground for recognized Sith Lords. The Empire managed to interfere and defended its positions, but was defeated by four Jedi heroes. The heroes then confronted and killed Lord Renning, freed the Imperial slaves, and went forward into the Sith Academy. \n\nTo access the Dark Council Chambers, the Jedi had to kill Sith Instructors to unlock the turbo-lift to their destination. They later encountered Darth Soverus and fought an intense battle. Soverus was later killed by Jedi Commander Jensyn, who arrived on time with reinforcements to assist the mission.\n\nAfter successfully stealing the data needed, certain Jedi and Republic troops were forced to leave Korriban, as they were summoned to assist the Assault on Tython; a similar mission as the Incursion, because the Sith invaded to steal information stored on the Jedi Archives.

Queen Trios, the newly appointed monarch of the Kingdom of Shu-Torun, faced a rebellion led by Duke Rubix and his faction of ore-dukes. Their objective was to challenge Trios' rule and gain control over the planet's valuable mineral resources. To suppress the uprising and maintain her authority, Queen Trios sought military support from the Galactic Empire. Responding to her request, the Empire deployed their forces to aid Trios' loyalist faction.# Section I\nAfter the destruction of Alderaan and the Rebel Alliance's victory at the Battle of Yavin, Darth Vader journeyed to Shu-Torun with the aim of solidifying the planet's alliance with the Galactic Empire. Princess Trios, daughter of the king of Shu-Torun, extended an invitation to Vader for a celebration, but her true intention was to assassinate him.\n\nDuring the event, disguised guards that were posing as rebel opposition, ambushed Vader. However, the Dark Lord swiftly defeated them. In a surprising turn of events, Trios then led Vader into a perilous shaft where lava threatened their lives. Despite the danger, both managed to survive the encounter. In a desperate move, Trios attempted to shoot Vader, resulting in the loss of her own hand.\n\nIn the aftermath, the Emperor's Fist dispatched two assassin droids, 0-0-0 and BT-1, to eliminate the king of Shu-Torun and his remaining children. With the rebellion crushed, Vader bestowed a fragment of Alderaan as a grim reminder of the Empire's power and appointed Trios as the new monarch of Shu-Torun. Subsequently, after Vader's triumph over Commander Karbin at the Battle of Vrogas Vas, Emperor Palpatine dispatched the Emperor's Fist to aid Grand General Cassio Tagge and Queen Trios in subduing the ongoing rebellion led by the ore-dukes.\n\n# Section II\nIn the War on Shu-Torun, Darth Vader joined forces with Queen Trios to confront the rebellious barons. Their strategic plan involved a direct assault on a delving citadel, a vital power source controlled by one of the dukes. Leading the charge, Vader, Queen Trios, and their allied forces engaged in a frontal assault, while Doctor Tulon Voidgazer's drones positioned themselves to strike the Citadel's flanks with experimental ordnance.\n\nThe combined might of Vader's stormtroopers and the Queen's forces put immense pressure on the Citadel's defenses, diverting their attention from Voidgazer's drones. Exploiting this advantage, the drones breached the Citadel's defenses and detonated their payload, causing extensive damage. Although the complete destruction of the Citadel was not achieved, the successful attack served as a reminder of the Empire's relentless power and left the dukes reconsidering their rebellion.\n\n# Section III\nIn the aftermath, Queen Trios appointed Bixen as Baroness to negotiate peace with the remaining rebels. She pledged to handle the remaining ore-dukes while ensuring their bloodlines persisted. Darth Vader departed but left a stormtrooper captain as Trios' advisor.

In this scenario, the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire both fought against six powerful Sith Lords known as the Dread Masters–powerful beings who served the Sith Emperor as prophets, military generals, and advisors. \n\nThe Dread Masters earned their titles after harnessing the power of the Phobis Devices; artifacts that drive Sith insane with fear. During the Great Galactic War; specifically in 3,668 BBY, the Sith Lords used the battle meditation ability to destroy Republic Fleets while on board inside their Dreadnaught. Then, Jedi Knight Jaric Kaedan led a strike team that successfully captured the Dread Masters. He announced they had been slain by the Republic, but were secretly imprisoned on the planet Belsavis.# Dread Master Crisis\nAfter being imprisoned on Belsavis, the Dread Masters escaped their prison and set their goal to achieve total domination; therefore sparking the Dread Master Crisis. They freed themselves in 3,641 BBY and returned to serve the Empire, fulfilling their own goals separately after the Emperor died on Dromund Kaas. This caused a truce within the Republic and the Empire, which allowed them to cooperate on defeating the Dread Masters. \n\nLord Tagriss; a Sith Lord who decided to assist the Dread Masters, was tasked to raid the Arcanum Space Station on the Meram Sector to steal powerful Sith artifacts. Darth Acina and Jedi Master Cedral Gend sent their forces to prevent the artifact theft, which was an overall success. Lord Tagriss managed to evade his pursuers and managed to obtain the Seeds of Rage and Darkstaff artifacts prior to leaving. He tried to unlock their powers on a Jedi Temple in Ilum, but was apprehended and killed during the process. This allowed the Dread Masters to send a strike force to recover the artifacts as they were crucial for their plan of domination. \n\nWhile the allies of the Dread Masters were constantly failing in enacting their plans, Dread Master Styrak grew furious and impatient on progress results. This made him go rogue and assemble a mercenary team against the Hutt Cartel to fulfill his personal agenda. He believed his actions would be hidden by the Sith & Republic, but was discovered and killed alongside his allies\n\n# Oricon’s Discovery\nOnce Styrak was dead, the Galactic Republic discovered that the Dread Masters’ base was in the moon Oricon. They sent a task force under the command of Jedi Master Ogan-Dei to bombard the moon on orbit and quickly end the Sith Lords, but the Dread Masters used the Force Fear ability to impact the Republic forces, which led to the death of the task force. Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh called upon Jedi heroes to travel onto Oricon, assist the task force and complete their mission. \n\nShortly after, the Empire discovered the Dread Master’s base and the status of the Republic forces that were sent. They allowed Lord Hargrev to assemble a task force and invade the Oricon base, where they also lost contact with the Empire as their ships were destroyed by the Dread Masters. Darth Marr ordered the elite members of the Sith–the ones who orchestrated the Dread Master prison break–to locate Hargrev and his task force. \n\nMeeting up on the surface of Oricon, the Republic and Empire formed a truce after realizing they both failed to defeat the Dread Masters. They managed to cripple the Dread Hosts and started an attack on the Dread Fortress. Both teams were approached by Dread Master Brontes and her following creations & servants: Nefra, Qor’thest, Draxus, Grob’thok, and Corruptor Zero. Brontes and her forces were defeated and killed by the truced task force, who later discovered a portal leading to the true Dread Master base, the Dread Palace. \n\nOnce entering the portal, they discovered the four remaining Sith Lords, where they tried to kill the task force but failed. Once reaching the throne room, the Dread Masters taunted their apprehenders, which to their surprise, realized they were truly a challenge. The Sith Lords decided to summon the spirits of Brontes and Styrak to assist the fight, but managed to be defeated regardless. When they realized how close they were to dying, the Dread Masters used some of their life force as an attempt to completely destroy the strike team, which ended up as a failure. The team managed to survive and took down the remaining Dread Masters one by one.\n\n# Aftermath\nAfter ending the Dread Master’s rogue plans and stopping the current threat to the galaxy, a Republic camp had the unexpected visit of Dread Master Calphayus. Surprisingly, he survived his death and was changed by it. He explained that he saw the light and was no longer bound to his peers.

They took place in the Galaxy and happened during the Pius Dea Era. The main reason the crusades happened was that according to Pius Dea’s beliefs, every alien species were to be eradicated from the Galaxy.# History\nThe Pius Dea Crusades mainly happened because of the Goddess, an entity that ordered her followers to slaughter every rival alien sect. Everyone who followed her orders would receive a reward from the Goddess. Following the Goddess’ will, Pius Dea members engaged against the Hutt Space region from 11,962 to 11,920 BBY. These four Crusades granted Pius Dea new alien territories: Delacrix, Nimban, Knewnn, and Toydaria. After Pius Dea took over the Galactic Republic, their leader known as Contispex and his successors sought to purify the Galaxy by eliminating those who were not humans. By 11,884 BBY, Pius Dea fought one of their most important Crusades, known as the Great Northern Crusade or the Seventh Pius Dea Crusade. In this battle, the Pius Dea followers fought against Zabraks and the Ithorians and their home planets, being these Ithor for the Ithorians and Iridonia for the Zabraks. \nDuring 11,820 BBY, a battle known as the Sixth Alsakan Conflict was happening between the planet of Coruscant against Alsakan. The Pius Dea’s origins date back to Coruscant, so the alien species moved to Alsakan for protection. After the Sixth Alsakan Conflict finished, Pius Dea targeted the Herglic Space region in a battle known as the Eleventh Pius Dea Crusade in 11,707 BBY. After this event, Pius Dea attacked the Zarricines and Teirasans in the Twelfth Pius Dea Crusade in 11,660 BBY.\n\n# The end of Pius Dea\nThe end of Pius Dea and their Crusades date back to the Battle of Uquine and the Seventh Alsakan Conflict, where the Jedi and the planet of Alsakan allied to eradicate the humancentric cult. The Jedi allied with the Alsakani and Caamasi to make a schism inside of Pius Dea that would spread a secret heresy. Those who left would be known as the Renunciates. The Republic Navy Admiral Pers Pradeux was a Renunciate, and he planned to overthrow the Republic along with other Renunciates in 10,970 BBY, Prefsbelt IV. \nThree years after this event, the Seventh Alsakan Conflict began and left Pius Dea with fewer members. As well, the Bureau of Ships and Services made most of Pius Dea’s fleets go to hyperspace, leaving Pius Dea with almost no military assets. The persecution of aliens ended in the Battle of Uquine, in 10,966 BBY. In this battle, Pius Dea was defeated successfully as the cult along with their leader, Supreme Chancellor Contispex XIX, were captured and removed from their charges.\n\n","meta":{"index":43,"author":"ValenTemenos","name":"Pius Dea Crusades","release_year":2022}},"Sith Civil War":{"content":"# Prologue |\nThe Sith Civil War was an event sparking warfare and infighting between the Sith of Revan’s shattered Sith Empire in 3958 BBY, ending in the Galactic Republic taking control of additional Sith territory in 3950 BBY. Following the events of the Jedi Civil War that resulted in the demise of Darth Malak, many of the Sith Lords that dedicated their loyalty to both Malak and Revan sought to take advantage of the aftermath of the Jedi Civil War and take advantage of it, they did. The Sith Lords scavenged what remained of Revan’s Empire, taking points of interest, artifacts, technology, and whatever else they happened to come across. Piece by piece, the Sith Empire was ripped apart, each of the remaining Sith Lords taking what they could and proclaiming themselves as warlords. Due to this, a multitude of different spaces became occupied by these various warlords and infighting began.# The Conflict |\nAs more Sith entitled themselves to be the rightful ruler of the Empire entirely, the conflict began to see its first battles on the planet Korriban; the homeworld of the Sith. Their destructive, gruesome, and harsh battles ended in the desertion of the Dreshdae settlement that the Czerka Corporation utilized: a former allying faction of the Sith Empire that provided an abundance of technology. The Jedi also involved themselves in the conflict as the former Lord Revan commanded Jedi forces in an invasion of the Sith homeworld. This invasion forced many of the Sith Lords to retreat and the planet was essentially uninhabited.\n\n\n\tThe Sith that managed to survive and expand into Sith territory continued to battle for dominant control and leadership over the Sith Empire; however, this allowed for the complete destruction of the Sith Empire and for a newer one to emerge, led by the strongest Sith Lords at the time. Eventually, Darth Sion and Darth Nihilius came into the spotlight in 3954 BBY and claimed rule over the Sith by formulating the Sith Triumvirate. Those that remained alive within the conflict were accepted into this newly formed Empire; though, a rather short tenure of the leading Sith Lords. After the Sith Triumvirate met its end along with the other aspects of its legacy such as Malachor V and Trayus Academy, the Sith sparked infighting once more leading to yet another destruction of a once-powerful Sith Empire.\n\n# Legacy |\nThis event was part of many reasons why Darth Bane decided to create the Rule of Two. He realized the outcomes of the different battles amongst the Sith and decided to take initiative to prevent this yet also keep the Sith powerful and somewhat in control. The Sith Civil War remained to be the true destruction of Darth Revan’s Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic used it to aid their efforts in purging the Sith from the galaxy completely. By taking control of Sith spaces and other territories that the Republic had lost, this superpower became the dominant faction within the galaxy once more despite the losses and other conflicts it had faced during the Sith Civil War.\n\n","meta":{"index":12,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Sith Civil War","release_year":2022}},"Great Jedi Purge (Order 66)":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Great Jedi Purge, also known as Order 66, was a secret command implanted in the brains of clone troopers to execute all Jedi as traitors to the Republic. The Order was designed as a contingency protocol against renegade Jedi, but was actually part of a plan by the Sith to eliminate the Jedi and seize power. The execution of Order 66 led to the downfall of the Jedi Order and the rise of the Galactic Empire.# Section 1\nAfter the Supreme Commander, Chancellor and Dark Lord of Sith survived the attack of the Jedi Generals, he announced the execution of Order 66. It stated the extermination of all Jedi during the Clone Wars and a signal was sent to all clones in their brain chips. They immediately killed all Jedi and future members of the Jedi Order because they were against the Republic. When Order 66 was issued, a number of Clone Troopers believed it to be a false order and began to protect the Jedi instead of killing them. Several other Jedi survived by killing the attacking Clone Troopers. Darth Vader led the campaign to hunt down and kill most of the survivors in the years following Order 66. This Imperial destruction of the Jedi is known as the Great Jedi Purge. Over 100 Jedi and former Jedi went into hiding and survived the entire Purge; for example, Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi survived by going into exile on the remote planets of Dagobah and Tatooine.\n\n# Section 2\nThose who survived began to hide from the Empire and its Inquisitors. Many hid behind the popular Outer Rim rings to avoid falling into the hands of the Empire or its servants. Some of those who survived were Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and other Jedis such as Chief Librarian Jocasta Nu. When most of those Jedi who were in hiding were found, the Inquisitors and Sith began to search for force-sensitive ones in order to revive the Sith armies as they were in the Old Republic. One of those who became Inquisitors and went over to the dark side was the Grand Inquisitor, a former Temple Guard.\n\n","meta":{"index":54,"author":"Minato_Yt108","name":"Great Jedi Purge (Order 66)","release_year":2023}},"Destruction of Tund":{"content":"# Overview\nThe destruction of Tund was caused by Rokur Gepta, a member of the Croke species. He lived on this planet, and hosted a Toong dispora that inhabited the planet after the destruction of Toong'L. This planet has a relatively small history, with its first known inhabitants being a colony of purebred Sith. Gepta used his and his colony's power to infiltrate a group of force users on the planet. After successfully doing this and using the colony to learn all he could, he set out an atomic superweapon that destroyed the planet and turned it into a toxic wasteland.\n\nBefore its destruction, Tund was an extremely wildlife-rich planet with over 18 million different species, sentient and non sentient, residing on it. It had a very diverse wildlife, containing species like Toong and pureblood Sith. Due to the emperor's sheer interest in the Sorcerers of this planet, he called on Gepta to act as a Scrivinir for the possessor of the ancient Sith secrets of these Sorcerers. He was paid with an Imperial Cruiser and used it to contain his hold over this isolated area of the galaxy.

He worked under CaesarTemenos for quite some time until he got the opportunity to build D&S. After Caesar took this opportunity he became the Grand Sorcerer. After Champaai had a falling out with TaitusTemenos (my master / overlord of e&d), he transferred to D&S. Shortly after Caesar granted him the title of Darth. D&S was in shambles and it was doomed from the beginning due to the lack of people in leadership positions. I helped fix that problem and shortly after it prospered.\n\n Caesar wanted to kaggath KennaexMalvern for Hand of the Dark Lord as he was not doing his job properly. He was one of his loyal men that helped him through thick and thin. (Fun fact: if we lost the kaggath Kennaex would have demoted everyone that was Lord+ to ASK for 2 weeks as a punishment.) Champaai became the Overlord when Caesar won the Kaggath and wanted to increase D&S their value within our community. This was not liked by other spheres and a mutiny was being orchestrated. Darth Hyvar wanted to retire after the sphere he helped grow turnt against him. But Caesar gave me an offer to give the Dark Honor Guard a try and Champaai  accepted. DHG was doing really well since a lot of veterans were in the high ranks: UnforceTemenos, MartinTLincoln, TaitusTemenos, and eventually Champaai became a Sergeant. One month after becoming a Sergeant he did not enjoy DHG as much, since I love communicating with our beloved community and the only way he could really do it was by utilizing our discord.

Havok is a notable member of The Known Galaxy, having originally served within The Jedi Order’s Temple Guard. He is a beloved and well-liked member of the community, garnering respect from all. His hard work during his previous tenure as Overlord of the Sphere of Laws and Justice laid the foundations of the sphere and made it what it is today.# History\nBefore Havok was a member of The Sith Order, he originally joined The Jedi Order in October of 2020. Focused and determined with the singular goal of joining the prestigious Temple Guard, he achieved knighthood not long after and went on to become a Captain within it. His work within the Temple Guard shaped the division as a whole, with the Temple Guards being seen as highly skilled, disciplined and role models of the community. Havok then proceeded to serve a tenure as Commandant furthering both the discipline and reputation of the Temple Guard.\n\nAfter some time however, Havok sought a change of both pace and scenery. In October of 2021, not long after Vermened had become the Dark Lord of the Sith, he joined The Sith Order and was initially granted a place within the Sphere of Laws and Justice as both a Darth and a member of the Inner Council. Serving under ArgusOtto, Havok went on to lay the foundations of the sphere alongside him until ArgusOtto’s unfortunate retirement. But with this came opportunity, as Havok then ascended to the Dark Council and became the new Overlord of the sphere.\n\nHavok built the sphere from the ground up, drafting the Doctrine of The Sith and creating the laws of our order which are still very much in use today. He carried on with his duties, shaping the Doctrine as time went on at the behest of the Dark Council. Havok worked tirelessly thereon to make the sphere an example to all others and to ensure that the laws of the Sith were not neglected.\n\nFollowing the resignation of Darth Reavion, otherwise known as Notom and the previous Will of the Dark Lord,  the Dark Lord Validus had deemed Havok fit to serve as his replacement. His ascension to the Powerbase had all but cemented his legacy within the order, and to this day, he continues to serve the Dark Lord faithfully. Havok continues to work hard, as he has always done, and it is doubtless that he will go down as one of the order’s greatest leaders.\n\n# Achievements\nAlthough his achievements are far too vast to list, some of his greater ones will be documented.\n\n- Havok authored the Doctrine of the Sith, the basis of our order’s laws which are still used today.\n\n- Havok became Commandant of the Temple Guard within The Jedi Order, creating a reputation for them that none could question.\n\n- Havok has served, and still serves,  as the longest consecutive councilor on the Dark Council.\n\n- Havok is the second Will of the Dark Lord and one of the only four people to ever serve on the Powerbase.\n\n","meta":{"index":2,"author":"CaesarTemenos","name":"Darth Havok","release_year":2022}},"Commander Arcanum":{"content":"# Overview:\nCommander Arcanum, also known as EscanorTemenos or Ray, is currently the leader of the Dark Honor Guard and a Darth of the Sith Order.

While he is currently a part of the Honor Guard, he has held the title of Darth numerous times in the past, helping direct the direction of different Spheres at different times.

After passing the necessary classes, he became the padawan of AuthenticArtifact and was knighted on the 19th of May. He walked the path of the Guardian, joining the Jedi Paladins, a specialisation under the Council of First Knowledge. He was promoted to Instructor and assistant head of the specialisation on the 3rd of July for a few weeks before Paladins were disbanded due to a lack of purpose. Ray instead became a Peacekeeper under the Council of Reconciliation for 4 weeks before becoming bored of the job and instead pursuing the path of the Sentinel and transferring to the Jedi Investigators, remaining an Instructor until he eventually ascended to the rank of Jedi Master, succeeding Unite5000 as the Chief Investigator. During his time as a normal Investigator, Eseray joined the Jedi Assault Team and quickly made his way through the ranks before becoming a Warrior in it, actively hosting and interacting with its members. His time in the Jedi Order would continue this way until he retired on October 1st, 2021, and eventually outright left the community for some time.\n\nAct I: The first Overseer.\nEseray joined the Sith Order on the 26th of November after seeing his friend SlenderMalvern in it and became the first Sith Overseer on the very same day by Vermened, being exempt from the trials of Knighthood like many early members of the Order. This was unofficial due to the fact he, Slender, and xLiamint were working on documents for the Sphere of Sith Philosophy in the background. On the 4th of November, he was officially a member of the Sith Order and sat on the Inner Circle of Philosophy as Chairman of the Assembly, managing the Sith Overseers and raising the first generation of actual Sith Knights. It continued on like this, with him even being awarded an accolade of activity from the Dark Council as recognition for his work on the 4th of December. 20 days later, EscanorTemenos would join the Inner Circle of the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy as the Darth that would be in control of the Juggernauts, the elite Warriors of the Sphere. Along with Esociety, CaesarTemenos, and TaitusTemenos, they would lead the Sphere to glory and prominence. In February 2022, Escanor earnt the Dark Council’s Leadership Accolade and on the 8th of March, he eventually retired from Darth and would be succeeded by Darth Vican.\n\nAct II: Destiny in solidarity.\nOn the 29th of March 2022, EscanorTemenos would step out of retirement into Lordship after being asked to by the Dark Lord Vermened himself for the Sith Training Corps, a division of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and a parallel to the Jedi Service Corps that would ultimately never be taken out of its thinking stage. Escanor instead joined the Sith Honor Guard on the 24th of April and worked hard until he finally became a Sergeant on the 10th of May. This was around the time most of the notable members of the High Command left, including TaitusTemenos, UnforceTemenos, ChampaaiTemenos, and MartinTLincoln. The only members of the High Command left, excluding Escanor, were HitMan9124 and ValorisAshen. HitMan was generally inactive and Commander Valdor was busy with real life, so if the Dark Honor Guard were to maintain its discipline, standards, and principles, Escanor alone would need to do so until more competent people could come along and become High Command. It was like this for some time, as Escanor would train the new generations of Dark Honor Guardsmen and those most worthy remained loyal to the purpose they served as the Emperor’s Guard, while the unfit were cast out. Through his efforts, Escanor was given the rank of Lieutenant on the 25th of May with his subordinates soon becoming a member of the High Command, the most notable of which being Dabroos and Bobdavejimmy and on the 1st of June, Escanor became a senior officer, a Captain of the Dark Honor Guard as Commander Valdor would recognise his efforts in demonstrating his capabilities, competences, and leadership. He was second only to Valdor in terms of guiding the Dark Honor Guard as a whole.\n\nAct III: Commander Arcanum, the Harbinger.\nAlmost four months after becoming Captain, on the 29th of September, EscanorTemenos would ascend to the rank of Commander. Having free reign over controlling and changing the Dark Honor Guard, he began directly serving under the new Hand of the Dark Lord, Darth Valdor, who succeeded Darth Kennaex. Whether he shall continue serving as a Commander or change once more is uncertain, but Escanor has expressed how much he enjoys the Dark Honor Guard and how proud they make him.

This changed when he discovered that the TSO was opening and they were opening a division for the Dark Honor Guard. This immediately piqued his interest and he spoke to the current Commandant at the time, LucifersWrath, about securing a spot in it.

Darth Hestiva wasn't the only one who decided to switch to SoP; her friend Darth Cervisa had to do the same. This was the beginning of Darth Hestiva and Darth Cervisa's race to Lord.

These titles were given to those who led the Juggernauts and made sure that no E&D members were falling behind in their combat abilities. He excelled in these tasks and four months later he would be rewarded. After serving as a Sith Lord for four months, Strages was finally promoted to Darth and remained in the Inner Circle. As Darth, Strages would become the Keeper of Records and did a lot of behind the scenes work for E&D. As Keeper of Records, Strages was given the privilege of hosting E&D tryouts every Wednesday. With this privilege, he was also given the opportunity to supervise all Neophyte Instructors, a rank given to lower rank individuals who would host E&D tryouts whenever Strages was busy. The most important thing Strages does is he takes care of the Sith Order notion page. Strages makes sure that all rules, strategic information, the archives, and logging activity are  up to date. Strages does his best to help the Order and he excels in combat, hence why he was given the legendary Dark Council Combat Prowess Accolade. Strages continues to serve E&D and the Order to the best of his ability and still exceeds  his duty as Keep of Records.\n\n","meta":{"index":18,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Darth Strages","release_year":2022}},"Darth Kaderim":{"content":"# Overview\nDarth Kaderim, known as AuthenticPurpose, is the current Overlord of the Sphere of Mysteries, and member of the Dark Council. \nHe became the first Overlord of the reconstituted Sphere of Mysteries after its shutdown back in April 10 2022. He’s the 2nd ever Sphere of Mysteries’  Overlord, preceded by Morsaki.# Early days\nHe became part of The Known Galaxy on the 25th of October 2020 by joining the Jedi Order. On the 1st of November, he would join the prestigious Temple Guard: it would be there that he’d make plenty of future connections and friendships. By the 12th of November, he was already a Jedi Knight. On the 20th of November, he became an Advanced Jedi Knight, specifically a Jedi Guardian. He would continue serving in the Temple Guard until the 7th of May 2021.\n\n# Brief return\nHe would return to the Jedi Order on the 28th of August to rejoin the Temple Guard, where he would once again become a Guardian. His stay would be considerably long until he chose to leave the Jedi Order in the early days of January 2022. As you may tell, short retirements followed by returns characterize Kaderim's history in the group. He spent in total about a full year worth of time in The Jedi Order, though he never chose to go further than Jedi Guardian as it wasn’t his desire. \nRegardless, during his time in The Jedi Order he'd make plenty of friendships and obtained lots of achievements: such as the two Jedi High Council Accolades of Activity and Kindness. During the small time spans between rejoining the Jedi Order and entering the temple guard again he covered many roles in the Council of Reconciliation, such as Jedi Investigator, Jedi Peacekeeper and Jedi Watchman. He'd also reach the fourth place of the second edition of the Duelist Of The Order tournament.\n\n# Becoming a Sith\nHe turned to the dark side on the 24th of January 2022, joining The Sith Order. \nHe joined the Sphere of Mysteries on the 29th of January after being taken as an apprentice by Morsaki and has barely changed spheres since. \nOn the 3rd of February he passed his Knights trials, with his Overseer being xLiamint, defining his ability as “above average”. Two days later, he received the prized Dark Council Activity Accolade. \nOn the 6th of February he became a Sith Lord right away, and shortly after he achieved the status of Darth on the 16th of February. This was due to his stunning contributions to his sphere, thus allowing him to be the first person to enter the Sphere of Mysteries’ Inner Circle. \nIt is important to mention that during this time, The Sith Order was still fairly small and growing, so large promotions were more frequent. Having been a former member of the Temple Guard, he had some acquaintances who had also transferred to the Sith, such as his former Chief of Security Vermened, and EscanorTemenos. It is also important to note that the Sphere of Mysteries was still in its first stages when he joined, as it had been introduced just a few weeks ago, on the 18th of January. Nevertheless, he did earn all his promotions rightfully with outstanding activity and participation. \nHe would keep his status as Darth until he briefly retired to Sith Elder on the 7th of March. He’d return a few weeks later on the 31st of March as an Advanced Sith Knight of the sphere of Defense and Security.\n\n# After the dissolution\nOn the 10th of April, the dissolution of the Sphere of Mysteries meant for Kaderim the loss of plenty of things: his old sphere of influence, his home, as well as many of the friends he had made in Mysteries… and yet he kept going forward, showing TSO a great example of how perseverance and strong-will lead to greatness. \nHe would join Laws & Justice’s Interrogators for a brief period in order to join its division - the newly formed \"Order of the Oracle\" - on the 18th of April 2022. The leader of the Order of the Oracle would also just so happen to be Morsaki, his past Overlord. \nJust when things were seeming to improve again though, his division leader, former Overlord, and former master Morsaki would cease being a part of the Order on the 24th of April. As a result, his division leader would be replaced by PurposeMalvern, who would remain the highest rank of the Order of the Oracle until its dissolution.\n\n# His time in the Order of the Oracle\nWhile his time in the Order of the Oracle was short as it would be shut down briefly after, he still describes it as a fantastic division with a very great ambience. To quote his own words, he has been briefly interviewed about the Order of the Oracles. \n> “It was quite.. united at times. However, the general feeling I understood from my time as assisted lead in Oracles, the high ranks and low ranks were very divided and there really wasn't enough communication at times. The high command was definitely more active than the entry-level ranks of the division, which led to some activity issues. I believe as of today, Mysteries is more functional, although Oracles’ job was a lot more hands-on and present in-game, which was something I appreciated.”\n\n# The return of Mysteries\nOn the 8th of May the Sphere of Mysteries was reintroduced (the Order of the Oracle was shut down on the same day), and Authentic was appointed as its Overlord by the Dark Council itself. As of today, 18th of September 2022, he has no intentions to retire anytime soon, and continues to serve as the Sphere of Mysteries’ widely supported Overlord. And all his Inner Circle members and operatives find him to be a fantastic leader, who may even hold his position for the years to come. \nAs for what exactly he does in his sphere that makes him such an efficient, skilled and beloved by his subordinates Overlord… \n\nWell, it's a Mystery.\n-Remalior, Sith Loremaster\n\n","meta":{"index":3,"author":"Remalior","name":"Darth Kaderim","release_year":2022}},"Darth Cibus":{"content":"# Biography Overview\nDarth Cibus joined the Sith Order on the 8th of June 2022.

He began training near the Jedi Sanctum, taken unofficially as WieldingDesire’s, otherwise known as the butcher of the Jedi’s apprentice. They laid siege together to the famous Jedi Academy, along with the raiding party “Ventarri”, forming a connection to the Dark Side. He’s currently one of the most feared and ruthless Dark Councilors, renowned for his dashing quick strikes and his devastating, powerful blows in lightsaber combat. To the Jedi, he’s one of the most dangerous adversaries there can be. A machine replaces half of his face, giving him a more terrifying look.# History\nBefore the birth of the Sith Order in the community, Darth Surge came across The Known Galaxy by joining SilverStallions, a veteran of the Jedi Temple Guard. As an hostile in the game, he began an unofficial apprenticeship under WieldingDesire after meeting the first time. Together they caused a lot of trouble to the Jedi, and had fun in the process, using the Jedi Sanctum to its full extent to ambush from the shadows, using chandeliers in the archives or any other structure found inside the temple. They fought in every possible location in the Sanctum, along with a small raiding party known as “Ventarri”, always yearning for the existence of a Sith Order. After some time, Surge stumbled upon the first version of the Sith Order, before it was truly put into use, joining it under the reign of Fedlz, raiding the Jedi alongside Sith Wraith KentuckySquid, TaitusMydrek [TaitusTemenos] and FerrumCaesar [CaesarTemenos].\n\n# From entering the Order to IC of E&D\nOnce Darth Surge joined the Sith Order as a Hopeful, he enjoyed the increasing strength and power the Sith were having during raids. He knew where he was headed: The Sphere of Sith Philosophy. However, he was denied entry there, so on 11/11/2021 he chose to join a private tryout hosted by Darth Kennaex. After a well-fought battle, he won a 3v1 fight in the process during gladiator duels, with one of his opponents being the former Dark Honor Guard commander, SanctusTenebris. Kennaex handed Surge an invitation to the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy, which then earned him the rank of Sith Knight in the Order, and Raider of Expansion & Diplomacy. The first few days in the Sphere were almost completely combat-based, if not 100% combat-based. He tried his best to remain at the top of his game, defeating the majority of contestants and acquiring both the Combat Prowess accolade and the Wrath of the Dark Lord title. He had a bit of a hard time ascending to Juggernaut, as the rank required leadership, which he was taught after countless raids together with Kennaex, along with Caesar and Taitus. After earning the rank of Warrior, and soon after Juggernaut, he continued to work well for E&D. This time is referred to as the golden age of the Sphere, as it was more of a group and family than an actual Sphere. Every time he went on a raid, he became better and better, and after a long time of promised seats inside of the IC, he was eventually on the day 11/27/2021 appointed alongside Caesar as Sith Lord, and Inner Circle member of the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy, overseeing recruitment, propaganda and tryouts. Shortly after, on the day 12/11/2021 he earned the rank of Darth and became Darth Sorg, now known as Darth Surge. Around this time Darth Kennaex became Hand of the Dark Lord, with Taitus as his successor and Overlord of E&D.\n\n# Feats and Accomplishments\n-First Sith Knight under Darth Validus’ reign\n\n\n-First Sith Warrior under Darth Validus' reign \n\n-First Wrath of the Dark Lord \n\n\n-First Overlord to rally 30+ sphere members\n\n\n-First Accolade of Combat Prowess\n\n\n-Third Overlord of The Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy \n\n\n-First Sith who has been in the same sphere for over a year \n\n\n-Second longest Dark Councilor\n\n\nAccolades\n\nDC | Activity Accolade\nDC | Combat Prowess Accolade\nDC | Leadership Accolade\n\n","meta":{"index":22,"author":"SpawnKiller123","name":"Darth Surge","release_year":2023}},"Darth Tacitus":{"content":"# Lore of Darth Tacitus\nWith a legendary obsession with knowledge and power, Darth Tacitus had established himself as one of the most prominent Darths in his time. Rising through the ranks to become a Loremaster Of Ancient Knowledge, he was even selected for the inner circle of Sphere of Philosophy  - yet all too soon disappeared mysteriously before the Sith Empire's Great Galactic War broke out, leaving behind an aura of mystery that has never been solved. In pursuit for answers hidden within The Force itself which nobody else had discovered priorly; it seemed like no obstacle could stand against this powerful being ... until suddenly: He vanished from sight without warning or explanation.\n\nHe was a renowned scholar, unlocking secrets of Force abilities thought to have been lost forever. But his name soon became synonymous with domination and tyranny, as he used powerful manipulation techniques to bend those around him to their knees in submission - no matter the cost. Tales spread throughout the galaxy told dark stories of this figure who seemed capable of controlling any mind that crossed his path; tales which even today still remain embedded deep into history’s narrative.\n\nTacitus was a brilliant and powerful Darth, nurturing his apprentices Cheifzac, Sincerespirit, Samsungcharger, Worlock365, Renjaal, Lil_ninjy, Revjaal, Aappamo3757, Malgorr. Into becoming mighty Sith warriors and infamous inquisitors. With their terrifying strength they banded together to form a fanatical cult devoted exclusively to furthering Tacitus' teachings - an unstoppable force loyally dedicated only towards attaining more power for him.\n\nDarth Tacitus was a formidable foe against anyone brave enough to cross blades with him. His superior knowledge of lightsaber techniques combined with his instinctive understanding of the Force made for an unbeatable combination on any battlefield, so much so some claimed it seemed almost magical. He disappeared without warning leading up to The Great Galactic War and remained lost during its duration, leaving as deep a mystery surrounding his fate as there had been when he first mastered combat arts that defied expectation.# Contributions\nDarth Tacitus began his journey devoted to the dark side and eager to demonstrate his power. As he gained rank, however, he realized there was more for him within the Sith than simply overpowering Jedi in battle - he wanted knowledge to be shared among those searching for their place on the darkside too. He embraced this passion by writing various articles and tutoring newbies as they found their way through treacherous Sith teachings.\n\nWith a commanding presence, Darth Tacitus led the Sphere of Philosophy's database inner circle with impressive leadership. He encouraged his team to reach their fullest potential through hours of rigorous training - an example from which others could not help but be inspired by.\n\nDarth Tacitus  had a remarkable life: from Knight to Inquisitor, Curator to Lord and Darth- his wide-ranging experience has earned him the title of Loremaster of Ancient Knowledge and earning him the title as a Darth and Inner circle of Sphere of Sith Philosophy.\n\n# Miscellaneous\nAWARDS: DC | Activity Accolade, DC | Leadership Accolade,  DC | Dark Knowledge Accolade\n\nAFFILIATIONS: Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, Sphere of Sith Philosophy \n\nMASTERS: Vialus\n\nAPPRENTICES: Renjaal, Luxjaal, Revjaal, Malgorr, Worlock365 and Samsungcharger\n\nCURRENT RANKS: Retired/Dead\n\n# Community Words\nIlquids -” he got me my lightsaber and did my 2nd training.

As a new Known Galaxy player, Darth Nödt only spent a little amount of time playing the game, and only ever really played when there was a training so he could rank up. He ascended to the rank of Adept within a few days, but from there his Known Galaxy path came to a short halt. Roughly 21 days later, which was 02/24/2022, Darth Nödt joined his first Sphere, it was none other than the Sphere of Defense & Security (D&S). Before joining D&S, Darth Nödt hadn’t a clue of what Sphere he was going to join, it was only when D&S tryouts happened and he was bored and online, he decided. Sadly, he faced internet difficulties and struggled to join tryouts causing him to fail his first attempt. Fortunately, ChampaaiTemenos kindly offered Darth Nödt a special D&S tryout on a private server. Champaai saw the potential the young Sith Adept had and he succeeded in the tryout. He was an official member of the ancient D&S.# A Test of Loyalty\nDarth Nödt served as the apprentice of Champaai and was determined to become a Knight and Centurion. He was inspired by Champaai to accomplish the goal of freedom as a Knight and only served as an apprentice for a 7-day period of time. After serving Champaai, his ambition was put aside because along came a new threat, one that would change Darth Nödt’s path and end Champaai’s reign as D&S Overlord. The Kaggath arrived. Brolion challenged Champaai to a Kaggath, and Darth Nödt already knew what side to join. Nödt, as a gift to his former master for his support in both passing tryouts and ascending, was to pledge allegiance in this kaggath. Champaai was defeated. Brolion was titled Overlord of D&S. What about Nödt? Het continued to serve D&S for a while and noticed they were in need of Shamans. He quickly ascended to the rank of Inquisitor to help out the Sphere. This choice would forever change his views and lead him to a more difficult path.\n\n# Change in Paths:\nNödt had a very powerful ally, an ally that changed his path. This ally was none other than the Dark Councillor and Overlord of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy, Darth Zinwrath the wise. The connection he had with such a powerful being would allow him to join the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and obtain a prestigious role. Nödt joined the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and was a part of the Order of the Loremaster, which was how he formed the connection with Zin. Nödt’s literature skills are quite impressive and that’s why he joined the Order of the Loremaster. Nödt started to provide more literary skills rather than combative skills. He ended up becoming a Harbinger, which made him more mature and changed his personality. As a Harbinger, Nödt became more mature, he acted more professionally and he learned how to act towards the lower ranks of the community. Once again, Nödt was faced with a difficult path. The Dark Council saw Nödt’s abilities and on 05/08/2022 the Spheres were reformed. The Dark Council had allowed Nödt to choose between remaining in the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and obtaining a prestigious rank or to remain in the division he served as the oldest member and one in which he already attained a secondary leadership position, the reformed Sphere of Ancient Knowledge. Nödt contemplated this difficult decision for a while, but we all know how it turns out. Nödt chose to remain in the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge because of his familiarity with how the system works and his intellectual skills. Nödt was a very helpful person and chose to pursue another path, the Sith Academy. He taught at the Academy for a while and quickly ascended to the rank of Overseer. Unfortunately, Nödt faced a few unexpected circumstances and wasn’t able to perform at his best sometimes. However, he also ascended to the rank of Lord and had to give up his position as Overseer. Luckily for me, Nödt, before he became Lord, was able to host what would be his final Knight Trials. Nödt hosted my Knight Trials and that would be the last Knight Trial he would ever host, I am ever thankful for that.\n\n# Rise of Darth Nödt:\nSomething unexpected happened, Darth Lividus, the Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, left the Order not long after his Inner Circle member, Darth Audax. All that was left was Martin, Unforce and Darth Nödt. Sadly, Martin and Unforce also left the Order, which led the Sphere into chaos. The Dark Council set up Overlord applications and Nödt applied to become Overlord. Luckily, Nödt became the new Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and Dark Councillor. This was odd because Nödt was a mere Lord, but his skills and dedication to the Sphere benefitted him very well and he was rewarded with the rank of Overlord. Nödt rose to become a great Overlord of our Sphere and has served Ancient Knowledge to the best of his abilities. Nödt changed a few rules in the Sphere that benefitted us and has been trying his best as Overlord. Nödt still serves as the Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge to this day and has done many things for us, such as introducing accolades and purges that motivate us to do our required tasks. Nödt currently serves as the third oldest Dark Councillor and is very experienced. He has taught the Sphere well.\n\n","meta":{"index":5,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Darth Nödt","release_year":2022}},"Quartermaster Meka Odullu":{"content":"# Introduction\nSith Quartermaster Meka Odullu is a developer for The Known Galaxy.

He started his journey as a Hopeful and made his way to Darth. Apeiros passed all of his Sith training at a fast pace and quickly became an apprentice of Youngboyboosie, who taught Apeiros everything he needed to know. He tried not to be an apprentice for very long because he desired to ascend within the Sphere of Sith Philosophy, which he joined as an apprentice as well. After serving as an apprentice, Apeiros quite rapidly ascended through the ranks of the Sith Order and the Sith Academy. He spent most of his free time hosting Sith training for new members, he loved to teach. He also tried his best to get his fellow teachers to host as many training sessions as they could. Unfortunately, a lot of teachers had too much work to focus on the Academy and they just remained there.# The Legacy:\nApeiros, as a beginner Sith, saw that there was a major flaw within the Order. There was a lack of training sessions being hosted for newer generations of Sith. How could we all ascend if there were no classes? Apeiros sought to fix this flaw by joining the Academy. This is why he tried his best to ascend to the rank of Overseer. Before getting Overseer, Apeiros desired to become a Warrior. He hosted as many classes as he could and did all his trials. He found himself ascending to the rank of Warrior about three weeks after being a Sith Knight, he failed his trials because he did it three days too early. He still got there, however. As a Warrior, Apeiros tried to become a Sith Praefect, which is the equivalent of a Warrior in the Sphere of Sith Philosophy. He achieved the rank of Praefect and was granted the privilege of hosting Korriban Excursions, which is how Acolyte III ascended to Adepts. He continued to strive his best in hosting and was soon given the rank of Overseer, after two weeks of being a Warrior. Apeiros was an Overseer for a very long time. He hosted countless Sith Knight trials during his time and he also found the time to continue hosting classes for newer Siths. Therefore, Apeiros was given the rank of Sith Lord or in the Academy’s case, Assistant Headmaster, less than two months after ascending to Overseer. Apeiros was now the Assistant Headmaster and a Sith Lord of the Order. Firstly, he needed to improve the activity of teachers. Apeiros brought in the well-known Sith Academy event, in which the person who had the most Academy credits by the end of the month got in-game credits for lightsabers. This is an event still used to this day so the Academy’s activity rates can be boosted. Apeiros spent a lot of hard work on this, he talked to Darth Zinwrath and Zinwrath did his best to convince the Dark Council and the dev team, and he was successful. Together, Zinwrath and Apeiros made it an official Academy event. After being a Sith lord and Assistant Headmaster for only nine days, Apeiros was rapidly given the title of Headmaster and was an official Darth of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy. He did his best to serve his Sphere, but his main focus was still the Academy. As keeper of Records, Apeiros tasked himself with removing inactive members and looking through Sphere interest forms. He also had to log people into the database and before the Sith Academy became a sub-Sphere, Apeiros was tasked with revising some of the google docs. He was very busy. Sadly, Apeiros’ time within the Order had to come to an end. Apeiros retired from the Sith Order and his respected Sphere, he stepped down as Headmaster a while before his retirement, however, and was given the rank of Elder once he retired.\n\n","meta":{"index":30,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Darth Apeiros","release_year":2022}},"Darth Ignis":{"content":"# Rising Fire\nDarth Ignis was an Inner Circle member, Darth, and Curator Overseer in the Sith Order. He served his Sphere to the best of his ability. He started as a Hopeful and attempted the Rite of Passage twice, he then became an Acolyte and eventually an Adept. Ignis always wanted to join the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and as soon as he became an Adept, he applied for the Sphere. Ignis then looked for a Master, it took him a while and he had two Masters. His final Master was Darth Xenion, who worked in the Sphere of Mysteries. Ignis was an Apprentice for quite a while and was very eager to ascend to Sith Knight. Once he reached this rank, Ignis was even more determined to become an Inquisitor. Due to his Apprenticeship with Darth Xenion, Ignis decided to join his Master in the Sphere of Mysteries for a while. He left Ancient Knowledge and join the Sphere of Mysteries for around three weeks. He quickly became an Inquisitor there and joined the Sith Savants. His Sphere of Mysteries career was all classified but it was enjoyable. He returned to the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and started to help more. He wrote a lot of articles, eventually reaching the most ever articles written for the Sphere in its history. Ignis would soon earn the rank of Sith Lord, where he’d perform a lot more duties and become even more active. Ignis at that point earned the DC Activity Accolade and was promoted to Sith Lord for his dedication to the Sphere. Upon earning the rank of Sith Lord, Ignis was the only leader in the Curator specialization. He guided young Curators and those aspiring to become Curators. On top of this, Ignis also had to fill in for the lack of Loremasters, he took it upon himself to start writing more Lore of the Order articles so he could help the Loremasters, due to their lack of members. He worked hard to support his Sphere and all the specializations within it. Ignis truly proved himself as dedicated to the Sphere. This time Ignis wouldn’t leave until he accomplished all of his goals.# Finding the Light\nThe beloved Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, Darth Nodt, decided to retire from the Sphere. Nodt had taught Ignis many things about leadership roles and had guided Ignis throughout his time in the Sphere. Luckily, Nodt had a dedicated replacement. Darth Zinwrath became the Sphere’s new Overlord. Darth Zinwrath had been in the Dark Council for a very long time and was the second oldest member, he originally served the Sphere of Sith Philosophy. Darth Zinwrath’s first goal was to fill up the Inner Circle roles as best as possible. Darth Gallius had been promoted to Darth a while ago and Ignis would be next. Darth Zinwrath decided to promote Ignis to Darth and bestow the Dark Knowledge Accolade upon him. Ignis had earned the accolade through his hard work and dedication to the Sphere, he was still leading the Sphere’s article production. Ignis was the Curator Overseer then and had a few changes in mind. He worked very closely with Darth Gallius and they both came up with some ideas for Curators. Gallius was once a Curator and so he and Ignis changed the specialization. Curators had more ways to work, they had access to the Inspiration channel and would guide the Neophytes and Scribes of the Sphere with unfinished or unclaimed articles. Ignis still worked on articles but he stopped marking them, he wanted his Curators to be more active and so he tried to boost their productivity. He wrote as many articles as he could so the Curators could mark and complete their quotas. Eventually, Ignis began to realize he had done everything he possibly could for the Sphere and there wasn’t much left. He remembered meeting a Jedi Master when he was a Sith Lord, a wise Jedi Master who had changed his views. This Master offered Ignis a spot as his Padawan when Ignis was to join the Jedi. Ignis had finally completed all of his goals; he’d made the most articles for the Sphere in its history, he had earned the Dark Knowledge and Activity Accolade, he had successfully trained a few Apprentices, he had served his Sphere to the best of his abilities, and he had finally earned Darth and was one for a little while until he left the Order and joined the Jedi.\n\n","meta":{"index":26,"author":"Jinqxd","name":"Darth Ignis","release_year":2023}},"Darth Lividus":{"content":"# Overview:\nTaitusTemenos, formerly known as Darth Lividus, is remembered as an Overlord of the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy, the first Overlord of the reopened Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, and former Captain of the Dark Honor Guard.

While in the Assault Team, he was also a member of the Librarian’s Assembly and made articles for it. It should be noted that one of his padawans in the Jedi was someone named FerrumCaesar, this is important for later. \n\nTaitus continued to contribute to the Jedi Order as a Sage until the 30th of August 2021 when Taitus, along with several other former Jedi joined the new Sith Order led and owned by Fedlz. By then, the Sith Order was a few weeks old and was a window of opportunity for those that seeked it, which Taitus eagerly took. He formed a connection with KentuckySquid, the Wrath of the Dark Lord, which would be equivalent to a Powerbase today and was given Sith Knight, becoming one of the first people to lead the Sphere of Military Command, a predecessor to the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy. He was one of the most active members then, frequently leading raids against the Jedi Order.\n\nAct I: The dawn of a new Sphere.\nAccording to him, the Sith Order wasn’t officially integrated into what would become the Known Galaxy yet, so it acted more as an unofficial and highly skilled raiding group. In late October, the Sith Order was slowly transitioning into an official group and Vermened replaced Fedlz as Dark Lord of the Sith. In this new era with vacant positions and new spheres of influence, Taitus would find himself having become a Lord of the new Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy and encouraged his former padawan FerrumCaesar to join as well. They would both become the first ever Sith to be Warlords with Taitus leading Juggernauts and Caesar leading Sorcerers. They worked under the first Overlord of the Sphere, VexillumUsh, who would later become KennaexMalvern.\n\nBoth Caesar and Taitus put an abundance of effort and work into making E&D, but Taitus was the only one of the pair to quickly be promoted and bear the name of Darth Lividus, quickly becoming one of the first ever Darths in the Sith Order in Vermened’s era. Unfortunately, despite putting in as much work as his friend, Caesar was less recognised and faced more hardships compared to Taitus, he would have eventually left the Sith Order had he not been persuaded by Taitus not to again and again. This would be a key point in Caesar’s future.\n\n\nIn November, Taitus was the first Sith to have an Apprentice, keys14, and he would eventually have more to follow, the most notable of which being ChampaaiTemenos and TalonTemenos (now known as ZaynGravidus). Later in the month, Taitus, along with several other Sith were the first to receive the newly made Dark Council Accolades, him receiving one that recognised his leadership and in the middle of December, he was the first to have received the prestigious recognition of Defender of the Order and became the Overlord of Expansion & Diplomacy shortly after his superior ascended to Powerbase on the 17th of December. His Inner Circle consisted of Caesar, Esociety, and EscanorTemenos. According to ZaynGradivus, Taitus got the job done and kept both his IC and Warlords satisfied.\n\nCaesar soon left to become the Overlord of Defense & Security on the 9th of January 2022 while Taitus and his sphere continued to flourish. E&D began to reach its first peak and become a force to be reckoned with, especially against the Jedi Assault Team. In this time, Taitus discovered a conspiracy against him and how his subordinate ChampaaiTemenos planned to kaggath him in early February due to conflicts shared between the two regarding the former being promoted to Darth, which the latter ultimately responded to by removing from him the sphere. Champaai found a place in D&S instead and it all worked out in the best possible future instead, with him easily getting Darth and eventually becoming Overlord after the huge kaggath between Caesar and Kennaex. Champ has stated himself in his interview how he no longer holds any resentment on the topic towards Taitus and that they continue to be good friends.\n\nOn the 20th of February, Overlord of Defense & Security, Darth Bellicus declared a rank kaggath against the Hand of the Dark Lord, Darth Kennaex. A contest of mutual annihilation pitting powerbase against powerbase, where bloodshed would determine victor. This was not just any kaggath, it would be the first rank kaggath in the Sith Order actually fought and won. It was a display of power, dominance, and authority. People bought shirts in support of Caesar, and many spectated the battles between the powerbase of Caesar and the Dark Honor Guard that so valiantly fought in support of the Hand. This was an event that would shake the foundations of the Sith Order as many members new and old knew it and indeed, it was a battle for the history books. It showed how truly impressive Temenos was and how they could unite under one person. It was a kaggath that Taitus had a very large part in as he pledged to Caesar’s powerbase and helped him become the new and rightful Hand of the Dark Lord. After the kaggath, E&D grew into becoming one of the most recognisable groups within the Sith Order and went through reforms to become more of an effective force than it already was. As the Sphere grew, Taitus felt that he had already set it on a path of greatness and success, and after 7 months of building E&D from the ground, he stepped down on March 12th and passed the mantle of Overlord to Esociety, who gave himself the name of Darth Surge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAct II: Salvation in authority and knowledge.\nTaitus saw how the Dark Honor Guard, a group considered separate from the rest of the Sith Order, was dying and had a lack of leadership. Much like E&D, Taitus joined it to pave a path of greatness and build stability in it and went from Dark Councilor to Lieutenant, the first ever Sith to do so. While people questioned his choice regarding the controversial move, he didn’t care and instead worked on the Guard with MartinTLincoln, UnforceTemenos, and ValorisAshen to rebuild and reform, which saw success as they improved the Guard and its standards. Taitus soon earned the rank of Captain, directly below the Commander and overseeing the continued progress of the Guard.\n\nAround a month after joining the Dark Honor Guard and reforming it into a disciplined powerhouse, on the 9th of May, Taitus stepped down from the Dark Honor Guard like he did with the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy, as Vermened was bringing back a few Spheres that were originally decommissioned. With the encouragement of Caesar, Taitus applied to become Overlord of the renewed Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, reborn from the ashes of the Order of the Loremaster and due to his reputation, experience, and Vermened favouring him, he sat on the Dark Council again. Now a member of the Dark Council once more, Taitus and his new Inner Circle formed from his loyal comrades from the Dark Honor Guard brought Ancient Knowledge to a state of glory and renown with the help of propaganda promoting the sphere. Within Ancient Knowledge, they made documents to lay the groundwork for the future of the Sphere and taught new members how to properly format articles. They were the forefathers that truly set up what Ancient Knowledge is now at the time of this article.\n\nWhat Taitus did next was a controversial response to a controversial action done by Project Management and set the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge back for some time due to these actions. On the 13th of June, KennaexMalvern was called to Vermened’s powerbase to become the Hand of the Dark Lord after CaesarTemenos retired, to the dismay of a few veterans of the Sith Order which included Taitus. He felt that the choice of someone who was already Hand and kaggathed out of it for good reason was one of the worst possible choices, rather than picking the Commander of the Dark Honor Guard or a competent member of the Dark Council. So, Taitus left his position hours after Kennaex was announced as Hand without notice or requesting to retire in pure defiance, taking the documents he made for the Sphere and destroying them by permanently changing the language they were in out of the dread that Kennaex would take credit for his work like he claimed that he did with Expansion & Diplomacy. Many thought that he left because he wasn’t given the role of Powerbase himself, but according to him, it was purely because of who actually was chosen. He was content with being Ancient Knowledge’s Overlord and building it up, but he would not continue being in the Sith Order with Kennaex as Hand. So he left the Sith Order, and ard1974 became Overlord due to the fact that the Inner Circle had left with Taitus.\n\n\nAct III: A clean slate.\nOn the 11th of August, Taitus rejoined the Sith Order after spending some time in the Jedi, his return being welcomed by many that recognised who he was. On the 14th, he was already an Adept and became Cyrotica’s Apprentice, attaining Knighthood on the 20th. TaitusTemenos remains as a leader of the Temenos bloodline, an incredibly remarkable bloodline rich with history especially in the Sith Order, due to many members being high ranking and powerful within the Order. He continues being a respected member of the community and like all futures, his is unknown but he has no choice other than to move forward in anticipation of a bright one.\n\n","meta":{"index":11,"author":"Daedima","name":"Darth Lividus","release_year":2022}},"Darth Amarus":{"content":"# Overview\nDarth Amarus, otherwise known as “limeytac” or simply “lime” is a current Inner Circle member and newest Savant Overseer of the Sphere of Mysteries. While her duties remain a secret, she has most definitely aided the Sphere during its highest and lowest points, and is a generally very well-known Darth and Sith in general, being often active around the Order’s communications. Overall, she’s a powerful, knowledgeable and intelligent Sith Lord, being able to utilize information absorbed to her advantage.# History\nDarth Amarus started out as a Hopeful, just like everyone does. She worked hard to climb through the ranks, finding a master, SamuelFederov, who would then drop her when she failed her Knight Trials. She would then be taken by Brolion1, who finally got her through the Trials, and thus she became a Sith Knight. While she was an Adept, Amarus first joined the Sphere of Laws and Justice, but then switched to Defense and Security after being recommended by her master and levithegamer. Once the Sphere shut down, she, along with her master, instead joined the Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy, where she’d spend a lot of time along with other prominent E&D members, becoming a Sorcerer in 2 months. After a while, she decided to join the Dark Honor Guard, thinking it would be an interesting experience. This was her favorite time in The Sith Order, as the Guard was a much more fitting place for her and she generally felt way better back then. However, when people started leaving and it started to drop in activity, Amarus decided to change again and progress in rank somewhere else, so she went back to the Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy. Sadly, the Sphere just wasn’t the same as it was before, so after staying as an Inquisitor for a long while, she decided to leave and join the Sphere of Mysteries. She felt really welcomed in it, and she met people like Darth Tythen, Darth Vederium, bekon, jason and GoldenFreddyy (who also hosted her Knight Trials). Throughout her time in the Sphere, she worked really hard, executing her tasks very quickly and thus earning the rank of Sith Lord after some time. Once Darth Vederium suddenly retired, she had to take over, becoming the new Savant Overseer and Inner Circle member of the Sphere. In her 2 weeks as part of the SoM Inner Circle, she’s taken over the Savants and recruited three new ones, all being great and active members of the Sphere, whom she often talks to.\n\n","meta":{"index":25,"author":"SpawnKiller1326","name":"Darth Amarus","release_year":2023}},"Darth Heisen":{"content":"# Overview:\nTrofyz, formerly known as Darth Heisen, was an Inner Circle member of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and acted as oversight of the Sith Praefects. Trofyz is remembered as a cherished and respected member of the Sith Order for his activity and likeable personality. Although retired as a Sith Elder, people continue to speak of him with admiration.# Biography:\nTrofyz joined the Sith Order on the 27th of February, he attended and quickly passed a Rite of Passage hosted by Vesparum and was inducted into the place he would come to leave a legacy for himself. He passed trainings with ease until he became an Adept on the 2nd of March, 2022. Afterwards, Vesparum made him an apprentice and on the 19th of March, Trofyz joined the Pyramid of Knighthood as a fully fledged member of the Sith Order, under the Sphere of Sith Philosophy. He had potential and skill, both of which he would make others recognise he possessed.\n\nOn the 31st of March, Trofyz was granted the rank and responsibility of Sith Overseer, now able to host Knight Trials and given authority just below that of a Sith Lord’s. According to Chilimeni, Trofyz had never done his Advanced Knight Trials prior to becoming an Overseer. Trofyz worked earnestly as a Sith Overseer, being a main component to bringing the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and its teachers into shape as it had been suffering with inconsistent trainings being hosted. He began to make a name for himself as he quickly became the most active and reliable Overseer that people could depend on for trainings and trials. His progression through the ranks stagnated on Overseer. While people he trained went on to become Lords and even Darths, Trofyz remained an Overseer for a considerable amount of time but he still remained active and a role model within the community for people to look up to.\n\nEventually, Trofyz was given the rank of Sith Lord which he had put in so much effort for on the 19th of May, to which many celebrated for him as they recognised how much work he had put into the Sith Order. He had also become the assistant Headmaster of the Sith Academy and managed in the affairs that required his expertise. It should be noted that before his promotion, the Dark Council reformed Spheres to only hold 3 Inner Circle seats and that Lords would now be a veteran of a specialisation rather than a separate sphere-specific rank. Trofyz chose to be a Sith Praefect Lord due to the fact he hadn’t been an Advanced Sith Knight before becoming Overseer. Because of the Sphere reforms, the Inner Circle seats of the sphere of Sith Philosophy were vacant and waiting to be occupied by capable leadership, which Trofyz was overqualified for. Exactly a month after he had become a Sith Lord, Trofyz ascended to the rank of Darth and gave himself the name of Darth Heisen, a reference to the avatar he usually wears being a cosplay of Walter White from Breaking Bad, who worked under the alias of Heisenberg.\n\nTrofyz lead the Sith Praefects into an age of activity and improvement as he continued to be respected by many in the Sith Order, either hanging out on Dathomir and conversing with other Sith or raiding Ossus. Trofyz was loved by most, if not all the Sith and even Jedi that knew him as a friendly and casual guy. He continued to be an active and esteemed member of the Sith Order for a few months until he retired on the 5th of September. He showed loyalty, commitment, and bravery to the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and the entire Order. He was succeeded by itsthebaker43, also known as Darth Mortiferum who lost his rank in a kaggath by forfeit.

The Dark Honour Guardsmen stood solemnly at each corner and each entrance, it was a time of merit and honour. Members of each Sphere were given accolades for their efforts and contributions, some recognised for their combat prowess, others for their involvement in events. But that time had passed. Now, lines of Sith stood shoulder to shoulder, in anxiety, in anticipation, and in excitement. There would be new Sith Lords announced, new leaders of the Order who would lead it into greatness and victory, who would bring the enemies of the Sith to their knees and execute them as was their right. Among the crowd, members of Ancient Knowledge gathered. Few in numbers, yet united, all the same, one of them was pessimistic about the ceremony. He had already been denied the recognition of an accolade yet again, his chances slim and hopes draining. He was Overseer ShokuMatsu, a Curator of Ancient Knowledge and someone recognised throughout the Sphere as active and the assistant of Darth Invictus. But, Darth Invictus was no longer present throughout the ranks of the Sith; having vanished in what he called a pursuit of artefacts and undiscovered secrets, he was essentially a dead man.\n\nShoku stood among those familiar and unfamiliar, people he personally knighted and people he had shared just a few words with. As Darth Validus sat on the throne, peering down on the masses with his single eye, the members of the Dark Council stood in front of the throne, all exuding their power. The eight most powerful Sith in the galaxy were all gathered. The Dark Lord cleared his throat and began to speak, every Sith went silent in both fear, reverence, and respect.\n\n“It is now time for the promotion of members to be announced. I believe Darth Nödt should be the first to share the news.”\n\nDarth Validus peered down at the hooded Dark Councilor, his arms crossed and his stare over the lines of people intent. His eyes met Shoku’s, once a new Curator taken under Darth Invictus’ now an experienced member of the Sith who others confided in for guidance. A true successor for the lost Keeper of Records. Darth Nödt spoke loudly and clearly for all to hear, to listen in on who would be promoted in Ancient Knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n“It is indeed an honour and a pleasure for me to announce not a new Lord, but a new Darth of Ancient Knowledge. He has shown resilience, he has taken initiative, and he has proven himself to be a worthy replacement for his predecessor. ShokuMatsu, I hereby grant you the title of Darth and name you Darth Gallius. Go forth and preserve the secrets of the Sith, destroy our enemies, and bring glory to the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge as the new Keeper of Records.”\n\nSilence still filled the room for a few seconds, until thunderous cheering and applause was made in honour of the new Darth.

Former Overlord for the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, and now, once again, the revered Overlord of the Sphere of SIth Philosophy, returning to his original roots. A revered Sith and a diligent Dark Councillor, Zinwrath is well-known and respected amongst the Order due to his vast contributions to multiple spheres, and is most certainly a fearsome foe to cross paths with, those who meet his wrath do not live to tell the tale.# Section 1\nPrior to Darth Zinwrath’s ascension, Zinwrath progressed through the ranks like any other Sith, however he was the first attendee of the first Right of Passage hosted within the Sith Order, marking a monumental occasion. Zinwrath continues to diligently serve the Sith Order to this day, almost three years after his original initiation into the Sith Order.\n\nZinwrath had intended from when he was initiated into the Sith Order, that he would alter the Sphere of Sith Philosophy for the better, and make significant changes to the sphere itself, due to his love for teaching. This passion within Zinwrath arguably fueled the spark that would allow him to eventually go on to become the Overlord of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy in due time. His contributions thus far had not gone unnoticed by nor the Dark Council or the Inner Circle of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy, as after reaching the rank of Sith Knight, the Inner Circle agreed to promote him to Sith Inquisitor for his valiant efforts. However, there was more to this than Zinwrath first initially thought. \n\nEventually, it would come to pass that Zinwrath would be promoted to Sith Lord by the Inner Circle for his valiant and colossal efforts in reshaping and assisting in leading the Sphere of Sith Philosophy, which marked a monumental occasion for both the Order and Zinwrath himself, as few, including himself, were yet to witness just how monumental Zinwrath’s impact in leadership would ultimately be on the Sith Order. Not only was he granted the rank of Lord, but also a leadership accolade as recognition for his capabilities in the area. \n\nSome time had passed within the sphere, and Zinwrath continued to do his duties diligently, to which he was then granted the ascension to Darth by the Dark Council for his notable contributions thus far. The Dark Council had taken note of his contributions, to the extent where Zinwrath was approached by the Dark Lord Valius, and was invited to take a seat upon the Dark Council as the new Overlord of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy. The Sith Order gathered that fateful day in anticipation of the newest member, and they were not disappointed. Darth Zinwrath continues to serve with rigorous dedication to this day. \n\nDarth Zinwrath once again became the revered Overlord of Sith Philosophy after being re-shifted back to the Sphere of Sith Philosophy after serving as the Overlord of Ancient Knowledge for an extended period of time. Cheers ensued upon his re-arrival once more as the leader of the sphere which he had progressed in so long ago. Zinwrath had returned to his home, where he belonged.\n\n# Additional Information\nZinwrath has made many notable contributions toward the Sith Order, which will go down in history and will never be forgotten, such as the opening of the Sith Academy, and winning the Wrath of the Dark Lord tournament. His many contributions and expertise in the leadership area prompted the valiant Darth to return to the Sphere of Sith Philosophy once more, however this time as the new Overlord, personally invited by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Validus. \n\nHis Lordship, Darth Zinwrath, had also spent an abundance of time creating detailed article entries for the Sith Archives under the Sphere of Sith Philosophy, as the Chief Archivist, enriching the archives for the future generations of Sith, whilst simultaneously taking initiative over the oversight of the sphere, as the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge was shut down at the time and merged into Philosophy, However, the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge had no Overlord when it was re-established, which prompted the Dark Council to shift his area of focus to the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, becoming the Overlord until he was prompted to return to Sith Philosophy.\n\n","meta":{"index":32,"author":"PoH_v1","name":"The Tale of Darth Zinwrath","release_year":2023}},"Darth Invictus":{"content":"# Introduction:\nDarth Invictus, also known as kophhii and now LuciferTemenos, is a Darth and Inner Circle member for the sphere of Ancient Knowledge, acting as our Keeper of Records.

Lucifer is a leader to almost everyone in Ancient Knowledge, and will always be a beloved and remembered figure.# Biography:\nLucifer and his friends originally joined TSO as a joke, though he found himself enjoying it much more than he originally considered. He would go on to be the only member out of his friends to move forward in the Order. After achieving Adept, he would be taken under the wing of thekingdog19, who is no longer a part of the Order. Invictus’s Knight Trial was hosted by Trofyz, also known as Darth Heisen, and after achieving Knight, he would quickly surpass his master and become a Sentry in the Sphere of Defense and Security. Unfortunately, with the disbanding of D&S, Lucifer would leave the Sith Order as a whole and begin a new path with the Jedi. This would be short-lived after he achieved Padawan, as he quickly grew bored and reverted back to the Sith. With his return, he would be taken in by Darth Audex (Renjaal), and he would grow extremely active in the Sphere of Sith Philosophy (SoP), where he would quickly rise to Overseer after achieving the rank of Sith Harbinger. As an Overseer, Lucifer would go on to host many KTs, even some for notable figures like Darth Mortiferum (itsthebaker43). Due to his leadership and effort, he would end up achieving Assistant Headmaster.

Darth Naile, AKA VenificiousTemenos, thanks him graciously for motivating him constantly and pushing him to reach for higher goals. EscanorTemenos regards him as a great friend and a hard worker, and I myself consider him an amazing leader and friend.

He was an Inner Circle member of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and served the Sphere for months, dedicating every bit of free time to the Sphere. He started his journey off as every Sith, a Hopeful during October 2021. He found himself joining the Dark Honor Guards and he worked his way through the rank of the Guards. Carmesi was well-known within the Order because he served the Guards for three months until becoming Captain of the Dark Honor Guards. Carmesi was a part of the first generation of Dark Honor Guards and, although it took him a while to ascend to Captain, he still contributed a lot during his time there. Carmesi invented the Initiate Trials and  hosted a lot of events for the Guards. as per usual Carmesi was extremely dedicated and active within the Sith order. Unfortunately, Carmesi only served as the Captain for a week before getting exiled from the Order. Carmesi went to the Jedi Order for around two months before returning to the Sith Order.# The Return:\nAfter spending two months in the Jedi Order, Carmesi knew it was time for him to return. He came back to the Sith Order and started from scratch. Carmesi had to start from the bottom of the ranking system and worked his way back up. After completing the required trainings again, Carmesi served as the apprentice of the famous Escanor, who is now known as Commander Arcanum of the Dark Honor Guard. As the apprentice of Escanor, Carmesi found himself joining the combative Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy (E&D). He wasn’t in E&D for as long as he was in the Dark Honor Guards and the main reason he joined was because of the connections he had within the Sphere. He served E&D for a period of one month and a week until requesting a demotion to Adept. He remained Sphere-less for a little while until he joined his last Sphere, the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge. As an Adept, Carmesi joined the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and got highly respected within the community.

Carmesi served as a Sith Knight in the Sphere for quite some time, sadly there was one thing Carmesi lacked: a good apprentice. Every apprentice Carmesi had failed him and to become an Advanced Sith Knight, Carmesi had to request a waiver so he didn’t have to spend another several months looking for an apprentice. Luckily, the waiver was approved by the Dark Council and Carmesi would become a Sith Inquisitor and Sith Curator. As a Sith Curator, Carmesi worked side by side with ShokuMatsu and together they marked and made some of the best articles in the Sphere. In fact because of their contributions to the Sphere they were both granted the rank of Sith Lord. Both of them served as fantastic Lords and made the Curator assembly even better than before. The Dark Council started to learn of Carmesi’s abilities and were quick to promote him to Darth. As a Darth, Carmesi served the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge as an Inner Circle member and Curator Overseer. This meant that he oversaw all of the Curator’s work and he eventually made his own Holocron to teach new Curators to become the best. Not long after serving as Curator Overseer, Carmesi requested to switch positions with Darth Invictus, allowing Carmesi to become Keeper of Records. Invictus approved the switch and Carmesi served as the new Keeper of Records, his dream job. He served the Sphere for a long time and eventually earned the Dark Knowledge and Activity Accolades. After serving as Inner Circle for a while, Carmesi decided it was time to step down from his position and became a Sith Elder. Carmesi’s Holocron is still used by Sith Curators to this day and his service to the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and the Dark Honor Guards was to the best of his abilities, he will always be remembered.\n\n","meta":{"index":29,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Darth Carmesi","release_year":2022}},"Darth Gladius":{"content":"# Introduction\nDarth Gladius is the ex-Supreme Executioner and Inner Circle member of L&J.

Nurrix finished his training as quickly as he could and then joined the Sphere of Mysteries followed by the Dark Honor Guards. Upon joining the Sith Order, Nurrix already knew that he’d find himself serving the Dark Honor Guards so he ascended to Adept as fast as he could and he became an apprentice to PaulTLincoln. Paul taught Nurrix everything he could and he learned a lot, then he joined the Dark Honor Guards for two weeks and found himself joining the Sphere of Mysteries when the Kaggath between Caeser and Kennaex occurred. He was handpicked by the Overlord of the Sphere of Mysteries to become the Chief of the Sphere’s academy. He dedicated time to the Sphere of Mysteries and he made the academy for them so that they could teach the new generations their ways. He served the Sphere of Mysteries for three weeks then returned to the Guards. Nurrix served as Lieutenant of the Guards and during this time he was most notably known for hosting the majority of the tryouts. Unfortunately, some of Nurrix’s fellow officers were busy so Nurrix decided to host most of the tryouts for them. He also hosted a few trainings so that the new Guards could excel in combat even more. Nurrix served the Guards for about half a year and the majority of that time he spent devoting himself to bettering the division. He was very respected among the Guards but he eventually decided it was time to retire. He retired from the Guards and was given the rank of Sith Knight, however, because he was a HICOM member within the Guards he was promoted to Sith Warrior a few hours later.# Journey to Darth:\nOnce Captain TaitusTemenos moved to the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, Darth Nurrix approached the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Validus about the aftermath of the Captain leaving. This resulted in Darth Nurrix asking Darth Validus about the newly restarted Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, which he recommended to him. Nurrix listened to Validus’ advice and joined the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge. He joined the Sphere as a Loremaster and wrote a lot of articles for them. Nurrix was never a fan of training apprentices, but he did have one apprentice who he successfully trained to the rank of Sith Knight during this time, this apprentice was none other than ValenTemenos, later known as Darth Carmesi, who also became an Ancient Knowledge Inner Circle member and Darth. Nurrix spent most of his time now helping his Sphere grow stronger. He did a lot for the Sphere, but his most notable acts were that he made the entire Ancient Knowledge itinerary, which is what they used as inspiration for article choices, he also assisted with making all the documents and was the caretaker of these documents and the Sith Order’s archive notion page. Nurrix became a Sith Lord during his time in the order and not long after he became an Inner Circle member of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and Darth of the Sith Order. He scrapped the old itinerary for the Sphere and replaced it with a new system and he made sure everything on the Notion page was up to date. Nurrix, after the departure of Ancient Knowledge’s Overlord, Darth Lividus, left the Sphere and the Sith Order as a whole.\n\n","meta":{"index":15,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Darth Nurrix","release_year":2022}},"Darth Bellicus":{"content":"# Overview\nDarth Bellicus, also known as CaesarTemenos, currently serves as the Sith Loremaster Overseer within the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge. Formerly, he was the Hand of the Dark Lord, Grand Sorcerer within Expansion and Diplomacy, Overlord of the Sphere of Defense and Security, and Sergeant of the Dark Honor Guard. Caesar is mainly known for his achievement against Darth Kennaex in the Kaggath that happened on February 27,  2022, where he defeated KennaexMalvern and ascended to the rank of Hand of the Dark Lord.# History\nBefore turning to the Dark Side, FerrumCaesar was the Padawan of Jedi Knight TaitusMydrek during April. Caesar’s padawanship didn’t last long, as his quick understanding of the philosophy of the Light Side of the Force granted him the rank of Jedi Knight in the same month. A few days after being ascended to Knight of the Jedi Order, FerrumCaesar attended a tryout to join the Temple Guard division. The skill he showcased in the tryout got him the entry to join the Temple Guard commanded by joelbloxx, however, his time in the Temple Guard didn’t last long, as he was kicked from it in June because of his ‘inactivity’. From this event on, FerrumCaesar went through a large period of inactivity until in October 2021, his former Jedi master, TaitusMydrek, offered Caesar to learn the ways of the Dark Side along him. As expected, Caesar accepted, and was given the rank of Sith Lord.\n\nAfter joining the Sith Order ruled by Dark Lord of the Sith, Fedlz, and Wrath of the Dark Lord, KentuckySquid, the now Sith Lord FerrumCaesar was in charge of leading attacks against the Jedi Temple on Ossus alongside Sith Lord TaitusMydrek. Although he always managed to be successful in his raids, his efforts were not seen by the Overlord of his sphere, VexillumUsh. Caesar, thinking he was not being appreciated for his job, considered leaving the order, but was stopped and convinced not to by his comrade, TaitusMydrek. This decision taken by FerrumCaesar was the one that made him keep going and work hard to achieve higher goals. A long time after this event, on January 1st, 2022, Caesar ascended to Grand Sorcerer, thus achieving the rank of Darth and being named Darth Bellicus. Seven days after the demotion of reyrosky on January 1st from the Dark Council spot as the Overlord of the Sphere of Defense and Security, Darth Bellicus was granted reyrosky’s spot and took over the Dark Council seat to serve as the Overlord of the Sphere of Defense and Security.\n\nFrom this moment on, a new journey for Darth Bellicus started as the Overlord of one of the most loved spheres of all time. His job was tedious, but he knew the Sphere would eventually flourish. After forming the Sphere and getting new members, it was time to start ascending people to leadership positions. The first batch of Sith Lord+ within was made up of only two members of the sphere: Purposei and ChampaaiTemenos. Purposei (Darth Xenion) was the Chief of Defense within Defense & Security, while ChampaaiTemenos (Darth Hyvar) was the Overseer of Sith Shamans. The second batch of Lords and above was formed by: Sith Lord Levithegamer92, Sith Lord KingOfDeaths0, and Sith Lord brolion1. Not much was known of Darth Bellicus during his time in Defense & Security other than him supporting his own sphere, but he was working in the shadows, thinking and planning something else; a Kaggath. \nDarth Bellicus had gathered all the Advanced Sith Knights and above into something that many called a crazy plan. Bellicus knew what he was doing, and informed all his trusted peers about the Kaggath he had in mind against Darth Kennaex, the current Hand of the Dark Lord. He announced the Kaggath on February 20, 2022, and contained in his Powerbase werepeople like Darth Hyvar, Darth Xenion, KingOfDeaths0, etc. On the other hand, Darth Kennaex had on his side the Dark Honor Guard and Darth Havok.\nThe Kaggath took place in the Sith Enclave, specifically on February 27, 2022. Everyone who rallied in the Kaggath pit was in that place either to see the rise of Darth Bellicus or his fall. Most of the Sith present in the Kaggath were united to see the triumph of Caesar and the fall of KennaexMalvern, though those who didn’t were aware of the fate of Darth Kennaex. When Bellicus and Kennaex’s forces arrived, the rite of the Kaggath started. On the first set of the Kaggath, Caesar dominated KennaexMalvern by beating him 2-0 in the 1v1 section, and 3-0 in the powerbase against powerbase section. The Kaggath ended in the Battle of Wits, where CaesarTemenos eliminated KennaexMalvern by beating him 3-0 in the Sith Order-related questions. After this Kaggath was finished, KennaexMalvern retired from the Sith Order as a Sith Wraith, while CaesarTemenos ascended to Hand of the Dark Lord. \n\nNot much was known about Darth Bellicus during his time as the overseer of the Dark Honor Guard, but he was more than an overseer in the eyes of his teammates; someone who wanted everyone to have a good time instead of always doing the same. Sadly, after four months of work as Hand of the Dark Lord, CaesarTemenos retired from the Sith Order as a Sith Wraith. What we thought would be a permanent retirement to focus on other things didn’t happen, as CaesarTemenos came back from his retirement on August 10, 2022. Caesar unretired as a Sith Lord and joined the Dark Honor Guard as a Sergeant. \nAround two weeks after serving as a Sergeant within the Guard, CaesarTemenos decided to discharge from the Dark Honor Guard and serve as the Sith Loremaster Overseer within Ancient Knowledge, thus being granted the rank of Darth once again. After his ascension to Darth, a new chapter starts in Darth Bellicus’ life; a journey of knowledge.\n\n","meta":{"index":1,"author":"ValenTemenos","name":"Darth Bellicus","release_year":2022}},"Darth Naile":{"content":"# The Jedi Order:\nDarth Naile, also known as VenificusTemenos or Rav, began his journey long ago in another Sith Order outside of this one. On his journey, he discovered a peculiar group of hostilities infiltrating the homeworld of this Order. The sheer skill of this team led Rav to seek out this team, which he would soon learn was the Jedi Assault team of TiberiusMalverns TJO. Rav quickly swept through the youngling ranks of TJO with one goal in mind, which was to join the Jedi Assault team. Rav was brought under a close friend's wing as a Padawan, and Rav quickly fell in love with The Jedi Order, between the beautiful Sanctum map and the excellent R5 saber mechanics, he quickly became an active part of the Order. Rav was unable to join the JAT as a Padawan due to being focused on becoming a Knight and having no time. His trials were hosted by none other than Darth Havok (OmegaVanquished), during the time he was a Jedi Master. After achieving Knight, he became focused on joining the JAT, which would be harder for him than you would expect. After finally getting a tryout, he had to leave halfway through due to an exam, where he then had to answer multiple questions in DM’s. Though, he did end up making it.\n\nRavs first of many advanced Knight specializations fell under the Jedi Paladins, where he quickly grew bored due to an endless cycle of fighting, fighting, and fighting. Master SanctusTenebris saw Ravs lack of motivation, and decided to take advantage of it. He quickly recruited Rav into the Lightsaber Instructor team, where Rav would once again lose motivation due to a lack of participation from Skaxon after the retirement of Sanctus. Rav was promoted to Instructor after voicing his complaints, though he soon hit another roadblock after Skaxons ascension to High Council brought more poor leadership to the LI’s.\n\nDue to the time and effort Rav had put forward into TJO, he did not wish to leave, so he once again switched specs and became a Jedi Peacekeeper. Unfortunately, Peacekeepers became a Temple Security Force rank, leaving them to be replaced by Jedi Praecepters. These were a group of Jedi that focused primarily on Leadership classes in the Jedi Service Corps. Rav was granted the opportunity to teach many prominent members as a Praecepter, some of which include Nov_Kalazar, ValiantPrice, ValiosNix, and other modern-day members.\n\nRavs leadership and competency showed. On October 3rd, 2021, Rav was invited into a VC by Skaxon, where he was offered the position of Head Watchmen, where he would be tasked with reviving the specialization left in ruins by the incompetent ShadowNevix. Rav jumped at the opportunity, and Rav would end up making many huge changes for the Watchmen that eventually led to its revival. It was Ravs idea to split the Watchmen into Two: Watchmen Trialers and Archivists. Trialers prioritized hosting Mock Knight Trials on the I2's, while the Archivists focused on a big spreadsheet dedicated to track all I2 and Instructor activity. This led to a flow of steady and active Watchmen.\n\nAs expected, Ravs amazing leadership abilities paid off. On the 29th of November, 2021, Rav was brought into a VC by the Master of the Order, WolfSupport, where he was then offered a position on the High Council due to his excellent work with the Watchmen. As a High Councillor, Rav oversaw the entirety of the Council of Reassignment. \n\nWhile many saw Rav as a great leader, he was unfortunately exiled on April 9, 2022, after rumors of a toxic workplace arised. This broke Ravs heart, he was extremely sad to be brought down from the position he worked so hard in for months, but luckily was convinced by some friends like BladedTemenos and Kelub_Zero to begin a new journey in TSO.# The Sith Order:\nDue to words of encouragement from his friends, Rav decided to start a new path in The Sith Order. Rav wanted to prove that he could still be a good person and leader, and he never had any malicious intent. Upon entering the Order, he was greeted with pure love, even from those who had shown disdain in the past. This was the opposite of what Rav expected, though he was pleasantly surprised. Ravs journey from an Acolyte to Knight is mainly irrelevant as he just focused on progressing in the Order rather than making an image at the time.\n\nRav has spent the entirety of his TSO journey in the Sphere of Laws and Justice, joining as soon as he achieved Apprenticeship from AdhesiveMaple. Ravs goal in L&J was to prevent others from having the same downfall as him. Pretty much as soon as he could, he took his ASK trials with the current Interrogator Overseer, Kelub_Zero. Rav has made a huge mark within Interrogators, working on multiple cases while also juggling consistent law seminars, and Interrogators at the time could vouch that he was doing an amazing job.\n\nRavs activity also expanded into Order of the Loremaster, where he would recieve the Dark Knowledge accolade due to some excellent pieces written by him. Some examples include First Jedi Purge, Ritual of Nathema, and the Dread Wars. Inevitably, some members of the Order were unhappy with Ravs appearance and planned to handicap him on his way up. This only motivated Rav further, and with the retirement of the Interrogator Overseer, Rav took the opportunity to assist the Overlord in any way possible. This would lead to Ravs eventual ascension to Sith Lord on July 10, next to UnholyPurpose and ShokuMatsu.\n\nAfter months of hard work, Ravs dedication to the Interrogators finally paid off. On August 14, 2022, Rav was crowned Interrogator Overseer and took the title of Darth Naile. He immediately began updating Interrogator documents, assisting with Interrogator needs, and creating scripts to assist with their duties. Nailes excellent leadership and activity showed, and every Interrogator loves him and appreciates him for all he has done. At this point, Naile had obviously proven that he had changed, and this paid off when he was brought into a VC and announced the newest L&J Overlord. Naile has certainly proven his ability, and he is now a community favorite.\n\n# Community Words:\nRav is a person many look up to, below are some of his closest friends, and those who helped him get to where he is today.\n\n\nLuciferTemenos- Rav is an inspirational individual, he has overcome many adversaries in his time in TKG as a whole and for that i respect him greatly. Not just as a member of the order but as a great friend.\n\nEscanorTemenos - Rav's a chill lad, he's been my friend for a few years now, honestly hes just a nice lad, he does his work and is straight up professional when it comes to it, he likes to also have fun but that's when the time is right.\n\nGiannaVanquished - Rav as a friend has always been insanely supportive, it’s something both he has in common with his friends as his leadership, he’s constantly understanding. he has been amazing to have as both as a friend and as a superior as I have immensely enjoyed working under him and with him as we have both grown throughout the order. I have nothing but good things to say about him as he constantly strives to better himself and to be a better friend to all and it is truly comforting and an amazing friend that I have had the honor to work with\n\n","meta":{"index":6,"author":"ShokuMatsu","name":"Darth Naile","release_year":2022}},"Darth Asmodeus":{"content":"# Biography:\nDisk’s journey began in TSO on July 9, 2022, and has stayed there ever since.

She completed all of her training and she quickly ascended to the rank of Adept, within three days. As an Adept, she quickly became an Apprentice as well. She was on a good path so far, ascending really quickly. As an Apprentice she served her Master, who was Sith Warrior AdhesiveMaple, to the best of her abilities and she finished her Knight Trials within four days on her first attempt. However, after becoming a Sith Knight, Penumbra decided to remain there for a while. She joined the L&J a little while earlier and she would remain there for the rest of her time within the Order.# Dedication to Laws and Justice:\nOnce she became Sith Knight, Penumbra dedicated a lot of her time to the Sphere of Law & Justice. She desired to become an Inquisitor but remained a Sith Knight for a while longer. After waiting a long time, Penumbra decided it was time to ascend to Inquisitor. She served as an Inquisitor for less than a month before getting promoted to Sith Lord. As a Sith Lord, Penumbra continued to dedicate her time to her Sphere and would achieve the rank of Darth not long after. When she got Lord, she was also given the title of Chief Interrogator due to her knowledge in the area. She was Lord for about a month and one week and then she ascended to Darth. She was later given the rank of Keeper of Records a month after receiving Darth. All in all, she was rapidly ascending and spending a lot of time serving L&J. During her time in L&J she made some great contributions, she assisted in stabilizing the Warden implementation within L&J. Before, Wardens used to be Enforcers and had different duties but that changed with the help of Penumbra. Not only this, but Penumbra also is the reason why Interrogators get the right to prosecute, it used to just be Ravagers. Penumbra achieved the rank of Dark Councillor not long after getting the Keeper of Records. As Dark Councillor, Penumbra hosted a lot of L&J events like Lord of the Drip.

But right before trying out for the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy, Avalan decided it wasn’t the right Sphere for him and because he was so intrigued by the Dark Honor guard he decided it was best that he joined them to serve and protect the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Validus. Starting as an Initiate of the Guards, Avalan decided he wanted to become a fully trained Guardsman and he wanted to become the best combative version of himself. On the 29th of May, he achieved his goal of becoming a Guardsman and aimed to complete his new one, becoming a Corporal and improving his combat skills. After a month of training and proving himself he became worthy of the rank of Corporal. Over time, Avalan became a Sergeant of the Dark Honor Guards and proved that he was very active by doing his duties on Dathomir every day. As a Sergeant Avalan was considered an Officer of the Guards and was able to host events, which he did very often so he could make sure that the Guards were running efficiently and were doing their proper duties. Soon Avalan was promoted to Lieutenant of the Guards and strived to do his best and continue hosting as much as he could. During his time as a Guard, he defended many important events within the Order, such as Kaggaths.

One of the most common forms for this unique blade was Makashi which was used due to its very precise hits, allowing the Quillons to make the most out of their placement of the lightsaber.# History\nThere were very few known users of the crossguard lightsaber, but all were very well known across the galaxy. First, there were the many Jedi that fought using this lightsaber at the Great Scourge of Malachor. There was a powerful Sith who used the blade, this Sith Lord was known as Darth Atrius, however, he used a very dark use of the blade, fusing it with the Dark Side and making the wielder of Darth Atris’ Blade have a surreal amount of anger that they cannot control unless they let go of the blade. Atrius’ crossguard was later destroyed by Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader during the Imperial War. There was also a very uncommon crossguard saber, found by Ezra Bridger; unfortunately, the green crossguard was broken as soon as Ezra ignited the blade. The most commonly known user of the Crossguard Lightsaber, Kylo Ren, a very powerful user of the Sith, and user of the unstable Crossguard Lightsaber that he used in the many battles he would face. Kylo Ren would have an unstable blade since he equipped the saber with a cracked kyber crystal, which made the blade very unstable and hard to use. Through the Dark Side, Kylo Ren possessed no trouble with the crossguard lightsaber and later used it to strike down his father, Han Solo. Eventually, through grief, he would see his father in a vision, resulting in him betraying the Order, and turning back to the light.\n\n","meta":{"index":36,"author":"Redjaal","name":"Crossguard Lightsaber","release_year":2022}},"Zann Defiler Tactics":{"content":"# Overview\nDespite having a well-equipped and structured military, the Zann Consortium's Defilers favored guerilla warfare tactics and criminal activities to achieve power.

She employed it during her attack on a native village situated in Genbara.# Description\nA lightsaber variant that consisted of the utilization of an auxiliary to modify it´s capacities. When attached to the saber’s hilt, the kyber crystal’s energy was channeled outward into several blades, forming a parasol. The auxiliary itself was composed of two parts: A central pole and several radiating ribs that opened upwards in resemblance to a parasol.

Vibroblades resembled short swords, albeit with a high-tech design and feel. It functioned the same way as any other vibroweapon: inside of the weapon’s hilt or handle there was a compact ultrasonic vibration generator, which made the blade vibrate at extreme speeds, turning even the smallest injuries into large wounds. Vibroblades conducted electricity, which would run through the length of the blade, and connect with the energy cell, causing a small explosion that could even take off somebody’s hand. At first it used to be fitted with cortosis-weave so that the wielder may be able to block and parry lightsaber blows, but as time went on this method was left forgotten, and the cortosis mineral itself became exceedingly rare. A newer, highly adaptable variant of the vibroblade was then produced, called the prototype vibroblade, which could be fitted with many more weapon enhancements than the basic vibroblades.# History\nVibroblades were popularly used by soldiers, mercenaries, assassins and pirates throughout the entire galaxy, along with other criminals and bounty hunters. The criminal allegations made these weapons banned on multiple worlds. Vibroblades were common around the Jedi Civil War era, because with the rapid increase of personal energy shields, blasters became less and less viable. However, vibroweapons could easily cut through energy shields. Vibroblades were carried by Mandalorian Neo-Crusader Shock Troopers, as well as Republic Military officers. During the Clone Wars, clone assassins used them as main weapons, and Imperial Dungeoneers as backup weapons. They were also sometimes used by high ranking imperial officers such as inquisitor Jerec. Even though vibroblades were banned almost everywhere in the galaxy, they were still being produced and used in less civilized worlds such as Tatooine.\n\n","meta":{"index":33,"author":"SpawnKiller1326","name":"Vibroblade","release_year":2022}},"Mandalorian Armor":{"content":"# Description\nThe Mandalorian is more than a race, it is a culture, a warrior culture, and along with it comes years of war, battles, honour, glory.

The Force has given us tools to defeat our enemies. During combat, the Dark Side crawls beneath our skin and electrifies the air surrounding us. If a Sith fails to channel it during these moments, they are unworthy of the Sith title. There are three schools, or focuses, of Force combat that channel the Dark Side: Offense, Body and Mind.# The first School: Offense\nOffense encompasses the Force skills with immediate, dynamic applications for lightsaber combat. All require relatively little exertion, so they can be easily applied at any moment. Think of Offense as a dagger saved in reserve for a fatal thrust. The skills of Offense include:\n\nForce Push: A kinetic wave that emerges from your hands or head and can knock a single enemy off balance or scatter a group in all directions\n\nForce Choke: A telekinetic grip, which when centered on an enemy’s neck can pinch off airflow and snap vertebrae. This requires more concentration than the Push, as well as a free hand to form the control fist. The neck is an easy target for its soft vulnerability, but strong users of theCoke can crush an entire body, including armor.\n\n\n\nForce Inertia: An amplification of your body’s momentum that uses the Force to redirect what looks like a lumbering charge into a hooking lunge. This can surprise an enemy by making your moves unpredictable.\n\nForce Blind: A burst of Force energy that can overwhelm an enemy’s optic nerves and render them momentarily blind.\n\nForce Throw: A force tactic in which you can control the path of your lightsaber when thrown. You can send it pinwheeling through clusters of ambushers before returning it to your grip. With refinement, the tactic can be used to aim and accelerate any thrown object, such as a stone or a thermal detonator.\n\n# The second School: Body\nThe second School, or focus, Body, encompasses those abilities that draw from the living Force. They emanate from your own cells and affect the physical structures of others. For this reason, any cyborg limb or enhancement will hinder your ability to conjure the effects of Body. This is not your failing, it is a law of the Living Force. The demands of the Dark Side can ravage the flesh, but fortunately it is possible to balance the scales by siphoning life from another bolster your own.\n\nForce Lightning: A weapon that calls forth electrical bolts from your fingertips. It is an embodiment of your wrath that can strike at the heart of your enemy. The lightning crawls across the skin and sends surges of pain through internal organs. Sustained exposure will roast flesh, calcify the skeleton and stop the heart.\n\nForce Convection: A concentration of Force energy that can make your fists hot to the touch, even raise their temperature to a burning intensity, but will cause no lasting injury to you. Striking an enemy with these fists can raise blisters and set robes aflame. \n\nForce Cryokinesis: A siphoning of essence that leaches the life intensity from another, leaving behind a frost shrouded corpse. Though this tactic usually causes the heat vitality of another being to hemorrhage, it is not possible to channel that vitality for your own use.\n\nDrain Life: A delicate procedure that saps the life energy of another and funnels it directly into your own essence. It is extremely difficult to employ in combat and is derived from the teachings of Zelashiel the Blasphemer in the Holocron of Darth Revan.\n\nDeath Field: An unstoppable concentration of Dark Side energy projected from your physical animus in the shape of a sphere. Any living being entering the field will wither into a dry husk. It is sustained by your will, but it will try to consume you as well.\n\n# The third School: Mind\nThe third School, or focus, Mind, encompasses those abilities that draw from the unifying Force. These operate on a different plane than the physical. They exist in the realm of thought and memory. The disciplines of mind require intense concentration and are mentally taxing. Physical strength will not help you here, only psychic clarity.\n\nMind Shard: A silver of psychic pain that is hurled from your own consciousness into your enemy’s brain. If your attack succeeds, the intense agony will leave your opponent vulnerable to a lightsaber lunge. It can be difficult to establish a mental lock, but your success will improve if the ability is used in conjunction with the verbal taunts of dun moch (a form of combat which uses distraction and doubt).\n\nMemory Walk: A link that can open your enemy’s mind and make it possible for you to compel them to relive tragic or humiliating recollections and bring forth layers of shame. Used for sustained periods, memory walk can be a sophisticated method of interrogation. The technique was stolen from the Guild of Vindicators, whose denizens are zealous about uncovering the sins of others.\n\nHatred: A method of focusing your inner fire so that it can be stoked with outrage, disgust and fear until it burns with white hot intensity. When smashed, this furnace will radiate hatred form you in palpable waves that can send another’s mind into catatonia.\n\nHorror: A simple mental manipulation that can raise fear in the mind of another. By amplifying this primal emotion you can trigger horror and eventually insanity. An afflicted target will be too haunted to raise any defense.\n\nForce Crucitorn: A technique that makes it possible to detach one’s mind from coarse sensations. The secret to overcoming physical pain lies in the nonphysical. A master of this technique can endure any torture and withsand any injury.\n\n","meta":{"index":49,"author":"jaketstone34","name":"Dark Side Combat","release_year":2023}},"Traditional Lightsaber Combat Forms":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe art of lightsaber combat did not only involve basic movements of one’s lightsaber in hopes that it would land a hit on their enemy. It is for this reason that a multitude of lightsaber combat forms was developed to combat against specific enemies or adversaries depending on the situation present at hand. There existed a total of seven combat forms, some of which had variations within yet still adopted the same principles of technique specific to the respective combat form.# Form I: Shii-Cho\nShii-Cho, otherwise known as The Way of the Sarlacc and The Determination Form was the first and most basic out of the seven lightsaber forms. Being the first style of lightsaber technique, Shii-Cho consisted of rather basic movement and strikes. This ancient form established the foundation for the basic concepts of attack, defense, and target body zones which is what the first form revolved around.\n\n\n\nGiven its ancient nature, the first form was developed as a result of the evolution from metal swords to revolutionary lightsaber development. The first lightsabers relied on many other pieces of technology that greatly restricted mobility, rendering them useless in combat and more so for display. With the development of lightsaber technology, freedom to adopt more mobility was increased and allowed lightsabers to be applied in combat leading to the creation of a real beneficial style of combat. Many aspects of technique with metal swords remained, with the addition of newer skill finding its way into the combat form. Its alternative names, “The Way of the Sarlacc” and the “Determination Form” emerged from the simple yet tenacious nature of this lightsaber combat form. Given its basic concept, the development of Shii-Cho did not address lightsaber to lightsaber combat thus deeming it extremely weak against the other forms that would later be developed as a result of the flaws in Shii-Cho due to the emergence of more and more lightsaber to lightsaber battles, one of these newer forms being known as Makashi. Shii-Cho remained a common practice of lightsaber combat for millennia, being adopted generation after generation.\n\n\n\n\nPlenty of the movements entailed execution of horizontal and vertical maneuvering to allow for leeway into simple yet deadly diagonal strikes to target strike zones. The target strike zones were the head, right arm/side, left arm/side, back, left leg, and right leg. Standard principles of Shii-Cho stressed the benefit of obtaining victory without directly causing harm. It was because of this, that the Way of the Sarlacc utilized the sun djem technique, an attack solely meant to destroy an adversaries weapon or disarm them entirely without causing injury or harm in any fashion. Other forms of offense for Shii-Cho consisted of wide sweeping motions useful against many enemies as well as a basic parallel slash.\n\n\nEven in the face of simplicity, the Determination Form was not rendered entirely useless due to its less complicated style, providing a basic set of skills that would be usable for eternity as well as offering an option for starters. Many younglings within the Jedi Order were first taught the principles and style of the first lightsaber combat form so that they may understand the basic concepts of lightsaber techniques. However, it was seen as difficult by many to adopt the technique that the first form stressed since it focused on disarmament rather than harm. It’s because of this that under pressuring circumstances, it was difficult for some to hold back which sometimes resulted in sloppy and wild movements. True masters of this form were able to not only use the first form in standard battle scenarios, but also lightsaber combat. This is shown by many of its notable practitioners like Yoda, Cin Drallig, Meetra Surik, and even Darth Vader. Some of these users incorporated the aspects of Shii-Cho into their style of combat to further advance their strategy on the battlefield and in lightsaber vs lightsaber combat but other forms such as Makashi later succeeded the first form and its faults.\n\n# Form II: Makashi\nMakashi, also recognized for its alternative names, the Way of the Ysalamiri and the Contention Form was the second lightsaber combat form of the 7 that existed. This elegant fighting style was developed to stress lightsaber to lightsaber combat, something that the previous form, Shii-Cho failed to do, continuing to become more prevalent as lightsaber battles prevailed throughout generations. Though similar to Shii-Cho, Makashi later became less useful with the introduction of newer threats such as blasters. Despite its other downfalls, the contention form was still a very deadly form for lightsaber combat during its period of common usage.\n\n\nThe first form and its commonality with standard metal swords are what led to Makashi being developed to make up for the faults that Shii-Cho presented. As lightsaber conflict increased during the time of Dark Jedi and other exiles, Makashi became the prominent form to directly counter the first form. This style of lightsaber combat would excel during its time, but following the Hundred-Year Darkness that nearly wiped out the majority of the Dark Jedi, Makashi became a lot less common given the fact that there weren’t many other adversaries that could engage in lightsaber duels. The events that transpired during the Great Hyperspace Wars and also the end of the Sith Wars also led to a decrease in the usage of this form. With the addition of increasing blaster technology, the Jedi would begin to encounter far more enemies that utilized blasters and as a result, began developing greater methods of countering blaster users which is how the third form: Soresu was created. Makashi would make its return during the New Sith Wars but with the conclusion of the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, practice of the second form vanished once more, and the Jedi in particular halted usage of it. Makashi receives its alternative, “Way of the Ysalamiri” title from the Ysalamiri, a non-sentient creature applauded by the Jedi for its patience–a large aspect of the second form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe practice of Makashi entailed balance and fluency of movement. Practitioners usually tend to avoid the usage of acrobatics of any sort and instead rely on decent footwork and fluency of each attack to ensure proper defense. The neutral stand called for the user to hold the lightsaber in their strong, dominant hand facing down at their side or directly at their enemy. Users also held the hilt with their thumbs facing down to allow leeway for more precise and accurate movement of the blade. The grip on the hilt was tight, enough to keep a decent grip but not so much so that it disrupts the fluency of each movement. Makashi embraced two marks of content; Sun Djem and Shiak. Sun Djem when used in the second form differed from the first form in the sense that the duelist targeted the weapon to destroy it, sometimes even harming the enemy in the process. Shiak was a simple stabbing maneuver that complimented the additional jabs and footwork of Makashi. This lightsaber combat form consisted of two special techniques, the “contentious opportunity” which was focused around waiting for an opening in the enemy before striking, and the “Makashi Riposte”, a maneuver to influence the angle of an adversary’s strike before continuing with a counter-attack.\n\n\nThe second form did not come without any weakness as already implied by its duelist skill sets. Blaster fire was a huge counter to Makashi considering the style was developed to solely go head to head with other lightsaber users. Not only that, the majority of its practitioners struggled against multiple enemies, fairing a lot better against single opponents; however, those who possessed a true mastery of Makashi found ways around disadvantages of multiple enemy engagement such as Count Dooku, a Sith Lord most notable for his usage of Makashi. The most devastating weakness of users who practiced this fluent style of lightsaber combat was their incapability to generate any real strength, specifically kinetic energy through each swing. Those utilizing lightsaber forms that required immense strength or power could easily overpower a Makashi user. Usage of this form continued to decrease with the introduction of grander blaster technology which allowed for the foundation to be set to create a newer and more defensive form known as Form III: Soresu.\n\n# Form III: Soresu\nSoresu, also acknowledged as the Way of the Mynock and the Resilience Form was the third lightsaber combat form approach out of the known seven. The third form emerged during the rise and increasing usage of blaster technology. As the Dark Jedi and other lightsaber users began to vanish from the galaxy, the Jedi felt that there was no longer a need for Makashi to stay in use but instead for a newer form to be devised to combat blaster enemies. Similar to the Mynock, a non-sentient species that the form was named in respect of, Soresu focused on evasion, compacted blade technique, as well as precise dodges to use defense to its fullest potential. The strong defense of Soresu was vital in ensuring survival and outlasting of the enemy so a user may take advantage of the flaws that showcase themselves as a result of their fatigue.\n\n\nThe resilience form was crafted by the Jedi as a result of the trend of blaster technology that began to arise following the disappearance of lightsaber enemies. Due to its extreme defense and ideology of perfect endurance, it is without question why it’s known as the resilience form. Soresu’s other alternative name, the Way of the Mynock, was founded by the Jedi after their encounters with the non-sentient species known as the Mynock which the Jedi commended for their evasive skill and thus named Soresu after this swift creature. The third form was quite useful to the Jedi during their various encounters with blaster-wielding enemies and in time, would become a symbol of Jedi philosophy for its non-aggressive nature. Similar to many of the other forms, Soresu also saw quite a few weaknesses because of its lack of offense. This later was corrected with the creation of other forms such as Form IV: Ataru and Form V: Shien. Despite its ups and downs, usage of Soresu prevailed for thousands of years and especially was not forgotten by the Jedi.\n\n\nAs implied by its alternate titles, Soresu stressed endurance and defense. In relation to Makashi, the third form practiced basic discipline regarding fluency in motion and energy preservation. The opening stance demanded that the user holds the hilt parallel and angled forward with the dominant hand holding the lightsaber back. The strong foot was positioned in the back as well, the other pointing forward. Yet another stance involved similar footwork but instead, the user gripped the hilt with two hands for better regulation of vertical maneuvers. When in the face of single opponents, Soresu duelist utilized the deflecting slash. This technique was vital for closing the distance by deflecting the shot yet still allowing for advancement towards the enemy before they could fire another. With proper proficiency, this move also allowed the user to deflect a blaster bolt back at their enemy. Multiple enemies still posed a threat and to combat this, form three practitioners made use of the “circle of shelter,” a skill that let users enter a shifting meditation. This meditation allowed duelists to perceive the position of the threats as well as the required movements to avoid blaster bolts and deflect them. In a sense, the user could see into the future so that they may adopt excellent defense. The resilient style of Soresu made it perfect for prolonged encounters since energy consumption was not a trend for its users. Practitioners often outlasted their opponent, holding back and waiting for them to become fatigued until they may retaliate with their own attacks. \n\n\nWeaknesses still existed in the third form as it does with all of the forms. Considering that Soresu was dependent on an entirely defensive concept, it was quite clear that decent offense was hard to enact. Attempting to wear down the enemy and prolong the battle also came with the risk of the user getting fatigued if they happened to face too much pressure from precise and aggressive assault. Those that possessed a mastery over Soresu such as Obi-Wan Kenobi had extreme focus and often left nearly zero room for injury against blaster and even lightsaber enemies.  To correct the flaws that existed within the third form, Form IV: Ataru alongside Form V: Shien was developed to employ a more aggressive nature in lightsaber combat whilst still maintaining the basic principles of techniques.\n\n# Form IV: Ataru\nAtaru, also known as the Way of the Hawk Bat and the Aggression Form was the fourth style out of the seven combat forms. This form made itself known to address the faults of Soresu and was fairly common amongst the Jedi. This aggressive form involved swift yet powerful strikes from various angles with the addition of flips, leaps, spins, and other acrobatics assisted with the Force. The aggression established within the fourth allowed its users to pressure their enemy while also staying mobile and performing a series of strong attacks.\n\n\nThe Way of the Hawk-Bat came into the light during the Mandalorian Wars when Soresu proved to be far too defensive. As a result, Ataru was crafted so that lightsaber duelists could tackle a more aggressive approach to single enemies to overwhelm them with a fast series of attacks. The Jedi, in particular, named this form after yet another non-sentient species known as the hawk-bat. In admiration of the hawk-bats' vicious, quick, yet powerful strikes in predatory settings, Ataru was named the Way of the Hawk-bat. Similar to Soresu, Ataru remained an active style of combat throughout history, preserved for generations. Eventually, weaknesses were seen within Ataru leading to further developments of other combat forms.\n\nDeemed as the Aggression Form, form four users were quite adept in forms of offense and aggressive assault upon their enemies. Practitioners of Ataru held the lightsaber vertically at either side of their body with a two-handed grip. Complementary to the form’s alternative name, the “hawk-bat swoop” was a technique used with Ataru that involved sweeping motions to apply pressure with immense power as to not allow the adversary time to react. The “saber swarm” technique was yet another move utilized by Ataru practitioners that involved a series of short and quick strikes at the enemy so recovery between each strike was not disturbed. Usage of the Force to enhance the quality of acrobatics was also a common technique with Ataru. In some cases, the force-enhanced acrobatics allowed a user to tap into force valor, an ability that further advanced one’s accuracy and speed behind each of their movements allowing oneself to bypass physical hindrance. Anyone desiring to practice this lightsaber combat form had to bypass limitations to their physical performance by incorporating running, spinning, jumping, increasing speed, as well as the accuracy of their strikes by also using the force valor. This allowed for a user to hit their enemy in an abundance of different directions to prevent them from retaliating. All of these abilities and skills applied to Ataru worked well against single opponents as opposed to multiple enemies. Though, this style of combat still came with many other weaknesses.\n\n\nAtaru was not ideal for multiple enemy engagements, which left the user quite vulnerable to attacks from others as a result of their aggressive and vicious acrobatics. Tight spaces that restricted movement in any fashion rendered Ataru quite weak regardless of the enemy. Jedi and Sith who demonstrated extreme prowess in form IV easily overcame these faults such as Jedi Master Yoda who had complete mastery over Ataru and was indeed able to face multiple enemies at once not just because of his small size, but because of his abilities such as force valor that he applied to further enhance his movement. Overall, Ataru remained a favorable form among the Jedi and even the Sith across all generations to come but there still prevailed other options for lightsaber combat for those that liked a more balanced approach such as Form V: Shien/Djem So which offered two variations.\n\n# Form V: Shien/Djem So\nShien and Djem So, also notoriously known as the Way of the Krayt Dragon and the Perseverance Form was the fifth approach to lightsaber combat, the first development of a style consisting of two variations. This hybrid combat style emerged when Soresu users felt as if the defensive style of form III demanded too much defense and that it prolonged battles for far too long since it was essentially a waiting game to land a counter-attack. Form V had two styles of combat, Shien and Djem So. Shien put more focus towards countering blaster users while its other variant, Djem So, was developed for the purpose of lightsaber combat. Both variants of Form V involved using the enemy's attack against them in some manner, which is why both styles exist within the same form.\n\nBoth Shien and Djem So were developed by form III masters following the Great Sith Wars who felt that the tradeoff of offense for defense in Soresu deemed the form unbalanced thus making it less reliable. As a result, Soresu practitioners combined the aggressive aspects of Makashi with the fluent defense of Soresu to create both variations of Form V. Considering Form V intricated the use of physical power and strength, it received its title of Way of the Krayt Dragon from the non-sentient species known as the Krayt Dragon which the Jedi admired the power behind the predatory nature of this dragon, therefore, naming Form V in honor of the beast. Just like the other forms accepted by the Jedi, Shien and Djem So continued to be used after its ancient era of prevalence, even past the Clone Wars.\n\n\nShien was quite common among the Jedi of the Old Republic. This variation of form V was pronounced for its counter to enemy blaster fire all while still maintaining the proper offense to conduct powerful attacks in retaliation; usually excelling against multiple enemies. Shien’s neutral stance involved the user holding the hilt with a two-handed grip above their head, pointing the blade vertically, and positioned behind them. To allow for power behind each leading strike, the dominant leg was positioned back. There were other alternatives to Shien stances such as the reverse-grip in which the user held the lightsaber hilt in a backward fashion, making room for more powerful and long sweeping strikes to eliminate multiple enemies at the same time. The commonly used techniques with Shien were the Barrier of Blades and Shien Deflection. The Barrier of Blades provided great protection from blaster fire incoming from all directions whilst also being able to redirect some of the incoming fire back at the enemy. Shien deflection was another technique that involved redirecting blaster fire, but instead of remaining stationary or slowly advancing while deflecting, the user was able to leap and redirect the fire at the same time. Shien still had its fair share of flaws, such as its ineffectiveness in the face of single enemies.\n\n\nThe alternate variant of Form V, Djem So, was more so designed for lightsaber combat as opposed to combating blaster-wielding foes. Soresu masters had a much larger influence in the creation of Djem So, feeling that the dominant defensive style of form III was not reliable in lightsaber combat. The neutral stance for Djem So entailed the user to hold the lightsaber hilt with a two-handed grip above their head, pointing downwards at a forty-five-degree angle. Djem So users utilized different parries for the defense to create an opening in their enemy, staying in control of the fight and following up with their own attacks after defending from a blow. Upon guarding against an attack from their adversary, a Djem So practitioner brought down the force of an enemy’s attack against them. Brute strength and immense power was a key factor in utilizing Djem So. The assault upon another enemy had to be continued throughout the battle with the usage of force-enhanced movements and power attacks. Quite a few maneuvers presented themselves with the emergence of this aggressive form such as the “Falling Avalanche”, an overhand swing using great power to collapse on the enemy, and the “Fluid Riposte”, a move that allowed for fluency from a parry into a strike also with great power. Just like Shien, Djem So also had flaws such as the lack of mobility due to the immense power and physical strength required to make decent use of this variant.\n\n# Form VI: Niman\nNiman, also noted as the Way of the Rancor, the Moderation Form, and the Diplomat’s Form was the sixth lightsaber combat form employed by many out of the seven lightsaber combat forms. This form was rather unique in discovery in the sense that it was not the Jedi that devised it, rather an unpopular group known as the Royale Machetero of the Kashi Mer Dynasty. The focus of Niman was to establish a balanced form, combining many aspects of the previous forms of lightsaber combat to unify them all into one generalized style of lightsaber combat. Force-based attacks were also a part of form VI’s style to make up for the deficiency of specific proficiency.\n\n\n\nForm VI was first practiced by the Royale Machertero, an elite guard force of the Kash Mer. This rather balanced form received its most notable name, Niman, from the Kashi inhabitants who named it after the double triumvirate of their gods which is why this form was also known as Form IV. After the Jedi discovered this form, they went on to make small alterations to adapt more to their philosophy. The Jedi went on to provide yet another name for this simple yet reliable form known as the Way of the Rancor. As implied, this form was named after the creatures known as Rancors, likely due to its balanced predatory nature. It’s no surprise that Jedi Consulars in particular used Niman, as their devotion to diplomacy and the study of the Force served them well in their usage of Form IV. Throughout history, the Jedi favored Niman during their various conflicts with the Sith because of the balance it offered in both offense and defense. Eventually, the Diplomat’s Form grew to be a commonality for lightsaber combat training within the Jedi Order. Following the Great Jedi Purge and the emergence of the New Jedi Order under the leadership of Luke Skywalker, form VI was replaced quite swiftly by other techniques in lightsaber combat. Some Sith still chose to practice this form for the generations to come, but with enough time, Niman was forgotten by many.\n\n\nBeing dubbed the Moderation Form, Niman users possessed not the greatest attributes of offense and defense, but not the worst either, rather a perfect balance. This was because form IV implemented different aspects of the previous lightsaber combat forms except for Makashi to create a rather vigilant and reliable form. Niman had quite a variety of stances, the first being a wide stance with the feet being evenly spaced. The lightsaber held away from the body in a one-handed grip. The blade would be pointed vertically while the non-dominant hand was positioned across the chest. A second stance showcased the blade pointed outwards in a two-handed grip yet still quite close to the body. The dominant foot would position in the front. Yet another stance of Niman featured the lightsaber held back at waist level with a low two-handed grip also close to the body. Usability and reliability of Niman entirely depended on the user's creativity and quick-witted thinking in combat. To make up for the relaxed state of mind through each maneuver, different force powers were incorporated into the use of Niman such as force pushes and pulls with the addition of lightsaber attacks that worked simultaneously with these telekinetic abilities. To further enforce this, two main skills were used with Niman, the “draw closer” and the “pushing slash.” Draw closer pulled an enemy into the path of the user’s lightsaber, while the quite opposite “pushing slash” pushed an enemy backward with a force push after landing a blow. Just like the other lightsaber forms, Niman still prevailed with an abundance of different faults.\n\n\n\nDue to the practical style of Niman, standard executants of this form struggled heavily against Makashi. Form VI may have been a decent fallback form but presented no general specialization to provide a clear advantage in battle which is why quite a few grew disfavor for its practicality. Those who possessed a great mastery over Niman such as Sith Blademaster Kas’im didn’t find many methods to overcome these weaknesses and usually resorted to a different form that would grant them a clear edge in an aspect of lightsaber combat.\n\n# Form VII: Juyo/Vaapad\nJuyo, also known as the Way of the Vornskr and the Ferocity Form, was the seventh and most deadly form of the seven lightsaber combat forms. Form VII was also another form that consisted of two variants, Vaapad being developed millennia after Juyo. Practices of this voracious form were often banned within the Jedi Order since it heavily relied on emotional influence, sometimes bringing its users closer and closer to the Dark Side.\n\n\n\n\nJuyo was also dubbed the Way of the Vornskr in honor of the non-sentient beasts that were known for their vicious, deadly, and ferocious behavior as a predator. Vaapad, the other variant was later discovered during the age of the Galactic Republic by a Jedi Master known as Mace Windu who named this variant after the non-sentient creature due to its method of approach that involved quick and deadly attacks to overpower the opponent. Only records of Mace Windu’s discovery exists, but it is speculated by many that the principles of Vaapad may have been adopted by many other ancient individuals before Mace Windu but there is no evidence to support this claim. Precisely because of the fact that form VII utilized emotions behind each of the strikes, it was banned among the Jedi. Jedi that happened to practice it usually fell to the Dark Side and joined the Sith in their conquest for power over the galaxy. Likewise, Juyo in particular became more used by the Sith than the Jedi throughout the different generations.\n\n\n\nThe first variant, Juyo, consisted of chaotic and unpredictable attacks, making it perfect for a heavy offense. The neutral stance showcased a one-handed grip on the hilt with the lightsaber blade wielded on a horizontal angle over the head but pointed down. Similar to Makashi, Juyo was also decent for one on one encounters, being able to easily destroy nearly any enemy that dare test one’s prowess in Juyo. This alternate style of form VII required more strength and energy distribution behind each strike than Form V due to Juyo’s adaptation to emotional influence and focus. Despite the difficulties in controlling and using Juyo, practitioners that were capable of using the form properly like Darth Maul, Darth Sidious, and Darth Bane became known as deadly foes for their prowess in Juyo. A primary skill employed in Juyo was “Assured Strike,” a technique that allowed the user to trade off power for the assurance of landing a strike. “Vornskr’s Ferocity” was yet another technique used with Juyo that entailed aggressive, unpredictable, and ferocious attacks against the opponent. Due to the erratic and aggressive actions of Juyo, it left its users weak against multiple enemies and did not fare well against those with decent mastery in the Force usage; however, this didn’t stop the practice of Juyo even during time periods where it would be illogical to use.\n\n\n\nVaapad, the second variant, displayed more internal thought that stepped in between the boundaries of the Dark Side, demanding that the user showcase enjoyment and satisfaction of the fight. Vaapad practitioners allowed for the assault of their enemies to prevail so that they may accept the darkness within their enemy to take advantage of them. Force power was not easily contained when using Vaapad, as there was a persistent flow of emotional influence and freedom of Force power. The attacks from Vaapad appeared so fast that it seemed as if the user was using multiple lightsabers at once, making it difficult for the enemy to track at first glance. One of the common skills applied with Vaapad was the “Swift Flank,” a technique in which the user leaped or performed swift dashes around the enemy to land a strike. Another primary technique was “Tempered Aggression,” which allowed one to fully utilize the ferocity of Vaapad but still wield the proper control over their aggression so that they prevent themselves from falling to the Dark Side, a rather common risk among those that utilized Vaapad. True masters were able to overcome the weakness of potentially turning to the Dark Side such as Mace Windu who was credited for the foundation of Vaapad. Knowledge regarding Vaapad remained preserved in holocrons for the next generations following the Great Jedi Purge and ended up in the hands of the New Jedi Order but was never taught or used by any of its members.\n\n","meta":{"index":51,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Traditional Lightsaber Combat Forms","release_year":2022}},"Electro Whip":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Electro Whip or Shock Wip had a medal grip which had metal wires 4 meters long.

It usually inflicts superficial wounds, but if you have any opening in battle you should be quick to seize it.\n\nShiak:\nShiak, the second fundamental Mark, pierces an opponent with the blade’s point.

It severs the weapon hand entirely, leaving your opponent alive, but unable to continue the fight and thus, a victorious/merciful conclusion to battle.\n\nCho Sun:\nThis Mark removes the entire weapon arm at a point above the elbow on most humanoids. Not as precise as Cho Mai, it will nevertheless end a battle quickly.\n\nCho Mok:\nIt severs a different limb, such as a leg.

It is a technique that demonstrates the user’s swordsman skills. Practitioners of the Jedi Order considered this an honorable act when in combat because it allowed the user to win a duel without causing physical damage. The Sith, on the other hand, considered Cho Mai as an act of mercy, given that they rather kill their opponents rather than let them live with one less limb.# Application |\nTo perform Cho Mai against your opponent, the user simply drives their opponent’s blade aside before cutting their dominant wrist. There are other alternative methods to perform Cho Mai, such as altering the angle of a parry, so the user catches their opponent’s wrist instead of their weapon or sliding your saber inside their guard to cut it off. This combat skill is the perfect representation of observing possible advantages and executing them because once that vulnerability is present in the eyes of a Cho Mai user, they will use it for their dueling benefits.\n\n# Examples |\nDarth Bane used it against Hetton and then proceeded to kill him on Ambria, in 990 BBY. \n\nAnakin Skywalker used it against Darth Tyranus (Count Dooku) before killing him in 19 BBY at the Invisible Hand flagship. \n\nDarth Vader severed Luke Skywalker’s hand during their duel at Cloud City, in 3 ABY.\n\nDarth Talon severed Elke Vetter’s hand during 137 ABY.\n\n","meta":{"index":20,"author":"RavMalvern","name":"Cho Mai","release_year":2022}},"Blastsword Fighting Techniques":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe blastswords were a melee weapon that were commonly favoured and used by the Adumari noblemen. This weapon closely resembled any other traditional sword one may see. However, it had one significant difference resulting in it to stand out among many others like it. The end of the sword contained an energy outlet which would emit a blaster bolt upon activation. Blastswords would come in variants to perform better for multiple situations. This would include a polearm version used by perator guards.\nThe blastswords were held in high regard by several different Adumari duelists and were seen as great weapons for single handed combat paired commonly with short knives and daggers in the off-hand.# Fighting metods\nAfter several years, the blastswords would have their own fighting form in development that included lower lethality well-fitted for stunning rather than killing the enemy. Although certain blows would be illegal, some fighters chose to ignore the rule and continue to use the weapon as they saw fit. After the Adumari Civil War however, non-lethal blastsword methods would experience a huge rise in popularity, lethal blastsword fighting techniques on the other hand would begin to decline and most duels would follow this new trend.\n\n# Functionality and appearance\nBlastswords were fine and balanced weapons with the length of a human-male’s arm and allowed proficient-users to wield it one-handed. The hilt of the blade containing a pommel of the blade was covered by a curved metal guard to protect the user’s hand. The exotic design and function of the weapon forced its user to achieve high proficiency in order to wield the weapon properly without failure. The tip of the sword was connected to a blaster mechanism that would be powered by a cell placed in the hilt. When the mechanism activated (through a switch on the pommel) it would discharge an energy blast when in contact with a solid object.\nThe blaster end when activated would give off a humming noise alongside a glow of energy that left behind a colourful trail when mobile.\n\n# Additional information\nThe blastswords price ranged from 600-1500 credits and weighed in at around 2.1kg with its blade approximately a meter in length. The blastswords were melee weapons used primarily for close range combat and were used mainly by the Adumari.

The Lightsaber became one with the Sith Order’s traditions and values to spread chaos, fear and bring victory to their battles.# Analysis\nThe Jedi also carry lightsabers. They tried to uphold peace and justice in each corner of the galaxy. Unfortunately, they managed to maintain peace and justice, despite the many conflicts with the Sith and the Fallen Jedi, also known as the Dark Jedi. However, everything ended for the Jedi after Order 66, when the Republic clones started executing the Jedi one by one, after Lord Sidious ' command. Jedi claim their lightsaber crystals through the deep caves of Ilum. The Sith, however, have a superior alternative. They cook raw elements in a brood furnace that causes the production of an artificial crystal; one that can generate an energy blade that bears a bright crimson light.\n\n# Sith Developments and Usage\nBecause this artificial crystal is forged through meditation and bleeding to the Dark Side, it has the marks of your will. The red blade is strong and can even break the blades of the Jedi. Only the strong may survive, the weak are unimportant. According to the Terdyn Holocron, the first plans for the double bladed lightsabers were Sith creations.

The Magna guards weighed 123 kilograms with a height of 1.95 meters (6 ft, 5 in) carrying various different types of weapons such as Electrostaffs, RPS-6 rocket launchers, and Precision laser darts. Most MagnaGuards would use an electrostaff however as it proved to be efficient against lightsabers and were also able to continue fighting after the loss of a limb or a head. Magna Guards were so well designed and programmed that they could even face some of the most skilled Jedi with one of them even being able to back Obi-Wan into a corner.# Section I\nMagna Guards would usually fight in pairs of two where one would be tracking upfront to keep the Jedi’s lightsaber occupied while the other would strike in unprotected areas and weak points. The electrostaff was a weapon well suited for the IG-100s as it would complement their training in the seven forms of lightsaber combat techniques. The rod was made of phrik metal which was strong enough to withstand a lightsaber which caught many Jedi off guard and occasionally would lead to deadly consequences as a result. Additionally, the Magna Guards were in possession of a wide range of weapons, particularly long-range with a preference for explosives.\n\n# Section II\nThe IG-100s had a unique combat style through the combination of the 7 forms of lightsaber combat allowing the deadly droids to overwhelm their enemies with ease.

The Noghri were much older than many civilizations within the galaxy, even the ancient Je’daii Order. The Noghri, after meeting Darth Vader and killing his honour guard with little difficulty, vowed to serve him. The same went for Leia Organa, whom they called “Mal’ary’ush”, which means Lady Vader in Honoghran, their native language.# Description\nThe Noghri, despite their small stature and unarmed nature in some circumstances, were some of the galaxy's foremost fighters; revered enough to act as the personal guard of Leia Organa, as well as the personal assassins of Darth Vader. They were unstoppable in battle, and were single minded once set a task. The Noghri used their lack of height as an advantage, as it allowed them to slip past unbeknownst to others, hence their disposition towards assassinations. They possessed sharp claws and fangs, allowing them to quickly and quietly take out enemies, and a powerful sense of smell, allowing them to track and hunt their prey effectively. Even though they excelled at hand to hand combat they still used weapons such as the E-11 blaster. Their noses were so sensitive that they could smell the bloodline of an individual, which Leia Organa used to her advantage, as the Noghri recognised her as the daughter of Darth Vader, to whom they had dedicated their lives and service years prior. The Noghri were quick and agile, capable of using all four limbs to move, giving them an advantage in speed and mobility, and also had sharp eyes, allowing them to see threats and take in more information. All this, combined with a mirth for killing and no emotion to spare for those killed, created the perfect weapon. In order to turn them into an even greater group of assassins,Emperor Palpatine removed all knowledge of their existence from the galaxy; he scrubbed their homeworld, Honoghr, from the maps, and removed all information from archives across the galaxy. Even once they had escaped from the malevolent grip of Palpatine and his Empire, the Noghri still kept themselves shrouded in secrecy, never leaving Leia Organa’s side unless sent on a mission, and even then they remained unknown to the galaxy.

It is classified as using the Force, through the means of psychological warfare. This scheme mostly involved spoken jeers and jests that revealed an opponent’s weakness; therefore eroding their will. Dun Möch will also combine mental attacks, so their opponent’s concentration with the Force is stripped away and making them less precise and accurate. This is mostly used by Sith since they aim to dominate their opponent in every means necessary (combat, spirit, power, etc.). Not only that but because the Jedi rely too much on their concentration with the Force, they would be left open and weak by the Sith, essentially giving them the upper hand in combat.# The Boomerang Effect |\nShould the user fail to use Dun Möch, it will backfire by angering the target instead of making them afraid; thus endangering the user with increased hostile actions. Darth Tyranus (Count Dooku) fell victim to this effect twice against Anakin Skywalker, where when trying to implant fear into him, he only provoked anger which ultimately led to his defeat.\n\n# Inverse Dun Möch\nThere also exists another variant of this ability, that contains a purpose opposite to the original. In this case, the Inverse Dun Möch is used as a reminder to the sith that it is still good inside them and an opportunity to redeem themselves to the light.

Darth Bane studied under the blademaster Kas’im its techniques, secrets and its power. He confessed that training with the saberstaff and learning its use, was very hard as it is a difficult weapon to use.# Details\nThe saberstaff may be constructed as a single piece, or it may simply be two interlocking saber hilts that can be detached for two-handed combat. It is best used in wide, sweeping movements while the hilt remains close to the body. It requires a firm stance and a two-handed grip. Novices are likely to injure themselves while training, which will expose the flaws in their techniques. Punishment can be a great teacher.\n  Do not be confused into thinking they are two blades. The blades are connected. If you know the position of one, you know the position of the other. But while both blades are in motion, you can choose to extinguish one blade and surprise your enemy with a sword fighting lunge or riposte.\n The saberstaff is ideal for defeating multiple opponents as well as for defending against blaster fire. The broad energy barrier created by a whirling saberstaff is impenetrable when deployed by a skilled Sith Lord and above; one who possesses the precognitive ability to sense the timing and the vector of a threat.

Despite the uniqueness and practicality of tràkata, it was rarely ever used by the Jedi. As for the Sith, it was also a rare sight to see one making use of this style considering they relied on passion to provide an edge in battle as opposed to practicality.# Technique\nWhile not a part of the core seven forms of lightsaber combat, tràkata still had its fair share of techniques and maneuvers that made it useful in combat. This complicated yet simple combat style aimed to adopt a mindset of deception and practicality by simply fooling the enemy with visual action. Due to the mindset that was required of a user when using this form, the majority of the Jedi were not fond of it and decided to resort to one or many of the seven forms of lightsaber combat.

The way of Noghri relied on velocity and endurance, due the velocity of the combat style Stava practicioners were able to dodge a blaster shot, which made it really effective in fights against blaster users. The martial art could be combined with weapons such as; vibroblades,  sickles, and the Vrakolian Spin-blades.

Often, a variant design doesn’t emerge until much later, after years of experience spent analyzing one’s own fighting style and evaluating deficiencies caused by that first effort.# Variants\nCurved-hilt Lightsaber:\nThe curved-hilt Lightsaber is perhaps the least radical of all variants. Its extended handle accommodates a slight bend seldom exceeding thirty degrees. This style is common among practitioners of Form II lightsaber combat, who prefer its balanced weight and precise handling for saber-to-saber dueling.\n\nShoto:\nThe Shoto is a short saber with a blade extending perhaps a half-meter. The Shoto is often wielded in a Jedi’s off hand as a second blade. The guard shoto is carried by means of a perpendicular handle, allowing for spins that put an opponent off balance but put oneself at risk.\n\nLightclub:\nThe Lightclub is a giant-sized saber, with a massive handle and a thick blade. Lightclub are often built by Houks or other Jedi of unusually large size.\n\nDual-phase Lightsaber:\nThe dual-phase lightsaber uses focusing controls to shift between twin crystals, allowing a normal-sized blade to suddenly become twice as long. This is useful only for surprise attacks and I have not found it practical for running saber cadences.\n\nDual-Balanced Lightsaber:\nA familiar image from the last Sith War, the dual-balanced lightsaber is known as a Sith weapon, but there is nothing inherently wicked in its design. Using one takes years of study.\n\nLightsaber Pike:\nThe Lightsaber Pike employs the same combat style as the dual bladed saber. Both are staff weapons, but the pike has a shaft of saber-resistant metal and a short blade on only one end.\n\nLightwhip:\nThe Lightwhip is the most exotic of all weapons that use the crystal energy technology. Instead of having a rigid blade, the Lightwhip’s energy tendril is flexible and can be wielded to entangle or cut. Unless you are already an expert with traditional whips, you should not even attempt to hold a Lightwhip.\n\n","meta":{"index":53,"author":"jaketstone34","name":"Lightsaber Variants","release_year":2022}},"Teräs Käsi":{"content":"# Overview\nTeräs Käsi, which translates to \"steel hand\" in Basic, is a mysterious and dangerous martial art style that is well-known for its brutality throughout the galaxy.# History\nTeräs Käsi was created in a far-off star cluster in the Pacanth Reach on the planet Bunduki, which was home to the Epicanthix, a close-to-human species. Teräs Käsi was created on Bunduki by the clandestine Followers of Palawa, refugees from the planet Palawa, which had been decimated earlier in a conflict involving the Jedi Council. The Followers did this to make sure that another world would never be destroyed by the Council's actions. Pupils were frequently sent to the Followers in order to learn Teräs Käsi, where they were taught about history, literature, metaphysics, and the cultures of the Pacanth Reach. The Followers also urged the students to use Teräs Käsi for the welfare of society. Although it was still uncommon enough that one had to look for one of these graduating masters in order to study Teräs Käsi off of Bunduki, many people who discovered the mysteries of Teräs Käsi spread the information to other parts of the galaxy.\n\n# Characteristics\nTeräs Käsi, a devastating martial art, literally translated to \"steel hands\" in Basic, alluding to the practitioner's fists' exceptional tenacity and the powerful piston-like blows they could deliver. This reputation was well-deserved because experts of Teräs Käsi were known to unleash blows with as much force as slugthrowers and blaster pistols, easily punching through body armour. Even novices were known to be capable of shocking damage, albeit to a lesser extent.\nA practitioner of Teräs Käsi may also become blindingly fast and fine-tune their senses to the point where they could anticipate attacks with an amazing ease and avoid them so quickly that they appeared as a blur. Because of this, practitioners also possessed a high level of acrobatics; a practitioner falling may employ midair acrobatics to control their fall and prevent hitting cliffs and other potentially fatal obstacles. \n\nThese power, speed, and acrobatic feats were made possible by Teräs Käsi's core principles, particularly control and self-mastery to the point that a practitioner had total control over their body. Teräs Käsi also included meditative arts, turning a Teräs Käsi artist's mental control inwards as opposed to outwards; practitioners could enter a meditative trance-like state in which they were immobile and stop bleeding as well as slow poisons and diseases; master meditation artists could even slowly heal their own wounds by refocusing their mental energies within themselves.\n\nTeräs Käsi is a martial art that was modeled after the hunting techniques and movements of numerous monsters found throughout the galaxy. Many moves in the system have these names, like Charging Wampa, Rancor Rising, and Dancing Dragonsnake, to mention a few. With half a dozen fundamental stances that relied on four ranges of engagement kicking, punching, elbowing, and grappling range Teräs Käsi focused on close work with hands, feet, elbows, blades, and sticks.\n\n","meta":{"index":41,"author":"iMirones","name":"Teräs Käsi","release_year":2022}},"Lugjack Machine":{"content":"# Overview\nThe lugjack machine was a mechanical device commonly accessed by gamblers in the form of a slot machine that featured gambling games for the users through a built-in virtual screen. It featured a spinning wheel that gamblers would spin in an attempt to gain a profit, with the amount players bet in the machine acting as a multiplier against a payout score for each spin. To play this game, players would have to locate a lugjack gambling station, or they could access a remote station, usually roaming around the gambling tables to entice players.# Additional Sections\nThe lugjack machines were commonly connected to the lugjack betting window, which was one place where the player could control the betting process whilst playing lugjack. Players tended to have three options, spin the wheel, bet one, and bet max. Players were limited to being able to make a total of three bets for a single game. The player was also able to opt to make bets incrementally one at a time by choosing ‘bet one’, or they could choose to bet max, which would engage the spinning process. \n\nAdding bets incrementally up to the three max will also begin the wheel spinning process. Each bet made subtracts a singular credit from the player’s balance. After winning, all credits are deposited from the slot machine located at the bottom of the machine. \n\nOnce the max bet has been reached, or the player chooses to spin the wheel, the engine will begin three, four-second cycles of random rolling numbers between 0-7.

After the incident, Niman evolved into six different lightsaber forms, whereas Jark'ai essentially became a generic name for dual-blade combat.\n\nNiman wasn't the only form with a dual variant; Form IV Ataru also possessed one, which is surprising because it was known to use two swords while training. Ashoka Tano achieved mastery in this form while still a Padawan, which is something that a Jedi master would find troubling.\n\n# Analysis\nThe Jar'kai isn't really a form. Instead, it is the idea of effectively engaging in combat with two sabres. When they reclaimed their dead comrades or the enemy's sabres in battle, many Jedi were compelled to use Jar'kai for a brief period of time.\n\n\nThe forms have to be learned by Jar'kai users as well, with Niman and Ataru being particularly helpful for their style due to the emphasis on balance and force-enhanced agility.

The sickle had a cord that adorned a sharp blade at the end. At a quarter of the length of the cord, there was a second grip for another hand to be used. This allowed the wielder to be able to swing the chain-sickle with accuracy and force. At the end of the cord, near the blade, were small studded spikes that aligned the area. These spikes were able to inflict damage even if the target had evaded the initial blade strike.# Section One\nJedi Master Thame Cerulian fought against three wielders of the chain-sickle on the planet of Filve. He managed to survive, but just by the skin of his teeth. Another instance of when this weapon was used was when Count Dooku betrayed Asajj Ventress. Dooku had presumed that she was dead and because of that she decided to return to the Nightsisters of Dathomir, looking to seek revenge against her former Master. Ventress then traveled to the nearby Nightbrother village in search of a warrior to send to Dooku in her stead. She chose a group of Zabrak Nightbrothers and put them through a series of trials. First, was the Test of Night, where Ventress wielded her weapon of choice, the chain-sickle and used the Force to conceal herself from sight. She then used the weapon to lash them with strikes that would come from anywhere and kept doing so until she found her warrior. Some time passed and the Jedi Council sent Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to Dathomir to investigate the death of two Jedi on Devaron.

The emitter would have a circular blade around the hilt and had the blade be able to move around the hilt in a circular motion at the press of a button.\n\n# Advantages\nThe double-bladed spinning lightsaber had a deadly advantage for it had its spinning name for a very good reason, The blade had a circular emitter around the hilt allowing the saber to be able to spin like a propeller and use many dangerous strikes on their opponents if it connected. The spinning mechanic could be used to fly as a way to get to a hard spot or escape should it be necessary.\n\n# Disadvantages\nThe double-bladed spinning lightsaber was very good for combat but could be exploited very easily should an experienced Jedi take control of the duel. For example, the hilt was a lot thicker than the average lightsaber so it could easily be disarmed or grabbed if not spinning. This mechanism also could be seriously damaged should the emitter be damaged while it’s spinning, potentially resulting in the user's untimely death as it was very easy to cut and end their lives due to them becoming disarmed due to their blade being dis-ignited.

Though similar to the bladed weapons utilized by the ancient Jedi, Sith swords were distinguished from Jedi katanas by their fundamental nature, both powered by and empowering the dark side of the Force. The Sith swords were built through an alchemical and metallurgical process transmuting base metals into an alchemical alloy possessing an unusual affinity for Dark Side energies.# History\nThe origin of the first Sith sword ever constructed is unknown, however, it predated the earliest lightsabers. Developed by the ancient Sith, it was adopted by the Jen'jidai following their arrival on Korriban. The Sith's native martial traditions were absorbed, blending with the exiled Jedi's forms of lightsaber combat to create a powerful hybrid—much as the Dark Jedi would do with the Sith race as a whole upon seizing the mantles of Sith Lords. Quite a few Sith Lords, including the Dark Lords Ajunta Pall, Marka Ragnos, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh used Sith swords rather than lightsabers, either for tradition, or because they preferred the feeling of sword cutting through flesh.\n\n","meta":{"index":56,"author":"Mateo_222","name":"Sith Sword","release_year":2022}},"Shoto Lightsaber":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Shoto Lightsaber also known as Lightdaggers or Shortsabers, was the same design as a regular lightsaber but shorter.

These short yet powerful blades were also used for those of small statures such as Yoda, Young Ashoka, Yaddle, and Toki talivar.# Design\nIn thought, the Shoto is no different from a lightsaber other than size. The Shoto was about half the size of the regular lightsaber and its hilt is slimmer to allow for maximum dexterity. The Shot was quite rare compared to the more commonly used lightsaber. During the Jedi Civil War, these handy weapons were quite popular. These lightsabers were constructed by hand by certain people. This blade was not only for convenience either it was also for looks if somebody wanted a different lightsaber color.\n\n# Notable Users\nYoda- Yoda used this weapon due to his small body and the fact that the blade is much lighter than other sabers and also allowed him to have more agility. \n\nYaddle- Much like Yoda, yaddle used this to her size and the Shotos capabilities.\n\nAhsoka Tano- She used Shoto along with a regular saber, this was so she could have a quick off-hand attack.\n\n","meta":{"index":15,"author":"Long_Industries","name":"Shoto Lightsaber","release_year":2022}},"TL-50 Heavy Repeater":{"content":"# Overview\nThe TL-50 Heavy Repeater is a model of heavy blaster rifle manufactured for the Galactic Empire's special forces.

In order to create a Force-imbued blade, the Initiate had to select a metal, preferably a high-carbon one. The most used metal was durasteel, but Madog steel could also be used to make a Force-imbued blade. During this process, the Force could manifest to reinforce the metal, preparing it so the crystal could be put in the blade. After this exhausting process, the user had to meditate to transform the crystal, blade, and smith into a single entity. \nThese blades were so powerful they could cut materials easily, as well as kill dark side spirits.

Most double-bladed lightsabers created featured two pommels combined together to enlarge the hilt rather than assembling this lightsaber with a single hilt. The design was similar to that of a quarterstaff which many would use as practice before testing their skill with the real deal.# Advantages/Disadvantages\nThe purpose behind having twin blades was to allow for a more swift offense without the user having to expend too much energy on movement. Double blades also were beneficial defense mechanisms because of the area that two blades could cover at a time, making it much more convenient to deflect blaster bolts and other attacks. In addition, Having two blades as a resource also made fighting enemies a lot less difficult. In fact, having dual-blades created confusion for adversaries, because they did not just have to track one, but two blades at the same time during combat. The usefulness of the saber throw technique could also be amplified with the use of a double-bladed saber, providing the user with nearly double the amount of kills. Physical advantages were not the only ones provided as a result of handling a double-blade. These lightsabers also made an enemy's focus difficult, as the adversary had to keep track of not one, but both blades at the same time during combat.\n\n\nWhilst the double-bladed saber offered a wide variety of advantages in combat, it was not without weakness. The hilt was a difficult target to defend given its larger size compared to a single blade, a multitude of users falling victim to the sun djem technique that aimed to disarm the enemy by destroying the weapon. Usage of such a weapon required intense special training, wielding twin blades was no easy task. Users often had a limited range of motion as to not harm themselves when holding the hilt resulting in their horizontal or diagonal neutral stance in combat. The different maneuvers adopted by the double-bladed saber were quite hindered due to awkward movement or positions that had to be taken to pull off these techniques. Plenty of practitioners were left open because of the rapid attacks and movements that had to be employed when using this weapon. Considering all time towards practice, complicated movements, and other complications of the double-bladed saber, most Jedi and Sith opted for a single-bladed lightsaber instead.\n\n# History\nThe first designs of the double-bladed lightsabers appeared in 4000 BBY, forged by the Dark Lords of the Old Sith Empire. Just like many other forms of technology, this lightsaber variation's most prevalent first appearance emerged during the Great Sith Wars. Exar Kun was one of the first notable users during this time period that forged his lightsaber into a double-blade with the knowledge he gained from a holocron that displayed the specifications to do so.

Even though one could hold it from either angle, most people would prefer to hold it perpendicularly. Guard shotos were best used to block other lightsabers and were used by very agile and quick Force Sensitives. These sabers would allow the user to block, jab, slash, and utilize many other useful techniques. These weapons were pretty difficult to wield if one was not competent with lightsabers. Most users would hold the blade outwards for attacking, switching to a backhanded grip for more defensive purposes.

They could grow up to two meters in height with white shaggy fur and razor-sharp teeth alongside deadly claws. They are also extremely aggressive and tend to attack anything they deem as prey. A Wampa usually prefers to hunt their prey alone rather than hunting together with other Wampas. Even though they were substantially solitary hunters, they could hunt as a pack on rare occasions. The wampa species dominated at the top of the food chain on planet Hoth and was established to be the planet’s most aggressive carnivorous predator.# Ambush Tactics\nA wampa that was not engaging in the hunt for food prefers to be walking on all fours instead of two, with one exception being when they were actively hunting their prey to intimidate and immobilize the victim with its razor-sharp claws, deadly teeth, and immense brute strength.\n\nWampas were covered with white shaggy fur making it easy for them to camouflage themselves with the snow around them to blend in while stalking their prey without exposing their close-by presence.\n\nThese creatures would typically stalk their prey until both of them were close enough within the vicinity for the wampa to launch an attack on the victim while keeping them trapped. Standing up with their two legs and taking a fearsome and intimidating stance in front of its prey would mean that it has taken its final sighting and prepared counter-measures, springing towards the victim with its razor-sharp claws deploying for a final deadly pounce to stun or eliminate their prey on the spot.\n\n","meta":{"index":63,"author":"joelbloxx","name":"Wampa Ambush Tactics","release_year":2023}},"Gungan Booma":{"content":"# Overview\nThe booma was a weapon on Naboo Used by the Gungan Army.

It could also burn biomaterial and would leave a trail of burning goo heated to the touch. Boomas were made in very different sizes. The small ones would act as hand grenades and the big ones would be put in a catapult and launched.

Blasters were made of “Dedlanite” the leading manufacturer of this weapon was “BlasTech Industries”. If the blaster fired red bolts, it was typically used by sith and droids. These blasters have cheaper gas in them. The Republic and Resistance used blue bolts. This was good for disabling machinery such as droids. Green bolts were used by the “Umbarans”, yellow was used by the “Mandalorians”, and purple was used by the “Magna Guards”, the “Malevolence”, and Geonosian Star Fighters. Cyan was used for training clones on Kamino.# How they work\nBlasters were powered by energy-rich gas, which would melt through enemies. They used the same principles as laser weaponry. When fired the gas would turn into a glowing beam of plasma. The lower quality of gas, the more ineffective the blaster is.

It was also known for relying on the practitioner’s prowess in dueling and swordplay rather than the user’s ability with the Force.# Kendosu's Creation\nBesides being created to help the Jedi during the Great Galactic War, it also corrected aspects of different forms, such as Makashi, Djem-So, Ataru, and Soresu. The Jedi Knight saw on Makashi that it didn’t have enough strength to sustain itself during a duel, and was practically useless against blasters. On Djem-So, he noticed it didn’t have the necessary speed. He also found out Ataru lacked precision and strength, while it needed massive amounts of stamina to be mastered. Scott Borek also observed the blasters were prevalent and decided to borrow Soresu’s defensive style.\n\n# Strengths and Weaknesses\nKendosu mainly relied on speed for an attack. Said speed was used to overwhelm, confuse and counter-attack the opponent, allowing the user to gain power during the battle.

Orbalisks were able to feed on the Force-sensitivity of Darksiders. The Holocron of Freedon Nadd possessed the knowledge to make armament to stop the orbalisks from wrapping the face, hands, and feet of the individual. The orbalisks living on Darth Bane gave him extraordinary recovering effects and nourished the host with greatly improved resilience and dexterity, but it also stopped him from utilizing one of the most essential skills as a Sith, stealth.

Members of the Banite SIth would often utilize Zeyd-Cloth for robes, due to the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, also utilizing this fabric to mask his shriveled appearance in public. Darth Sidious chose to wear this fabric due to his admiration for his former Master, Darth Plagueis, who also wore this fabric.

These beasts utilized a variety of adaptations to hunt down their prey through the large forests that covered their planet. Vornskr possessed two forward-facing eyes that overlapped in their fields of vision, giving them stellar depth perception. They also possessed a dark green or gray skin tone, allowing them to effectively disappear into the shadows of the forest. They could angle their hyper-sensitive ears to pick up on the direction of even the smallest noise. Their whip-like, venomous tails could be used to injure and stun prey before using their razor-sharp teeth to finish the job. All of these combined made them expert hunters, but their biggest advantage was their sense of the Force in living creatures.# Section 1\nThe sense of the Vornskr evolved as their favorite prey, the Ysalamiri, a salamander-like lizard species, became more and more difficult to catch. These beasts evolved the ability to sense the Force around them and within living creatures. This greatly aided them in hunting down the Ysalamiri, who were rich in the Force, but also caused them to sometimes target Force-Sensitives. Thinking these Force-Sensitives, including Jedi, were their favorite prey, they would sometimes mercilessly hunt them down for food.\n\nAs the Vornskr evolved to become better and better at hunting down their prey, the Ysalamiri also evolved to be able to avoid being slaughtered by their predators. The Ysalamiri eventually developed the ability to suppress the Force within and around themselves to effectively cloak themselves from the Vornskr’s ability to sense them. The Ysalamiri became so skilled at using this ability that they became able to create a “Force Bubble” around themselves that would suppress all Force inside, to the point where no creatures could even use Force abilities within.\n\n# Section 2\nVornskr are primarily known to be nocturnal hunters. However, they have been reported to occasionally hunt or fight during daytime hours if extremely hungry or threatened in some way. Vornskr have rarely been seen outside of a wild capacity, but in rare cases, they have been known to be tamed by those brave enough to do so. Their talent in hunting was used by some to hunt down prisoners of war who escaped or to track down enemies in a combat zone.

This was seen plenty of times throughout recorded lightsaber duels and battles. Prominent examples of these are the following: \n\nJedi Knight Johun Othone successfully maims Darth Bane on Tython with a Shiim strike, gaping a wound in his orbalisk armor that would expose his wrist.

Naturally, this maneuver was used to defeat an enemy without causing harm to said person. Sun djem could be used to disarm nearly any enemy with a weapon. When utilized against blaster-wielding enemies, the user simply destroyed the weapon by cutting the barrel. During lightsaber combat, the maneuver simply involved twisting the hilt out of the enemy's hands or even knocking the hilt out of the adversary’s grasp by using brute force. Other methods also involved chopping off the hand of the opponent completely, rendering their ability to hold a weapon useless.# Application\nThis ancient technique of lightsaber combat was most commonly used with the first form known as Shii-Cho. Given the basic nature of the first form, it is to no surprise that such a skill was so consistent during the emergence of lightsaber combat forms. The most common technique of sun djem with this style of lightsaber combat was the disarming slash, a maneuver that was simply meant to destroy the weapon of an enemy. Sun djem would begin to become a rare technique within lightsaber combat after newer forms began to succeed the first such as Makashi which was entirely focused on preventing disarmament.\n\n","meta":{"index":9,"author":"Redjaal","name":"Sun Djem","release_year":2022}},"Protosaber":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe protosaber is the first ever known design of the modern lightsaber. It is also referred to as Archaic lightsabers. Instead of these protosabers having a blade emitted from a Kyber Crystal within the lightsaber, these protosabers had an external power pack with limited operation time. This meant that it was harder to continue duels for extended periods of time before a power pack would burn out and stop working. The mobility of a user was restricted due to the long cable, which connected the weapon to the power supply located on their hip, back, or belt. The thick cable would be connected on the bottom of the protosaber. Its design eventually became obsolete due to improvements in technology and materials. This new invention allowed more potent power cell technology which allowed users to replace the power packs, with even small ones that fitted within the hilt of the lightsaber instead of a big bulky bag.# Limitations\nDue to these protosabers being connected by a power cable one could not be as agile and mobile. This also meant that the power pack would eventually surge out and stop working, if used for a prolonged time. Another disadvantage was that if someone were to cut the cable connecting the power pack to the protosaber that the protosaber would cease to work, and they would have to replace it.\n\n# History\nProtosabers were used during the Hundred-Year Darkness and also the Great Hyperspace war by both Jedi and Sith. During the battles, they clashed with weapons imbued with the Force, and other weapons, some made of Mandalorian iron which is also known as beskar. As the galaxy evolved, the protosabers became a weapon of the past. They found ways to create better weapons that didn’t rely on these big power packs, but instead found a way in order to put power cells inside of the lightsaber, requiring no unneeded cables. This also allowed the user to be more mobile, using these lightsaber with power cells inside of the hilts let a user dual wield, or even come to create a weapon that had two blades, connected to a long staff hilt.\n\n","meta":{"index":3,"author":"MommyDorchadas","name":"Protosaber","release_year":2022}},"Thermal Detonator":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Thermal Detonator was a weapon used by many weapon wielders.

This weapon was used by pressing the thumb trigger and placing it so that the wielder has time to place it and move before exploding. Thermal Detonators were extremely common during the era of the Galactic Republic and became big after many people realized that the plasma grenade and other explosive-type weapons were growing outdated.  The explosion was as big as five to six meters but had a customizable blast radius.# Section I\nThe thermal detonator's name is linked to the process by which the device explodes. The shell of the explosive is made with thermite or axidite. When detonated the bomb emitted a sudden shot of energy that caused the shell to explode through a fusion reaction. This explosive was so powerful it could eradicate any material that did not produce any form of thermal energy. These weapons have different usages depending on certain scenarios, this means that some of them cling on to walls and other platforms, while some couldn't be detonated in mid-air.

All of the known ready stances were ready, defensive neutral, offensive neutral, and center of being.# Section One\nThe first ready stance, ready, was most commonly used amongst the Jedi. This stance has many similarities to the Ataru guard. When the form was used the dominant foot was held back and the blade was held in a vertical parry position. Next is defensive neutral, which has little to no differences from the prior ready stance. The blade would still be held in a vertical parry position, but the user would keep their feet evenly spaced. Offensive neutral is the next ready stance and it has some similarities to defensive neutral. However, it differs from defensive neutral because the blade would be pointed directly at the enemy. This stance was intended to reduce the time that the blade is visible. The last of the ready stances was center of being, which was also used for meditation. This stance was used by members of the Old Jedi Order and they utilized it by holding their saber horizontally and keeping the hilt just below their chin.\n\n","meta":{"index":25,"author":"ElysiaLValkyrie","name":"Ready Stances","release_year":2023}},"Lightsaber Pike":{"content":"# Overview\nLightsaber Pikes were a style of lightsaber that appeared to resemble one of two different forms.

The lightsaber blade itself resided at the end of the handle and was much shorter and thinner than a normal single-bladed lightsaber. This type of lightsaber was almost as long as the wielder and was perfect for keeping enemies away from the wielder at a distance. Notable users of this weapon include the Knights of Zakuul from the Eternal Empire and the Dark Honor Guard of The Sith Order. The second form of this lightsaber type shares the same function and seems identical in appearance to the double-bladed lightsaber; it displays another blade at the other end of the handle.

Mon Cala's oceans held an abundance of life, including two influential sentient species: the peaceful Mon Calamari and the bellicose Quarren. Both preferred to build their cities underwater, although some cities were built on the surface. Despite their differences, the two peoples generally showed mutual respect throughout their history. The coral on Mon Cala grew in large colonies, forming coral reefs that acted as shelter and feeding and breeding grounds for various sea life. These reefs tended to thrive in areas bathed in the light of Mon Cala's twin suns, but some hardier species dwelt in deeper, darker areas. The planet's sparse islands formed archipelagos with varying terrains, including rocky cliffs and sandy beaches with dense jungle. The polar regions were colder than the rest of the planet, with ice floes located in the north. Some Quarren and Mon Calamari left their homeworld to avoid politics, settling instead on the moon of Trask.# History\nMon Cala, discovered by the Galactic Republic in 19,000 BBY, has a rich and varied history. During the Clone Wars, the planet played a crucial role, serving as a battleground between the Republic and the Separatists. The Mon Calamari, led by King Yos Kolina, sided with the Republic, while the Quarren aligned themselves with the Separatists. In 19 BBY, the Battle of Mon Cala occurred, leading to King Yos Kolina's death and the Quarren's alliance with the Separatists. After the Clone Wars, the Galactic Empire occupied Mon Cala, and the planet became a hotbed of resistance activity. The Mon Calamari joined the Rebel Alliance, and a massive battle erupted, leaving the planet severely damaged. In the years following the fall of the Empire, Mon Cala became part of the New Republic, and the Mon Calamari and Quarren worked together to rebuild their planet. However, the planet continued to face threats, including an attempted coup by the Quarren in 5 ABY and an invasion by the First Order in 34 ABY. Despite the conflict, Mon Cala remains a vital and resilient planet, with the Mon Calamari and Quarren living together in relative peace and cooperation. They continue to protect their planet and their way of life, ensuring that Mon Cala remains a critical player in the galaxy's history.\n\n# Settlements\nMon Cala's population mainly lived in underwater cities, preferred by both the Quarren and the Mon Calamari species. However, some cities like Dac City breached the surface. The cities included city-ships which could also be used as ships. Mon Cala city was the planet's capital where the king ruled from and included a city square and a central planetary scanner mast. Other settlements included Dac City, which had a palace for King Lee-Char, New Coral City located above water, Quarren Town located in the depths of the ocean, and Zeran Town located in the northern regions of the planet.\n\n# Structures and buildings\nDuring the High Republic Era, Mon Cala had an outpost made of coralite which served as a raft and had kelp hanging from the underside to create a habitat for sea creatures. The Mon Calamari Royal Palace, located in Mon Cala city, served as the residence of the king of Mon Cala, and included a throne room used for debates. King Yos Kolina was assassinated in the palace by Riff Tamson, but his son was soon coronated as the new king. The Moncaladrome, a famous opera house, performed plays such as the \"Faluvian cycle\" and \"The tale of the tragic egg\" on a multi-level stage to a large audience.

Due to Yoda being here, Luke Skywalker came here looking for training. Yoda died here and his essence became one with the Force.# Description\nDagobah was a planet located in the Sluis sector of the Outer Rim Territories. Dagobah was a hot and humid planet, and a nursery of life. Dagobah was pure in the Force, one of the purest locations in the entire galaxy. This planet was mysterious, filled with mist. Dagobah was also interspersed with shallow lakes, lagoons and multiple living caves. Dagobah was home to many creatures, including bogwings, dragonsnakes, butcherbugs, vine snakes, sleens, and swamp slugs. Dagobah had flora too, such as the Lahdia plant, Gnarltrees, Yoghurt plants, and Yarum seeds. This planet was clear of advanced or indigenous civilizations of sentient life. Dagobah had two seasons, a dry season and a wet season. During the peak of the dry season, the uplands become too hot for the majority of life to survive, so the organisms have to migrate to the lower lands. After a quarter orbit passes, Dagobah is far away enough from its sun that the dry season comes to an end and the rains return. The wet season starts again, making the uplands habitable again after this.\n\n# Republic Era\nDuring the High Republic Era, an academic paper was written that stated that Dagobah was strong with the Force. During the Republic Era, Halka Four-Den’s Alpha Team was sent to Dagobah in order to chart and map the outer borders of the Galactic Republic and also to learn more about Dagobah’s plants and animals. After three months, Four-Den and her team were overwhelmed by dangerous wildlife, fast-growing plants, and diseases. Close to the end of the Clone Wars, Jedi Grand Master Yoda went to Dagobah after hearing deceased Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn's voice. Yoda went into the swamp, where he communicated with Jinn who appeared as a group of fireflies. Qui-Gon told Yoda how to contact the living after death using the Force. Then, Yoda set foot in a cave, where he saw a vision of the Jedi fighting clones and fought Darth Sidious.\n\n# Imperial Era\nFollowing Yoda’s failure to defeat Darth Sidious, Yoda exiled himself in Dagobah. Yoda began his exile, continuing his studies of the Force. Due to the swampy environment of Dagobah, Yoda’s E3 standard starship lifeboat, his shelter at the time, started to degrade within a year. As the Lifeboat was slowly consumed by the swamp, Yoda built a new home for himself. He made it near the dark side cave but out of range of its influence; Yoda would visit the cave every few years. Dagobah’s wet season created a need for Yoda to regularly relocate to the planet’s highlands for the duration of the season. At some point in time, former Sava Medlin Sun went to Dagobah in search of Yoda. After saving her from a monster, Yoda used the Force to lead Sun into the Dark Side cave. While she was inside, she saw visions which dissuaded her from looking for Yoda. Afterwards, she left the planet as Yoda watched from a distance.\n\n# Training ground of Luke Skywalker\nLuke Skywalker, Darth Vader’s son, went to Dagobah under the direction of deceased Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, hoping to find Yoda and be trained in the ways of the Jedi Order. Luke crashed into a bog while landing, not realising he crashed upon the old master. Yoda took Luke back to his hut for dinner, where he revealed his true identity to Luke. At first, Yoda was reluctant to train Skywalker because of his age and lack of patience. Yoda was later convinced to teach Skywalker by the Force spirit of Obi-Wan. During Luke’s training, he entered the Dark Side cave and came across a vision of Darth Vader, who he struck down, only to see his own face in Darth Vader’s mask. However, Luke ended his training early, once he had sensed his friends, Han Solo and Princess Leia, were in danger. Yoda and Kenobi tried to reason with him to stay, but Skywalker left the planet, promising to return and finish his training. Luke came back after learning Darth Vader was his father during their duel on Cloud City, saving Leia and Chewbacca from Vader on Cloud City, and also rescuing Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine. When Luke arrived in Dagobah, he found Yoda sick and dying. Yoda told Luke that his training was complete, but his final task was to confront Darth Vader one last time. Yoda became one with the Force and the ghost of Kenobi revealed that Princess Leia was Luke’s Sister. Luke left Dagobah in order to confront Vader and the Emperor in hopes of turning Vader back to the Light Side.\n\n# New Republic Ear\nKylo Ren, the nephew of Luke Skywalker and under the guidance of his master Snoke, came to Dagobah in order to face his darkest fears. In the Dark Side cave, Ren experienced a vision of his uncle Luke, in which he dueled and killed, and a vision of his parents Princess Leia and Han Solo. Ren was not able to kill his parents, so he destroyed the cave, fooling his master, Snoke.

An infamous Mandalorian terrorist group called the Death Watch also set up a base here around 20 BBY.# High Republic History\nDuring the High Republic Era, a battle for Operation: Counterstrike was located on this planet. This military operation was created due to the threat of Nihil marauders claiming territory and expanding into Galactic Republic settlements. When some of the Nihil were caught and interrogated on Carlac, the Jedi discovered the existence of Tempest divisions. They also found that these divisions were led by three different Tempest Runners, who held significant power and influence over the entire organization.\n\n# Clone Wars History\nAs previously mentioned, the Death Watch organization created a base on Carlac during the Clone Wars. Padawan Ahsoka Tano and future senator Lux Bonteri traveled to meet Death Watch with the goal of securing a deal for revenge on Count Dooku. Mina Bonteri, Lux’s mother, was killed by Dooku’s minions because she spoke out against the war. After finalizing the deal, Chieftain Pieter of the Ming Po people interrupted their party, imploring that Vizsla returned the female Ming Po slaves he took. Although Pre Vizsla, Death Watch leader, accepted his plea, he later returned to their town and killed Pieter’s granddaughter in front of him. The Mandalorians burned their town, slaughtered a significant amount of their people, and captured Ahsoka when she tried to defend them.

The products and people on Taris were referred to as Tarisian after unknown human colonists overtook it. Aliens would consistently go in and out of the planet, whether to settle or to visit. This caused the Republic to notice it and claim it as its own. While the Republic’s rule of the planet first caused immediate economic growth, it eventually led to a mass overpopulation of the planet. Once the Galactic Nexus was formed, greater trade routes were found, which led to Taris’s importance on the map greatly declining. Eventually, the harm became too much for the Tarisians, and they started immigrating to other planets. Those who were less fortunate and could not immigrate started social movements and riots among its people. The economy declined, the oceans were polluted, and its main food source was gone. It got so bad that pretty much all of the Taris wildlife was sick or dead. The poor were left to die while the rich hoarded what was left. This led to numerous civil wars, most notably the Tarisian Civil War, and the Humanocentric Civil War. These wars only led to more unjust rules for the poor as they would be banished from entering the upper regions of Taris, where the rich resided.\nTaris acted as a crucial central point for the Jedi during the Mandalorian Wars. As the lower class was trampled during the war, their anger only grew. The crime levels shot up, and the rebellion from the low class became stronger. This caused one of the biggest mining companies to leave Taris, causing the unemployment of half of the lower class. This would cause much of the lower class to go to the planet's government and start riots. They even kidnapped the Senator as well as the local constable. This only led to the Jedi also leaving, causing the wars on Taris to continue raging. Taris would eventually recover after the Jedi return during the Jedi Civil War.# Planet features\nTaris was an ecumenopolis, meaning that pretty much all land was transformed into cities. Unlike most ecumenopolis, Taris had a huge ocean that took the majority of its surface. These oceans were once used for enormous kelp farms to feed the massive population, but then the ocean became polluted, causing the kelp to die. The buildings on Taris were tall and beautiful and had unique features around their edges. Despite this, the planet was still corrupt and left the lower class to suffer under all of the loud buildings. After Darth Revan’s Sith empire bombarded Taris, much of the buildings were left in ruins.\n\nTaris had these feathered dog-like animals that were used as pets by the citizens of Taris. Many animals were also hunted or used for resources that were either shipped or used by Tarisians. The Rakghoul was one of the most terrifying creatures on the planet, residing in the Undercity of Taris. They were ruthless creatures that tore their prey apart and spread a disease that turned their victim into a Rakghoul.\n\n# Culture\nTaris was an extremely classist and segmented society, splitting up the rich and the poor into nicer areas based on wealth. Most alien species were banned from even being in the upper regions of Taris, with a few exceptions. Most aliens that even stepped foot in the upper regions would be arrested. The middle regions allowed aliens, but also still had a majority of humans due to the unfair favoritism of humans on Taris. The lower region was mainly alien-based and dealt with lots of crime.

However, the Separatist fleet would blockade the planet; thus trapping the senator on the surface. Admiral Trench, a Separatist leader, would be the cause of this blockade, making it impossible to break through the defensive formation.

The planet was known for its doonium which was a resource that was used to construct starships. Umbara was also well known for having several moons in its orbital system.# History\nUmbara was actively contributing to the Galactic Republic but always prioritised its homeworld over the Galactic government. Despite its reputation for deceit and self-serving schemes, Umbara remained loyal to the Republic during the Separatist Crisis and the Clone Wars. Represented by Senator Mee Deechi, Umbara initially supported increased military spending. However, after Deechi's assassination, Umbara defected to the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In response, the Republic launched an invasion led by Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi, Saesee Tiin, Anakin Skywalker, and Pong Krell, accompanied by the 501st Legion and the 212th Attack Battalion.

The Umbaran society was structured around a violent caste system that often led to ambition and mistrust. Umbarans possessed unique abilities such as seeing into the ultraviolet spectrum and excelling in deception, negotiation, and charm. They were sensitive to bright light and often wore traditional garments like the Umbaran shadow cloak. Umbarans had achieved great technological advances, particularly in military technology. Their advanced weapons and vehicles were difficult for non-Umbarans to operate. They also had their own native language called Umbarese.\n\n# Imperial Era\nDuring the early months of the Imperial Era in 19 BBY, the Galactic Empire dealt with surviving the resistance, including Umbara. Eventually faced with a debt and no way to pay the Empire, Umbara was one of many worlds that surrendered its remaining independence, fully placing the planet under the power of the Empire. The pirate and insurgent leader Nightswan started an uprising in Umbara in order to promote the Imperial takeover of Umbara's mining and refining sector. Nightswan believed that it would be more convenient to bribe the Imperial inspectors instead of dealing with the Umbaran officials. Despite resistance from leftover Separatist forces that were mostly vulture droids, Thrawn helped secure an Imperial victory by convincing Commander Alfren Cheno, who was part of the task force, to bombard a ground-based transmitter on Umbara's outermost moon despite Admiral Carlou Gendling's orders not to. Gendling ended up being furious with Thrawn, and Cheno ended up resigning his position.\nA new pocket of doonium was discovered on Umbara at some point.

Moraband was known by many names due to its age and use. Most notably of the names used were Korriban when it was the planet of the Sith Temple and the Siths home world. Korriban or Moraband, has since become a desolate wasteland due to years of prolonged wars and was abandoned by the Sith. However, the atmosphere is still breathable despite most plant life having been long dead.# Terrain and Climate\nThe terrain of Moraband became desolate due to the 100s of years of wars during the Ancient Siths occupation of the planet. Moraband itself is also a very mountainous planet. Furthermore, due to the aforementioned wars, the climate has since become hotter than when it was used as a Sith Temple. Surprisingly, the atmosphere is still breathable.\n\n# Locations\nThere are many notable locations of Moraband. Two of the most important locations on Moraband were the Sith Temple known as the Valley of the Dark Lords and the Sith Temple known as the Sword of Khashyun. The Sword of Khashyun was a Sith Temple that held the Sword of Khashyun. The Temple was guarded by massive sentries and Tuk’atas (Also known as Sith Hounds). The Temple was also heavily booby trapped to protect the Sword. The sword itself is a Sith Artifact forged by a faction of Dowutin Sith Warriors that believed lightsabers were for the weak. Legends say that the sword is cursed to turn Sith upon one another.\nThe Valley of the Dark Lords was a Sith Temple dedicated to holding the tombs of great Sith Lords. The Valley of the Dark Lords was the largest monument to fallen Sith Lords. The largest and most notable monument in the valley was that of Darth Bane, the founder of the Rule of Two. The Temple itself also held an extensive execution chamber that was utilized to execute Jedi prisoners.\n\n# Notable Events\nMoraband, known as Korriban by its primary occupiers, the Ancient Sith, was the homeworld to the Ancient Sith. Due to the constant wars and the subsequent fall of the Sith Order in approximately 1000 BBY(Before the Battle of Yavin) left the Sith homeworld of Korriban in disarray. Korriban stayed almost entirely uninhabited until the Clone Wars when Grandmaster Yoda was sent to Korriban by the force priestess to unlock the secrets of Eternal Consciousness. When Yoda arrived at Korriban, he was met with a number of Sith Spirits. Including the spirit of Darth Bane himself. As Yoda went further into Korriban, Darth Sidious attempted to corrupt Yoda using Force Visions to further the plot to destroy the Jedi Order. The plan ultimately failed and Yoda left Korriban after unlocking the ability to Eternal Consciousness (also known as a Force Ghost).\n\n","meta":{"index":52,"author":"60328","name":"Moraband","release_year":2023}},"Rhen Var":{"content":"# Description\nA planet in the Outer Rim Territories, Rhen Var was situated near the Galidraan system which was primarily controlled by the Galactic Empire. This freezing cold planet possessed a frigid climate only withstood by troops well-equipped with heat harboring gear. \n\nOriginally possessing vegetation and fauna, a sudden cataclysm transformed the surface of Rhen Var into a frozen wasteland thousands of years before the Clone Wars. The only terrain that remained was the tundra, snow-covered mountains, and glaciers.# Imperial Era\nRhen Var maintained an Imperial outpost during the rule of the Empire, and it was thought that the stolen Carrion Spike would attack the settlement. After this Imperial corvette (starship) was hijacked and used to launch assaults on the Empire’s establishments in the Galidraan system, Moff Wilhuff Tarkin originally predicted that it would be used against the Rhen Var base. He later decided that the rebel pilots would instead target the planet Nam Chorios due to its mining colony and prison facility.\n\n","meta":{"index":101,"author":"purebourne","name":"Rhen Var","release_year":2023}},"Mortis":{"content":"# Overview\nMortis was an “ethereal” realm of the force that  was talked about and passed down in legends between Jedi and Sith alike. It contained dreamlike environments and could never be mapped due to even the biggest  landmarks often appearing in different places. It is believed to exist outside of any star system, or perhaps even outside of the galaxy or universe as a whole. Some also believe that the origins of the Force come from Mortis itself.# Section 1\nOne of the more intriguing parts of Mortis is its day-and-night cycle. During the day, it has a beautiful landscape of lush fields, mountains that are green, dense forests, and molten caverns, which allows for a stunning view of the entire place. During the night however, this fauna would wither away and die, all the creatures would simply disappear, and the downpours would sweep the terrain so heavily that survival without a shelter was practically impossible. Most interesting of all, is that in the black night skies of Mortis, there are few stars that shine, and all of them are unidentifiable.\n\nThe entrance to the realm was never voluntary either, it drew in its visitors out of the blue while manifesting itself in a manner of different ways. To some, it would show itself as a monolith randomly floating in space, and sometimes individuals walked through a door or landed there without any specific reason for it. The way time flows here is also most unusual and holds no meaning to any place outside of it as weeks, months, years spent in Mortis are mere seconds outside of this place.\n\n# Section 2\nThe realm was inhabited by only three beings, The Son, The Daughter and The Father. The Son signified the dark and twisted parts of the realm such as the night while the daughter signified the beauty and peace of it such as the day time. We can therefore insinuate from this that The Son is aligned to the Dark Side of the Force while The Daughter is aligned to the Light Side of the Force. The Father is who keeps these two forces in perfect harmony and balance.\n\n# Section 3\nIt is here that Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi were drawn during the Clone Wars by The Father. This happened because The Father realized that Anakin Skywalker was “The Chosen One” and therefore he would be able to keep balance in the Force on Mortis after he passes. However, the entire thing escalated to the three beings on Mortis battling the three Jedi that were drawn into Mortis. The struggle ended with The Father, The Son, and The Daughter dying at the hands of the Jedi trio that happened to be pulled to Mortis. The deaths of these three beings led to the restoration of balance on Mortis.\n\n","meta":{"index":134,"author":"AlterAurum","name":"Mortis","release_year":2024}},"Kamino":{"content":"# Overview\nLocated in the Outer Rim, Kamino is an aquatic planet, home to Kaminoans. These Kaminoans are tall, long-necked, slender-like beings. The Kaminoans lived in cities held by poles under water. These cities are in the shape of a circle with ascending and descending levels inside. The majority of these cities were homes to some of the best cloning technology.# Section 1\nWith the Kaminoans’ technology, this later led to the Clone Army's creation by the donor named Jango Fett for the Galactic Republic. With this, the Kaminoans started getting to work. They began to make millions of clones for the Galactic Republic and were making a decent amount of money in exchange. These clones were well-trained and were put in different specializations such as medics, arc troopers, marksmen, anti-tank troopers, etc.\n\n# Section 2\nWhile chasing the bounty hunter Jango Fett, Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered the isolated planet Kamino. Erased from the Jedi archives by Count Dooku, Dooku did this to cover up the Sith’s objectives. With this knowledge, Kenobi informed the Jedi Council. Even though he informed them, the mastermind deceived them all and Order 66 eventually occurred during the ending of the Clone Wars. While Jedi would go to Kamino to view the clones’ progress, the Kaminoans always informed the Sith of their arrival and what had happened.\n\n","meta":{"index":132,"author":"CoolShark2828","name":"Kamino","release_year":2024}},"Nal Hutta":{"content":"# Description\nNal Hutta, also known as Hutta, was a planet located in Hutt Space. The planet had a sticky and uninviting environment, covered with mist and continuous heavy rainfall. Its diverse ecosystem closely resembled the Hutt species that inhabited it. The Hutts ruled the planet, and they utilised the little solid land available to build their abodes since numerous bogs covered the surface.\n\nThere were only a few spaceports built on the planet by the Hutts to move among their towns, settlements, and palaces. Visitors seldom arrived on the planet; Nar Shaddaa, the largest moon, was the foremost hub for off-world transactions. The capital city, Bilbousa, had the primary spaceport, and it sprawled across the land with twisting roots extending from large pods in all directions. The Palace of Gardulla Besadii the Elder, one of Nal Hutta's significant buildings, occasionally functioned as the Grand Hutt Council's headquarters, responsible for governing the Hutt Clan. Despite being a polluted and dangerous planet, under the Hutts' control, Nal Hutta played a preeminent role in the galaxy's black market and had a similar reputation as Nar Shaddaa.# History\nThe Hutt Clan's headquarters were on Nal Hutta. At one point, Nal Hutta was a bustling planet with many cities. Unfortunately, during the Drengir crisis, this changed, and a Drengir infestation turned the world into a place of sweltering jungles. The planet remained this way for years to come. However, this climatic turn was to the Hutts' liking.\n\n# Clone Wars\nAfter freeing Ziro the Hutt from prison on Coruscant, the skilled bounty hunter known as Cad Bane brought him to the Grand Hutt Council on Nal Hutta. However, Ziro refused to provide the Council with the location of his secret holo-diary and was imprisoned. Nevertheless, Ziro managed to escape with the help of a singer named Sy Snootles. Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Quinlan Vos were then dispatched to Nal Hutta to capture Ziro. But, he escaped with Snootles and fled to another world, with aid from Ziro’s mother.\n\nDuring a separate mission to rescue Supreme Chancellor Palpatine from Separatist assassins, Obi-Wan Kenobi, disguised as bounty hunter Rako Hardeen, teamed up with Bane and Moralo Eval and eventually crashed into the swamps of Nal Hutta. The three of them had to travel to Bilbousa Bazaar and get themselves a spacecraft to flee the planet. Even though they were pursued by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Padawan Ahsoka Tano, they successfully left the planet and landed on Orondia.\n\nIn the final days of the Clone Wars, the former Sith apprentice Maul visited Nal Hutta alongside his brother Savage Opress and the Shadow Collective. Their mission was to persuade the Hutt Council to join them. Regrettably, the Council rejected their offer, leading to a fierce battle scene. Despite the Hutts managing to escape, Maul and his group were able to seize Oruba, who told them that Jabba Desilijic Tiure was present on Tatooine. The Shadow Collective killed Oruba before leaving for Tatooine.\n\n","meta":{"index":4,"author":"Karrykaren","name":"Nal Hutta","release_year":2023}},"Pagodon":{"content":"# Overview\nPagodon is a planet situated in the Mid Rim, notable for its captivating geographical features.

However, as the Age of the Empire dawned, the Galactic Empire seized control over Jelucan, annexing it into their domain. Notably, this planet served as the birthplace of Thane Kyrell and Ciena Ree, two individuals caught in a fateful love affair that found them on opposing sides of the Galactic Civil War.# Description\nJelucan, a cold and rocky planet in the Outer Rim Territories, was inhabited by two distinct communities: the valley dwellers known as the First Wavers and the more affluent second wave settlers in urban centers like Valentia. Mutual distrust existed between these communities, with the second wavers looking down on the valley dwellers and vice versa. Jelucan was also home to non-sentient muunyak species and prized resources like Jelucani fogstone. Ridgecrawlers were commonly used for transportation due to the planet's rugged terrain.\n\n# History\nJelucan's history spans several centuries, beginning with the arrival of the First Wavers around 511 BBY. These exiles settled on the planet, maintaining their allegiance to their king despite arriving in a state of poverty. Approximately 350 years later, a second wave of settlers arrived and established profitable mining operations, considering the traditions of the initial settlers to be outdated. The second wave settlers amassed wealth and power, while the First Wavers remained impoverished. During the Clone Wars, Jelucan aligned itself with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However, following the end of the war, the planet gained independence until it was annexed by the Galactic Empire in 11 BBY. A grand ceremony, attended by Grand Moff Tarkin, marked the Empire's presence on Jelucan. During this event, Thane Kyrell, a noble from the second wave settlers, and Ciena Ree, a valley-dweller, were befriended by Tarkin and encouraged to join the Imperial Navy upon reaching maturity. While only a few Jelucan residents were recruited due to their former allegiance with the Separatists, the Empire favored the more populous Inner Rim worlds for its cadet recruitment. As time passed, the native muunyak species gave way to Imperial-introduced ridgecrawlers, becoming the prevalent mode of transportation on Jelucan. Thane and Ciena, having fulfilled their dream of joining the Imperial Navy, graduated from the prestigious Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant shortly before the Battle of Yavin. However, disillusioned by the Empire's oppressive actions, Thane defected to the Rebel Alliance. The planet suffered from heavy pollution due to the Empire's mining activities during the Galactic Civil War. The distinction between the First Wavers and second wave settlers blurred as both groups adopted similar attire. The legislative building of Jelucan also fell under the control of the Imperial Military. Following the Battle of Hoth, Ciena Ree returned to Jelucan to support her falsely accused mother, who had been sentenced to hard labor. Ciena and Thane, despite fighting on opposing sides, reunited and shared a moment of intimacy. During the era of the New Republic, Jelucani fogstone, a local resource, was employed to construct a statue of Senator Bail Organa at the New Republic senatorial complex on Hosnian Prime. Tragically, the statue was destroyed by the Amaxine warriors during the Napkin Bombing in 28 ABY.\n\n","meta":{"index":131,"author":"SkyPanik","name":"Jelucan","release_year":2023}},"Vanquo":{"content":"# Overview\nVanquo was a resource-rich planet most notably mentioned within the Mandalorian Wars. The planet was mountainous in nature, which enabled large-scale mining operations. Major settlements contained a substantial civilian population. The rest of the planet was dominated by mines, which made these areas a target for refugees who would plunder the mining stores out of desperation. Vanquo had a refugee problem in the early Mandalorian Wars as the planet was something of a safe haven for those affected by the conflict. Vanquo would eventually be a target of the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, where it would be successfully conquered.# History\nVanquo is worthy of recognition for its role in the Mandalorian Wars. The planet was one of the first worlds within the Core that was contested by Mandalore. The threat of conquest forced the Galactic Republic to form the Jebble-Vanquo-Tarnith line. The early Mandalorian Wars would see heavy combat take place on this line, however it would not advance past a stalemate. This was until a diversion tactic involving paratroopers seizing mining installments was used. This caused the Jebble-Vanquo-Tarnith line to be broken.

Additionally, Mygeeto had two moons orbiting it and a breathable atmosphere alongside one sun called Malola.# History\nMygeeto was controlled by the intergalactic banking clan alongside the Confederacy of Independent systems. Before the beginning of the Clone Wars, this planet was researched by pantoran scientist Cuata. However, Mygeeto would soon be in danger causing Tee Watt Kaa’s Lurmen tribe to abandon it in order to avoid any bloodshed. The third battle of Mygeeto began in 19 BBY during the Clone Wars era which was a conflict between the Confederacy of Independent systems and the Galactic Republic. During this conflict, General Grievous brought a group of separatist droids and was assisted by Colonel Coburn Sear who had previously escaped being captured by the Republic.

It contained two moons that orbited the star named Dromund and are located between the planets Jaguada and Brothsida, should an individual take the Kamat Krote hyperspace route. Its atmosphere is so heavily charged and dependent on electricity, that lightning became constant ever since the Sith Emperor arrived and began conducting experiments with the Dark Side of the Force. These experiments also led to Kaas being surrounded by dark side energy, making its temples have strong force nexuses. Although it contains a wet and humid climate, the atmosphere is quite stable and breathable for its inhabitants.# Environment |\nDuring the Great Hyperspace War against the Galactic Republic, Kaas was only covered with jungles and oceans. This changed when the Sith Empire arrived on the planet in 4980 BBY, where they fought against the vicious fauna and tamed the jungles to establish a society. After that, the capital Kaas City and other locations were created, whilst the vast majority of the planet’s environment remained in jungles, oceans, and swamps. \n\nCenturies after the Galactic War, Dromund Kaas’ jungles began to disappear while swamps and marshes began to increase; therefore submerging the majority of the planet’s ground. This led to massive dark-wooded trees growing in the swamps and further led to the formation of canyon-like groupings that grew infested with lizard-like creatures.\n\n# Capital of the Sith Empire |\nOriginally, Dromund Kaas was a Sith colonized planet, where Sorzus Syn was known to commonly visit while the Empire controlled it in 5,000 BBY. During this period, Kaas’ location was lost and therefore abandoned by the Sith. \n\nOnce the Great Hyperspace Wars ended, Vitiate ordered his followers to locate a planet that can be used as a haven for the damaged Sith Empire. This led to Dromund Kaas’ rediscovery, as Vitiate manipulated the remaining followers of the Empire into a twenty-year-long pilgrimage that ended in 4,980 BBY, where thanks to Vitiate’s “advice”, Kaas was “discovered”. \n\nOnce at Kaas’ surface, Vitiate rebuilt the Sith Empire as its leader, swearing that he will take revenge against the Galactic Republic due to the Great Hyperspace War’s aftermath. With the help of his Dark Council, they conquered Dromund Kaas and established their new homeworld, and began improving their overall strength & power.\n\n# Fall of the Empire |\nIn 3,640 BBY, the Dromund Kaas Operation mission was carried out by the Jedi Order, to create a diversion so that the Jedi Hero and his companions could infiltrate the planet’s capital and kill the Emperor. When landing in the Dark Temple–a site where spirits were housed and where Emperor Vitiate conducted his experiments–the Hero turned the mission into a success, by killing the Emperor’s Voice and forcing Vitiate into hibernation. This outcome made the Dark Council take full leadership of the Sith Empire; under the command of Darth Marr. \n\nKaas’ leadership was once again jeopardized when the Eternal Empire of Zakuul was founded and invaded Dromund Kaas. This prompted the fall of the Dark Council; however, Darth Acina was the sole survivor of this invasion and took the mantle of Empress, seeing as no sith was able to surpass her power. \n\nAfter Empress Vaylin of the Eternal Empire was assassinated in 3,630 BBY, the Eternal Fleet began a bombardment with the sole purpose of eradicating all life within the galaxy. Dromund Kaas was one of the planets affected by this incident and was highly damaged after the events.\n\n# Inhabitants\nBefore the Sith arrived at Kaas, it was an abandoned planet that lacked sentient life-forms; though filled with a surplus of flora. This changed when the Sith arrived and used the planet as their homeworld. However, the planet still felt empty, as the humanoid inhabitants confined themselves into their cities and temples; which is mostly shown when the Prophets of the Dark Side took control of Kaas.\n\nDue to Kaas being constantly abandoned and “rediscovered”, barely anyone within the galaxy knew of its existence which is mostly the reason why there is not a big number of inhabitants.\n\n","meta":{"index":129,"author":"RavMalvern","name":"Dromund Kaas","release_year":2022}},"Dantooine":{"content":"# Overview\nLocated in the Raioballo Sector, Dantooine was a terrestrial planet that was ruled under a largely Imperial rule, though also having a past with the Galactic Republic.

Dantooine has a history in eras like the Clone Wars, the Galactic Civil War, and the Rise of the First Order. Despite its prominent appearances in history, Dantooine was not a well-developed planet and had a low population. This is due to its stagnant position in the galaxy and its lack of useful resources.# Terrain and Planetary Features\nDantooine was an extremely grass-filled planet with lots of natural features. It was a beautiful planet with features like rivers, hills, plains, and lakes. It was a dense planet with a dry climate. Dantooine was home to many animals, and a large number of plants, specifically Blba trees, allowed many herbivores to thrive. Although it has an extremely dry climate, it has a short wet season that brings massive rainstorms, often causing fertile soil to run off and tinting the brown grass into a purple shade. Just a few of the animals you might find on Dantooine include Stalker Lizard, Graul, and Kath Hound. Unfortunately, the animal population would decline as many of the animals were captured as guards or pets.\n\n# Brief Overview of History\nDuring the Clone Wars era, Dantooine hosted mainly small farmers who utilized the fertile soil. During the war, though, the Confederacy of Independent Systems arrived on Dantooine in search of ancient artifacts. The Galactic republic did not buy this claim, and in rebellion sent Mace Windu and his legion to respond. It was a close fight, but despite Windu losing many of his soldiers, he still achieved victory in the end.\n\n\nDuring the massive war with the Resistance, the First Order occupied a blockade on Dantooine. Venisa Dose, the Resistance Commander, sent out a squad to invade the blockade and destroy their TIE Fighter fleet. Three Resistance Shuttles attempted to meet up, but were ambushed by a fleet of First Order Fighters. Only two managed to escape, but as they went off-planet, one of the Shuttles was destroyed by a TIE Fighter pilot.\n\n","meta":{"index":46,"author":"ShokuPurpose","name":"Dantooine","release_year":2022}},"Celegia":{"content":"# Description\nLocated in the Expansion Region (area between Inner and Mid Rims), Celegia was a world apart of both the Galactic Republic and the Empire at different eras in time. The cyanogen gas that filled the planet’s airspace acted as regular oxygen to the natives of the world, which were sentient beings known as Celegians. Sea water encompassed a majority of this planet’s surface, with harsh currents that created tides over most of the land. Since the Celegia system was in The Slice portion of the Expansion Region, it was connected to both the Virujansi and Belasco systems through hyperlanes.# History\nBy 17,000 BBY Celegia finally was associated with the Galactic Republic. Controlled by the Grand Companies, which were conglomerates of trading connected with Coruscant, Celegia had no major power over their Belasco system hyperlane. The Grand Companies were primarily located on the Spin hyperlane, which was around the Core Worlds. Additional routes like one leading to Virujansa were contested and fought for by other factions or sometimes even remained neutral. Due to conflicts between the Alsakan planet and the Republic’s Coruscant over natural resource control, it began conflict within these Celegia hyperlane routes. Between 22-19 BBY, the Fourth Sector Army was tasked with fighting around Celegia against the CIS military army. However, by 17 BBY the system became a fully-fledged asset to the Galactic Empire. The Yuuzhan Vong on their conquest of power eventually conquered the Celegia System around 27 ABY.\n\n# Inhabitants\nCelegians primarily breathed their home planet’s toxic gas and required a specific life support chamber in order to properly intake gas on oxygen-ridden worlds. The toxic gas located in the Celegia atmosphere was a deterrent for other species' arrival as they could not ingest it. These mind-reading jellyfish-like beings evolved and utilized an organic locomotion method of levitation, allowing floatation while in the air. Although Celegians are unable to breathe oxygen as it is poisonous to them, they were able to form a well-developed settlement on the cyanogenic moon of Tramanos. Between 10-100 million Celegians lived on their planet during the approximate year of 25 ABY.\n\n","meta":{"index":126,"author":"purebourne","name":"Celegia","release_year":2023}},"Makeb":{"content":"# Overview\nMakeb is an oceanic planet located on the fringes of Hutt space. Its surface is riddled with stone pillars, plains, and many cave systems. Makeb’s low gravity allows for the formation of the large stone pillars and intricate cave systems, which many of the planet's native creatures use as shelter. These cave systems are also home to many mineral deposits from which many people on Makeb claim their wealth. One of these minerals, Isotope-5, is an extremely valuable and rare mineral and was the reason for the Hutt invasion in the year 3638 BBY, who used the mineral for the creation of powerful war droids, weapons, and shields.# Early History\nMakeb was first discovered sometime during the Mandalorian Wars when refugees on a Republic Transport Ship crashed onto the planet's surface. These refugees, led by businessman Semako Thalien, built settlements on top of Makeb’s stone pillars and explored its surface, discovering many mineral deposits. Over time, the settlers would begin to mine these deposits, and the planet, as well as the early settlers, became extremely wealthy once communication was established with the rest of the galaxy. For much of its known history, Makeb remained independent from the Republic and was filled with prosperity and much economic investment from foreign corporations and wealthy business people. Much of the planet's prosperity can be attributed to the Avesta Family, who played a major role in establishing a government and creating trade deals between the Hutts and Republic. The planet boomed in tourism and the Capital, Talaos City, became an economic and cultural center for the people of Makeb.\n\n# Hutt Invasion\nIn 3638 BBY, taking advantage of the Republic’s war with the Sith Empire, the Hutt Cartel invaded Makeb. The defensive forces of Makeb, made up entirely of the Interstellar Regulator's mercenaries, were bought off by the Hutt Cartel and the planet was easily conquered. Following the invasion, the Republic came to the aid of the planet after many of its leaders agreed to join the Republic and was able to push the Hutts off of the planet. Unfortunately, the Hutt's invasion also came with increased mining, destabilizing the planet's core, and, believing that the planet was lost, the Republic evacuated the planet. However, during the invasion, the empire had secretly worked to stabilize the planet's core in hopes of mining Isotope-5. While the Empire's efforts did not prevent the planet from becoming inhospitable, they were able to continue mining Isotope-5 for their own agenda and were able to keep the Republic unaware of their continued mining on the planet.\n\n","meta":{"index":47,"author":"24dino","name":"Makeb","release_year":2022}},"Eadu":{"content":"# Introduction\nEadu was a planet located in the Outer Rim.

It housed a significant droid construction facility underground. Following the Clone Wars, the Galactic Empire occupied Akiva, with the Satrapy of Myrra collaborating with the new rulers. In the aftermath of the Battle of Endor, the remnants of the Empire convened above Akiva to regroup and plan an attack against the New Republic. However, the summit failed, resulting in the Rebellion on Akiva in space. As the Imperial leaders fled for safety, the citizens of Akiva joined forces to overthrow the Satrapy of Myrra and the Empire. This successful battle marked Akiva as the first Outer Rim planet to align with the New Republic. Later on, in 34 ABY, Akiva pledged its allegiance to the rising First Order.# Description\nAkiva, located in the Outer Rim Territories, was a hot and humid planet known for its thunderous storms and frequent rainfall. The city of Myrra, Akiva's capital, had unique features like \"storm ladders\" to swiftly evacuate people during flash floods. The planet's surface boasted jungles, canyons, and narrow streets navigated by the bala-bala speeders. Beneath Myrra's sprawling cityscape lay ancient catacombs inhabited by the primitive Uugteen species. Legends surrounded these catacombs, with rumors of a Jedi training temple, Sith traps, or Hutt breeding grounds. Only a few individuals survived encounters with the Uugteen. Additionally, remnants of a Separatist droid factory from the Clone Wars were discovered in the catacombs. In the past, Akiva was home to the Ahia-Ko, an ancient species that constructed magnificent temples in the planet's jungle wilderness. The Ahia-Ko believed the water in the canyons possessed purifying qualities, capable of cleansing sins and improving one's character. The water from these canyons was highly valued by members of the Satrapy of Myrra, including Satrap Isstra Dirus.\n\n# History\nDuring the Clone Wars, Akiva aligned with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, housing a Separatist droid factory in the catacombs of the city Myrra. With the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Satrapy of Myrra ruled Akiva indirectly on behalf of the Empire, fostering corruption and a thriving black market. The Karyvin clan, an aristocratic family, held significant influence on the planet. Amidst the Imperial Era, Brentin Lore Wexley was imprisoned on Kashyyyk while his wife, Norra Wexley, joined the Rebel Alliance. The crime lord Surat Nuat established a presence in Myrra. Following the Battle of Endor, Norra and her allies orchestrated a successful uprising on Akiva, capturing members of the Imperial Future Council. This led to the Satrapy switching sides, and Akiva became the first Outer Rim planet to officially align with the New Republic. In the years that followed, Pima Drolley became Akiva's senator in the New Republic, and Brentin Lore Wexley was buried in accordance with Akivan customs. As the First Order emerged, an emergency election resulted in the appointment of a sympathetic merchant as the new governor of Akiva.\n\n","meta":{"index":59,"author":"SkyPanik","name":"Akiva","release_year":2023}},"Mustafar":{"content":"# Introduction |\nMustafar is a planet that orbits the Mustafar System located at the Outer Rim.

It was also a place where individuals disposed of evidence they did not wish the public to see; which is something that drew the Black Sun Syndicate’s attention and prompted its habituation & usage. Mustafar was known for being the Separatist’s last capital before their official defeat; an incident that affected the course of history. This planet was where Darth Maul began his training with Darth Sidious and where Obi-Wan Kenobi fought against the newly titled Darth Vader, where the Sith Lord was severely burnt and severed.# History |\nMustafar was previously not a planet filled with volcanic components. It was a beautiful green planet that housed a Jedi Enclave that was built in 5,300 BBY. During this time, Jedi Master Chu-Gon Dar developed a sentient artifact known as the Chu-Gon Dar cube, where its user could harness, use and alter the physical Force. Unfortunately, the planet’s beauty and harmony did not last long, as Sith invaded Mustafar in 3,996 BBY to exterminate all inhabiting Jedi. This led to the Battle of Mustafar; one of the many conflicts within the Great Sith War, in which a gas giant was pulled into the atmosphere and caused environmental hazards, and forced the Jedi to abandon their Enclave.\n\nMany years later, a dangerous eruption destroyed almost all Mustafarian settlements, as well as its overall green environment; therefore transforming it into the volcanic planet it currently is.\n\n# Inhabitants\nThe planet of Mustafar was inhabited by the Mustafarians; a species of sentient insectoids. The Mustafarians were divided into two different subspecies, which were the following: Northern Mustafarians–the tallest and thinnest– and the Southern Mustafarians–smallest and roughest–. Due to their physical appearances, both subspecies contained different roles in society. Aside from the Mustafarians, factions like the Black Sun, the Blackguard, and the Sith often inhabited Mustafar but were isolated within their structures.\n\n","meta":{"index":14,"author":"RavMalvern","name":"Mustafar","release_year":2022}},"Asation":{"content":"# Asation\nAsation was a major port world that belonged to the Gree Enclave, which was home to the Caste of Crafters of the Gree.

During the early years of the Galactic Empire, Lothal was currently in a state of economic neglect and offered a deal for the Empire to take full ownership of the planet’s industries, at the cost of the promise of security and riches. The citizens of Lothal had many doubts and worries about the Empire taking over planet Lothal and instead attempted an insurgency which failed. Around 5 BBY when Lothal was growing in success due to the Empire’s reign over the planet, Lothal had become a nesting ground for the Spectres, a small group of republic alliance rebels that operated the Starship Ghost. After persistently attacking the Imperial forces and impeding Imperial activities for a year or more, they eventually caught the attention of Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin, however, they were unsuccessful in eliminating the rebels. Darth Vader manufactured a blockade on the planet, but the rebels of the Spectres slipped through these blockades and regrouped with the alliance. \n\nAfter the rebellion, events that had occurred would also spark up a prison revolt which led to the escape of numerous prisoners, including the former governor Ryder Azadi who was discharged and arrested due to treason, he would then proceed to activate another rebel cell on Lothal before continuing his escape. The Imperial blockade has become an uncertain situation and caused severe obstacles for Princess Leia Organa to embark on a mercy mission to Lothal. However, this mission was a deception for Princess Organa to deliver ships to the rebellion. Now in 2 BBY, the rebellion made Ryder Azadi’s successor, governor Arihnda Pryce formally request Grand Admiral Thrawn and his Seventh Fleet to arrive on planet Lothal to support the Empire with the ongoing rebellion at hand. Ryder Azadi’s efforts in demolishing Imperial vehicles around the Imperial Armory have drawn Grand Admiral Thrawn’s attention.   \n\nDuring 1 BBY, planet Lothal was under constant heavy Imperial blockade and employment, with her once immaculate environment ruined and on the verge of collapsing. Nearly all traces of natural resources had been strictly removed from the planet. Immense pollution covering the planet started becoming visible from orbit. Although the will of resistance remained, the planet was under Imperial control and those who remained and had not joined the Empire by free will were either forcefully deployed into service or executed. This chaos created the opportunity for a group of rebels under the leadership of the Spectres to make a daring move which managed to eradicate the Imperial presence on and around Lothal. For some time, the planet’s citizens lived out of fear and concern that the Empire one day might return to claim it once again, but the Empire was now disrupted by the Rebel Alliance and Lothal remained as a world with freedom for the rest of the Galactic Civil War.\n\nAround 35 ABY, planet Lothal was now directly under the control of the First Order, the Galactic Empire’s successor.

With time, Arkanians became well-known for their wealth and wisdom. The ancient capital Adascopolis, served as the home of The Adascan Bio-Mechanical Corporation of Arkania, a corporation with a controlling interest in the planet and run by the House of Adasca.  As 6900 BBY came, the Sith Empire overthrew Arkanians, taking over their planet. They installed a Sith Library on the planet. As centuries passed, the archives kept going, with each moment containing more dark knowledge. When the Dark Lord of the Sith, Naga Shadow was exiled, the Jedi found out about the Sith on Arkania.

These natural formations provided the Muuns with an almost inexhaustible source of wealth, used to guarantee credits across the galaxy. At their arrival, It was an unbalance world due to the terrain and the 2 moons.# Culture\nThe Muuns were famous for their incredible intelligence in financial and mathematical matters, but they also had the reputation of being greedy people. Muuns usually looked at other species as hot-tempered and immature, and so they didn’t feel much guilt when exploiting them. They were highly competitive, both among themselves and among other races, living in a society based on rigid castes, with the higher ups being lawyers, financiers, engineers and diplomats. The common Muuns usually weren't able to leave their home planet, as upward mobility was limited to only the most intelligent people of the common Muuns. Despite their enormous greed, they respected fairness and regarded contracts as almost sacred.\n\n# Locations\nThe most important Muun city was Harnaidan, headquarters of the InterGalactic Banking Clan and capital of the planet. It was built around a series of spires, and had a population of more than 50 million.

The city was unfortunately leveled for the most part during the Clone Wars. A skyhook connected Harnaidan with High Port Space Center. Mariunhus was a very important and rich city of Muunilinst, built around a smoker rich in platinum, gold and other precious metals. It was considered a “vault-spire”, a safe source of wealth, which could be mined whenever needed to produce credits. Other smokers were considered “mine-spires” and used for industrial metals.\n\n# History\nOnce the Muuns achieved their independence from Rakata during the Infinite Empire, they established themselves on Muunilinst, and at first founded an economy based around farming and fishing. As interstellar travel became more popular though, the Muuns started to utilize the natural resources and precious metals of Muunilinst for trading, with the planet even becoming a rival for Coruscant itself. They founded a large number of trade guilds, colonies and corporations along the Braxant Run. At some point, they even colonized the very wealthy planet of Mygeeto, which would be used as a financial center. Once Muunilinst became part of the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Credit Standard was established, the InterGalactic Banking Clan, founded by the Muuns, became its major guarantor, producer and distributor. During the Clone Wars, Muunilinst aided both the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems financially, but the InterGalactic Banking Clan, controlled by San Hill, was mainly backing the Separatists, so the Muuns asked the Republic for help, causing horrible battles to take place. During the battle of Muunilinst in 22 BBY, the Republic took back hold of the planet, devastating however the majority of Muun infrastructure and screwing over their economy, bringing the galaxy on the brink of financial ruin. Sometime later, Muunilinst came back in the hands of the Separatists. During the era of the Galactic Empire, the planet was under direct supervision of the Empire, and although it wasn’t destroyed like other factions such as the CIS, its business operations were hampered by harsh Imperial decrees and the presence of Imperial monitors throughout its institutions. During the years of the New Republic, Muunilinst was still part of the Imperial Remnant, but nobody was able to attack them without destabilizing the Imperial credit.

The sands that covered the landscape had no use for the dwellers and were native to aggressive creatures like the Womp rat and Krayt dragon species. Those who chose to journey on through the deserts often used Dewbacks. A prominent city was Prosir, home to the Fungus Hotel and a spaceport, inviting traders of the galaxy.

The two species could co-exist due to the two separate biospheres - the forested surface world, and a second underground world, formed by the action of water, plate tectonics, and the deep burrowing roots of the arbozoic trees native to the world. The two sentient species were also kept apart due to their differing respiratory needs, each finding the atmosphere in the other's environment toxic to their biology. Very few have ever explored the Kindalo's dark world, and few if any records exist of it. Aleen's surface world, on the other hand, is a nature lover's paradise.# Section 1\nOver sixty percent of the planet is covered in forests, from cold forests of pines and other conifers near the poles to warm rainforests near the equator. Many species of herbivores and their predators roam these forests where the native Aleena evolved their renowned dexterity partly to avoid becoming a meal for these large carnivores. One peculiarity of the planet's terrain is that the land gently slopes from pole to equator, resulting in massive river systems and small oceans girding the planet. The plains of central Aleen are where the capital city, Reunion, is located, and the area of the planet most familiar to visitors.\n\n# Section 2\nHistorically, Aleen was part of the Infinite Empire with its fierce and warlike servants of the Empire. The Aleena built towering monoliths for their masters and the various religions they followed at the time. The remains of these monumental constructions still dot the planet's surface today. In the past, Aleen was much more urbanized than it is today. However, following a long war between the two sentient species native to the planet that almost wiped out both species, the Aleena dismantled many of their cities and returned to a more pastoral lifestyle.

Fondor was a planet that was the site of two Rebel Alliance attacks against the Empire, which resulted in Imperial defeat. Following the formation of the Galactic Empire, Fondor became a large manufacturing center, with its shipyards being equally on par with Scarif and Kuat. Imperial Citizens, scientists, and officers that occupied Fondor became loyal to the Empire. The Empire used this Shipyard notably as Imperial research and development of classified technologies.  The Resistance came to Fondor requesting assistance but they refused. Later, the shipyards were then seized by the First Order during the First Order/Resistance War. The First Order sought out for the Resistance, trying to locate any trace of their whereabouts. Despite being loyal to the Empire in the past, history of independence, and denial of helping the Resistance, they refused to give any information about the Resistance to the First Order, resulting in the death of a Fondor official under charges of treason.

Its community was made up of many species, such as the Phillak, along with being the homeworld of the Zeffonians, an ancient sentinel race. However, when the Galactic Empire was founded, a large part of the planet was ravaged due to the Emperor’s greed for valuable knowledge.# History\nAt first, Zeffo was a planet inhabited only by the Zeffo species (or Zeffonians), who left behind many tombs, statues and relics mainly dedicated to the Zeffo Sages, prominent members of the species who were proficient in the Force.

Its oceans and lands were saturated with sodium salt, forming white salt flats over its red rhodochrosite soil, such as the Nupayuni salt flats. Salt and minerals would be mined and traded for profit by a Q’ltane individual, Trusk Berinato. The landscape was also outlined by mountains and canyons. Inhabited by non-sentient species, the world was home to various fauna and flora adapted to survive the blinding midday sun against the shiny surface crystals and crystalstorms that ensued. The elusive Vulptix species, known for their crystalline spine coat, would dig beneath the salt occasionally brewed, where small mammals and the Tuber plants they fed on lived. Still, the Vulptix fell prey to other carnivorous species. Waterways ran across the mineral terrain, with briny seas underneath, presumably apt for aquatic life.# Imperial Era\nWith the advent of the Galactic Empire, a secret base was established by the early Rebel Alliance to serve as a strategic stronghold that occasionally infiltrated Imperial facilities. In 3 BBY, the Alliance attacked the Calderos Station in the Mid Rim to diminish the Imperial presence in the sector and to conceal import records for Crait. Yet, the Crait outpost was abandoned within the next three years. Later, Leia Organa and Han Solo, prominent leaders within the Alliance, journeyed to the world to find a new location for a base. However, they were met with hostility and deception when Berinato, in charge of mining droids within the Mines of Crait and assigned to do so by the Nupayuni Mining Consortium, lured them into the mines for the Empire’s Task Force 99 to detain. The Alliance fought off the intruders successfully but they deemed Crait an unwise choice for a new base.\n\n# First Order-Resistance War\nAfter the destruction of the First Order’s Starkiller Base by the Resistance in 34 ABY, the remnants of the Resistance sought refuge on Crait. This consequently sparked the Battle of Crait, a major conflict between the two factions that showcased their respective technologies, but the Resistance defence had weakened to the point of near defeat. This remained the case until Jedi Master Luke Skywalker appeared before their enemy using Force projection. This distraction allowed the survivors to escape through the cave system and be saved by the crew of the Millennium Falcon.

The planet was covered in a thick fog while the “Bridge Cities” of the planet were built and suspended above the oceans of the planet which were naturally acidic. The reason these cities were called “Bridge Cities” is because they were suspended with bridges on the naturally forming giant rock arches and formations on which many of the fauna, along with biomes like grasslands and forests would thrive on.# Section 1\nCato Neimoidia first joined the Galactic Republic somewhere about 25 millenia before the Battle of Yavin meaning they have been a long time member of the republic. By the High Republic Era, Cato Neimoidia solidified itself when their Opera House rose to fame, this in turn increased traffic to and from the planet leading to an increase in tourists, profits, etc. This happened because shortly after the First Emergence, a Nihil Tempest Runner called Pan Eyta, suggested they should take time away from raids and he pondered about whether he should visit the Opera House of Cato Neimoidia.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, multiple battles and events occurred such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker getting into some feuds with Anakin saving Obi-Wan, which happened sometime in 22 BBY. Also during the Clone Wars, the Trade Federation signed over a couple holdings including this planet to the Intergalactic Banking Clan in order to loan money for purchasing equity in a new droid factory. Despite this, the Neimoidians managed to continue their control with the Headquarters remaining on Cato Neimoidia. After this there were multiple battles occurring between the Separatists and the Galactic Republic on the planet with control of it, switching between the two sides on multiple occasions until the war was over.\n\nFollowing the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Empire created a garrison on the planet in order to keep it there as a protectorate and therefore reducing the Trade Federation to a puppet of the Empire. Finally, nearly 28 years after the Battle of Yavin, a race known as “The Gauntlet” settled on Cato Neimoidia, and because of that, during the Cold War, the Resistance had to launch a mission to save Lor San Tekka.\n\n# Section 2\nCato Neimoidia, as previously stated, was a purse world of the Neimoidians, a wealthy species originating from their homeworld of Neimoidia, not to be confused with the topic of this article as Cato Neimoidia and Neimoidia are two separate planets. The Neimoidians operated the Trade Confederation which was once one of the biggest and wealthiest corporations in the known galaxy, where Cato Neimoidia actually housed the headquarters of said corporation.

Mandalore is the homeplanet of the group known as Mandalorians, calling their planet Manda’yaim in their language and being the primarily sentient group to populate the planet. Mandalore's surface is covered in different biomes, having different kinds of forest, jungles, deserts of white sand, and also different lakes, rivers and seas, with the addition of being the only known planet alongside the Concordia moon, to reside within the unique ore known as Beskar.# Early History\nBefore the Mandalorians came to Mandalore to occupy the planet, Mandalore was dominated by the beasts known as Mythosaurs, enormous beasts with a great physical capability, without any sign of a sentient species populating the planet. When the Taung warriors, a sentient species, alongside the Mandalorian warriors reached the planet of Mandalore under the rule of Mandalore the First, they killed most of the Mythosaurs while also tamed many of them, being able to rule over the whole planet of Mandalore. After conquering and establishing in Mandalore, they named the planet in their language Manda’yaim, or also as “Home of the Mand’alor”, therefore obtaining the common name of Mandalore. The planet was mainly inhabited by multiple Mandalorian clans, who were all ruled by a Mandalore, being the supreme leader of Mandalore, however, after they conquered Mandalore, they were not satisfied after conquering only one planet, so under the rule of Mandalore the Indomitable, the Mandalorian clans and Taung warriors began the Mandalorian crusades or also known as the Mandalorian war, trying to conquer different star systems, leaving the planet of Mandalore mostly abandoned.\n\n# Post-war Era\nAfter the Mandalorians lost the Mandalorian war when Mandalore the Indomitable died against the Jedi Knight Revan, some Mandalorians came back to Mandalore in devastation due to the lost war, and so Mandalore began to be populated once more by Mandalorians. Some time after the war, a great plague known as the Candorian Plague, infected Mandalore and made it a great victim of the plague, becoming the planet devastated by the plague. Due to the Mandalorian war being lost, and the plague affecting the whole of Mandalore and its sector, it transformed into a weakened planet often being attacked by outlaws and bandits, being Mandalore in a crisis scenario. This time period of crisis lasted until Aga Awaud, a veteran mercenary returned to Mandalore in the year 1058 BBY, and when he saw the weak state of Mandalore, he took the position of Mand’alore to call upon all the Mandalorians over the galaxy to overcome the crisis and reform Mandalore as a whole, therefore becoming known as “Mand’alore the Uniter”.\nWhen Aga Awaud reformed the whole of Mandalore and its sector  began to increase in military and technological power, becoming a very powerful group that threatened the Galactic Republic, in fear of suffering a second Mandalorian war. \nDue to this, in the year 738 BBY, the Galactic Republic and the Jedi devastated in a strike force in the reformed parts of Mandalore, being called the Mandalorian Excision or Dral’han, which meant annihilation, this lead to Mandalore and the Mandalorians to begin a era of devastation where parts of Mandalore became inhabitable to reside in.\n\n# New Era\nAfter the devastation of the Mandalorian Excision, many Mandalorians began to endure a more “pacifist” regime, calling themselves “New Mandalorians”.\nThis political movement in Mandalore began to deny the warrior codes and the violence past of Mandalore, this led to a part of the Mandalorians to separate from Mandalore due to the new regime to deny the warrior codes that the Mandalorians followed for generations. This led to the creation of the “Old Mandalorians” who followed the warrior codes like the past Mandalorians, while the “New Mandalorians” were a more peaceful group dedicated to their advancement of technology and to grow in Mandalore. Many of the Old Mandalorians became mercenaries and bounty hunters across the galaxy, but some decided to change the regime of the New Mandalorians and formed the group known as Death Watch to overthrow the regime of the New Mandalorians. This led to an era of constant inner wars between the clans of the Mandalorians, some followed the ideals of the Death Watch, while other clans refused them, begging for an inner fight between the different clans, although the regime of the New Mandalorians stayed out of the conflict.\n\n# Clone Wars Era\nDuring the Clone Wars, Mandalore stayed neutral during the conflict, however the Death Watch which remained hidden after the wars between clans, decided to act again, but in Mandalore in hopes of overthrowing the current government ruled by the New Mandalorians in hopes of bringing Mandalore back to the times of conquest and violence. This was secretly supported by Count Dooku in hopes of making Death Watch to conquer Mandalore and join the Separatists in the Clone Wars, this made Death Watch to constantly attack the political figures of Mandalore by terrorist attacks, recruiting Mandalorian citizens of Mandalore and so on… This eventually led to the Death Watch overthrowing the Duchess and its council of ministers, taking over Mandalore with the help of Darth Maul and its apprentice Opress. After taking over Mandalore, the new leader of Mandalore and leader of Death Watch, Pre Vizsla, betrayed their Sith allies Darth Maul and Opress to gain full control over Mandalore, however the Sith Lords anticipated this and after the betrayal, Darth Maul challenged Pre Vizsla to a one on one combat to gain the rule of Mandalore, wich Darth Maul won.\nAfter Darth Maul took over Mandalore, a fraction of Death Watch decided to not follow Maul and wanted to overthrow him from the throne, calling the Republic troops with the help of the former Padawan Ashoka Tano, this lead to a battle for Mandalore where members of the Death Watch who opposed to Maul, fought alongside Clone Troopers and Ashoka Tano against Maul troops, eventually capturing Maul and winning the battle in favor of the Death Watch leaded by Bo-Katan, ruling Mandalore.\n\n# Inhabitants\nBeing the first inhabitants, the Taung warriors who conquered alongside Mandalorians Mandalore itself, it became after that a planet who was mainly inhabited by Mandalorians who were human alongside a few Taung. However when the Mandalorian war began and many Mandalorians began to spread across the galaxy, many Mandalorians in Mandalore began to accept also different kinds of races, but the bigger portion of the population in Mandalore were of the human race.\n\n","meta":{"index":11,"author":"bonniealfonsochica","name":"Mandalore","release_year":2023}},"Anaxes":{"content":"# Overview\nAnaxes was a terrestrial planet in the Outer Rim, inhabited by immigrant species. The terrain was partly rocky, lined with canyons and caves that would border forest jungles, hills, and valleys formed from the river bodies over millennia. Indigenous species were largely silicon-based, such as the predatory Fyrnock, which would use towering red trees to hide from the sunlight that hurt them. This particular flora gave a distinct red hue when observed from space. Benefiting from the temperate climate were several grasslands where agriculture could thrive; the Spiral Dumplings delicacy had its roots in these regions. Trade was made possible with Republic shipyards, linking the planet to the Perlemian Trade Route. However, Anaxes was obliterated following a freak accident, believed to be caused by a reactor failure and hypermatter storage in the shipyards, dispersing the planet into an asteroid belt.# History\nIn the heyday of the Republic, Anaxes was a renowned stronghold for Core World defence forces against potential threats along its trade route, housing military bases such as Fort Anaxes. This all changed during the latter years of the Clone Wars.\nThe Confederacy of Independent Systems targeted Anaxes even with their perceived little presence in the galaxy, which surprised the Republic. In 19 BBY, the Separatists collected at a security outpost seized a prominent assembly complex for ships, one of several plans made by a new strategic algorithm provided by the Cyber Center. This technology could turn the tides of the Clone Wars in their favour. In response, the Republic deployed Jedi Generals Mace Windu, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker, alongside clone trooper forces, to reclaim the vital shipyard. However, their efforts were in vain due to a complication - a bomb that could potentially level the entire planet. Yet, Windu was able to deactivate the threat with the assistance of Skywalker and Advanced Recon Commando Echo.\nConsequently, the unsuccessful attempt to capture led to Clone Captain Rex’s suspicions of the droid army’s use of Republic strategy algorithms. Desperate to find the source, his 501st Legion and the unorthodox elite commando squad, Clone Force 99, were ordered to infiltrate the facility of their foe. After storming the outpost, the team was able to locate Cyber Center. It was later revealed that the overseer of the base, Admiral Trench, was using a signal from the planet Skako Minor, transmitted by Echo, who had been captured from the Battle of Lola Sayu by the Techno Union a year prior. Following the Echo’s rescue, the Republic removed much of their enemy from the world.\nThe destruction of Anaxes in the early years of the Empire led to the rocky debris forming an asteroid belt. Some facilities even survived, such as Fort Anaxes, now on PM-1203, and a Separatist stronghold, now on PM-6986. Fort Anaxes saw a new function as a smuggling post for mercenaries and the early Rebellion, while droids on the planetoid PM-6986 were left stranded there.\n\n","meta":{"index":105,"author":"AnimatedEcrux","name":"Anaxes","release_year":2023}},"Ambria":{"content":"# Introduction\nAmbria, also known as Stenness, was a planet located in the Ambria System, in the Stenness Node of the Inner Rim.

This foundation for Sith would see the start and end of many battles, wars, victories, losses, and other forms of discovery as well as ancient history within the Sith for all of its time.# Ancient Times\nIn 27,700 BBY, The Rakata, a humanoid species that was highly advanced in technology would eventually choose to invade the planet of Korriban in hopes of adopting the planet into the Infinite Empire for the purpose of enslaving its beings to do work for Rakatan outlines. Their attempts were futile as they would be excised by the Sith King Adas who forced them to flee with the assistance of his people.

Following the exile of a multitude of Dark Jedi that grew attached and curious with the Dark Side of The Force and its nature, they would flee in search of a planet that harnessed great Dark Side energy, this planet being Korriban. Upon arriving on Korriban, the Dark Jedi demonstrated extreme prowess with the usage of The Force. This would impress the native Sith even the very King that ruled them known as Hakagram Graush.

After the age of 10, the Chiss would have a growth spurt, after which they would be considered full adults by Chiss society. The Chiss middle-age was 51-62, and those aged 63-x were considered old.\n\nIt is believed, however uncertain, that the Chiss might have been a long-forgotten human colony; According to Chiss legends, the planet of Csilla where the original Chiss settled used to be a warm and tropical planet. Csilla would later become locked in an ice age with glacial terrains forming on the planet, this would be the same condition on many of the Chiss planets, and for their survival, they would move underground and form most of their society there. Whilst underground they created technology to stay alive, and eventually, they would turn into a technologically advanced society, the moving underground and exposure to the glacial mineral content of the planet(s) would result in their now known physical shape.\n\nThe Chiss survived by using geothermal energy for power sources, they used the energy to build populous cities and develop a global government for the Chiss people, known as The Chiss Ascendancy. The Chiss species mastered star travel independently, allowing them to expand to planets within Chiss space. Due to the Chiss their expansion, the Chiss Ascendancy became a global government along with the formation of the Chiss Expansionary Defence force; the mission of the Chiss Expansionary Defence Force at that point was primarily exploration. The Chiss would remain an isolated, yet technologically and culturally advanced society located in Chiss space and united under the banner of the Chiss Ascendancy. There would be some outside connection with the Chiss, as they chose to ally or hold connections only with those they considered strong enough, such as the Sith Empire or Galactic Empire; this would result in Chiss being incorporated in their ranks.","meta":{"index":4,"author":"DaedricOtto","name":"Chiss","release_year":2021}},"Celestials":{"content":"# Introduction\nIn the vast expanse of the Force, an unfathomable energy field pervading all existence, existed the Celestials, ancient entities whose essence eluded mortal understanding. Commanding the very fabric of the Force, they took form as the Ones—comprising the Father, the Daughter, and the Son—embodiments of its intricate balance and power.# Section 1\nThe Daughter and the Son, embodiments of the Force's light and dark aspects, respectively, were initially balanced by the Father. However, with the addition of a mortal servant who ascended to become the mother, the father's burden was lessened. Yet, consumed by fear of abandonment among the eternal Ones, the Mother sought immortality through forbidden means. This led to her transformation into Abeloth, a fearsome entity embodying chaos and destruction.\n\nTo contain Abeloth's malevolent influence, the daughter and the son joined forces as the architects. Together, they orchestrated the construction of Centerpoint Station by enlisting the assistance of the Killiks, who were temporarily granted access to the Force. Centerpoint's colossal capabilities were harnessed to create the Corellian system and other celestial phenomena believed to be artifacts of the Celestials. Additionally, they devised the Maw—a prison encircled by black holes—and Sinkhole Station to confine Abeloth, safeguarding the galaxy from her destructive power.\nAmidst the Clone Wars, a pivotal conflict in the eternal struggle between Jedi and Sith, Anakin Skywalker, the prophesied Chosen One destined to restore balance to the Force, found himself drawn to the realm of Mortis. There, he was tempted to assume the role of the Father, a position crucial for upholding cosmic stability. Tragically, the mission ended with the demise of the immortal Ones, victims of the lethal Dagger of Mortis—the sole weapon capable of vanquishing them. With the demise of the Ones and the escalating Jedi-Sith conflicts, the Force is out of balance, paving the way for Abeloth to exploit the ensuing chaos.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Celestials remained shrouded in mystery, with their existence primarily inferred from the enduring monuments they left scattered across the cosmos. Regarded as among the earliest and most influential cultures of their era, they were distinguished by the colossal remnants of their craftsmanship. Despite their mysterious presence, little was definitively known about their identities, fueling speculation and theories regarding their nature. Some believed them to possess a fluid form, while others suggested that they were spiritual entities, possibly assimilated with the Force ages ago, endlessly shaping the galaxy's destiny. Yet another perspective posited them as supernatural intermediaries, wielding powers far beyond mortal comprehension.\nThe Celestials enlisted the aid of the insectoid Killiks from Alderaan, strategically placing them across the Perlemian Trade Route. Alongside the Killiks, other races such as the Gree, Kwa, and Rakata served as subordinates to the Celestials. Together, they embarked on ambitious technological projects, ranging from constructing entire star systems to manipulating hyperspace phenomena.\n\nThe Celestials were renowned for their numerous projects in the vicinity of Corellia, Kessel, and other locations within the eastern galactic parts. Among their notable accomplishments were the construction of the Corellian system, the Vultar system, the Hapes Cluster, the Kathol Rift, and the formidable Maw black-hole cluster.\n\n# Section 3\nAround 35,000 BBY, the once-dominant Celestials saw their reign challenged as the Rakata slave race revolted. Despite the Celestials' attempts to contain them, the Rakata broke through their defenses and launched a brutal campaign of extermination. According to ancient texts from the Gree Enclave, the Rakata, referred to as the \"Soul Hunters,\" unleashed curses upon the Celestials, known as the \"Gray Swallowing\" and the \"Hollowers of Beings.\" These curses were said to render the Celestials powerless, earning the Rakata ominous nicknames like the \"Faceless Mouths\" and \"Eaters of Worlds.\" \nBy 30,000 BBY, the Celestials vanished from the galaxy, with the Rakatan Infinite Empire rising to prominence. Similarly, the Killiks disappeared, migrating beyond the Unknown Regions, possibly at the command of the Celestials. \n\nThe destiny of the Celestials remained shrouded in mystery. Some suggested they were ensnared within the galaxy by their defensive measures, annihilated in the Rakatan uprising, or departed from this universe altogether. Darth Plagueis entertained the notion that the Celestials transcended into the Force, manipulating its flow—an idea echoed in both Jedi and Sith lore.\n\nAlthough all evidence of the Celestials had disappeared by 30,000 BBY, The Ones persisted within the realm of Mortis until 20 BBY. Their existence came to an end during a mission undertaken by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano.\n\n","meta":{"index":79,"author":"mummytrie","name":"Celestials","release_year":2024}},"Rancor":{"content":"# Overview\nStanding nearly 5-10 meters, Rancors were semi-sentient reptilian creatures native to the planet Dathomir, but could also be found on other planets such as Felucia and Corulag. However, it should be noted that Rancors from Dathomir were said to be stronger and more intelligent. Known for their violent nature and short temper, many rancors were kept as pets for crime lords, including Jabba the Hutt, and used for entertainment while others found Rancors to be capable mounts or even sources of food.# Appearance\nRancors weighed an average of 1,650 kilograms and had long arms equipped with razor-sharp claws as well as two rather stubby legs and a short tail. Rancors also had flat faces with exceptionally large jaws and sharp teeth which were rather useful for a carnivorous creature like itself. Furthermore, the skin of a Rancor was usually brown colored and heavily armored, capable of withstanding large amounts of blaster fire.\n\n# Biology\nIn contrast to what many believe, Rancors are inherently gentle and can be very loyal and loving to those who treat them well or whom they view as family. They hatched from eggs and rode their mother until they reached maturity. Rancors also adhered to social hierarchies with the alphas being the most dominant of the Rancors.\n\n# Subspecies\nThere are at least 8 known subspecies of Rancors differentiating in both color and size from the original rancors. These are the Bull Rancor, the Felucian Rancor, the Tyrant Rancor, the Gnarled Rancor, the Jungle Rancor, the Rancor pygmy, the Chrysalide Rancor, and the Rancor-Dragon.

Using this ability, the Sith created part machine, part organic hybrids learned as techno beasts. The ability of mechu-deru was practiced by merely a few Sith during this period, driving its mysteries to fade into anonymity. In a later time called the New Sith Wars, a Dark Lord of the Sith by the name of Belia Darzu studied mechu-deru alongside Sith alchemy. With her insight into both, Lord Darzu derived a new technique understood as mechu-deru vitae, using it to convert living beings into technobeasts operating a nano gene virus. \n\nBound to Darzu's intention and infused with the power of the dark side, the technobeasts were developed and accommodated inside a hidden fortress on the planet Tython. Within this fortress, living beings from several other humanoid and non-humanoid races were changed into technobeasts themselves, assembling an army of beasts known as the Metanecrons. In addition, Darzu made a Holocron including her understanding of the techniques used to make the Sithspawn beasts. The techno beasts of Belia Darzu were used against the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order, becoming identified as the signature monstrosity of a two-decade battle known as the Sictis Wars. In battle, the mutated hybrids contaminated other living beings with the nano gene virus, incorporating Darzu's fallen foes into her cyborg army.\n\n# Characterization\nTechnobeasts were described by an infection from the nano gene spore, a techno virus capable of transmuting live tissue into metallic components. Consisting of infinitesimal nano gene droids, the techno virus instinctively pushes toward the brain of the target, lobotomizing their frontal lobe and causing them to be incapable of higher thinking. Once completely altered, most remains of living tissue on the creatures would have eroded away, leaving only small strands of skin and ligament surrounded by metallic scraps, rods, and wires. The conversion also deteriorated the target's vocal cords, causing the techno beasts unable to speak. Due to the inherently experimental nature of the nano gene spore, the form in which the subjects were transformed held varying outcomes, causing all techno beasts to be unique. Some of the creatures possessed zigzags of scarred tissue caused by the virus formation upon its own metallic chunks. In other cases, victims ended up with numerous heads or crab-like pincers. By this point, the subject's transformation into a Sithspawn hybrid was irreversible. Before the lobotomy took place, nevertheless, it was possible to stop the transformation via the control of the Force, or by purifying the nano gene droids with extreme heat. While they were initially considered intelligent beings, techno beasts with long-term frontage to the nano gene spore would experience severe cognitive degradation, altering their motor functions and decreasing the creatures to clumsy, shambling robots.\n\n","meta":{"index":22,"author":"Worlock365","name":"Technobeast","release_year":2022}},"Jenet":{"content":"# Appearance\nThe Jenet are a species of humanoid rodents who were often not liked by humans because of their features, causing them to adopt a more scavenger-like nature.\n\nDespite being shunned away from one of the largest species, the Jenet have a remarkable memory and can remember events, words and movements from events they had witnessed weeks and even months into the past. Notable features regarding them include their pink skin, red-tinted eyes, and their wiry fur that came in hues of white, grey, and red which could be seen more abundantly on their heads rather than the rest of their body. Whiskers could also be seen on their face and would twitch when they spoke as well as aiding in their scavenging. They are located on the side of their muzzle right above their cleft top lip, which hid their sharp, yellow teeth from all who viewed them. Their digestive tract is rather impressive, being able to consume and digest almost all living organic matter. Additionally, the Jenet have marvelous eyesight, hearing, and smell. More marveled feats included their strength, resulting in their enhanced ability during running, climbing, and swimming. Lastly, the Jenet are very flexible creatures, capable of squeezing through gaps as small as twelve centimeters via dislocating their lengthier limbs and some of their cranial plates.\n\nThe Jenet are originally from the planet Garban within the Tau Sakar system. They evolved into impressive survivalists as they systematically drove their largest predators to extinction, an important part of their history they refer to as “The Great Conquest”. They accomplished this with their average height of 1.4 - 1.6 meters, which accompanied well with their strengths. The Jenet were seen to walk on their toes rather than their whole wedge-shaped foot. Each of their limbs ended in four elongated fingers or toes with the hands having the exception of opposable thumbs. Each one of their digits lined with sharp claws. However, this did not impact their preferred transportation method of scurrying around.# Society\nJenets are temperamental and obsessed with any form of trivialities, which caused many species to recognize them as obnoxious with their urge to be right in every instance. Despite their technological advances on their homeworld and elsewhere, the Jenet are still heavy scavengers. Nothing they came across ever left them though, with all items either being kept in their homes or within a community warren, also known as a Community Heap. These heaps were filled with broken tools, empty containers and food. They were all common ground for the other Jenet, which had grown accustomed to digging through the more likely than not gargantuan pile of items to find anything that could be of use to them. The Jenet were also omnivores, though they did not raise or slaughter animals; they continued their scavenging ways and would only consume the flesh of an already dead animal. This meant the predators they did not kill in the Great Conquest had free rein over them more often than not, resulting in Jenet accustoming to fleeing at the first sight of these predators.\n\nThe Jenet memory is so impressive that they will remember the thing that attacked them in exact detail so as to tell other Jenet what they were coming up against. This did not just work with their natural predators though; a Jenet could remember an insult told to them and hold a grudge for a lifetime. Having this ability, rumors about other Jenet could be told while members voted treason against their own from just a rumor they heard a month ago in perfect detail. They also had a habit of not caring what other species thought about their opinions, usually spouting nonsense and their beliefs whenever they felt like it. This even extended to their families and friends, with it becoming so popular among them that it formed into their most common form of greeting each other. This was possible as the Jenet took pride in others needing to take the time and power to be remembered in the first place. This unfortunately began a chain of people believing the Jenet would make false memories in order to trick the people around them, but no Jenet entertained this idea as no Jenet had a tolerance for ignorance and duplicity.\n\nDespite these strifes back and forth, the galaxy shared with them most of the technology available at the time, leading to most Jenet being better off than many other species on average. Regardless, most Jenet did not work technology-focused jobs, instead opting for manual labor and places where their memory could be of use.\n\n# History\nThe Jenets evolved from rodent prey animals on Garban. Using the ancient trash piles the Jenet had cultivated in the past, archaeologists hypothesized that the species had developed sentience rather than starting out with it. Early Jenets lived in caves underground. They stayed within numerous cramped confines and locations for most of their day with some reaching full days within these places, only stepping out to the surface to scavenge for food.\n\nPeople agreed that thousands of years before the Battle of Yavin, ancient Jenets organized against their predators and began an extinction event against all the species of their home world that would be an immediate threat to the Jenet. Jenet legend revered and respected this period, which they called the Great Conquest. It immortalized the numerous heros and the warriors of this time in poetry. According to such tales from this time, the Danchaf of Garban were once a sophisticated and cunning species for their planet that tried effortlessly to stop the Jenet from penetrating their destruction into the forests. The Jenet rulers, Chirr't Ferr and Rhet H'rrr, formed countless armies to drive back these Danchaf hordes far further than any of them dared to expand outwards. H'rrr, according to the legends of the past, specifically targeted the Camale Danchaf, one of the species' four genders. Consequently, this disturbed the tree goblins' reproductive abilities and slowing their efforts in pushing the Jenet back. An epic titled The Ballad of Shan'Gredor told of the Jenet Ch'irrk Felt, who created numerous giant traps made out of pots, pans, and bright phospowder. The noise and blinding lights dazzled the Danchaf, which had allowed the Jenet soldiers waiting to ambush them an opportunity to slaughter all caught within their radius. In the end, such wars were unsuccessful in eradicating the Danchaf from the planet entirely despite the best efforts from the Jenet over the course of many years; legend claimed that the Jenet attacks forced the Danchaf to devolve into such a primitive state that the Jenet had free reign over the planet, becoming one of the apex predators of the time on the planet Garban. With the help of a xenobiologist named Xemlorn, scientists dismissed any information of a more sophisticated past for the Danchaf, thus doubting the truth and longevity of the Jenets' heroic tales.\n\nTo the Jenets however, the legends were key elements of their history and was their main reasoning for continuing outwards to other planets as they did not fear the creatures lurking on them. Jenet society had eventually fallen into clans after the battle was faught. During this period, the Jenet bureaucracy developed, as did the positions of premier and the Council of 127. Jenets learned to manage the numerous other species on their world without resorting to widespread eradication to keep their food supply high for generations of the species to come. The Jenet advanced their technological prowess soon after the control of their planet, eventually reaching spaceflight by their own innovation; this was likely done from stray ship crashes on their planet rather than any form of their own developed work.\n\nOver time, Jenet fecundity and lack of predators caused the species to overpopulate Garban. As a result, Jenets sent settlers to the other worlds of the Tau Sakar system in hopes of finding a new planet to call their home in a more sustainable location. Their attempts proved beneficial as they were successfully able to find conditions very similar to those on Garban, a fact that led scholars to postulate that an unknown intelligence once terraformed the planets to make these conditions so similar. The Jenets eventually founded colonies outside the Tau Sakar system as well, and over time they reached a technological standpoint that was on par or better than other advanced worlds in the galaxy. Their system became part of the Abrion sector in the Outer Rim Territories as their official home.\n\nThe Jenets' spread to other worlds inevitably brought them into contact with pan-galactic government. During the Galactic Civil War, the Galactic Empire took over the Tau Sakar system for their own goals and benefits. Imperial sentientologist and propagandist Obo Rin included the Jenets in his Catalog of Intelligent Life in the Galaxy, a project commissioned by Sith Lord Darth Vader to detail sentient species of most interest to the Empire so they may be used to help their own war effort. Rin claimed that the galactic regime protected the Jenets from marauding members of the Rebel Alliance who were out to exterminate all intelligent life. In exchange, the Jenets gladly served the Emperor as laborers while preferring their working ideals of manual labor. Contrary to this, they did see themselves as slaves to the Empire, as most of the population was forced to live in labor camps and undertake a task that they collectively hated because their own self-right and personality conflicted with the type of work they were being forced to partake in. The Empire found the Jenets to be useful workers on other planets as well due to their high reproductive rate, which rendered any worries about mortality levels to a microscopic degree. Enslaved Jenets often operated in perilous work conditions as their increased abilities in almost all physical situations resulted in them being the best in most scenarios for The Empire. As a result, the Empire set up breeding facilities for the species in an effort to select traits that would increase their pacifist nature while lowering their overall intellect of the species.\n\nJenets willing to fight back against the Empire were rare as their entire species was under their control by this point, except for a select few survivors, with some even joining the Jedi Order upon escape. After the collapse of the Empire in 4 ABY, the Jenet had to recover from the generations of selective breeding that had taken place, resulting in a far more primitive state than the Jenet ever imagined they would be taken back to. The species never joined the New Republic, the successor state of the Rebel Alliance, due to their preference for being among only their own kind after the horrid events that had taken place. Yet, a few individual Jenets did serve in various capacities in the new government and its successor, the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances.\n\n","meta":{"index":18,"author":"Private_Popsicle","name":"Jenet","release_year":2023}},"Anx":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Anx species were a tall reptilian sentient species native from the planet of Gravlex Med.

They had members in both the Jedi Order and the Galactic Senate.# Biology and Appearance\nTheir distinctive appearance had changed throughout the different gravities their planet had had, ending with a very high gravity and what they are now. Their bodies were dense in musculature, had a tail to help them balance and had a natural stooped and hunched posture. However, even with the restriction of gravity, they were capable of growing up to 4 meters high and used these heights to harvest food on their native planet.

This had the bonus of being a thermal sensor for the Ho’Din. These creatures have claimed their original form was a plant from which they evolved from while also possessing two hearts but scientists have classified them more as a reptilian than any plant relative.# History\nDuring the year 300 BBY the Ho’Din began their decision of progressing forwards instead of living their low-technology lifestyle. Once they had migrated to the first floors they began mining, farming, and manufacturing goods. Sadly, their ideals of ecology were slim to none, resulting in them underestimating the power of deforestation where organisms that would enhance the speed of decaying plantlife would prosper, resulting in them evolving into a parasite type creature that would latch onto a Ho’Din, bringing diseases and malnourishment as it sat. This pushed the Ho’Din back into the trees where they refocused all of their time and research into botanical research rather than ecological research. With this advancement, the Ho’Din had developed herbal therapies which could rid them of the parasites within them. Their pharmacological techniques as well as attempts to restore the Moltok ecological system resulted in the species safe and prosperous life as a civilization. However, this didn’t come without a cost. Some technologies were outlawed within Moltok and were under strict rule not to be developed there but when it came to planets outside of Moltok, the Ho’Din took it as a necessary evil they had to deal with on what they themselves considered to be unhealthy and damaged planets. This resulted in trades of medicines from the Ho’Din people of Moltok as they knew more about preserving life and planets than most species in which they gained their wealth vastly where it was used to help rebuild the ecosystem of their planet as well as repair damaged planets that needed it, many becoming garden planets where species could go to and commune with nature.

Ugnaughts prided themselves on their craftsmanship and adaptability. Insulting the functionality of their creations with or without malicious intent would greatly upset them. A common phrase, “I have spoken,” was used at the end of an Ugnaught’s statement symbolizing their unyielding thoughts. Since Gentes was an Outer Rim Territory, it was susceptible to slaver raids and common Ugnaught citizens were forced into indentured servitude. Little Ugnaughts remained on Gentes after the attacks and those remaining were often captured and sold across various planets as slaves. Gentes was located in the Anoat Sector, and only a small number of Ugnaughts remained because of the Galactic Empire’s blockade.

Sulfur was used by them as a stimulant however they couldn't abuse it as their livers struggled in eliminating it. \n\nThis species was extremely unique as the gender dimorphism was extreme. Males were very aggressive, had red skin and a pair of horns which were their pride. In addition, they had teeth that were extremely sharp. Females on the other side, were peaceful, didn't have horns, and were covered in fur that ranged in various colors. Their teeth were similar to the male ones but also counted with molars and canines. They used their teeth to speak and some male individuals were born with both pairs of teeth which made them live a life of solitude as scouts. Males were known to have extremely long tongues but it was never known if females shared this trait.\n\n# Society and culture\nThey were one of the first civilizations to discover interstellar travel and were commonly seen since eons back. Their culture was based on two different roles. The male role, which were the raiders and often traveled the galaxy in search of treasure and fights and the female role, who preferred to stay in the same place and therefore raised the future generations and governed them. The males sent as much resources and money as they could while the females were happy with these roles. The number of Force-sensitives was much higher in Devaronian than in many other species; however, not a strong Force wielder ever appeared. The Jedi Order, knowing this, established a temple there and almost all students were females as men only desired to explore.\n\n","meta":{"index":14,"author":"Craked10","name":"Devaronian","release_year":2023}},"Sullustan":{"content":"# Introduction\nSullustans are a sentient species known for their distinctive appearance and keen intellect. They are humanoid in form, with large, round heads adorned with short, fur-like hair. Their faces feature wide, expressive eyes and prominent cheekbones, giving them a friendly and approachable demeanor. Sullustans are known for their exceptional navigational skills, honed through generations of space travel and exploration.# Section 1\nSullustan society is characterized by a strong sense of community and a deep appreciation for technological innovation. They are renowned for their prowess in starship engineering and piloting, with many Sullustans serving as skilled navigators and mechanics throughout the galaxy. Family bonds are highly valued among Sullustans, and their communities often work together to achieve common goals.\n\n# Section 2\nThe history of the Sullustans is one of adaptation and resilience. Originating from the volcanic world of Sullust, they developed advanced technology to thrive in their harsh environment. Over time, they became pioneers of space exploration, venturing beyond their homeworld to establish colonies and trade routes throughout the galaxy. Despite facing challenges such as Imperial oppression and the devastation of their planet during the Galactic Civil War, the Sullustans have persevered, carving out a place for themselves in the galactic community.\n\n# Section 3\nSullustans have made significant contributions to galactic affairs, particularly in the realms of trade, diplomacy, and military strategy. Their expertise in starship navigation and engineering has made them valuable allies to various factions, including the Rebel Alliance and the New Republic. Sullustans have served as pilots, engineers, and diplomats, playing key roles in shaping the course of history during times of conflict and peace.\n\n# Section 4\nIn the creation of the Star Wars universe, the Sullustans were brought to life through a combination of practical effects and digital animation. The species' distinctive appearance was achieved through a combination of prosthetics, animatronics, and CGI, allowing for a range of expressions and emotions to be conveyed on screen. Sullustan characters such as Nien Nunb have become fan favorites, further cementing the species' place in the Star Wars lore.\n\n","meta":{"index":121,"author":"Il_van","name":"Sullustan","release_year":2024}},"Lepi":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Lepi were a unique sentient species, with some of their unique attributes being their long ears and buck teeth.

With their muscular digitigrade legs it had enabled them to run faster, jump higher, farther, and move more quietly than humans. They came equipped with large finger pads and prehensile toes which assisted them in climbing. In addition to their large physical features, they also had larger eyes and ears to give them superior sight and hearing capabilities over humans and with their impressive stature they even had the strength to open a powered-down blast door which could be done easier by taller types but most were typically above two meters tall as anything below that was considered below-average for a Lasat. Some fur patterns did vary on a Lasat as it seemingly changed from individual to individual with some changing drastically as they aged. But this was mostly noticed by other Lasat as the odor to humans was considered to be unbearable to be around so most humans and species stayed away from them.# Society\nWithin the species, those who had superior fighting skills were the most respected among the general populace, often being members of the Lasan High Honor Guard whom of which were a group of highly trained and intelligent warriors who had sworn to protect their homeworld of Lasan. Bo-rifles were a long-standing tradition in Lasat culture; these weapons had evolved to become of use exclusively by the Honor Guard of Lasan. But the weapons could move around in ownership as the way of the Lasat warrior was the Boosahn Keeraw, which deemed when a Lasat was bested by a superior opponent in combat, they would stand down and give them their weapon. The way they handled weapons was not the only defining feature of the Lasat. Facial hair was surprisingly an important part of their culture. Those with green eyes and prominent purple stripes were considered the most attractive of the species. Juvenile Lasat also had a knack for climbing tree branches for fun and entertainment or in some cases, a challenge. Of the Lasat that exist they spoke their own language of Lasat. A language whose r’s were difficult to replicate by most species who would try and even come close to replication. On their homeworld, time was measured by counting how many dust seasons they had survived through. The Lasat also had their own religion of sorts as they believed in the Ashla, a Spirit of the Galaxy and a personification of the Force. Using the Bo-rifle, Lasat were able to channel the force and in doing so could see past and future events that would take place. The Lasat who had become exceptionally good at this would come to be known as Revered Masters, whom of which often carried Ashla Staffs. These staffs had a special connection to the Ashla.\n\n# History\nLasat were native to the planet Lira San which could be found beyond a cluster of collapsed stars in Wild Spice. During an unknown point in time, a group of Lasats had colonized the Outer Rim world of Lasan and over many years their homeworld had only been reduced to a myth among other Lasat. During the Clone Wars, a galaxy-spanning conflict had formed between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During this time a Lasat had joined the Jedi Order and participated in the sudden conflict. This Lasat would go by Jaro Tapal. This was the only Lasat contribution to the conflict as the species as a whole did not participate in the war. During the end of the war, the Republic was transformed into the Galactic Empire, whom of which had devastated Lasat, destroying the High Honor Guard, the royal family, and killing most of the species which had made their appearance very rare across the galaxy. Wookies had tried to stop the empire from purging the Lasat at the cost of their own lives. None of the Lasat remained on their homeworld as the place they once called home was forgotten and far too dangerous. Sadly, most of the species had fallen into slavery from the Galactic Empire. As more and more Lasat died and more and more stopped using their traditional tongue, the Bo-rifle, much like the lightsaber, had become a symbol of a dying age. Fifteen years after the creation of the Empire, three brave Lasat had gone off in quest to search the wider galaxy on the mission to find Lira San with the help of the rebellion.\n\n","meta":{"index":58,"author":"Private_Popsicle","name":"Lasat","release_year":2023}},"Cathar":{"content":"# Overview\nCathars are a sentient feline-like species.

By nature, they give a lot of importance to moral values such as honor and family.# History\nThey first appeared on the planet Cathar, of the Quelii Sector in the Outer Rim. Despite their hostile nature, the Cathar never got into any conflict with outside species until the Mandalorian Wars. In this event known as the Battle of Cathar, a stunning 90% of the entire Cathar population was killed by the invading Mandalorians, with the few survivors being caught as slaves or forced to flee their home to survive. Following the Mandalorian Wars, some Cathars began returning to the planet, which recovered back to its original status in the following decades. Following the return of the Sith Empire in the Great Galactic War, they chose to side with the Galactic Republic, although over time their alliance with them would falter. Following the Sith Empire liberating a Cathar political prisoner, many Cathar clans chose instead to be integrated into the Empire’s ranks.\n\n# Culture\nAcross the galaxy, generally Cathar females were often considered prized as slaves, while males were too aggressive for servitude. Some famous members of the Cathar species include Juhani, whom aided Darth Revan in the destruction of the Star Forge, and the Cathar Jedi Sylvar and Crado in the Great Sith War, as well as the three Cathar Jedi brothers Rasi, Ahn and Zho-Tuum in the Second Galactic Civil War. \n\nThe Cathars present two definite subspecies: the Juhani and the Myr Ro, both being slightly more human-like and having paler fur colors.

While they evolved naturally, many of their attributes were caused by the intervention of unknown genetic engineers in the past. Like most canine species, they had pronounced muzzles, sharp claws, long pointed teeth, and pointed ears set on top of their heads. They had large glowing eyes and could run at incredibly fast speeds, both bipedally and on four limbs. They had excellent hearing and sight together with night vision, although this made them sensitive to light or piercing noises. By nature, they were isolationists and preferred not to interact with other species. Other than that, their technology was on par with  one of other species, and the few that chose to venture into the galaxy were often employed as scouts or soldiers.

They are most notable for their long, thick tentacles that wrap down from their heads and over their shoulders, as well as horns from their heads. Mas Amedda was the Vice-Chair of Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum and most recently, Sheev Palpatine. He was a Chagrian that served in the Galactic Senate, soon becoming the Grand Vizier following the establishment of the Galactic Empire. Chagrians begin their lives in a tadpole stage, similar to toads or frogs. Each tadpole measured 30 centimeters long and was initially entirely aquatic. Chagrians then begin to breathe air after developing lungs after maturing, then growing two arms and two legs. As the limbs are developed, they would then begin to emerge from the water and the past intermediate physiological stages would no longer be applicable, fading away entirely. In the adult stages of a Chagrian, they were bipedal humanoids who would remain just as comfortable in the water and out of it. Many Chagrians could spend months and even years fully submerged underwater without any effect on their bodies. Their bodies were very powerful and muscular, making them well suited for any kind of swimming or heavily labor-filled tasks. Chagrians have a very bad sense of taste due to the fact that they are so accustomed to saltwater that they will only usually taste the salt. All Chagrians possess a set of horns from their head tentacles protruding the tips, but male Chagrians also possess a set of horns straight up from their foreheads or cranium.# Lifestyle/Culture\nChampala was a planet of great wealth, allowing many of its occupants to have many expenses. Meaning, many Chagrians faced equality in their daily lives, having little want for anything, and having mostly everything they could need, such as medical needs, social equality, and higher education. Chagrians were rarely motivated by anything, apart from encountering something that they are unknown to, such as poverty, prejudice, or homelessness. They will attempt to heal this encounter the best they can, whether through actions or less direct methods. Chagrians will also be notable for rarely speaking Galactic Basic, most Chagrians only speak Chagri, their native tongue. Due to their lack of taste, many Chagrians resort to carrying food capsules for supplement rather than dealing with meals having no taste. Although being a generally peaceful species, Chagrians history was very particular with conflicts or unrest. Due to this, Chagrian conflicts were highly officiated affairs that clung to various rules and codes. An example of one of these codes is the Color of War, many Chagrians that joined the alliance during the Galactic Civil War chose to wear this color on their uniforms, often in their epaulets, piping, combat webbing, or a combination, therefore making them valid military targets or combatants.\n\n","meta":{"index":10,"author":"PhaseSpectr","name":"Chagrians","release_year":2022}},"Mon Calamari":{"content":"# Overview\nMon Calamari, a world of aquatic wonder located in the Outer Rim Territories, captivates the imagination with its rich culture and unique ecosystem.

Their most striking feature is their high-domed heads, which house a large brain capable of complex thought and reasoning. Their eyes are large and expressive, providing excellent vision in the dimly lit depths of the ocean. Webbed hands and feet allow them to navigate the waters with ease, while their skin, ranging from mottled shades of blue and green to pale pink, provides effective camouflage against predators.\n\n# Section 2\nMon Calamari society is built upon principles of craftsmanship, artistry, and communal living. Shipbuilding is a central aspect of their culture, with Mon Calamari engineers and artisans renowned throughout the galaxy for their mastery of starship design. Elaborate murals and sculptures adorn their cities, depicting scenes from their rich history and mythology. Music and storytelling are also integral to their culture, with traditional songs and tales passed down through generations.\n\n# Section 3\nThe history of the Mon Calamari is marked by resilience in the face of adversity. In ancient times, they faced threats from predatory sea creatures and rival underwater civilizations, forcing them to develop advanced technology and form alliances with other species, including the Quarren.

Very few people still know what is beneath a Jawa’s cloak, so only mystery surrounds these little creatures.# Culture\nJawa’s spend the majority of their days searching the entire desert for droids, ship parts, scrap metal, and other scrap to sell to locals and visiting merchants. Jawa’s are also often found around pod races, stealing the metal from the crashed pods. They make themselves a great living fixing up what they find and bargaining with moisture farmers. The Jawa’s have quite the reputation for being dishonest and scamming locals and travelers. They are often caught selling dangerous stolen equipment and broken droids for full price. Even though they have this reputation, the lack of retail options keep them in business.\n\nTheir native language, Jawaese, uses scent as well as spoken words.

The Yuuzhan Vong had extremely long life spans, compared to their human counterpart, as much as three times longer. This is all due to strict and regulated selective breeding, allowing them to adapt over time and increase their lifespan. The head of a Yuuzhan Vong could be described as a skull, with pointed ears and a very short nose, similar to that of a skull.

This gave the Yuuzhan Vong reasons to despise both machine and sentient species. After years upon years, and this war still having its flame at its peak, the Yuuzhan Vong became more and more violent, aggressive, and wanted the war. Through the war, their homeworld had been giving them tips, advice, and resources to create “living weapons” to use in this war. These weapons proved their worth, destruction, and usability when they used it on all sides of the war in their galaxy and completely ruined all of their enemies, forcing them to flee their galaxy. This glorious victory gave them the courage to start their own war.. on the entire galaxy they lived in. Their goal was to remove all mechanical advances, as the Yuuzhan Vong from their previous war, despised and thought of all machines as evil corruption. This is where their violence and destruction begins. As they conquer solar systems in their galaxy they do one of two options: make the species of each planet extinct or enslave them, which slavery is what they forced the Chazrach, a repltilian species, to become their soldiers.

As war and terror continue, Warmaster Tsavong Lah send the New Republic an offer, this offer stated the Yuuzhan Vong will end their conquests, wars, and violence.., as long as all Jedi in the galaxy were given to the Yuuzhan Vong. This caused all Jedi to be despised, and hated as the common folk were willing to give them up to protect themselves.

Despite most Squibs not being taller than a single meter, their greatness is instead shown by the astounding depth of their culture, society, and psychology.# History\nThey first appeared on Skor II, a small and dense planet within the Squab system of the Outer Rim. Their homeworld was extremely lush and opulent, allowing early Squib groups to accumulate large amounts of resources. As a result, over time the hoarding of as many material goods as possible became imprinted into the species’ psyche. \n\nNot only that, but their resource-amassing nature also caused them to often have surplus in their stockpiles, which translated into bargaining, haggling, and trading developing early and at an impressively fast pace. During this period, most of them were still nomadic with very few Squib tribes settling down to make permanent villages. They continued developing until they advanced to mass production, past which they decided to unite and form a peaceful, species-wide government called the Squib Polyanarchy. \nThey first interacted with a member of a sentient species other than their own around 3640 BBY, when a Dorcin trader discovered their world. The trader would proceed to instruct them on space travel in exchange for minerals. In the following centuries, they would proceed to spread across the galaxy and gain a fair amount of notoriety. They became so widely known that they were included in the 1000 BBY Jedi book “The Jedi Path”, under the section “Advanced Cultures and Politics in the Republic”. They established a stable reputation as the galaxy’s greatest scavengers and hagglers. Over time, Squib settlers established colonies on other planets, while Squib companies signed contracts with other industrialized and populous planets to gather their rubbish, recycle it, and resell it themselves. This led to Skor II becoming a prosperous trade world and the establishment of the capital “Metrobig City”.\nAround 40 BBY, a Squib named Ebareebaveebeedee would become the King of the Squib Polyanarchy. In the following years, he would proceed to lead the entire Squib civilization into a period of great prosperity. He signed contracts with capital ships to sell Squibs as garbage workers. While it may seem like an enslaving operation, it was instead an extremely clever move as the working Squibs secretly acted as spies and reported back to their home planet all coordinates of found battlefields and garbage deposits for salvaging. During the Separatist war, he would sternly support the Galactic Republic, which caused their planet to be attacked by Separatist forces. Shortly after, the Jedi Master Mace Windu and Commander Cody would arrive to attempt to free the planet, in the Battle of Skor II. The battle would result in a Republic victory, the planet being freed, and a statue of Mace Windu being built on Skor II in his name. Their territory would remain uncontested for the rest of the war and they would help with cleaning up scrap following battles.\nAround the time of the creation of the New Order, Squibs would find themselves challenged by another scrapping species, the Ugors, who would quickly surpass them to the point where most of the galaxy relied upon Ugor waste disposal services. The Squib king would choose to remain neutral following the Galactic Civil War’s breakout, and continued having commercial relations with both the Republic and the Empire. They profited off the conflict, being able to recover and sell many military vehicles to civilians following battles, such as many Arakyd 74-Z Speeder bikes. Despite this, the Ugor salvage fleet had gravely surpassed them thanks to a gravity well projector near their home system, to the point where the Squib King would break his neutrality and make a pact with some Rebel Operatives in exchange for the destruction of the gravity well projector. After they succeeded, the Squib would establish a long-lasting alliance, until the planet fell under Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire.\n\n# Biology\nOverall, Squibs are an extremely developed and evolved species with great survival capabilities, natural proficiency in anything related to dexterity, and many differences from specimen to specimen. Squibs are humanoid sentient mammals, which present both canine and rodent characteristics. They are quite small in size and lightweight, with their average height ranging from 1 to 1.2 meters and average weight around 25 kg. Their skin is naturally pink, although it is covered by fur. Their coats are usually white, gray, black, brown, blue, violet, or red. Other than protection, the main function of their coats is the fact it is used by them to smell objects, pick up scents, and identify forgery by brushing items against themselves. Their eyes were large compared to their skull, and located on the sides of the head. Their ears were large, adorned with tufts, and able to focus and rotate towards the source of any noises. Their muzzles were short and whiskered, their mouths full of white sharp teeth, although their cheeks were still flexible enough to store small objects. They’re bipedal, with the same amount of fingers as humans, albeit much more nimble. They reach teenhood at about nine years of age, maturity at thirteen, and middle age at thirty-nine. Their average life expectancy is sixty-five years.\nWhile usually very different physically, what brings together squibs the most is their similarities on a psychiatric level. Almost all squibs have a natural attraction towards the obtaining of great amounts of material goods - no matter if others view them as garbage - and always attaining more. They are overconfident, prideful and a perfect symbol of greed. Such emotions could make them great subjects to the dark side, albeit unfortunately, they tend to rarely be sensitive to the Force. Their non-threatening figures hide underneath naturally expert hagglers, bargainers and exploiters. They don’t have a fight or flight response - in front of danger they simply bluff and bluster.\n\n# Culture\nSquibs read, write and speak in Squibbian. Most traditional squib names were rather long. Their voices are naturally high-pitched, and while many of them learn basic, very few of them speak it fluently, and even fewer can write and read it. They tend to speak too fast, usually changing subjects even in the middle of sentences for convenience - or as a tactic to confuse their counterpart during haggling - and struggle to convey emotions through the tone of their voice. Additionally, they often present thick accents and use their own expressions such as “koovy” (meaning good, positive, cool) and ending sentences with the expression “You bet!”. They express most of their emotion through body language instead, such as droopy ears to convey discomfort and trembling whiskers to display indignation.\nUndeniably, the highest form of art for a Squib was haggling. There was no compliment more prestigious to a Squib than being told that they haggled well. They also liked to make intricate homemade ion blasters, as well as take garbage and reorganize it into intricate artistic works. One major example is a large mural celebrating the fall of the Ugurs and the triumph of the Squib people and the Rebel operatives.\nSquibs had their own religion which was based upon garbage collecting and scrapping, in which the Ugors were considered literal demons who desecrated their destiny to collect garbage.\nThe Squib’s home planet Skor II was governed by the Squib Polyanarchy, whose nominal head was a King. Additionally, from their birth, all Squibs are part of a species-wide corporation known as the Squib Merchandising Consortium. The Head of the consortium was known as the Illustrious Chieftain of Junkyards.\nMost of Squib technology is developed from scrap metal, but despite this the Squib species pride themselves in being the creators of some of the most advanced tractor beam technology in the galaxy- to the point that their ships had no weapons, but instead used tractor beams to quickly move asteroids as defense, or to launch them against enemy ships. They had their own fleet, called the Suib Reclamation Fleet, composed of fifty needle ships and a flagship called the “Wholesale”, which was later replaced by the Squib momship “Thrifty”.\n\n","meta":{"index":26,"author":"CrazyMaRKuLsIO","name":"Squib","release_year":2022}},"Sando aqua monster":{"content":"# Appearance\nThe Sando aqua monster was a monstrous creature with a body length reaching anywhere from 160 - 200 meters long; anything larger or shorter was rather uncommon for the species. This species was not sentient, yet despite all of these factors, they managed to stay hidden within the traditional oceanic territories they preferred to be in. Being this large meant they were muscular by nature with most survivors who have seen one stating they had a feline figure and four limbs ending with long, sharp claws. Of these limbs, the front two arms of the creature ended with hands that the creature could use to grasp any prey they deemed fit. The size of their mouths were capable of swallowing most creatures in a single bite. Their teeth were also razor-sharp, resulting in them being the only predators that could physically break an opee sea killer’s shell. These monstrous creatures had the capability of living for 100 standard galactic years.# History\nSando aqua monsters originated from the planet Naboo, where the interconnected core of water tunnels made the perfect spot for the Sando aqua monsters to live and as a result, the monsters did not float up to shallower waters very often. This had been proven by natives of Naboo such as the Gungans, many have never even seen a living Sando aqua monster, only spotting ones that have died and washed up to shore. Consequently, the Sando aqua monster was more of a horrific myth than an actual threat to any of the residents. A more notable point in history for these creatures was when Sith Lord Darth Vader single-handedly killed one that a group of rebels had summoned after they had tricked him into going into an underwater tunnel. This event was the first-ever recorded instance of someone killing one of these beasts. This single kill had a theorized 83% chance of causing the species’ extinction as the rarity in these creatures was slim to none.\n\n","meta":{"index":96,"author":"Private_Popsicle","name":"Sando aqua monster","release_year":2023}},"Selonian":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Selonians were a bipedal sentient race with cat-like features.

The flashsticks would send out a quick bright light which would stun the Selonians and would give an opening for an attack.

Trandoshans are powerful beings with long skinny arms that end in thick three-digit fingers or four including the thumb. Trandoshans have eyes set on the back of their pointed skull and a mouth full of pointed and sharp teeth. Some Trandoshans have been noted to have a crow of feathers along the top of their head. Trandoshans are known to be hatched from eggs and will call other Trandoshans hatched at the same time as the “clutch mates”.\n\nTrandoshan brains have been noticed to have base urges that include: Fury, Rage, and aggression. Trandoshans come in a range of colors including Green, Red, Yellow, Orange, and Brown. Trandoshans also have sharp claws on their hands and feet which allow them to climb trees in a forest or jungle.# History\nTrandoshans are born and come from the planet Trandosha. Trandoshans are known to be enthusiastic hunters. All Trandoshans first hunt is a creature called the Frist Wolves. Trandoshans have a goddess they worship called The Scorekeeper. The Trandoshans had taken control of the moon Wasskah, which would become the location of game preserves. A Trandoshan hunter named Garnac had control of an island called Island Four and would run a hunting guild out of the floating fortress that hovered on the island. Garnac’s scouts would travel to different worlds and kidnap and transport sentient beings dumping them on Island Four in which the newly made prisoners would be hunted for sport. During the Clone Wars, three young Jedi were captured and brought to Wasskah to be hunted for sport. For a long time, the young Jedi would evade the Trandoshans. Eventually, the Trandoshan hunter Lo-Taren would capture Jedi Padawan Ashoka Tano on the planet Felucia and would transport the Padawan to Wasskah and to Island Four. Trandoshans would turn out to be very good bounty hunters due to the background they have in Hunting on Trandosha. At least 1 notable Trandoshan bounty hunter was named Bossk. Bossk would later become the bodyguard of the young up-and-coming bounty hunter Boba Fett along with numerous contracts and become a very well-known bounty Hunter.\n\nTrandoshans had bad relationships with Wookiees as Trandoshans would hunt and kill Wookiees regularly and Trandoshans found Wookiees to be great hunting targets.\n\n# Other Jobs\nNot all Trandoshans took to bounty hunting or to do work related to hunting. Some of them would take on other jobs and tasks that fit them better. Some Trandoshans would-be traders and scrappers. One notable Scrapper/Salveger Trandoshan was named Gha Nachkt. This Trandoshan was a captain of a salvage ship during the Clone Wars. One of Gha Nachkt’s biggest and most notable hauls was after he was hired by the CIS in which he would be slaving a space battle that was long over and would recover the R2 unit that was in use by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker. Gha Nachkt would later bring the R2 unit to General Grievous on his secret base. While on this base Grevious would task Gha Nachkt with opening the R2 unit and extracting the information from it which during this time he found that the R2 unit had all the information of republic ships and battleplans. Later after finding this information, Gha Nachkt would try to negotiate the price of the R2 unit which would lead to his death at the hands of Grievous.\n\n","meta":{"index":116,"author":"AlexanderWestley","name":"Trandoshans","release_year":2024}},"Elomin":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Elomin species were horned humanoids native to the planet of Elom.

They were very commonly found in the Jedi Order and due to their species' low number, they could reproduce and not follow the  vow of non-attachment.# Biology and Appearance\nTheir distinctive large skull, in which their binary brain could be found and the 2 hearts that it needed to maintain itself, made them very different to other species. Their special brain made them capable of seeing an issue from 2 very different points of view, analyze information with extreme quickness, solve problems easily and have a high capacity to meditate and concentrate. Due to their extreme thinking capabilities, they were pretty cold, calm and rational, preferring peace and harmony in nature. Due to their brains they had extreme quick and refined reflexes, however they were clumsy due to their head weight and had back problems. The male Cerean were lower in number and aged faster than their female counterparts. They had Force sensitives very commonly and it was stipulated that due to their binary brain, they could explore both the Light and Dark side at the same time.\n\n# Society and culture\nTheir culture was based on a primitive, low tech natural lifestyle. Their citadels were made without hurting the nature of the place and visitors could use technology as long as it didn’t hurt nature. The core point of their society was meditation, in which they used kasha crystals which eliminated all possible distractions. Some Cerean Jedi used this crystal while making their saber to be capable of concentrating even more. Their politics were led by women, as the government was matriarchal due to male low numbers and fast aging. They were governed by the Council of Elders, which was led by a president who made decisions based on the advice of the Council. Decisions made by the Council were considered to be perfect and someone appealing the decision hadn’t been seen before. Their traditional culture was best seen in their names, as they were made from their grandparents, parents and a new one. Their clothes followed those that had been used for centuries and were trained in martial arts from a very young age. Polygamous marriages were common in their culture due to low numbers of males.

Klatooinians were fairly common throughout the galaxy and were found quite distinguishable from other species as they possessed a firm brow and visible teeth. On top of this Klatooinians had a stronger build which had made most of the species useful when it came to more laboring jobs. Their skin color was also a defining feature as it ranged from green to brown and their uniquely green blood had also made them quite distinguished. Most Klatooinians could be found in deserts or wastelands as those locations were their natural habitats. Another defining feature these creatures posses is their ability to be force sensitive.# History\nMost Klatooinians became bounty hunters as their strong builds allowed them to overpower many foes. But the occasional few would also become henchmen and bodyguards. Though these jobs were for the lucky few who didn’t get sold into slavery as their strong prowess and effectiveness in laboring jobs had made them desirable to most. In the history of Klatooinians there have been a few prominent members. One of these being Tarados Gon who was force-sensitive and ended up joining the Jedi Order. More predominant members of this species included Castas, a male Klatooinian bounty-hunter who had seen most of their business during the Clone Wars and had taken out many targets. Klatooinians had also strived from the path of good and taking out crime and decided to assist in crime under the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. More criminal acts include Klatooinian raiders who after the fall of the Galactic Empire in 9 ABY, had created a tribe on the planet of Sorgan. This tribe had found an AT-ST walker and repurposed it for their own benefit. This included attacking a remote village on multiple separate occasions until they were found defeated by the hands of Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin and a former rebel shock trooper who went by Cara Dune. Though the worst criminal act the Klatooinians had committed was done by the Klatooinian Family. A group of Klatooinians that had resided within the city of Mos Espa on the sand planet Tatooine. After Jabba the Hutt died during the disastrous defeat in the sail barge disaster, his majordomo and Bib Fortuna had claimed his throne which had caused the Klatooinians to act and split up their family from Jabba’s criminal empire. Despite this split, the Klatooinians had managed to capture and claim the spaceport and upper sprawl. During 9 ABY though, the Klatooinians had formed an alliance with the Trandoshan family as well as the Aqualish family who had created an alliance with the well known Daimyo Boba Fett’s gotra.

These creatures could also absorb physical material from ships, resulting in a breach in the hull that could lead to catastrophic damage if not tended to in a timely manner. Mynock had a pair of bat-like wings with which they used to fly through the vacuum of space, something only very few creatures could do. However, they were limited in their travel as the species naturally had an allergy to helium, resulting in many planets not being able to support Mynock life. The consequence of this was the helium grenade being invented so pilots could successfully stop Mynocks from eating their power cables. They would feed on the electrical, stellar, and electromagnetic energies using their sucker-like mouth to latch onto and drain. Mynock had different strengths of holding onto ships as some had legs while others did not. Yet, this was not a result from two genders or variants, instead from the fact that the Mynock would reproduce via mitosis as they possessed no major organs. This process could only happen after enough material had been consumed. Their small size in nature made them perfect prey for other silicon based lifeforms such as the Exogorth. They were also a popular last resort meal for shelters and colonists, who would convert their flesh to bioplasma.# Culture\nAs Mynocks were usually considered pests by most, the word quickly became a common insult used throughout the galaxy.

Weequays were found all around the galaxy. Their rough, leathery skin let them tolerate the harsh climate of their homeworld while also giving inherent resistance to blaster fire as they evolved under ruthless conditions. Weequays were therefore perfect bodyguards and bounty hunters. Some Weequay developed horns on their lower jaws, while others had rough skin extensions. Weequays wore their hair long most of the time. Weequays were able to interact with other adjacent Weequays via pheromones which went undetected to non-Weequays.

During the day, the planet’s red dwarf star, Barab, emitted radiation across the surface, so Barabel and other native nocturnal species sought shelter underground. Growing up to 2.2 metres, they had a distinct set of two-inch teeth and retractable solid claws. Their dark-coloured skin was covered in durable scales that could withstand a stun shot from a blaster, inspiring the Barabel microbe armour created by Creshaldyne Industries. Unique with two stomachs, the Barabel could consume copious amounts of meat, which, coupled with physical features, allowed them to be naturally strong.\nBarabels lived in rudimentary districts of up to 10,000 individuals led by a pack leader. They were renowned for being fiercely loyal and aggressive, while biological adaptations proved helpful in hunting. All spoke the language of Barabel, but most tried to learn other languages to communicate with the wider galaxy. They had an unusual sense of virtue, finding other people’s pain funny; in the Barabel language, sounds for sadness and laughter were represented with the same sissing sound.# Presence in the Galaxy\nSometime before the Imperial Era, an Ithorian named Noga-ta and other Jedi Knights travelled to Barab I to settle a dangerous disagreement between the Barabel clans, which would later be called the Barabel War. With the dispute pacified, they deeply respected the Jedi. They told stories of skilled “great warriors from the sky” over the ages, building their trust in the judgement of the Jedi. To many Barabel, this was the only contact with extraterrestrial species because most stayed on the planet. Still, some did choose to become mercenaries and brutes, while others left the planet to live on the swampy world of Abraxin at around 67 BBY. Some centuries later, Barabel began trading with other worlds, especially wildlife, hunters and Barabel commodities for weapons and metal goods, but they were still relatively quiet on the galactic stage. \nIt wasn’t until the reign of Emperor Palpatine that conflict was introduced. Planetary Safaris Incorporated, backed by the Galactic Empire, saw an opportunity to use Barab I to illegally host hunting trips. Captain Osted Alater was tasked to monitor the company’s investment in Barab I, and after discovering the Barabel to be sentient beings, the company was shut down. The Barabel dubbed their underground capital city after the captain, Alater-ka. With attitudes of the species slowly changing, some Barabel were taken in by the Jedi Order, such as Saba Sebatyne.\nEventually, at the start of the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Barabel experienced near extinction with the invasion of the extragalactic race; only a few escaped the fires that enveloped their underground districts.

Their lands were filled with the most beautiful structures that touched the clouds of Tatooine. Their culture was vibrant and their land bountiful, providing the Kumumgah structure and security. Unfortunately, this beauty would come crashing down due to the Rakatan Infinite Empire.\n\nThe Rakata caught wind of this space-faring species and embarked on a campaign to subjugate the Kumumgah. The Rakatan Infinite Empire swiftly destroyed many of the great cities that reached the skies, eventually subjugating the Kumumgah and forcing them into slavery; off and onworld. \n\nOver time, the Kumumgah grew tired of the Rakata control of their lands, raising their banners and launching an insurrection against their oppressors. This would lead to tragedy as the Rakata swiftly put down the rebellion. Due to the rebellion, the Rakata decided to disband all operations on Tatooine, leading to them leaving the planet. In the process of leaving, the Rakata would glass the planet- turning the lush jungles and great oceans into the dunes and sands that is modern Tatooine. The Kumumgah were wary of this and moved most of their population into the caves of Tatooine. \n\nAfter what seemed to be forever, a devolved half of the Kumumgah population rose out of the caves and started their lives under the Twin Suns, the Dune Sea their new home.

They were physically hermaphroditic, referring to them being able to be female or male physically. The female version, which is called Dinagous, is the most common. To reproduce, they exchanged eggs with each other. The mature ones, typically seen with deep purple skin, could use camouflage and adapt their skin color to their surroundings. On top of this, they were capable of regenerating stray limbs.\n\n# Society and culture\nThese species were more attuned to a primitive and tribal culture where they lived in non-complex routines for survival. They lived in the same geographical area and assisted each other in gathering essential resources. When they were not eating, they communicated and made a resonant and complicated humming noise that was difficult to understand to outsiders.

The Kindalo were known to guard the passageways leading to the surface of Aleen since the air was toxic to those who dwelt underground.# Biology and Appearance\nThe Kindalo were much taller than the average human height, at around 3.1 meters, or 10 foot, 2 inches. Unlike most vegetation lifeforms who grew on a permanent spot, the Kindalo were mobile, using their lower growth roots as legs. They had feet with four toe-like appendages on them in the same fashion as the Fftssfft, the Kindalo’s near-sentient relatives. They also had two roots on their upper torso that acted as the Kindalo’s arms, with four finger-like appendages at the end of them. Their arms were also longer than their legs.\n\nMuch like other plant life that resided in Aleens underground, the Kindalo were bioluminescent, producing dim white lights that illuminated the caverns that they resided in. They also had stern faces, pouting and lipless mouths, glowing white eyes, and branches protruding from their heads that resembled horns. Kindalo’s had dark plant bark for skin with gray-ish white luminescent stripes all over them, along with organs to help them with their deep, echoing voices.\nHowever, like most of the underground life on Aleen, the Kindalo’s were deathly allergic to the surface air, which was poisonous to them. They survived only because the ground on Aleen was able to keep the surface and underground separate, which naturally filtered the air making it harmless and breathable to those in the underground. The Kindalo were able to produce groundquakes as a way to seal any holes that appeared and jeopardized the underground ecosystem; However, it was dangerous and sometimes harmful for the Aleena, the surface-dwelling sentient natives of the planet.\n\n# Society and Culture\nWhen the Kindalo had no need for mobility, they would remain stationary in one place, making themselves indistinguishable from other non-sentient and immovable trees and plants. Since the air on the surface presented a deadly hazard to them, the Kindalo would have little to no dealings with beings from the surface. There did, however, exist a type of covenant between the Kindalo and the Aleena, a sentient species of small, wide-mouthed reptilians who lived on the planet's surface. The surface and underground worlds were separated for the betterment of both species. The Kindalo were open to communication but they were distrustful of strangers, especially those who were from the surface, and wouldn’t hesitate to kill anyone they deemed to have broken the covenant. They had their own means of communication, however, as some were able to speak in Galactic Basic Standard.\n\n# History\nThe first Kindalo’s can be traced to the underground of Aleen, where they’ve evolved to be more suited to their living conditions and whatnot. The planet of Aleen is a temperate yet rocky world with a hollow interior acting as an underground of the planet, located within the Mid Rim Territories of the known galaxy. They shared the planet with the reptilian Aleena, whom they had little interaction or communication with. The Aleenas joined with the Galactic Republic during what was known as the Great Manifest Period, which lasted from 20,000 to 17,018 BBY.\n\nThe underground residents remained independent and isolated from the wider galactic community; However, they did have enough contact with the outside galaxy to learn about Galactic Basic Standard, the lingua franca of the galaxy.

The Kaadu were quite a tall animal with an average height of 7’3 inches, 2 feet taller than the average horse. Kaadu have an extremely heightened sense of smell and hearing. They are without upper incisors, which makes it difficult to chew. It is so difficult to chew that they rely on snails and seaweed so it can go down smoothly, making them omnivores. \n\nThe Kaadu normally travels in separate groups of 20-100, although in one case they were reported to be in a group of 3.4 million. Male and female Kaadu are separated by flocks, these flocks only come together in mating season and separate once done. When in mating the male Kaadu is yellow with outlined purple spots. To lay their eggs they would find an area near water and would lay 6-12 at a time.# History\nKaadu are fearless creatures, making the gungans attracted to using them for battle. These animals would be used to charge into battle and as patrol animals for the police of Gungan City. Kaadu is an extremely loyal animal.

But they migrated and adapted to eventually dominate many worlds, one of the more notable of these being Ord Mantell alongside the human population. During the Clone Wars though, a cabal of Falleen nobles had led a criminal organization known as the Black Sun criminal syndicate which had the perfect opportunity to grow as the Jedi were focused on battling the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Black Sun had evolved to become notorious in the lawless Outer Rim Territories and elsewhere around nearby systems. The Black Sun had grown so much in the time with no Jedi that they had established a well-defended fortress on Mustafar where most of their operations were planned and acted on. This had led the Falleen to invest into more serious personnel for their syndicate. Xomit Grunseit who was the lead of the syndicate had enlisted the help of Lieutenant Ziton Moj to assist and lead the criminal organization. During the reign of the Galactic Empire though, Falleen much like other alien species like Umbarans and Neimoidians had become the butt end of jokes within academies and even most notably the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant.

Hutts were not known for their health and many of them have genetic defects such as their skin being cracked. The planet they live on is Val Hutta and was a very hot planet and would rain often which the Hutt found most pleasurable. Hutts also have a very long life span such as Jabba who lived to be 604 before his death and some could even live to 1000 years old and spoke Huttese since they did not know Galactiv Basic.# Culture\nThe Hutt society was divided into families such as the Jabbas who were a part of the kajidics. Some of the Hutts had tattoos of the family crest. When a Hutt died they were bandaged and buried. Architectural Hutt style could be seen on the planet Mataou. Their buildings had sloping gates and flatter buildings that were red, and white. Hutts had a choice to wear clothes and some chose not to, such as Jabba. Hutts liked to dine on gorgs, slime pods, andpaddy froggys. The Hutts also had a holiday to celebrate Boonta the Hutt who they believed ascended to Godhood. Most Hutts were known for being crime lords that would oversee all criminal activity in the area. Some of these crimes were slavery, gambaling, spice smuggling, and bounty hunting in Hutt space. Not all of them were crime lords and some were even artists.\n\n# History\nFor a quite long period of time, the Hutts ruled over all organized crime in the galaxy and for several centuries controlled the Twi’leks of Ryloth and the Nikto species. When the Hutts approached Lord Isamer of the Directorate, They struck a deal with him to destabilize the local government of Eiram and E’rondor so they could control trade and create mass enslavement which most Hutts were fond of. Although the Hutts wanted to accomplish these goals, their true reasoning was so they could destroy the Directorate so they could move their criminal duties into the region. Fast forward to The Galactic Empire Era, the Hutts had a very tight grip on the galaxy with crime syndicates all across the galaxy. \n\n    After Jabba's death, who was a crime syndicate leader killed by Leia Skywalker, the Hutts were left to determine who would take his place and for the next few months there was no new crime lord. Eventually the new republic slowly started to take steps and gave the crime syndicates financial regulations. Even with all the patrol and regulations the Hutts were still able to keep control over the Nikto species in the republic era. Even with the Nikto in control the Hutts still lost most of their control over the galaxy.

They have tall, gaunt bodies with a fleshy and pallid skin covered by a hairless exoskeleton, which helps them resist the atmospheric pressure of their homeworld. Their eyes are compound and do not have lids, and their vocal cords produce a deep, low voice that is nearly impossible for other species to hear without assistance. The Tognath have both insectoid and mammalian characteristics, which makes them a unique species. They are genetically related to the Kel Dor and Gand, although it is unclear whether this relation is due to experimentation or evolution. Tognath larvae are hatched from eggs nurtured in a suspension jelly, where two or more eggs can be grafted together to create a bond that lasts throughout their lives. After the parasitic larvae emerge, they latch onto one of their parents to feed directly from their bloodstream for six months. Then, they are taken to a nursery tree where they spin a cocoon, undergo metamorphosis, and grow an endoskeleton and exoskeleton within the safety of their cocoon. When they emerge from their cocoon, they look like a smaller version of their adult form. Tognath almost universally opt to enhance their biological functions with cybernetic modifications, which is an easy process due to their dulled pain receptors. They often add special lenses to their eyes, breathing apparatus to process the oxygen content in a planet's atmosphere, and other technology to augment their poor hearing and balance.\n\n# Society and culture\nTognath lived on the high-gravity planet Yar Togna.

The possibility of breeding between Theelin and other near-human species gave every single Theelin unique characteristics, such as different numbers of fingers/toes and differently shaped horns, a reason for their diversity. The only consistent features were that they grew to about 1.7 metres as adults and that most spoke the Galactic Basic Standard. Adaptability was also in their nature, demonstrated by their widespread presence in the galaxy.# Presence in the Galaxy\nDuring the Galactic Empire, their colourful appearance and notable sense of fashion allowed Theelin to be ideal performers, like in the case of the female religious singing group, the Divas.

However, Theelin hybrids faced discrimination even if their loyalty to the Empire was high, and as a result, they often stopped working with the Empire and chose more precarious jobs like bounty hunting.\nIn the subsequent years of the Empire, mutations in Theelin’s gene pool arose, which caused individuals to become infertile. To crimelords like Ingoda the Hutt, this unique race became more prized as commodities than individuals, leading to further Theelin enslavement. Even after several methods to revive the species through breeding with other near-human species, more and more were unable to have children as time passed.

On average, they lived around 100 years (most likely thanks to their better blood flow - a perk of having three hearts) and were around 1.9 meters tall. They hail from Scipio, a frozen planet with a snow and ice-covered surface, where the temperatures were low. However, since the Muuns had two hearts that they could control at will, they could easily manage their blood flow to resist the cold temperatures of Scipio.# History\nBeing born on a planet with no actual natural resources, they had to resort to exploiting the economic system: they formed the InterGalactic Banking Clan, the largest and most important banking organization in the galaxy. Not long after, they colonized the planet of Muunilinst, and made it one of their major activity hubs. Muunilinst was used for the creation of the most used monetary source in the galaxy, Credits. During the age of the Galactic Republic, the Muuns were often privates who invested in whatever seemed the most profitable and useful to them at the moment. Important trade guilds founded colonies, trade guilds and corporations, and at some point, they even colonized the planet of Mygeeto, which would become a financial center for Muuns.

Over time, the Rakatans accomplished many things but couldn't escape the grasp of nature.# Description\nThe Rakatans were born on the planet Lehon, deep in the unknown regions of the galaxy. They were cannibalistic species that were genetically drawn to the dark side. They held no galactic significance until the Kwa (a species of Force Sensitives) arrived on the planet. Kwa were Dathomirian in origin and sought to teach lesser species, such as Rakata, in the ways of their knowledge. \nThe Kwa would teach the Rakatans everything they knew about the force, such as the light side and the many ways it was used. However, the Rakatans were unable to stick to this ideology, as their genetic attraction to the Dark Side was too strong. This struck fear in the hearts of the Kwa, and for a good reason. When they refused to give the Rakatans the secret to the infinity gates, they were massacred, and those that remained devolved into the Kwi. The Rakatans then formed the Rakatan Infinite Empire and set out on a massive conquest. The first thing they did was invent one of the earliest forms of the Hyperdrive system. However, it was only limited to traveling to force sensitive planets, the only ones that mattered in the eyes of the Rakatan. They would also be responsible for producing an early type of lightsaber, known as the Forcesaber. There was a catch, though. Those who wielded a Forcesaber would force them to shift ever so slightly to the Dark Side. As you know, the crystal, the blade and the user are all intertwined. Using these weapons, the Rakatan empire would go on to enslave many of the early species of the galaxy and  enslave the citizens by forcing them to build projects for them. One of these projects was the Star Forge, a massive space station that could mass produce an endless supply of naval ships, drawing energy from the sun. Despite the fact that the Rakatan Empire had many conquests, their corruption due to the Dark Side was too strong, even for them. It caused the civil war to break out amongst the Rakatans. Along with this, the Rakatands would develop a fatal disease, slowly crippling their connection with the Force. This would also have devastating effects on their technology, due to most of them relying on force. Over a very extended period of time, the Rakatans would slowly lose the grip that they once held on the galaxy, and they had no idea what was causing it. This was made worse by failed attempts to conquer both Tython and Korriban. In 25,200 BBY, the Infinite Empire would collapse, leaving only small pockets of Rakatans alive. In the end, the Rakatans devolved, losing their connection to the force, and becoming the laughing stock of the galaxy. Their physical appearance didn't change much. The Rakatans were a humanoid species that contained some aquatic-like characteristics. As much of their homeworld was water, they evolved with a head stalk and a pair of eyes horizontal on their heads. Their eyes had a wide variety of colors, gray, gold, blue, and brown.

They would usually approach the spoils of war and would take what they needed and wanted from who they conquered before returning back to their home.

Yam’rii or as the Kaleesh would refer to them as Huk would invade their homeworld, they would strip their resources away from them resulting in most of their population being sold into the slave trade. Their lack of technology and Senate representation resulted in any wishes they pleaded for to go unanswered. The result of these unanswered pleas was a devastating war between the Kaleesh and Yam’rii which is a constant rivalry even to the present date. Not too long after the start of this war though a warrior by the name of Qymaen jai Sheelal had learned brutal and determined strategy, battle tactics, and warfare during the war. Because of this, he was looked upon as a sort of deity and legend. His reputation earned him the moniker “Grievous”. Grievous had made such an impact that the Yam’rii had called for republic assistance during the war which had caused Jedi to join in. The result was the Yam’rii had stopped worrying about the war as much as they used to, which had devastating effects on the warriors of Yam’rii as they weren’t as heavily supplied as they once were, leading to the starvation of hundreds and thousands of them. Eventually, the battle had reached a stalemate as the Jedi slowly began putting less resources into the fight. Resulting in Grievous having free time to be called off to Izvoshra. But his transportation pod had been trapped by a conspiracy from Poggle the Lesser, Count Dooku, and Darth Sidious. The result had left Grievous badly injured. The Empire would then take him in and rebuild him into a cyborg general who would go on to lead numerous droid armies and gain the new title of “General Grievous”, thus creating one of the most iconic members of the Sith Order.\n\n","meta":{"index":93,"author":"Private_Popsicle","name":"Kaleesh","release_year":2023}},"Amaran":{"content":"# Overview\nAmarans are a peculiar sentient alien species, which present both canine and vulpine characteristics. Their body is covered in fur, usually orange or white-colored, and they are bipedal. They have long, silky tails, narrow whiskered muzzles, and pointy ears. They are small in size and generally lightweight. They walked digitigrade, with four clawed digits per limb. They often wore clothing together with earrings or necklaces and favored staffs as weapons of choice. They had great propension to bargaining and bickering over transactions, and many members of the species often worked in the field of animal taming and trading.# History\nThey first appeared on the planet Amar, of the Airon Sector in the Inner Rim. Such planet would always be part of the Galactic Republic until the rise of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire in 137 ABY, which it fell under. They often used Hyperspace technology, and by the time of the Clone Wars, they began emigrating en masse and spreading around the galaxy. In particular, they would greatly spread on the planet of Vulpter, in which they provided a great amount of workforce. This led to distrust and discrimination between the planet’s natives, the Vulptereens, and the Amarans. By the time of the creation of the New Republic, some Amarans had even spread as far as Naboo, in which they distinguished themselves as extremely skillful animal tamers.\n\n","meta":{"index":77,"author":"Remalior","name":"Amaran","release_year":2022}},"Ecorb":{"content":"# Overview\nEcorbs, who inhabited the Destral Pits, were a sentient species that were known to have coiled attachments, which were referred to as hampas, lodged on their mucilaginous heads. As legend among the ecorbs tells, hampas were not always attached to their heads, as they were said to have gained them through consuming a species of luminescent orange and blue flowers consecutively, regardless of their side effects. As a result of evolution, this trait is inherited by subsequent generations.# Biology\nTypical characteristics of ecorbs were their dark yellow exteriors, patterned even more darkly down their backs, and a scaly texture across the entirety of their skin. Along with this, they possessed jelly-like heads topped with hampas. Hampas were known to be very painful to possess, as their painfully constricting nature made the ecorbs miserable. Along with hampas, the ecorbs also possessed red blup sacks that undulated when the owner was happy. They were capable of dreaming while sleeping and were even known to have nightmares occasionally. Ecorbs sported eyes the color of amber, and sharp teeth encased in their mouths. They were known to possess at least two sexes, female and male, and were able to speak.\n\n# History\nAs legend among the ecorbs tells, hampas were not always attached to their heads, as they were said to have gained them during a period known as \"the Mercurial and Long Time Away From Here Times.\" Their life was carefree during this time as they glided ecstatically across the Destral Pits until one fateful night, a luminescent orange and blue flower sprouted from a viscous rock. The ecorbs, feeling tormented by the flower’s presence, as they have never seen a flower before, gathered around it and were mystified by its presence. The ecorbs, not knowing what to do about the flower, decided to consume the flower. An elder ecorb warned the others of its species of the flower's unknown origin. However, their warnings went to waste, as the other ecorbs insisted on consuming the flower. The petals were torn off the flower’s stem, divided among the ecorbs, and consumed. The flower had a psychedelic effect on the ecorbs, causing them to feel giddy at first, however, once they laid their eyes to rest, they were accompanied by horrid nightmares. When they awoke the next morning, hundreds of the same orange and blue flowers bloomed surrounding the ecorbs. Due to their arrogance, they decided to consume the flowers once more. This led to an addiction of the flowers and they soon became extinct. Due to the overeating, the ecorbs grew hampas atop their heads and began to feel dreadfully ill. From then on, the ecorbs lived miserably with the constant pain of the hampas reminding them of their mistake.\n\n","meta":{"index":25,"author":"Aceltra72279","name":"Ecorb","release_year":2022}},"Flesh Raiders":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Flesh Raiders are mutated subspecies of the Rakata. They were bred to serve as low-caste soldiers for the Empire. A few members of the Flesh Raiders species were left on the planet Tython before the Cold War which allowed them to survive past the end of the Rakatan Empire.# Society & Culture\nThe Flesh Raiders had no established cities or a government, they had crude shelters on the Ridges of Tythos. At the shelters, the Flesh Raiders would practice a form of spiritual worship with a Shaman. Their shelters had idols and rocks placed all around them. The Flesh Raiders used signal fires to be able to communicate with other Flesh Raiders who were farther away. They also preferred naked earth so they burnt the grass and trees and replaced them with the bones of their dead prey. The Flesh Raiders were also scavengers so they used anything they found to use to make clothing and armor.\n\n# Biology & Appearance\nHaving originally been created as low-caste soldiers in the Rakata species, the Flesh Raiders were extremely violent. They were a bulky species who had razor-sharp teeth to tear into the bones of their prey. Eight slits lined their upper lip and two eyes that were located on the side of their somewhat box-shaped heads. There is little study of the Flesh Raiders but there have been multiple theories about them. After the colonists left Tython the Flesh Raiders started to become cannibals.

These beings grew to five metres and had scales while frequently displaying patterns of stripes or spots. Their red eyes were protected by translucent eyelids that guarded their vision against the sandstorms that would occur on the moon. Using their venomous fangs paired with sidewinding movement, these nocturnal hunters quickly paralyse their soon-to-be food, returning to their tribes with their prey alive. During the day, they would hide away from the heat in places of shelter, either digging deep into the sand or staying in the shade of large structures, such as giant cacti. The Slith had limited vocal potential, only producing a few sounds due to moisture evaporation that occurred in their bodies. Therefore, they resorted to rubbing their jagged scales against the ground, a language called Slithese.\nThe Slith had a male-dominated structure in nomadic clans of about a dozen individuals. Tribes were led by an alpha male, assisted by the most senior male and female after the alpha male, aptly titled the “Lieutenant male” and “First Mate”, respectively. Most females, like Dresk Kist, were carers and hunters, while males protected their traditions and the young. Several ceremonies took place, including prayer to spirits and worship of gods, confirming that the species was somewhat civilised.# Presence in the Galaxy\nThe Slith were largely unknown in the galaxy due to being many thousands of years behind other races. Still, even when contact was established, they preferred to stay isolated. Some conditions made them emerge from this segregation, namely with the native Gerb species for trading valuable goods, like twilight lizards. Eventually, an Imperial scouting team discovered both species in an expedition to the moon, from which numbers of Slith were estimated to be around 19 million. The Rebel Alliance sent their own exploratory body, the Fernandin Scouting Expedition, to Yavin XIII but accidentally brought a plague, harming the Gerb. When there was a chance that the disease could mutate to harm humans, the Empire plotted to demolish the moon’s surface to minimise its spread. The rebels sought to prevent this from happening, and with the crisis averted, the Slith stayed on the moon into the era of the New Galactic Republic.\nOnly a few knew about their existence; for example, Rodian archaeologist Suz Tanwa in her travels and Jedi Padawans on the neighbouring moon of Yavin IV. Yet another crisis occurred when the war-mongering Yuuzhan Vong attempted to invade the system to eradicate the New Jedi Order, leading to the extinction of life on the habitable moons of Yavin Prime. This marked the end of the Slith.\n\n","meta":{"index":92,"author":"AnimatedEcrux","name":"Slith","release_year":2023}},"Starweird":{"content":"# Appearance\nThe average Starweird was an incorporeal humanoid with the ability of the force in every single one of them and are only found in the vacuum of space. They were a lengthy and gaunt creature so much so one could describe them as being skeletal. They wore ephemeral rags that would hang from their two arms. Beyond this look, they also had long, white hair that was always in a state of wildness as they had no gravity around them. Their skin was as equally pale but no two Starweirds were the same as they varied slightly from creature to creature. A Starweird’s face however was desiccated with reports varying from person to person as victims have stated the face looked like their own face. Though beyond these outer appearances, the Starweird would usually have a large toothy mouth with glowing eyes and would best be described as eerie. Other parts of their body like their arms were bony with three elongated and sharp talons at the end of their hands. Being they were incorporeal by nature most physical attacks did nothing to them as well as physical objects as they would fly right through the hull of a ship. However, with force fields and the force itself, these creatures could be impacted and stopped effectively until they moved on to other prey. These creatures did not walk though, rather they floated and hovered at a speed ever so slightly faster than any bipedal humanoid could run. These creatures did not talk or communicate, they had no known language and most importantly, when killed they left no trace of their existence as if they were never real in the first place.# Behavior\nStarweirds have most commonly been sighted attacking crews who were repairing their ship in deep space or in rare cases they would instantaneously manifest aboard ships that were traveling through hyperspace. When spotted by any other creature though, it would quickly become enraged and release a telepathic shriek to their prey. Most would cower in fear or even try to fight back but their attacks wouldn’t connect. Even in the vacuum of space the shriek could be heard as was the nature of how it was delivered. When they got close enough though, they would take their talons and shred them to pieces in a matter of moments before continuing their selective hunting of picking one target before moving on. Though if there was a force-sensitive among a group, they would specifically target them and no one else until the force-sensitive had defeated the Starweird or was slain by the Starweird.\n\n# History\nStarweirds were found singularly in deep space and nowhere else which warranted them being classified as a mysterious species. Some Jedi believed they were physical manifestations of the dark side of the force yet there were no claims to back these statements up. During the First War between the Reconstituted Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, the Starweird Queen was considered to be of legendary status among the Galactic Republic as it was reported to have attacked many padawans and the Jedi Council.

Exogorths were colloquially known as ‘space slugs’. Exogorths typically reached maturity at 10 meters in length and were able to reproduce by splitting in half. On the rare occasion an Exogorth was incapable of splitting in half, it was capable of growing up to the size of 900 meters in length. Space slugs of this capacity were known for swallowing starships whole and house entire ecosystems within their innards due to the space slug’s vast size.# Additional Sections\nExogorths were well-known for burying themselves within asteroids of any size until they would burrow themselves within the asteroid until completely hidden. The space slugs feed off stellar energy emissions, mineral-rich deposits from the asteroid, floating space debris, and other creatures such as mynocks. Exogorths remained primarily dormant once burrowed due to the lack of available food sources in space. Due to this, an Exogorth's lifespan could stretch up to a billion years depending on the contents around them. A notable Exogorth is Sy-O, who resided in the asteroid belt of the former rebel-occupied planet; Hoth. Sources claim Sy-O has lived for over a billion years, which was considered to be young for an Exogorth.\nThe space slugs stereotypically would leave their mouths agape to trap victims. However, on rare occasions they were able to lunge at starships. This was not their preferred method of attack however, due to being an exhausting method of catching prey, leaving the Exogorth over-exerted for an extensive period of time.\n\n","meta":{"index":90,"author":"PoH_v1","name":"Exogorth","release_year":2023}},"Sarlacc":{"content":"# Overview\nSarlacc, one of the most feared creatures in the galaxy, known for its behemoth size and horrifying way they use to sustain themselves. Mysterious in origin, these ancient organisms spread through the cosmos, rooted under the sand and soil of worlds. They can be found in different places, ranging from the dune sea of Tatooine to the swamp of Dathomir.# Anatomy and Physiology\nSarlacc are omnivorous plant-like organism with an appearance of a hybrid between giant worm and tree with tan color bark-like skin. They can grow up to 100 meters in length. Sarlacc have 4 main body parts ; a head, 8 appendages , 3 roots and a worm-like body. Juvenile Sarlaccs are more agile and smaller than adults due to size and their roots yet to anchor themselves permanently to the sand or soil. \n\nHead\n\tSarlacc head has 3 different organs ; a beak, fangs and tentacles, though beaks are only found in adults. \n\tBeak : The beak of a Sarlacc is positioned at the middle of their maw. This beak is in fact, the tongue of the creature. Inside the beak there is another tongue like muscle, helping in swallowing prey. Inside the beak there are many nerve endings. Sarlacc determined which stomachs they would send their food in with their inner tissue inside the beak. There are also microscopic pore openings inside them to help with sorting off undesirable objects such as sand and mud. \n\tFangs : Sarlacc has many rolls of fangs. Its fangs are slightly curving inward and coated with mucus to prevent prey from escaping. In juvenile, these fangs are being used to chew prey.\n\tTentacles : Tentacles are the sensory organ of Sarlacc. Detecting vibration from the sand. Sarlacc uses tentacles to catch prey and send them down its beak/throat. \nAppendages\n\tSarlacc has 8 appendages, 4 each side of its body. They use these flipper shape appendages to bury themselves in sand as an adult. As a juvenile, these appendages were used to move around, synergized with the different hunting methods of juveniles.  \nRoots\n\tSarlacc has 3 roots at the bottom end of their body. These roots absorb nutrients and water to keep the Sarlacc hydrated. Roots have the same function in adults and juveniles. However, in adult form these roots also function as anchors, holding Sarlacc in place. \nBody \n\tSarlaccs have their body grow downward toward gravitational force. Make their body look like a pitfall trap. Their outer membranes of the body are bark/leather-like. \n\t\nSarlacc’s lifespan is incredibly long, estimated around 20,000 - 50,000 years. With such a long lifespan, Sarlacc has time to grow to the truly enormous size, up to a hundred meters in length. With such size, it is safe from most predators. Only Great Krayt dragon and Gouka dragon have been known to prey upon them. \n\tIt has been thought of as desert dweller organisms, in truth they prefer a more damped environment. However, they can do just fine in the desert due to their efficient roots.\n\n# Predation\nWith physiology different between adult and juvenile Sarlacc, the predation method of them are different. Juveniles, while not possessing enormous size, are much more agile. Their hunting method is a simple one. Chase their prey through sand, cough them, then eat them like typical carnivorous animals do.\nAs an adult, Sarlacc is an ambush predator. Using their odors to lure prey close enough to their maw for their tentacles to grab them.Their special shape fangs and mucus prevent prey from climbing up. Lastly, with a slightly moveable beak for more flexibility in feeding.\nMisconception about adult Sarlacc’s predation is that they primarily rely on their tentacles to grab prey into their pseudo-mouth(beak).In reality, Sarlacc uses odors to lure their preferred prey to them, not just waiting for their prey to accidentally stumble upon them.\n\n# Digestion\nSarlacc has 2 different stomachs to digest different kinds of prey, primary stomach and secondary stomach. Sarlacc can determine the size of prey through nerve endings inside their throat. Smaller prey would be sent to the primary stomach. The primary stomach is a big sack in which all of the non-dangerous animals would be held. For larger or more volatile prey, Sarlacc would send them to their secondary stomach. Secondary stomachs are private chambers, only for those specific prey. \n\tThe most disturbing part about Sarlacc’s digestion is how slow it is. Prey can be trapped inside the stomach and be kept alive for thousands of years. Normally, prey will be punctured by tentacles inside the stomach. These tentacles inject digestive enzymes and acid to slowly digest prey from the inside while its prey is also being soaked in mild acid. Pain from acid burn is not the only thing its prey would be subjected to. Sarlacc known to deliberately inject neurotoxins to its prey, made them suffer in agony. It does this to make its prey suffocate with pain and not attempt to escape. Prey suffered all of these while also being kept alive by Sarlacc. Through the same tentacles which inject acid and poisons into prey, they also inject nutrients back.\n\n# Reproduction\nTheir species females are normally much larger than their male counterparts. When they meet each other, the male would attach itself to the female in a parasitic fashion. After the reproduction, Sarlacc’s spore called “Sarlacci” will be released. These spores can travel through the void of space. This is the reason why finding Sarlacc’s origin is impossible to do. \nThese Sarlacci are also incredibly resilient. If not digested well enough, Sarlacc larva can hatch from Sarlacci. It will then digest its predator from inside out.\n\n","meta":{"index":37,"author":"nuariel","name":"Sarlacc","release_year":2022}},"Vultan":{"content":"# Article\nVultans were a near-human species known to have existed at least five thousand years before the Great Hyperspace War, their homeworld housing on the planet Vulta within the Mid Rim Territories.

This species was a sentient race and often adopted a peaceful disposition yet due to their large stature they sparingly found work as bodyguards. Their main sources of employment consisted of being Traders, Workmen and High-Quality Engineers.# Physiology\nHerglics were a bipedal race, with evolutionary origins tracing back to aquatic mammals, as such they retained a few traits from their aquatic ancestors. One such was their most prominent feature; their blow-holes. These holes were situated at the peak of their cranium and were used for breathing. The sound of such was so associated with the Herglic that it formed the basis for a common Herglese word, which was used to express the significance of a remark.\n\nAnother of the features of the Herglics’ physiology was their stature. This stature was a leftover trait from their large aquatic ancestors which carried over to the Herglic Race. As a result of this, the average male Herglic measured in size from 1.7 - 2.2 meters tall. However, This height did not solely compromise the Herglics’ stature, additionally the Herglic were incredibly well-built, featuring broad shoulders and thighs accompanied by dense muscles and thick skin. \n\nSuch skin was another highlighting physical feature of the Herglic, akin to their aquatic ancestors the Herglic possessed thick, blubbery skin. Upon this, the skin was usually light blue in colour yet ranged all the way darker to fully black. Exceptions to this rule existed, however, such as was the case with Hamar-Chatak, a Herglic merchant who had pale pink skin.\n\n# Galactic Reach\nSome time prior to 27,500 BBY the Herglics developed hyperdrive technology, using this they would go on to colonise surrounding worlds and form trading networks along the newly christened Herglic Empire which resided in the aptly named Herglic Space. [See the Article on the Planet Giju for more information regarding these events]. Due to the great reach of the Herglic Empire prior to the unification with the Republic, vast amounts of Herglics would make residence within the planets along the Rinma Trade Route. These Herglics would make up a minority of the population on these planets and would usually live separated from other races due to the different needs of the Herglics when compared to other bipedal species. As such, Herglics tended to form communities on the outskirts of towns and cities known as Pakks, however despite disadvantageous to themselves the Herglics did not abstain from contact with other races, Herglics were effective traders and technical workmen, their skills as engineers so great that even Hutt Cartel associated groups would seek out Herglic engineers.\n\n","meta":{"index":86,"author":"ard1974","name":"Herglic","release_year":2022}},"Qom Jha and Qom Qae":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Qom Jha and Qom Qae species were sentient flying species that lived in the canyons and caves of the planet Nirauan. Their wings spanned up to a metre long when full-grown and appeared like bats. Although usually referred to together, Qom Jha and Qom Qae had a few differences; the Qom Qae was apt for nesting on the highest peaks with their smaller size and browner texture, whereas the Qom Jha was naturally larger and darker, giving better adaptation in the cave environment. Both species were quite intelligent, adventurous and had a social structure where adults would have specific roles within their nestings, led by a Bargainer. Only after they specialised in jobs for their herd did they obtain an adulthood name. For example, \"Builder With Vines\" was an adult, as opposed to the straightforward \"Child of [Parent's name]\" that was its childhood name. Whilst the adults of nestings were highly territorial against adults of other nestings, the children were allowed to roam free, often as scouts and ambassadors.# Presence in the Galaxy\nEven though the Qom Jha and Qom Qae were slightly Force-Sensitive sentient species able to communicate via telepathy, the secretive Chiss species viewed them as pests. The avian species were somewhat aware of the existence of the Empire, New Republic, and the Jedi.

This helped them evolve and over time they started hunting the Ysalamir. However, there was an adverse effect that caused them to think that Force-sensitives were prey too. To protect against this, the Ysalamiri experimented and created the ability to project a Force bubble and no Force abilities could be used inside this bubble. The Vornskr were nocturnal hunters and used their whip-like, venom-filled tails to stun their prey. They would then seal the deal with their teeth. Although usually dormant during the day, hunger or a potential danger would cause them to switch to diurnal hunting.# Section One\nTyber Zann trained such creatures in his consortium, aptly dubbed the Zann Consortium. He took the younger of the species away from their home and disciplined them to be effective hunters, so no enemy troops would be able to escape. A smuggler by the name of Talon Karrde had two vornskrs that he named Sturm and Drang. Sturm and Drang served as pets and guards; however, Karrde thought of selling them as guard animals. He also discovered that if you cut off their tail, it was similar to castration since it reduced most of their hunting aggression. He apparently did this by accident when he shot off Sturm’s tail in self defense. This discovery was even written about in an article of the Galactic Zoology Monthly. He also mentioned that the Vornskrs were easier to control when removing a frequently used weapon.\n\n# Section Two\nDuring the Peace Brigade attack in the Invasion of Yavin IV, Talon Karrde outsmarted the Peace Brigade by tricking them to Kam and Tionne Solusar. He did this by ordering two vornskrs to find the Jedi and later letting them follow the trail they had left. During the hunt, Karrde convinced the Peace Brigade that he was the owner of the last two remaining vornskrs. The members of the Peace Brigade fell for his lies. However, the Yuuzhan Vong were informed by a New Republic Senator by the name of Viqi Shesh that plentiful vornskrs originated from Myrkr. The Yuuzhan Vong proceeded to use the species as a biological template for a new species called the Voxyn. Vornskrs were also used as guards in the Dark Force Temple on Dromund Kaas.\n\n","meta":{"index":88,"author":"ElysiaLValkyrie","name":"Vornskr","release_year":2023}},"Abominor":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Abominors were immense droids that were composed of many different tubings as well as complex assorted parts of other droids. One of the only members of this species that was studied in depth was shown to be filled with bouncing pistons beating in an excruciatingly off putting rhythm, and its arm chopped off. It didn’t seem to bother the entity in the slightest. It seems that it also bore an entire droid haven within it, luring them into a false sense of security before feasting upon them from the inside. Using “oil baths”, as his digestive fluids to add to its own immense structure.# Biology\nAn Abominor has massive boilers filled with fuel which often relied on moisture drained away from a planet's life forms to cool its immense internal machinery. However, this process often plunged the planet into a drought or famine and caused great hardship for the inhabitants. Abominors also kept organic slaves and used them to fill their massive boilers. For obvious reasons, they hardly care for such things, given that they can grow to absurdly large proportions, some even reaching the size of actual planets. \n\nTheir mouths are filled with enormous grinding blades, and they seem to be assisted by tiny mechanical robots living in its robotic maw, like worms living in a mammal's stomach, feeding off its excess.  The most interesting part about the Abominor is the fact that, if they eventually get destroyed, one skilled enough can rebuild a highly advanced droid from just a handful of his precious mechanical parts. It is to be noted that even after advanced programming and further attempts to properly control the recently made droid, they will always return to their more primal Abominorian side and seek to rebuild pieces of themselves before regaining control over their main body.\n\n# Culture and Society\nTheir culture was based on asymmetry and chaos which conflicted with that of the symmetrical Silentium, another sentient droid species. Their conflict seemed to be immemorial, and we are unable to find more information on the conflict itself, since they come from the same galaxy the Yuuzhan Vong came from. The two robotic species fought a massive war that culminated with their very galaxy becoming devastated by the conflict, becoming a cosmic wasteland. \n\nThe Abominors were such a dangerous species that they even came close to subduing the Yuuzhan Vong species as a whole. Eventually, because of how intense the conflict had become and because the Galaxy itself was on the brink of total destruction, the organics of the galaxy, who had been ignored by the machines and only viewed as collateral damage, rose up and waged war on both races. After centuries of war, both droid civilizations were forced to flee into the Unknown Regions of another galaxy where they re-established their civilizations, keeping out of the affairs of that galaxy most of the time.\n\nIt is to be noted that their earlier actions in the Silentium-Abominor War are also indirectly responsible for the Yuuzhan Vong War, as the Vong's technophobia has its roots from this very conflict, and lead to their desperation into using organics to drive out both the Silentium and Abominor species and, eventually, becoming conquerors. \n\nAs for their opinion on Organics, Abominors clearly had little to no care for them, and saw organics as cattle, or slaves, at the best. Being entirely mechanical and having little need for flesh in any way, they mostly ignored organics and would not hesitate to destroy healthy planets with inhabitants on them as bringers of Chaos, according to their ways. They have no opinion on the Force, since they hail from a galaxy where Midichlorians do not exist.\n\n# Addendum\nA handful of Sith engineers managed to exchange with the only Abominor we ever encountered while it was repairing itself. Note the opinion it has on force users in general, and the Force itself.\n\nAs the Five masked Dark Side users approached the gargantuan mechanical beast, the one in front of them all, presumably the leader, raised their hand and seemingly signaled to advance with the utmost care, for the robotic monstrosity was clearly aware of their approach, for its sinister eyes gave out an unnerving glint while following on  every mood of the leader.\n\nTeam Leader (Sith #1): What even are you, creature. We do not come to slay you, but seek more information on you.\n\nAbominor: You could not slay me even if you wanted to, Organic. I’ve feasted upon many planets that held your kind before, and I’ve never cared in the slightest. You are like the wind for your own kind: passing and barely noticeable. You exist, and that’s the extent of my opinion of you, for why would you care for ants yourself.\n\nTeam Leader (Sith #1): So you think of us as weaklings? Not all organics are weak. Some have quite the uncanny abilities, and you may want to be careful, Droid, for, in the end, you are but a machine, and many abilities of the Dark Side can easily shred robotics parts like the most brittle of stones.\n\nTo prove his point, the Squad leader raised an arm and pointed two digits towards the Abominor, only for massive bolts of lightning to erupt from his fingertips, scorching a small portion of the Robot’s arms, before proceeding to tear out an entire finger of it. As a reaction, a loud crackle could be heard, in successive patterns, for its spike-filled maw was rapidly clashing with each other, making a horrifying clanking noise repeatedly. Was it… chuckling?\n\nAbominor: IRRELEVANT. The Esoteric force has no lasting effects on my kind. You may start to attack one of my species, it’ll end with a planet being consumed. It is surprising to see an organic use.. Lightning and telepathy, but expected.\n\nTeam Leader (Sith #1): Are you mocking the Power of the Dark Side of the Force?\n\nAbominor: Correction. I do not know what this Force you speak of is. But I guarantee you it does not exist within the Galaxy our kind comes from, nor would it have been powerful enough to stop us. If that is the extent of this Dark Side of the Force you speak of, then at our peak, my kind would’ve easily consumed this Galaxy without any effort.\n\nTeam Leader (Sith #1): We shall see about that.\n\nAbominor: Rebuttal. We shall not. It was interesting talking to you about organics, but as I said, our kind does not care for flesh users. I humored you to pass the time while my tendrils reached deep within the core of this rock. I thank you for this knowledge of the Force, even if useless. I shall not bid you my farewell.\n\nBefore the Siths could even react, the planet’s very core shook before the entirety of the globe started to tear itself down, as it began to get consumed by the Abominor. The record was stopped only after hearing screams and unearthly sounds.\n\n","meta":{"index":35,"author":"IppeiFTW","name":"Abominor","release_year":2022}},"Zygerrian":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Zygerrian were a sentient humanoid species that lived on the planet Zygerria. They evolved from an unidentified sentient canine species with horns, leading to their feline appearance. Their iconic ears inspired a hairstyle known to be worn by a Kanjiklubber, Razoo Qin-Fee, at Nar Kanji’s underground fighting circuit. Their society was split into classes of clans, ruled by a queen with an idealism towards slavery, holding the Royal Slave Auction to instigate a slave market boom. Those in higher classes were distinguished by bright, distinct clothing instead of the regular dark-coloured commonly worn. They were known as notorious slavers in the galaxy, often equipped with shock whips, electrostaffs and Zygerrian blaster rifles to control their assets of all kinds. Zygerrian traders and royal guards wore armour, reflecting their warlike nature.# History\nIn times of the first Galactic Republic, the Zygerrian Slave Empire flourished, benefiting both the Zygerrian and their buyers. Access to the Triellus Trade Route allowed business and distribution of the Twi’lek people. Eventually, the empire received opposition from the growing Jedi Order presence and was forced into the shadows, which commenced Zygerrian hatred towards the self-righteous knights. Although outlawed by the Jedi, Zygerrian slaving traditions were continued through the Zygerrian Alliance of the High Republic.\nDuring the Clone Wars, there was a futile attempt to revive its former status in a plot by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However, it was halted again by the Jedi, who managed to liberate the enslaved people, and a betrayal was enacted by Count Dooku, who killed the Zygerrian queen, Miraj Scintel.\nFollowing Scintel’s death, Zygerrian King Molec was crowned and led a comeback for the Zygerrians in the Imperial Era after brokering a deal with Galactic Emperor Palpatine for freedom in return for restricting their slaving operations to the Outer Rim. This led to the increase of Zygerrian significance in the galaxy. MaDall led a small slave empire on Oon, while Raney led a similar group on Ord Mantell. The Zygerrian Slavers Guild was later established on their homeworld upon favourable imperial law reforms. Furthermore, the activity grew with the advent of the New Republic.\n\n","meta":{"index":52,"author":"AnimatedEcrux","name":"Zygerrian","release_year":2023}},"Rodians":{"content":"# Introduction\nRodians were humanoid green-skinned creatures that resembled reptilians.

Some roadians were dedicated to bounty hunting and informants for the galactic empire.# Description\nThe rodians possessed large eyes that lacked pupils, meaning they could see the infrared spectrum. They also had antennae that had a weird twin-saucer shape that could detect vibrations. Their antennae were located at the top of their head. Rodians also used to have relatively small snouts, pointy ears, and a spine-shaped ridge surrounding their skulls.\nThey mostly had scales resembling green but could also be red, yellow or turquoise. Their skin had a pebble-like texture and a rough texture on top of it. Their hands had five strong and long fingers with suction-like cups at the end of the fingers. The pads assisted them with the diverse conditions they had to go through by living in swamps and they used it for climbing. The shape of their hands was rather bizarre as if it would be an object that a human would feel uncomfortable using. Their toes were also similar to their fingers.

This was important to the culture and species as a whole since the crest would continue to grow as the Vurk did, signifying to many species who saw them who the elders were of this species and who were younger if size alone did not do it.# History\nVurk were believed to be a very primitive species but were highly empathetic and skilled mediators. Being they were inclined with inner peace and empathetic to all, some would go further and become Jedi such as the notable Jedi Master Coleman Trebor.

The planet was soon dubbed Iokath. Since the name of said species has been lost to time, they are now called the Iokath species. They reached a height of two metres and were renowned for having larger heads than other humanoid species.\nThe Iokath species were a technological race; its social structure comprised scientists, engineers, analysts, and designers who spent centuries developing Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMPs), answering to only the Master Designers Council. In their endeavours to create power WMPs, they didn't hesitate to test them on live species. It is said that over 70 worlds were destroyed, and trillions of people lost their lives due to this, despite their non-violent and expansionist nature. In some cases, they even provided help for survivors of their tests to rebuild what they lost, only to test their WMP on them again several centuries later. Eventually, in the later era of their species, the Iokath species relied on simulations to carry out tests.# Technological Demise\nTheir technology developed exponentially over time. An example of this was the creation of the Eternal Fleet and GEMINI droid captains, a deadly combination that featured cloaking technology, full automation, and an overwhelming arsenal. Ironically, the Iokath species were also responsible for creating the Gravestone, a massive combat frigate able to destroy the Eternal Fleet. In addition to this, they made several droids, such as the Old Gods and SCORPIO.\nA civil war broke out on Iokath, which saw the creators unleashing their WMPs upon each other. In an attempt to save their technology, it was driven away from the conflict into Wild Space. However, one side of this battle caught hold of and released the Old Gods, which counterproductively led to the ensuing planetary-scale destruction and the conclusion of the Iokath species.

These hulking, pig-like humanoids possess a unique combination of features. The Gamorreans most recognizable feature is their green skin tone. Their complexions range from various shades of greens, with some individuals displaying darker or lighter hues. Their faces are adorned with beady, dark-colored eyes that convey a predator gaze. The most prominent feature is their snout-like snout that protrudes from the front of their faces.

The upper echelons of the Kaminoan species often wore a pale collar around their elongated necks. The Kaminoans were the creators of the technique of cloning, and the founders of the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. The conflict was named after the clone troopers made by the Kaminoans to fight against the Separatist Droid Army, for the sake of the Galactic Republic.# Biology And Appearance\nTheir evolution from aquatic, oceanic creatures was clearly visible: they had a tall shape, glassy eyes and digitigrade slender legs. The eyes of the Kaminoans had the shape of an almond, and were said to be able to see the colors in the Ultraviolet spectrum. The white dwellings in their eyes were, in fact, colored with shades that multiple other species were unable to see. Kaminoans were able to reach adulthood by the age of 11, and their adult physical prime at 40. They usually started showing signs of aging around 80, but one genetically-modified Kaminoan, Kina Ha, lived for over 3000 years. Female Kaminoans were bald, while males had headcrests and fin ridges with their skulls.\n\n# History\nAfter a disastrous ice age on Kamino, called the Great Flood, Kaminoan society was pushed to the brink of extinction. However, through extensive development and mastery of selective breeding, genetics and cloning, the Kaminoans were able to continue existing. Quickly after, they started offering their cloning services in return for essential imports. The select few clients that traded with the Kaminoans received the perfect clones to suit their needs. Though, the Kaminoans didn’t think anything of the clones slaving away outside of their homes, as they only cared about scientific improvement. Their most infamous work was designing and developing the Galactic Republic’s clone army. The Kaminoans produced and trained a massive amount of clone troopers for the Republic, using bounty hunter Jango Fett as their template. Their world would be then targeted by the Separatists to end the supply of clone soldiers. However, the Kaminoans defeated them. When they first started experimenting on Jango’s genetics, they produced 12 specimens, now classified as “Null”. As they were too intelligent and independent to be used by the Republic’s Army, the Kaminoans wanted to terminate them, but Kal Skirata managed to save most of the 6 remaining clones and trained them. Due to their actions during the Clone Wars, the Kaminoans were awarded a seat in the Galactic Senate, with Senator Halle Burtoni as their representative. After the First Battle of Kamino, the cloning facilities kept creating more troopers for the Galactic Republic. However, after Order 66, Kamino’s facilities would be taken over by the Empire. Tired of the Imperial rule, some Kaminoans tried making a new, more efficient clone army, better than even the Grand Army. However, Darth Vader became aware of this plot and sent the 501st legion to eliminate the army. After the destruction of the Galactic Empire, the Kaminoans joined the New Republic. Their species flourished and even aided in the fight against the Yuuzhan Vong.\n\n# Society And Culture\nThe Kaminoans saw themselves as superior lifeforms, but still remained polite. They respected all species bent on self-improvement, and considered those who were not inferior. There wasn’t much known about inner Kaminoan society, but there was a dance known as Nahra, which would be one of the only ways to see their emotions. While the Kaminoans put great care into their work, they considered it just a product. Their castes depended on their eye colors: gray for the upper classes, yellow for the medium classes and blue for the lower classes. Sometimes Kaminoans were born with green eyes, but they were seen as genetically inferior and a threat to their society. For this reason, they were eliminated shortly after birth. There were also different organizations, such as the Kaminoan Ascetics or the Kaminoan Armorsmiths. The Kaminoans could also be Force-sensitives.\n\n","meta":{"index":53,"author":"SpawnKiller1326","name":"Kaminoan","release_year":2022}},"Vulptereen":{"content":"# Appearance\nThe average Vulptereen had a total of six tusks that would protrude outward from their snout.

This resulted in the Vulptereen to develop more of an echolocation.

Extremely related to the dark side of the force, Terentatek presence is oftentimes an indicator of great Sith predominance across the galaxy.# History\nDespite their tendency to the dark side, surprisingly Terentateks were originally a result of Jedi Alchemy. A predecessor creature known as the Terenta was created by Jedi Master Quan-Jang to track explosives, although due to being fed force-enriched meat, ended up developing a craving for Force Sensitives’ flesh. Following this, they would be abandoned on one of Tython’s moons, Bogan. \n\nThey would be encountered again centuries later on the planet of Dromund Kaas. Following this, the Sith Lord Exar Kun would start creating Terentateks through Sith Alchemy due to their natural predation of Jedi and force resistance. These creatures would quickly become known as the most dangerous creature bred by the Sith, earning the name of “Jedi Killers”, and being used to destroy Jedi outposts on Tython, Tatooine, and Kashyyyk. Due to this, the Jedi would eventually attempt to exterminate the Terentatek in an event known as The Great Hunt, in which groups of Jedi would hunt these creatures across the galaxy. While the hunt was a modest success, Terentateks still managed to return whenever the Sith’s rule strengthened across the galaxy, such as during the rule of Darth Revan, and Darth Sidious.\n\n# Characteristics\nThey’re bipedal carnivores, which are quite similar to rancors in appearance, albeit much smaller. They have two large tusks at the sides of their mouth and long, sharp claws which are both extremely poisonous. A Terentatek’s hide is also resistant (if not immune) to the effects of the Force. \n\nThey are naturally drawn to inhabit locations that have a strong connection to the dark side of the force, such as caves or Sith Tombs.

During the auction, the Ezaraa offered 0.00001% of their Imperial revenue for the doctor and her following ten descendants, threatening to torture them should she decline. Forced to lie, the host said the offer would be considered. To demonstrate the power of the Eternal Rur, the doctor allowed it to possess a droid of the Cyban Front, which was quickly shot down and sent for repair. Before the auction could be helpful for the Ezaraa, the doctor’s accompanying Imperial droids, 0-0-0 and BT-1, inserted the Eternal Rur back into the droid and armed it with two lightsabers, all in retaliation against their rogue master. They also alerted Darth Vader to force the doctor to give them freedom. The Eternal Rur escaped its container and promised to seek revenge on those who attempted to buy it. In typical Ezaara fashion, the Ezaara opened fire at the possessed droid to retrieve the crystal.

The first Rakghouls were created through the Muur Talisman, an amulet able to convert any non-force sensitive sentient beings into these creatures. Rakghouls are also able to multiply through the Rakghoul plague: a virus that spreads through their bites and scratches and begins a slow and agonizing transformation process into these creatures.# Origins\nRakghouls were created by the ancient Sith Lord Karness Muur, as he desired an army to rule over as well as a way to persist after death. He achieved this by forging the talisman, imbuing it with his spirit and power. While the Muur Talisman couldn’t transform certain individuals directly, the Rakghoul plague had no limits on the subjects it could infect, making it a near-unstoppable weapon. Due to the amulet’s concerning power, Karness was killed by his rivals, and the Muur Talisman was stolen.\n\n# History\nThe talisman would end up being passed upon many Sith, before ending up in Taris’ impoverished Undercity, in which the Rakghoul plague would run rampant for many years. Despite millions of people infected, the planet eventually managed to remove Rakghoul’s presence completely (following the creation of a Rakghoul serum which interrupted and reverted transformation) which brought to their extinction. Such extinction was only temporary though, as the talisman would be found and retrieved by Jedi Knight Celeste Morne, before being abandoned for four thousand years and reclaimed by Sith Lord Remulus Dreypa. She would then proceed to use the Muur Talisman’s powers against the current Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Krayt and attempt to kill him but ended up being overpowered by Muur’s spirit. She would then be struck down by Cade Skywalker, who resisted the talisman’s influence and destroyed it, finally bringing an end to the Rakghoul.\n\n# Characteristics\nExtremely repugnant and with animal-like instincts, these creatures are naturally mindless and feel nothing more than a constant craving for flesh. They have no hierarchy, although they usually hunt in packs ranging from four to eight. They are extremely aggressive, hardy, and vicious. \nThe only occasion in which their personality changed was when they were under the influence of the Muur Talisman, in which the amulet’s holder could control and command any nearby Rakghoul at their will. Their animal instincts would also subside, and they would be more similar to their personality before transformation, being able to use any former combat knowledge.\n\n","meta":{"index":23,"author":"CrazyMaRKuLsIO","name":"Rakghoul","release_year":2022}},"Dressellians":{"content":"# Overview\nDressellians were a sentient species that were natives of the planet Dressel. They had hairless heads and wrinkled features and craniums. They peacefully isolated themselves from the Galactic Civil War to avoid any conflicts. Many Dressellians will eventually join the Rebel Alliance following the Galactic Republic’s demise, which they were very loyal followers of. Following the conclusion of the Imperial Senate, the Rebel Alliance’s Commander-in-Chief Mon Mothma jotted in a journal entry in the Rebel Files that she considered many of the Dressellians population vulnerable and that they should take in refugees. A Dressellian resistance fighter by the name of Lokmarcha, was a Major in the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. Dressel’s isolation ended after the Galactic Empire took control of their system by 10 BBY. The Imperials would descend on the planet, setting up bases to exploit and steal Dressel’s natural resources. Despite the Dressellian’s having very little political organization and barely any industrial level technology, they would begin to form a Resistance Movement against the Empire. At first, the Resistance would have little effect upon the Imperials, but as time went on, the Dressellians would become accustomed to many forms of guerilla warfare, making the Resistance very costly for the Empire. Later on, the Bothans will support the Dressellian resistance by smuggling equipment, weapons, and even mercenaries to train the Dressellians. Designed during this period was a Dressellian projectile rifle, that was produced in large numbers and used to great effect. As tension built up for the Imperials, they would eventually decide it was not worth the cost, abandoning the planet of Dressel. After liberating their homeworld, the Dressellians will return to their previous form of isolation from the Galaxy, with most of the former underground leaders becoming the most prominent leaders of their loosely held participatory democracies.","meta":{"index":13,"author":"PhaseSpectr","name":"Dressellians","release_year":2022}},"Anzat":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Anzat were humanoid, dangerous, Force sensitive species whose unique characteristic was having  two tentacle-like extensions that curled out and extended from their cheeks and which they used to feed on their prey's brains. They had an extremely long life expectancy and possessed far greater regeneration capabilities than other humanoid species. They were telepathic and were far more adept in mind controlling than any others.# Biology and Appearance\nTheir appearance was very similar to that of a human but with slight changes such as bulbous noses, flared nostrils, and grayish-hued skin. Their height ranged between 1.5 to 1.7 meters and they had no natural biorhythm which means no pulse and no body heat, therefore they were considered a mystery.\nThey were far more advanced than any other civilization being capable of exploring the world when the core worlds only had the dream of doing it. They could live for centuries but if they didn't eat their aging process would fastly accelerate making them die of old age if they dont eat regularly. Due to them being superior to others, their strength was admirable and their physical capabilities were far greater than those of an ordinary human. However this was just a little part of their true strength, as they had developed very sensible organs and sensory organs that permitted them to sense the life essence in others and drain it. Even if they didn’t actually use the Force, they had the capability of using mind tricks such as the Jedi and were experts in it. The “soup” as they called it, was the life essence they took out of their victims and they were very strict on how they did it. The truth was they were somehow draining the Force from their prey but it was never understood how they actually did this.\n\n# Society and culture\nTheir need for “soup” was the central point in which the Anzat life stood upon. They could be considered as addicts because once the hunt began, nothing else mattered, only feeding with soup. As Anzati grew older its need for eating increased and their isolation was made even bigger. The elder Anzati were mentally unstable, many times insane and couldn’t hold themselves back when they were hungry. These singular needs made them so unstable that in the end they destroyed themselves. Inside the Anzat there was a group of them that believed the soup gave them eternal youth and energy, a belief that can be traced back to the Silent Voices and that just demonstrates the importance of “soup” in their society. They didn´t reproduce frequently as it was normal in long living species and didn't even name their children as they didn’t care and only cared about soup and the children once reached puberty, which would be 100 years, left their home in search of soup. A very common misconception was having them as great scholars and knowledge keepers, when the truth was they only knew things because of how much they lived but weren’t interested in learning anything. However, they were great hunters as their physical capabilities made them far superior than their prey and easy for them to hunt. That is one of the reasons most of them were also assassins to presumably earn credits but due to their anonymance it was never known truly why they did. One of the greatest mysteries about the Anzati’s was their origin as it was never known, not even in myths and old writings; and it was speculated that they were the oldest species that habited the galaxy.\n\n","meta":{"index":71,"author":"Craked10","name":"Anzat","release_year":2023}},"Togorian":{"content":"# Overview\nTogorians were a feline warrior species from the planet Togoria, they were known for often interacting with Mandalorians. Physically, they were incredibly large bipeds, averaging 2.2 meters tall for females and 3 meters for males. They were covered in gray-to-black black fur with stripes and had an extremely dense bone structure which allowed them to sustain heavy physical hits.# History\nThey first appeared on the planet of Togoria, evolving as nomadic hunters. Another very widespread species were the winged creatures known as Mosgoths, which  often flew for transportation. As they developed over time, Togorian society split between males and females: the males choosing to retain their nomadic lifestyle, and the females wishing to settle down and develop. As both members of the species were too stubborn to come to an agreement, it ended up with tribes of Togorian males continuing as hunter-gatherers, while Togorian females settled down in large cities, the two different worlds only meeting together for about a month every year. Males rarely left their homeworld, though a few became pirates and mercenaries, or were forced off-world to find their missing mate. They often despised all outsiders on their planet, especially droids and imperial stormtroopers. They did return mutual respect though and have honored during their encounters people like Han Solo and Mammon Hoole. Instead, Togorian females enjoyed conversing and trading with outsiders, and had a common enjoyment for luxury. They were first discovered as a species when Mandalorians attempted to conquer the planet of Togoria.

It is presumed that these beings also originated from the planet Korriban just like many other native Sith that were also thought to exist during 100,000 BBY. This species of Sith would be well accustomed to the practices of Sith magic, alchemy, and studied the Dark Side of The Force to their fullest extent, also holding a great deal of force sensitivity attuned to the Dark Side. With their observant and intelligent nature, it is easily perceived that the Kissai resided within the priest class of Sith social hierarchy. Just like their warrior Massassi counterparts, these priests would adhere more to their instincts regarding The Force, though they did not possess the same physical traits of Massassi and what they lacked for that, they made up with their superior intelligence. Like the rest of the Sith species that existed, these sorcerers would experience a mass amount of change among their society, culture, and even beliefs throughout history.# Appearance/Biology\nAverage Kissai would stand 1.8 meters tall. In relation to sentients in Sith classification as a whole, these Sith would have humanoid appearance and also display crimson-like skin tone ranging from the darkest of red shades to the lighter shades of pink. Unlike the Massassi, this priest counterpart would possess a pair of yellow eyes. They also had tendrils that would hang from their cheekbones, predacious facial features, but also possessed human-like noses, mouths, and ears with bone spurs that would cover a good portion of the different parts of their bodies. These philosophical and intelligent beings averagely lived up to 60 years. Some did in fact live to be much older and would be considered the wisest of their species for such a superior life span. With all the time that progressed, the Kissai never met newer biological changes that altered the species as a whole, instead, interbreeding with the Dark Jedi during the Hundred Year Darkness gave rise to more notable half-bred Sith Lords like Naga Sadow and Marka Ragnos, two beings that would accomplish great feats among the Sith.\n\n# Culture/Tradition\nKissai put significant trust into the Dark Side of The Force, attempting to follow their instincts that would act as guidance. Being a species of Sith, Kissai would adopt a ruthless nature but composed themselves as insightful and intelligent. They did not go as far as demanding sacrifice as a part of their tradition, instead, they engaged in practices of Sith Magic and alchemy which assisted the Dark Jedi in building their Empire by the time the Kissai were enslaved. Opposed to falling towards biological change like the Massassi, these priests saw changes to their tradition, philosophy, and culture as a whole. A new set of principles were introduced to this species during their slavery that entailed utter loyalty towards those that commanded them, specifically the Dark Jedi. Principles such as these were established and made mandatory as a result of their slavery. The slavery they underwent was not the only event that would alter the beliefs of Kissai, as their new beliefs that abandoned the Dark Side was founded by the Sorcerers of Tund.\n\n# History (Invasion of Korriban)\nThe Rakata that governed the Infinite Empire would invade Korriban in 27,700 BBY seeking to enslave the Sith to use them for their Rakatan projects. Sith King Adas would lead his people into battle with the Rakata eventually pushing them off the planet of Korriban. Adas would meet his death in battle, as a result, the Sith retreated off the planet due to concerns of other another possible invasion. Kissai, along with their other relative species, would make their way to the planet Ziost. On this planet, the Kissai would engage in conflict to fight for the position of Sith’ari to establish order within the society of the Sith once more. Nonetheless, oversight of reconstruction to benefit the Sith would fall to the hands of the Kissai. Some of these priests would refuse to remain loyal to their tradition and principles as a result of their former Sith King meeting his demise. Instead of rebuilding, some of these Kissai chose to halt their traditional practices towards the Dark Side of The Force. They would be deemed as heretical leading to their exile from their homeworld, choosing to cohere with those that also held their instincts that guided them to the planet Tund.\n\n# History (Hundred-Year Darkness)\nUpon entering the world of Korriban in 6900 BBY, the Dark Jedi led by Ajunta Pall and a select few others posed extreme prowess in their usage of The Force towards the native species. Due to this, the majority of the native Sith praised these exiles as Gods. Pall’s status as the new Sith’ari coaxed the Kissai away from Ziost to join his Sith Empire as his loyal servants. Studies were conducted on the species in order to formulate a better army to eventually seek conquest over the galaxy. Kissai were well involved in the acts of interbreeding and because of this, produced powerful half-breeds such as Naga Sadow and Marka Ragnos. Stature that was provided to these soon-to-rise Sith Lords came from their priest nature given to them from their interbreeding with the Kissai and is presumed to be a reason as to how they paved their way into God status that would be followed for the rest of near eternity.\n\n# History (Sorcerers of Tund)\nThe Kissai that chose to drop their beliefs regarding the Dark Side of The Force were exiled from Ziost so that they may follow their instinct that led them to Tund. Upon arriving in the world of Tund, this society created the Sorcerers of Tund, a group of Sith Sorcerers most known for their skills in the arts of deception, alchemy, illusion, shapeshifting, and other magic. Followers of this new society, specifically the Kissai, no longer turned to the Dark Side to provide strength and enlightenment despite the attunement they expressed towards it. Their tradition stressed that life should be speculated with great harmony and that opposites only existed in illusions. Foreigners were not accepted into this new philosophy formed by the Kissai, but these philosophers integrated the Missassi and Kissai into their practices that were cast aside as a result of the conflicts amongst the galaxy. These sorcerers would continue to thrive for generations to come until Rokur Gepta, a force sensitive croke and Sorcerer of Tund sought to deceive the Kissai for their knowledge. After learning all he could, Rokur Gepta used a biological agent to destroy the world of Tund and its life forms along with the Kissai that resided within. There prevails no records of Kissai extinction but those that appeared to remain alive from the series of wars and destruction across the galaxy lived out the rest of their life as they pleased.\n\n","meta":{"index":46,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Kissai","release_year":2022}},"Cantrosian":{"content":"# Overview\nCantrosians are a sentient bipedal species very similar to domestic cats.

Those tall creatures which were 2-3 Meters on average live underground, near the core. They are proficient burrowers and are rarely seen on the surface, instead lurking underneath the ground, ready to feast on unlucky outlanders. They are the lesser known species inhabiting the planet, greatly overshadowed by the Diathim.# Biology\nIt is said that the Maelibi have striking similarities with the Diathim yet do not possess wings. They have a humanoid body that seems to be formed from actual molten gold. Just like the Diathim, they are Force Sensitive. Their skin is incredibly hard to pierce but also reflective, making blaster shots all but useless against them. Contact with concentrated beams of energy (like Lightsabers) are reflected off of their skin. They can even survive the vacuum of space. They have claws on the tip of each of their three fingers, and possess sharp teeth; but the reason why they are labeled as demons, clearly hail from their dual sets of horns. They are known to be incredibly well versed in the art of burrowing, but also have displayed immense speed and strength while doing so. \n\nIt is evident that they are also amazing fighters, being able to fight underground with very poor visibility and lighting, thus making this another proof of their ability to easily navigate while robbed of most of their basic senses. Their more terrifying ability is their unholy hypnotic singing ability specifically designed to disrupt brainwaves, triggering an hypnotic trance-like state in even the mightiest of sentients. The very few who managed to survive an encounter with the Maelibi have expressed many things about how their voice is that of an angel, and how their vocal chords can produce sounds akin to the “Embodiment of music”. It is to be noted that so far, none has been able to resist this cursed siren call, for most people drawn in to those sounds, end up being prey to the demons, who burst out of their burrows and drag them underneath the surface, only to then proceed to feast on their victim alive.\n\n# Society and Culture\nAs an extremely aggressive species, there isn’t much known about the Maelibi besides the information above. So far, a handful of contacts have been made, but as a species that is known for its predatory behaviors and its refusal to leave its own planet while being fully sentient and immune to the vacuum of space, they clearly see any outlander as prey to consume. They seem to be highly intelligent and their underground system of burrows is complex and literally a maze for any outlander. Even the Diathim aren’t safe, and mostly are tolerated as some sort of forced sharing of the planet.\n\n# Recovered Audio Logs\nBelow are the recovered logs of two Siths attempting to learn more about this species.\n\nThe master and the apprentice remained still after feeling something odd within the force. They could sense them. They seemed to be.. Everywhere. Was it the planet itself that was messing with their senses? Or was it the fact that they were underneath the ground, near the core, and oh so well aware of the two dark side users that were obviously not native to this land. As they carefully started to venture towards another location, an unusual sound was suddenly heard through the receiver. Like that of the ground collapsing in front of them. This was the entrance of one of the many burrows the Maelibi were known for making in a moment’s notice.\n\nThe Master: Careful, my apprentice, for we are dealing with a force that may just feast upon your insides the second you falter. This shall be a test of will, but also of might. Ready yourself.\n\nThe Apprentice: Yes, my master.\n\nNot even a few meters in, an intricate set of high and low pitches sounds can be heard around them.\n\nThe Apprentice: My master, can you hear-\n\nThe Master: This song. What is this?\n\nThe Apprentice: It’s.. Beautiful.\n\nThe Master: Never would I have thought that such angelic sounds could ever be..\n\nAfter this, any verbal communication with the two Siths was lost, instead simply hearing the noise getting slightly louder as the two siths approached the source of it. Not even a minute later, a large burrowing sound was heard, the high and low pitched noises, now labeled as Siren Song, being suddenly much louder, followed by the screams of both Siths before losing contact with the team.\n\n","meta":{"index":38,"author":"IppeiFTW","name":"Maelibus","release_year":2022}},"Trianii":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Trianii were an advanced sentient felinoid species, originating from the world of Trian.

These considered founders were few of the most technologically advanced peoples in the galaxy during their height, becoming the progenitors of hyperspace travel and hyperdrive technologies. Their technology in particular was special yet peculiar, due to its reliance on the Force as a powering capacity drawing from the Dark Side, which would mold its society into a brutal, arrogant, and terrible species. The Rakata’s Force-driven technology became a fundamental asset in their conquests throughout the galaxy, turning prominent as a warmongering and enslaving sect forming the Infinite Empire as the first sole power of the galaxy. Hundreds upon hundreds of systems belonged to the Rakata, most were terraformed to meet their ends and hundreds of species were wiped out by their savagery.# History and Conquests\nThe Rakata’s roots were humble and primitive, situated in the temperate and luscious planet of Lehon. These individuals remained in relative primitivity until the arrival and first contact with the Kwa, a strange yet benevolent people. The Kwa arrived utilizing their Infinite Gate, a technology that allowed them to travel great distances across the galaxy in a mere instant. The Kwa would become the Rakata’s sponsors granting them access to advanced technologies and more importantly, knowledge about the Force. \n\nBy this time before 36,400 BBY, the Celestials would be the preeminent galactic civilization and themselves backs of the Kwa. They made the Rakata their own slave race, utilizing them to whatever means. It was not long before the Kwa realized their grave mistake, for the Rakata tapped into the Dark Side of the Force in their innate cannibalistic and savage ways completely ignoring the Kwa principles of moderation and balance with the Force. With their desire for power and the cravings of conquest boiling Rakata society to the brim, they waged war subsequently, expanding their control over outlying systems conquering from Lehon unto other planets and systems across the Unknown Regions. \n\nThe Rakata then established the Infinite Empire, building their conquests upon planets with strong Force signatures, as these planets made their technology viable. This superpower continued to target planets strong with the Force in their desire to expand, conquering them abruptly and enslaving the local species and races that inhabited them. Their technology relied on the Dark Side energies that corrupted these peoples enslaved by the Rakata, feeding off their emotions and hatred to power their ships and weaponry. With their various conquests beginning to reel their relations, the Rakata launched a brutal war against the Kwa, desiring to take their Infinity Gate technology for themselves. By 33,598 BBY the Rakata became the sole hegemony over the galaxy and by 30,000 BBY, the Celestials, and the Kwa would cease to exist as competition to the Infinite Empire.\n\n# Zenith and Decline\nBy 25,790 BBY, the Rakata would be at its zenith of power and hegemony over its territories. They were unmatched, their power indomitable. Their species advanced, and their slaves plentiful. There was truly nothing that could match their power. The Rakata would face multiple threats during its reign over the galaxy, The Esh-Kha were alien nomads who marauded and conquered multiple Rakatan worlds before the Rakata could assemble to meet them, and their savagery would be near equal to that of the Rakata to the point where the Rakata would entirely despise them labeling them as a plague. The Rakata were able to drive the Esh-Kha to clusters and eventually decimate them to near extinction, the war would be brutal and merciless towards them. The Rakata would capture and preserve the remnants of the alien species, and a great commemoration of victory would be built on the planet of Hoth, with a monument and a holocron describing the details of their great victory.\n\n\tSometime during their conquests across great swathes of the galaxy, the Rakata would encounter the Sith Purebloods on the planet of Korriban. They pretended to ally themselves with King Adas, who ruled over the Sith, even as far as to give them the technology in constructing the pyramidal Sith Holocron. This feigned alliance would not last with Adas as he learned of the Rakata’s desires for expansion, unifying the Sith and sparking a great war against the Rakata driving them from Korriban however at the expense of his own life. \nEven as the Rakata have failed in holding Korriban, they succeeded in its decimation, forcing the Sith to relocate to Ziost. With this cruel act of savagery leaving its mark upon the Sith, they fully embraced the Dark Side of the Force, which resonated throughout the annals as the Sith would become the prominent figures of the Dark Side for millennia.\n\n# Collapse and Legacy\nAs the Rakata began its far-fetched expeditions unto the Core, they would come into a knowledge of a planet powerfully imbued with the Force, however, it was near-impossible to reach given its location and proximity to black holes and stars along the way. This planet was known as Tython, home of the Je’daii who practiced a philosophy of balance between Light and Dark, as this reflected upon their planet’s Force storms. The presence of the Rakata shifted the planet’s storms into a planet-wide surge, which alerted the Je’daii of their presence. Eventually, the Je’daii came to learn more about the Infinite Empire and its coalesced expansion.\n\n\tWith generations upon generations and centuries of continued galactic hegemony, the Rakata eventually reached an implode by 25,200 BBY following a great civil war and internal frictions which were caused by their superweapon, the Star Forge’s dark influence. This further worsened their situation with a great and volatile plague that spread throughout the Rakata species, only infecting them alone and causing a great purge of their kind with nearly all of them exterminated. This also left the remnants losing greater sensitivity to the Force, even as Rakata scientists attempted to find the cause of the virus and to mend its afflictions to no avail. In time, the Builders lost their abilities and in turn, their power. This forced the Rakata remnants to utilize inferior technology which further riled the slave races in open revolt sensing great weakness in their masters. The Rakata, hopelessly outnumbered and their technology useless, would stem a total collapse of their Empire, forcing them to retreat to Lehon where they remained insignificant till then. Rakata clusters would exist till 25,100 BBY where the Tion Humans would seize their Force-sensitive technology. \n\n\tIn time, the Rakata diverged into barbaric warlordism following their retreat to Lehon, which itself was protected by a disruptor field that destroyed communication and navigational systems and prevented foreign ships from entering the system. In generations of constant infighting and strife, only a few would know their long and grievous history as the cycle of warfare would continue. The Rakata would be purged from the archives and scripts of their former slave races, as they would be violently ousted from galactic history. Many liberated worlds opted to destroy their technologies and creations to purge them of their brutal past, and eventually, most memories of the Infinite Empire would come to pass. Their idle superweapon, the Star Forge, remained unused until the time of Darth Revan who also used it in his bid for great power, producing hundreds of thousands of warships to bring war upon the Republic.\n\n","meta":{"index":15,"author":"C_aladria","name":"Rakata","release_year":2022}},"Geonosians":{"content":"# Introduction\nLocated on their home planet Geonosis, the Geonosians were a winged semi-insectoid species who created nests in large, spire-like colonies to their homeworld. Their height was approximately 1.7 meters, or 5ft and 1 inch. During the Clone Wars, the Geonosians fought in association with the Confederacy of Independent Systems while defending their planet from the Galactic Empire on multiple occasions, and were nearly exterminated by the Galactic Empire after they finished aiding in the construction of the Death Star. After the near extermination of their species, only one was alive, nicknamed Klik-Klak, who survived the Imperial sterilization of their planet. However some hope remained when the New Republic Era started, as there were some eggs left which could hatch and create a new Geonosian Hive.# Society and Culture\nThe Geonosians were born into hives which were led by a Queen, a caste-based species separated by positions of drones and warriors. The Queen’s job was to lay eggs for the hive and to provide orders to the public leaders of Geonosis. Karina the Great, once was a queen who was able to control sentient beings, including her own kind, with parasites called brain worms. In their society, drones were capable of becoming warriors only if they provided enough evidence by defeating other drones in an arena. Geonosian Warriors had thick wings and a thick exoskeleton, and were also dedicated to warfare. Their Alpha was known as the Geonosian Brood Alpha. The blood of the Geonosians was yellow, and their skin color was dark-orange to green.\n\n# History\nTheir history wasn’t always peaceful, wherewith many losses and suffering also came happiness and wealth. In the Pre-Clone Wars, they successfully conquered Geonosis and named it as their home planet. In the Clone Wars, Geonosis became a part of the Confederation of Independent Systems. The Separatists only used the Geonosians to create their so-called “Separatist Droid Army”, after the Head of State, Count Dooku came and personally negotiated the agreement. In theImperial Era, the Geonosians were forced to aid in constructing the Death Star by the Galactic Empire, where they became an enslaved servant species for the Empire and were strictly forbidden from freely breeding. After the Death Star’s hyperdrive was up and running, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin ordered the Imperial Weapons Division to sterilize Geonosis using  Imperial gas canisters;killing, circa 100 billion of the planet's population-just so the Empire could keep their weapon covert. At the Post-Sterilization in 2 BBY, the Spectres and Captain Rex found out that the Empire had perpetrated genocide against the Geonosians. In addition to this, they discovered and helped out Klik-Klak to escape with the last of the queen’s eggs in the depths of Geonosis. Unfortunately, Klik-Klaks' plans didn’t last very long the egg would hatch concludingly with a new queen, named Karina also known as the last Geonosian Queen.\n\n","meta":{"index":113,"author":"Odysseus_v1","name":"Geonosians","release_year":2024}},"Massassi":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Massassi were a form of primitive sentient Sith species, most notable for their fearless, intimidating, and warrior-like demeanors. Being a species of the Sith race, the Massassi were native to the planet Korriban and posed extreme loyalty to their superior Sith master beings. Based on appearance alone, Massassi were fearsome and highly skilled combatants. Massassi, just like other species of Sith, possessed a natural force sensitivity mostly attuned to the Dark Side of The Force. This would further advance the skill sets that the Massassi already possessed as they were able to feed on the Dark Side of The Force like any other native organism that resided on Korriban.# Appearance\nAverage Massassi would stand 2-3 meters tall and had an average weight of 150kg. Just like other species of Sith, the Massassi would appear with skin tones such as red, dark red, light pink, crimson, and anything else related to said colors. Though dissimilar to other Sith species, Massassi would naturally have glowing yellow eyes. These pairs of glowing eyes would not contain pupils or eye whites of any sort, rather the yellow portion would be the dominant color within the eye of a Massassi. The facial features of Massassi consisted of tendrils that would dangle from their cheekbones, eyebrow stalks that would shield their eyes--a mouth, nose, and ears like that of any human species.\n\n# Biology\nMassassi had an average lifespan of up to 50 years but this was likely due to the harsh conditions they faced within their history. There were quite a few Massassi that would live for over 200 years and at such an age, wielded plenty of wisdom and were highly respected by other Massassi. Childhood times were considered 0-20 years where at the age of 20, Massassi would be considered to be in their adolescent stages. It wouldn’t be until the age of 30 that a Massassi would finally reach adulthood. Just like some of their other relative species, the Massassi possessed a thick hide and tough skin, this would result in higher quality medicine being used among the species in order to care for them such as cyanogen silicate which would provide proper healing to account for their thick hide and their durable skin. In time, the Massassi would see more biological changes during their service and loyalty towards Naga Sadow on Yavin IV. The result of which caused them to become more monstrous, mindless, and savage as they would undergo biological experimentation in the hope that Naga Sadow would continue to increase his power. Eventually, these monstrosities would descend into large brutes containing a set of serrated claws and malformed fin-like features on their back leading up to their head. During this time is when these beasts would finally be considered a subspecies of the Sith due to the mass amount of alteration they faced as a result of biological experimentation.\n\n# Culture/Tradition\nWith the warrior, fearsome, and ruthless nature of the Massassi, they held a variety of principles and traditions that put those traits into the spotlight. Their brutal standards would hold a very primitive nature going as far as sacrificing other sentient beings out of acts of mere tradition. War, battle, and violence as a whole were considered the natural order of things within the lifestyle of these warriors. While this rather brute species of the Sith were a form of sentient species, they weren’t the most intelligent but still possessed good engineering skills as well as the ability to wield weapons and be trained to use weapons that may be unfamiliar to them. This group of Sith in particular would use armor enhanced by alchemy along with their primitive battle ax called the Massassi lanvarok. Masters who commanded these fearsome beings would act as the enforcers within the battlefield to ensure that the Massassi could be led into proper strategy. Similar to their other Sith relatives, the Massassi also had a language of their own known as the “Massassi language.” It’s very much believed that this language of theirs that they adopted was fairly similar to the Sith language as a whole. Not only that, but the usage of this language and its markings complimented the Sith language since they would also engage in the use of hieroglyphs which would be written on the structures, tombs, and other artifacts that they constructed and carried. The obedient, mindless, slave-like nature of the Massassi comes from the times when they were enslaved or forced to work under the command of many notable individuals such as Ajunta Pall, Naga Sadow, and Exar Kun. Due to their admiration of the masters that they served under, this warrior race would eventually take their own responsibility of formulating a tradition and belief in order to also gain that same admiration they had for their leaders.\n\n# History (The Hundred-Year Darkness):\nIt is widely believed that the Massassi first would originate on Korriban considering the planet of Korriban was the very location where most Sith had come from. The ancient history of this warrior race is unknown, it can also be presumed that they were around during the first Rakata invasions on Korriban and fled the planet with the Sith King. Around 7000 BBY began the period in which this primitive species would start its descent into utter loyalty and obedience. During this time, the Dark Jedi would make their arrival on the planet Korriban where the native Sith congregated within. With the extreme prowess in The Force that these new arrivals demonstrated to the Sith, all of its natives praised the Dark Jedi and would commit themselves to serving Ajunta Pall along with the rest of his exiled fellows that practiced the Dark Side. As interbreeding became more common among the Sith with the help of biotechnology and alchemy, the Massassi also were involved in this process which could provide an explanation as to why they started to lose some of their warrior nature. Ajunta Pall and his followers would rule over the Sith and would make great use of the Massassi–making them the bulk of the Sith Empire’s military forces.\n\n# History (The Great Hyperspace War)\nIn 5000 BBY, the Sith Lord Naga Sadow would utilize the Massassi in a series of battles to fight the Galactic Republic. Despite the extreme prowess of Naga Sadow and his loyal sect of warriors, he had lost the Second Battle on Korriban which resulted in him exiling himself to Yavin. Some Massassi would remain on Korriban in order to provide cover for Naga Sadow’s escape. Those that were the most loyal to Naga Sadow would flee the planet alongside him to congregate on Yavin. Upon the moon of Yavin 4, Sadow sought to extend the lengths of his power by conducting a series of cruel experiments on his own gathering of loyal Massassi followers. This time period would mark the point in history where this species would begin their transformation into the abominations that gave them their witless behavior. Even after all the pain, suffering, and complications they faced as a result of the brutal experiments they underwent, the Massassi would still choose to follow and praise Naga Sadow as a God. Temples and other constructions such as the Massassi Temples from these primitive beings were still erected regardless of their unintelligent status as abominations due to the inspiration they had from the examples set by their masters.\n\n# History (Sith War):\nDuring 3997 BBY, Exar Kun would make himself known on Yavin and would enslave the Massassi just as many have done previously. Knowing that these atrocities held good engineering and construction skills, he would order these beasts to build a multitude of temples that would be used for Sith tradition, principles, and other forms of enlightenment of dark knowledge. Just like Naga Sadow, Exar Kun also did experiments on the Massassi slaves to produce a Golden Globe that would allow him to trap the children of these slaves into this artifact in order to drain their life essence. Sometime within the Sith War, Exar Kun had evaporated the life of the majority of the Massassi to allow himself to pull his spirit from his body as an escape tactic to flee from the Jedi. As a result, this would lead to the near extinction of these warrior Sith. The ones that survived would continue to live a normal life, unguided, doing as they please. Though, there remained others that would seek revenge against the Jedi, Republic, and even the Sith that used them as weapons of destruction for their own benefits.\n\n","meta":{"index":8,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Massassi","release_year":2022}},"Snivvian":{"content":"# Appearance\nSnivvian are mammal-like creatures with humanoid features.

Their heads were mostly filled with their larger compound eyes which came in shades of black or red. Located behind them were two antennae, one per each eye. They were adorned with a hardened green carapace that had a green substance known as carahide. It was flexible and as flimsy as any normal skin would typically be but it was dense enough that it could easily deflect a blade or even a blast bolt that just so happened to graze by the area. They were known to have an increased survivability during injuries as no scientists could determine if the Verpine circulatory system had one, at least nothing they could identify as one. however, this was not their most impressive trait. The Verpine eye could easily detect microscopic details while their antennae could pick up radio waves which could allow them to transmit messages to others of their species or language to receive the message from as far as one hundred kilometers away. Though as they came to rely on them, a damaged antennae would cause real mental distress with almost all Verpine criminals having damaged antennae. Verpine came in two types, the intelligent ones and what is now referred to as drones. When they Verpine originally made their mark into the galaxy only around five percent of the total population was intelligent but with the demands for new technology surfacing the Verpine needed an entire restructure of their society. So development began and scientists were able to put a gene into the Verpine eggs to make sure all of them came out intelligent. Verpine who are not intelligent are now a result from cloning and are given the title drone. And while most are typically the same in terms of looks, the hive mother has stated that male warriors helped the Jedi meaning a select few have genders.# Society\nThe Verpine had a naming culture for their off-spring. Most were given a single first name while a select few were given first and last names depending on the family who had them from the egg-laying Verpine. Because of their vast intellect, the Verpine made very highly sought after weaponry and shields which could earn anyone who could make one very wealthy in a matter of a few days. On top of this, the Verpine used six as their way of counting instead of the human ten.\n\n# History\nMany believed that the Verpine evolved from asteroids when in fact the only reason any of the Verpine could survive on these asteroids was from their technological advances making it possible to live in such a place. Many believed that the Verpine homeworld was destroyed whether it be from natural causes or from an all out civil war. Though unfortunately, there is no evidence or history of their home-planet if there is one as most records either haven’t been released or have been destroyed. But for whatever the reason may be, the Verpine were a peaceful race. They tried to solve conflicts before they were started and had created colonizations within numerous asteroid belts long before even the Old Republic was formed. With these vastly spanning populations the more notable members of this species began making their mark. Such as one individual who went by the name of Lyns Skutroo, who had reversed engineered the Sif-Alulan process with waymancy weapons, resulting in a product known as the squintpipe process which had caused many rapid-firing blasters to outperform any shield on the market, entirely revamping the weapons industry with just a single invention until the year 7500 BBY where the technology had become so common that stronger shields were invented to prevent these blasters from taking over. Verpine technology was so popular that during the Jedi Civil War, Ion blasters and cardio-regulators were widely used on both sides of the war with their medical supplies falling just short of their weaponry’s threshold. This would not be the only war the Verpine took part in though. Their technology was wildly popular by the time of the Galactic Civil War where they still remained peaceful but quietly opted to support the Rebel Alliance more than other consumers partly because of their pacifistic ideals. After the rebellion sadly failed, the Verpine were very close with the New Republic, more specifically their military as they were advancing weaponry even further past the new republic. During the Second Galactic Civil War the Verpine took a slightly different approach. Accusing the people of Murkhana of breaking their trade agreements by producing weapons similar to theirs. As a result, they opted to sign a non-agression pact with the Mandalorians who were rapidly expanding their boarders in which the Verpine thought they might try to obtain Verpine territory. This act stated that Mandalorians would send their best fighters, and exports while the Verpine would reciprocate the offer by sending them their newly advanced weaponry along with any medical supplies the Mandalorians needed, that way both sides could have a neutral standing in the entire war that would soon be upon them in the case of Darth Sidious attacking the Verpine’s home with the added help of the Imperial Remnant forces. In this instance, the Mandalorians along with the help of Jedi Jaina Solo defended the Verpine and their territory successfully from the attack. Finally, to prepare themselves for war in a way that wouldn’t mean relying on other people the Verpine developed the IX-6 Heavy combat droid to help assist them in their asteroid settlements. Though under new federations it was ordered that the Verpine destroy all factories and currently running models of the IX-6. The Verpine refused, resulting in asteroids with well-known factories of this droid being turned to dust and causing mass casualties as these were among the more populated locations for Verpine. This did not stop the Verpine from producing them though as they began building the factories deep within the asteroids where no one would find them, resulting in the effective battle droid to become a prized possession for any Verpine to have, costing a fortune to anyone who wanted one.\n\n","meta":{"index":2,"author":"Private_Popsicle","name":"Verpine","release_year":2023}},"Wookie":{"content":"# Appearance\nThe Wookiees come from the planet Kashyyyk and are referred to in their own language, Shyriiwook, as the People of the Trees.

They primarily needed a methane-air supply to breathe when out of their homeworld which in some places, was hard to come by. The species itself when not in these suits had a grey to white-toned skin that hung over their skeleton in folds. They lacked any sort of hair and had sunken beady eyes above the slit in their face one may identify as a nose as it served the same purpose. They also had lipless mouths as they only needed to speak. However, these creatures did not digest solid foods so the need for teeth never evolved with them resulting in gaping mouths instead. This paired with the high pressure on their homeworlds meant that despite their looks, the Skakoan were a healthy species with lifespans averaging around ninety to one hundred and ten years old.# Society\nOutsiders very rarely visited their homeworlds of Skako so to many they had only seen the species with their suits on and not the very select few who had seen them without them on. This had started a rumor that the Skakoan were emotionless and very machine-like as they fit the part very well with not being able to express a lot of emotion while within the suit. However, the Skakoan were very emotional creatures. They were very self-developed and self-centered with almost all of their research being how to preserve themselves after the suit was created since their species was able to solve nearly any mathematical, scientific, and technological problems with the minds of just the Skokoans.

They had established a major ecumenopolis that scaled the cities and population of Coruscant though it did lack the republic’s charm where war was just outside of their reach and they liked it that way as the species more often than not, didn’t want to go to war when they needed to wear their suits for survival in every environment. Skakoans did manage to have a seat in the Galactic Senate but after leading the Techno Union away from the Republic and towards the confederacy, the Skakoans were promptly kicked out of the Republic as they were making a new enemy in doing so.

Most Togruta who were originally from planet Shii would be excessively protective of their planet(s), and would consider the ground to be sacred, and would respect the ground by walking barefoot, only to put on boots for off-world missions. The Togruta were a civilized species, with many colonies across the galaxy. Togruta’s would even have a queen, at least on their home planet, where a majority of their government would operate. They would have militaries, royal guards, and even galactic fleets with multiple warships.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Togruta were also known to be excellent candidates for the Jedi Order, featuring many well known Togruta such as Master Shaak Ti, Initiate Ashla, and the well known Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Not all Togruta would meet the fate of the selected candidates, some would simply live in peace and neutrality, including the Artisan colony founded upon the planet Kiros. The colony would be known for being a peaceful community that had no intention of any negatively impacting war or battle, they simply wished to live in peace.

Life under these specific circumstances resulted in the Kyuzo to grow dense muscle fibers that were far stronger and more developed compared to other bipedal species’ and adapt to have faster reflexes resulting in the Kyuzo becoming vastly more dangerous opponents to anyone wanting to fight them in relatively normal gravity. Because of their thin arms and legs they were often seen as easy opponents but they had more muscle mass than anyone knew, making underestimation a great strength they had. But they were typically not messed around with as their distinctive green skin that would range from a light olive green all the way to a deep -blue-green palette alongside the wrinkled face that donned a pair of yellowish eyes. Most eyes would vary though as some would have compound eyes while others have eyes with black slit-shaped pupils. Eyes were also not the only difference. Their height would fluctuate a lot as some stood at 1.99 meters tall while other stocky types only stood at around 1.2 meters tall. Though due to the uncommon makeup of their homeworlds' atmosphere, the Kyuzo frequently wore corrective lenses and highly pressurized filter masks and sometimes bandages over their faces to help their sensitive respiratory system work. Without these the symptoms could vary but weren’t fatal, it would only slow them down.# Society\nThe Kyuzo is a species known for its strong sense of justice and honor. Most Kyuzo regarded oaths and contracts as unbreakable and many other species sought them as mercenaries, law-enforcement personnel, and bounty hunters. The Kyuzo were a highly political species, developing societies that had spanned a considerable geographical area, and most Kyuzo did identify as being members of a certain country or region and most major islands as well as continents were their own political units they had set up, though they did form a loose confederacy that didn’t really stick. Though these Kyuzo weren’t all passive. The Kyuzo warriors traditionally wore wide-brimmed war helmets that served as shields or as a thrown missile. These headpieces were originally sought after and developed by the inhabitants of the Kwaidan Peaks to protect travelers from torrential rains during monsoon season in southern Phatrong. But this was not the only headwear the Kyuzo would wear as not all of them were fighters. It was simply known as a Kyuzo hat from how popular it became. Many of the Kyuzo didn’t fight compared to the rest of the population though, many lived simple lives as farmers and merchants. But despite their known honor and oath among the masses the Kyuzo tended to lean more towards thieves and rogues than any notable figure. \n\nMany of their myths had come from outcast heroes who were forced to oppose the social order so the idea of doing so was very common among them. Because of this the Kyuzo had favored their own language which had consisted of quickly spoken, short words and phrases. The Kyuzo weren’t limited to it though as they picked up at a very young age the Galactic Basic Standard which is the most common of languages in the galaxy. Unfortunately the Kyuzo found this language hard to phrase when sentences tended to draw on. So they preferred their own language with the assistance of translators or interpreter droids to smooth their interaction with outsiders. But among their culture the Kyuzo had events known as clovocs, fighting orders that maintained law and order in specific regions of Phatrong. Their purpose is for governments to help maintain peace within sectors or fight species who oppose them. Though depending on the region the clovocs could range vastly in terms of numbers, expertise, technique, tradition, and structure depending on the time of mission ahead of them. During peaceful times though, the clovocs tended to be a tournament with their strongest fighters going head to head in mostly non-fatal battles as occasionally the death of a Kyuzo would happen. Kyuzo who killed another member would typically flee Phatrong, lest they face the wrath of a powerful clovoc held against them.\n\n# History\nThe ancient history of clovocs lived on through the Kyuzo as the earliest dated days of Phatrong’s recorded history included clovocs but these have proof of dating back towards even ancienter times on other planets not yet discovered. Though the myths of the Kyuzo were debatable at best, but if found true it is most likely the Kyuzo had began their society with the development of city-states, and the loose confederation that controlled Phatrong had elected the world’s representatives and senators in the Senate of the Galactic Republic as well as the Imperial Senate of the Galactic Empire. During some point in history not yet documented, the Ekaqume clovoc put down a rebellion on Phatrong’s Kambey Plains in a single day. Following the Imperial Senate’s dissolution they had replaced the confederation and oversaw Phatrong directly who would then only expend forces if absolutely necessary and only for clovocs. Because of their reputation though the Empire had become cautious of them but they didn’t care as long as taxes were paid on time. A resistance had started not soon after in the hopes they could bolster the Alliance to Restore the Republic at large and form the core of a major resistance force on their homeworld.\n\n","meta":{"index":45,"author":"Private_Popsicle","name":"Kyuzo","release_year":2023}},"Gungan":{"content":"# Appearance\nGungans, the original inhabitants of the planet Naboo, are slim and tall bipedal amphibians, an adult can measure up to 1.9 meters.

These frigates were extremely powerful, multi-role starships that often contained navy forces of the Trade Federation to use against the Galactic Republic. The frigate measured 825 meters in length, 426 meters in width, and 243 meters in height, making this ship colossal to most creatures.# Additional Sections\nDespite the frigate’s monstrous design, the frigates were incredibly fast ships due to being primarily lightly armored and powered by a nuclear reactor. They were designed to operate in squadrons supported by smaller crafts to take down larger capital ships, hence the ship’s naturally light armor compared to its counterparts.\n\nThe frigate came equipped with a large array of weapons, to compensate for its lack of defense. The frigates contained: armed with two forward-mounted heavy turbolaser cannons, two forward-mounted heavy ion cannons, thirteen port and thirteen starboard twin light turbolaser cannons, ten port and ten starboard turret-mounted light turbolasers, six port and six starboard medium flak guns with roughly thirty-three shells per gun, ten dorsal, ten ventral, ten port, and ten starboard turret-mounted retractable point-defense twin light turbolasers, including several ordnance launchers and a hyperwave jammer.\n\nThe crew of the frigate was almost entirely automated, which compensated for the amount of troops this ship was able to carry. The ship could carry roughly 150,000 battle droids in total while maintaining less than 200 crewmembers itself.

Answering the distress call, the A-wings located the convoy to be under invasion from TIE Bizarros, and the escort vehicles of Suluk lurking at the fringes of the battle site. In the following mission, Rebel Z-95s damaged one of Suluk, subsequently disabling it, and it was brought back to the calamari cruiser Liberty for examination. It was discovered that the life support systems on board the vehicles were rigged to \"malfunction\" if the vessel were ever disabled, slaughtering all aboard and presumably keeping the Suluk's function a secret.

Unlike the original TIE series, Sienar Fleet Systems had limited involvement in this project, with their contribution primarily confined to establishing the initial TIE design lineage. As a result, the Raptor saw little to no deployment among units of the Imperial Navy loyal to the central authorities, making it a unique asset exclusively utilized by Warlord Zsinj's faction.\n\n# Section 4\nWhile the TIE Raptor did not achieve widespread adoption within the Imperial Navy, its impact cannot be understated. With its exceptional maneuverability and powerful weapons, the TIE Raptor proved itself capable of thriving in different combat situations. Pilots who had the opportunity to fly the TIE Raptor praised its responsiveness and firepower, often likening it to a deadly predator soaring through the stars.\n\nOnce introduced, the TIE Raptor left a lasting impression on the world of starfighters in the years that followed. Its influence can be seen in subsequent starfighter designs, with elements of its unconventional configuration and enhanced defensive capabilities finding their way into future iterations. While not commonly employed, the TIE Raptor serves as proof of the imaginative and resourceful individuals who aimed to expand starfighter technology in the vast universe.\n\n","meta":{"index":39,"author":"Zeldris98761","name":"TIE Raptor","release_year":2023}},"Action VI Transport":{"content":"# Description\nAction VI Transport was also known as the bulk transport. It was a transport ship that was created by the Corellian Engineering Corporation. These ships had no defense systems, making them an easy target for opponents of their owners. That is why they needed to be used only in convoys and be protected by other cruisers. This cruiser was used mostly by the Galactic Empire of Darth Sidious, due to it being a cheap transport way. These ships were also used by the Galactic Alliance, but most of them were stolen from their sworn enemies, the Empire. A well known Action VI Transport was the Wild Karrde of Talon Karrde. It was a version of the cruiser which was modified, had futuristic technology, advanced durability, and defense systems, and could be used as a home.","meta":{"index":58,"author":"ElMajestico","name":"Action VI Transport","release_year":2023}},"The Ebon Hawk":{"content":"# Description\nThe Ebon Hawk was a smuggler and dynamic-class freighter ship which was commanded by the famous Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Revan. It was originally constructed on the planet of Transel. Before Revan, it switched many owners, after some time, the ship took a trip to Korriban and was sold to Darth Revan. Because of Darth Revan, this ship was famous across the Galaxy. It was the fastest ship in the Unknown Regions. After Revan abandoned his Sith alignment and joined the Jedi Order, Ebon Hawk was the key to finding the Star Forge. Revan has used the Hawk to travel to the Unknown Region of the Galaxy to destroy the leavings of formerly his Sith Empire. Eventually the Hawk was taken by a Jedi Exile, Metra Surik, who used it to stop the Sith Triumvirate.","meta":{"index":73,"author":"ElMajestico","name":"The Ebon Hawk","release_year":2023}},"Synthetic Crystal":{"content":"# The Beginning\nIt is unknown when the Sith and other Dark side groups began using synthetic crystals, though red crystals have been in use since the times of the Old Sith Empire, with notables like Karness Muur and his followers wielding such weapons. However, at the time, most Sith wielded Sith swords instead of lightsabers, though red lightsabers would become the quality weapon after the reformation of the Empire. The primary Sith follower to wield a red-bladed weapon before the resurgence of the old Empire was the Dark Jedi Haazen, because the previous Dark Lord in power; Exar Kun; and his followers simply continued using their Jedi lightsabers in combat. Darth Revan and Malak followed suit after they rose to power, making the usage of red-crystals widespread among their Sith followers. Because of their common use within Revan's Sith Empire, red-hued crystals were marked as the staple of Darksiders.# The Middle\nThe primary reason for the usage of synthetic crystals among Sith and other Darksiders was the necessity to remain hidden, as most of the sites where natural crystals suitable for lightsabers may well be gathered were frequented by the Jedi Order. Eventually, synth-crystal usage among such groups became a convention, with most members considering the creation of an artificial crystal superior to the more passive Jedi method of gathering from natural formations, which was looked on as wishing on the \"untamed wilds of space\" to supply. In fact, synthetic crystal creation was viewed by Darksiders to be an indication of greater mastery over the Force. Conversely, the Jedi frowned on the creation and use of synth-crystals among their initiates, associating this with taking the short and straightforward path, as they believed they must depend upon crystals found naturally. However, sometimes Jedi were forced to form synth-crystals when a weapon was needed and no present crystals were accessible. Notable examples include Luke Skywalker, who used a synth-crystal for his first lightsaber, because he had no knowledge of the natural crystals at that time, and his niece Jaina Solo. Synth-crystals made by the Jedi usually had colors apart from red, to avoid similarities with the Sith. Skywalker created a green crystal, while Solo produced a violet one.\n\n# The End\nIn fact, due to Darth Sidious looting or destroying most of the sites where crystals occur naturally, the New Jedi Order had to depend on synth-crystals almost exclusively. The Imperial Knights crafted their lightsabers that featured synthetic crystals, using knowledge from Sidious' Book of Anger, during a process deprived of ceremony or significance. To an Imperial Knight, a lightsaber was merely a tool, and their training devoted the maximum amount of attention to fighting in vehicles, bare-handed, and with the Force. The blades of those lightsabers were uniformly a silver-white color. Not all red lightsaber crystals were synthetic. Adegan crystals featuring a red coloration weren't unprecedented; Darth Vader utilized such a crystal in one of his lightsabers. Red-hued crystals were known to occur naturally within the Crystal Cave on Dantooine, together with blue, green, yellow and violet crystals. However, unlike the opposite crystals, the red crystals from Dantooine were typically found in unhatched kinrath eggs.\n\n","meta":{"index":35,"author":"Ruvjaal","name":"Synthetic Crystal","release_year":2022}},"Gozanti-class Cruiser":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Gozanti Cruiser, also known as the Gozanti-class armed transport, was a slow but powerful transport designed by the Corellian Engineering Corporation. It was described as a flying fortress and was built for durability and firepower rather than cargo capacity and speed. The design for the cruiser was leased to other companies for construction, one of them being Gallofree Yards.# Section One\nThese cruisers were first built during the Old Republic and were made purposefully slow to prove to Republic Inspectors that the ship couldn’t be used as a private vessel. However, the ship was used by many independent organizations, including the Hutts and a number of crime lords. Lots of the ships were refurbished and turned into warships by the Rebellion during the Galactic Civil War. Rebellion engineers were able to get most of them up to standard for operations in modern combat. The Rebellion deployed Gozantis as escort vessels and they also used them as capital ships in times of need.\n\n# Section Two\nGozanti cruisers were known for being difficult to board and were equipped with unusually heavy armor and hull bracing. They also had retractable weaponry, including, four laser cannons, two quad laser cannon turrets, and a proton torpedo launcher. The ships were primarily used by merchants, militaries, and mercenaries to defend cargo from being pirated. A rare few were used as diplomatic vessels and were popular choices for mobile command centers. However, one of these ships did fall into the hands of a criminal and it was turned into a prison ship.\n\n# Section Three\nThe design for these ships fell out of popularity during the reign of the Galactic Empire. However, the post-Endor collapse took place and the demand for heavily armed ships was once again in demand. The Krayt’s Honor was the name of a notable Gozanti Cruiser used by freelancers to protect merchants from harassment by the Trade Federation. During the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems militarized the cruisers and used them as support ships. They were painted with Separatist colors and served in the fleet under the command of the super tactical droid Aut-0. The Black Sun crime syndicate later modified them to be used as frigates. After the takeover of Mandalore, the Separatists’ and Black Sun Gozantis were seen hovering over the sky of Sundari.\n\n","meta":{"index":24,"author":"ElysiaLValkyrie","name":"Gozanti-class Cruiser","release_year":2023}},"TIE Heavy Bomber":{"content":"# Description\nUtilized by the Galactic Empire, this Heavy Bomber was primarily designed for penetrating densely armored starships. It contained modified heavy armor that allowed for decent agility, allowing it to successfully act as a mobile artillery craft. Shielding was improved upon from the original bomber, and had protection against strong atmospheric conditions like wind. Power cores were one of the most essential things that this model was efficient at dealing with, as it could bypass heavy tanks and other artillery for a swift blow.# Technical Specifications\nTwin ion engines were employed by this specific model. Dual weapons pods were added rather than the single payload module that the original TIE bomber possessed. The TIE Defender’s unique laser cannons were substituted for the Heavy Bomber’s old ones due to less of an overheat. The two bomb bays contained a variety of weapons and utility for various missions, such as proton bombs, heavy rockets, and concussion missiles. Besides the missiles, these two forms of weaponry greatly assisted the Empire’s planetary assaults. Thermal detonators, orbital mines, and proton torpedoes were additional armaments that could be carried on the bomb bays. These could be used for defense or support, but usually contributed to the assaults carried out.\n\n","meta":{"index":45,"author":"purebourne","name":"TIE Heavy Bomber","release_year":2023}},"The Kauri Princess":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Kauri Princess was an M-class luxury liner built by the Mon Calamari and was used by Galaxy Tours during the Galactic Civil War. It inspired many of the systems that were used during the development of the MC80 Star Cruiser. Onboard the liner were 850 crew members including the captain, ten officers, 500 droids, and 329 sentient crewers. The majority of the crew was made up of stewards and engineers and the rest were part of the onboard entertainment. On top of this, a team of 60 troopers were stationed across the ship as security personnel. The liner was capable of holding 3,500 passengers with accommodating facilities for 27 species.# Section One\nStandard rooms on the ship had two berths, a suite bathroom, and environmental controls. Depending on the location of the room the price would range from 50 to 150 credits per night. The deluxe rooms had a price range of 250 to 450 credits per night. Lastly, there were two top-tier suites that costed 1,000 credits per night, which were known by their names Emperor and Kauri. There were some documents that mentioned a royal suite that was supposed to be the most luxurious of them all. However, many presumed that the Royal Suite was renamed and became the Emperor Suite.\n\n# Section Two\nThe main area was called the Lido Deck and had standard accommodations. It was where the Grand Ballroom, Grand Dining Room, and Bistro resided. The Lido Deck also housed a holovid library with two billion volumes and a nightclub called Xerrol’s place. A special night club for droids was also available for the crew and passengers’ servants. Above the Lido Deck was the Recreation Deck which had 15 gyms catering to multiple species. This deck also had a six-lane multi-gravity running track, zero-g sauna, wall ball courts, and a slafcourse. There were 212 standard and 46 deluxe rooms on this deck that resided above the two casinos and another dining hall.\n\n# Section Three\nThe uppermost of the public decks was the Bazaar Deck which included two luxury suites and the Imperial, which was the most prestigious restaurant on board. This deck also had the Scorp Club, a members-only night club. Other facilities on the deck included the Estuan Theater, two shopping arcades, meditation chambers, a day care, and a few extra amenities. Lastly, the Bazaar Deck housed 224 standard and 36 deluxe rooms. Below the Lido Deck were two credicruise decks that held 448 standard and 86 deluxe rooms. These two decks each had a small dining room and three snack shops. Below these decks was the engineering deck that contained the ship’s drive systems and most of the crew areas. This was also where the hangar bay was located.\n\n# Section Four\nThe Kauri Princess traveled multiple routes across the galaxy. Its best-known voyage was a cruise along the Relgim Run, which started at Endoraan and passed through Marmoth, Aris, and Vykos to end up at Mantooine. However, when the ship passed between Aris and Vykos, it was attacked by the Riders of the Maelstrom. They were a gang of pirates led by Big Jak Targrim that were rescued by Rebel forces. Some time passed and the Kauri Princess eventually offered a Grand Galactic Tour that traveled across Tatooine, Endor, Bespin, and the Imperial Center. The bounty hunter 4-LOM used to be a valet and human-cyborg relations specialist on the ship. His programming was later corrupted by his observations of the passengers that were under his care. The fame of the ship grew and a sister ship named Kauri Princess II was launched.\n\n","meta":{"index":16,"author":"ElysiaLValkyrie","name":"The Kauri Princess","release_year":2023}},"57C Holocam":{"content":"# Overview\nThe 57C Holocam was known as one of the automatic cameras and was manufactured by Merr-Sonn Munitions. It was utilized by Imperial forces on the first death star for surveillance purposes, such as observing the detention blocks.

Though the scanners recorded perfect images, the 57C was vulnerable to Han Solo’s, Luke Skywalker’s, and Chewbacca’s blaster shots as the screens would break upon being shot.\n\nThe parts of the Holocam included an audio pickup, motion sensors, signal transmitters, data relays, visual scanners, audio matrix, and screens.","meta":{"index":43,"author":"ViroSpect","name":"57C Holocam","release_year":2022}},"Dark Trooper Project":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Dark Trooper Project was an experimental wing of the Galactic Empire’s Stormtrooper Corps. The idea of the project was to eventually outphase the more common stormtrooper with a cybernetic battle droid that could fight more efficiently than most of the Empire’s ground forces at the time while also being able to withstand harsh attacks.\n\nThe Project was created by Imperial General Rom Mohc, a veteran of the Clone Wars who developed a keen and particular interest in the various models of battle droids produced by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. General Mohc believed battle droids to be the future of ground warfare, seeing the droids as a far more effective method of waging war, even more so than the Kaminoan method of cloning and flash training.# Part I: Phase Zero\nThe Phase Zero variant of the Dark Troopers stood as the first iteration of the program and came before the program had been officially sanctioned by the Emperor. General Mohc made use of many of the remaining Clone troopers who still served in the early years of the Galactic Empire and combined their genetic material with cybernetic enhancements designed to increase their strength, speed, stamina and overall combat efficiency. \n\nGeneral Mohc would use many of the same methods employed to create Darth Vader’s cybernetic enhancements. The Phase Zero Dark Troopers were considered successful despite being considered as inhumane abominations, very little resembling the original Clone Trooper under the armour. \n\nClone Troopers would volunteer willingly for the cybernetic enhancements, often seeing it as a way to remain in service and combat the Clone aging process. Those who were successful would be outfitted with enhanced combat equipment and had access to a wide variety of Imperial weapons akin to that of other Imperial Special Forces units. Despite the questionable quality of life of the Dark Troopers and methods used to produce them, their combat effectiveness was not something that could be argued against. \n\nOnly a few years later the Emperor would personally green light and fund the creation of an official Dark Trooper Project with General Mohc at the helm.\n\n# Part II: Phase One\nThe Phase One Dark Trooper would be the first iteration of the program that did not make use of sentient beings and instead were a prototype droid. Designed with light armour and serving an entirely melee combat role, the Phase One Dark Trooper was never officially deployed into a combat zone and only served as the foundation of ideas and concepts that would further the creation of its vastly superior model, the Dark Trooper Phase Two. \n\nThe Phase One was still an efficient combat model and made use of an extremely mobile chassis. Despite not being officially deployed into combat, the Phase One did guard numerous Imperial installations and would find itself coming up against the Rebel Alliance on numerous occasions, proving itself to be an effective enemy in its own right.\n\n# Part III: Phase Two\nThe Phase Two Dark Trooper can be credited with being the first true adaptation of the program. Taking elements from the Phase Zero and Phase One projects, the Phase II would be the most mass produced variant of the program. \n\nAt one stage in the history of the Rebel Alliance the Phase Two Dark Trooper was the largest threat to Rebel Cells. Many Rebel ships and installations could be boarded and dispatched in a swift and decisive manner that even the best Imperial Commando units struggled to keep up with.\n\nThe Phase Two Dark Trooper could be utilized as a battle droid and even as an exoskeleton for Imperial soldiers. As such they were often worn by decorated Imperial Field Officers who had a background in Imperial Special Operations and on many occasions the Phase II Dark Trooper would be deployed in small squads and even as individuals to support larger military activities.\n\n# Part IV: Phase Three\nEasily the most lethal variant of the Dark Trooper, the Phase Three stood at nearly 3 meters in height, towering above its previous models. The Phase Three would most often be deployed as an individual unit with the goal of tackling particularly difficult hostiles. Considered to be on par with a small tank, the Phase Three would find itself fairing against Jedi, heavy armoured opponents and entrenched enemy positions. \n\nThe Phase Three model was seen as the true success of the program, so much so that General Mohc had intended for the Phase Three to become the next set of armour for future Stormtrooper generations. However this would prove difficult due to the cost and rarity of the armour material utilized by the Phase Three. General Mohc himself would utilize a Phase Three exoskeleton model as his own personal armour.\n\n# Inquisitorium Dark Trooper\nThis model was produced to support operations undertaken by Imperial Inquisitors. As such they wore black armour and were programmed to conduct operations against Jedi and force-wielders. Due to their size and arsenal it would be safe to theorise that the Inquisitorium Dark Trooper is an off-shoot of the Phase III model. \n\nThe Inquisitorium Dark Trooper would wield melee weapons, being one of the rare varieties to do so, this is likely due to the nature of the enemy they were tasked with killing, often wielding a lightsaber.\n\n# Triumphant-class Dark Trooper\nThe Triumphant-class Dark Trooper is a lesser known sub-unit of the program. The unit would make appearances on worlds often visited by Darth Vader, and two Triumphant-class Dark Troopers could often be seen escorting Darth Vader during his visits to Naboo.\n\nThe Triumphant-class Dark Trooper is the only model seen to not sport a jump pack, unlike other variants of Dark Troopers, it is unclear if this model is an exoskeleton or a droid, or if it can be utilized both ways such as the Dark Trooper Phase II.  Due to the lack of armaments and jump packs it could be theorised that the Triumphant-class Dark Trooper served a formality and intimidation purpose and much less of a combat purpose, though likely still very capable.\n\n# Dark Novatrooper\nThe Dark Novatrooper was a variant of the Phase II and III Dark Trooper that specialised in ship boarding operations. They donned black armour with orange markings, similar to that of the Novatroopers who carried out the same operations.\n\n# Exogen-class Dark Trooper\nThe Exogen-class Dark Trooper was a unique variant of the Phase II Dark Trooper that was responsible for carrying out policing duties in towns and cities deemed important to Imperial infrastructure. These units would deploy armament that could not typically be found in local police forces and even in local Imperial garrisons.\n\n# Oppressor-7 class Dark Trooper\nThe Oppressor-7 class Dark Trooper was a more advanced variant of the Exogen-class Dark Trooper. Appearing mostly the same and conducting the same duties as the Exogen-class Dark Trooper, this model simply had more advanced AI programming that allowed it to calculate tactical risks and decisions far more efficiently.\n\n# Oppressor-9 class Dark Trooper\nThe Oppressor-9 class Dark Trooper was in all ways except one the exact same as the Oppressor-7 class Dark Trooper. It was also responsible for policing duties; it was simply outfitted with heavier armour than the Exogen and Oppressor-7 variants.\n\n# Glory-class Dark Trooper\nThe Glory-class Dark Trooper was unique in its battlefield duties in that unlike most other models this model was designed for defensive purposes. The Glory-class Dark Trooper undertook the task of defending Imperial cities against attack, specialising in urban warfare and defensive maneuvers and notably carried the T-21 repeating blaster.\n\n# Urban Assault class Dark Trooper\nThe Urban Assault class Dark Trooper performed the opposite duties of the Glory-class Dark Troopers, whereas the Glory-class Dark Trooper was designed to defend and hold cities utilizing advanced urban warfare tactics, the Urban Assault class Dark Trooper was designed to invade and capture cities while making use of advanced urban warfare tactics and assault programming.\n\n# Victory-class Dark Trooper\nNothing is known about this Dark Trooper variant but due to its appearances and lack of weaponry in comparison to other models it can be theorized that it served a somewhat similar purpose carried out by Triumphant-class Dark Trooper, simply there to intimidate and perform ceremonial duties.\n\n# Black Hole Dark Trooper\nThe Black Hole Dark Trooper was utilized by Imperial Intelligence to carry out operations alongside the Shadow Stormtrooper division. This particular variant had stealth programming, a rarity amongst Dark Troopers and utilized this programming to conduct missions sensitive to Imperial Intelligence.\n\n# Purge Trooper\nNot to be confused with the Inquisitorial Purge Trooper of the same name, this Dark Trooper model was a unique variant of the Phase II Dark Trooper class. Outfitted with additional armaments and protection that would put an AT-ST to shame, these Purge Troopers were designed by the Techno Union and later commissioned by Imperial Intelligence to conduct advanced operations that involved the killing of force-wielders. \n\nThis model was so successful in its duties it served as a direct inspiration for the Phase III Dark Trooper model and many of its designs would be carried over into the Phase III project.\n\n# Elite Dark Trooper\nElite Dark Troopers were variants of the Phase II Dark Trooper model that were designed to be even more physically terrifying than other models. This however was not what earned them the title of ‘’elite’’, what made them elite was their advanced AI programming. The Elite Dark Trooper was able to think faster and more efficiently than even seasoned Imperial Special Forces soldiers and would often act as one-man armies when infiltrating and disabling Rebel Cells.\n\n# Part VI: Arsenal & armament\nDark Troopers would utilize the finest Imperial weaponry and be crafted from some of the strongest armour plating in the Imperial War Machine. In particular the Phase Two and Phase Three models could provide so much firepower and withstand so much damage that they would often be a substitute for numerous Stormtrooper squadrons and even light armoured vehicles.\n\nThe Phase Zero model, who would see combat until even after the fall of the Galactic Empire would make use of ARC Trooper and Commando weaponry, such as the Commando blaster pistol, Arc casters, E-11s, jump packs and other such high grade weaponry.\n\nThe later generations would make use of assault cannons, wrist rockets, jump packs, rocket launchers of various models, shoulder mounted grenade launchers and high powered automatic weapons. The design of the Dark Trooper was never intended for silent deployments, instead the method of deployment was often that of swift, shock assaults that would overpower the enemy before they could react, or to punch a hole in heavily entrenched enemy positions, often making use of their jump pack in the process.\n\n# Part VI: Destruction\nThe Dark Trooper Project was headquartered on an Imperial Research base known as ‘’Arc hammer’’. When Dark Troopers began making appearances across the galaxy, Mon Mothma, leader of the Rebel Alliance would dispatch a young Rebel Intelligence and SpecForce operative by the name of Kyle Katarn who had recently defected from the Empire to locate and destroy ‘’Arc hammer’’.\n\nKyle Katarn would achieve his objective and in the process he would personally kill General Mohc, thus putting an end to the production of new Dark Troopers. Emperor Palpatine expressed great frustration at the program’s failure and would cease all funding for new models. \n\nDespite this, many Dark Troopers would survive until the end of the Galactic Empire and even into the era of the New Republic, standing as a true testament to the durability and efficiency of the mechanised weapons.\n\n","meta":{"index":54,"author":"seko1111","name":"Dark Trooper Project","release_year":2022}},"Kyber Crystals":{"content":"# Introduction\nA kyber crystal also known as a lightsaber crystal, a living crystal, a kyber, or in ancient times a kaiburr crystal. This is the main part of the lightsaber. These were rare crystals that contained the Force within them. Kyber crystals were scattered on different planets throughout the galaxy. Most notably, they were used by the Jedi, Sith, and other users who used a Lightsaber. These crystals were used in order for their lightsabers to emit the glowing blade of the lightsaber. Depending on the color of the Kyber Crystal, it will emit different colors. Each lightsaber color has a different meaning or purpose on why one got that Kyber Crystal color. The Kyber Crystals were mainly found on the icy tundra known as Ilum. Thousands of Kyber Crystals grew here, this caused the Jedi to claim this as their area for their Crystal Gatherings. The Crystal Gathering is a ceremony hosted by Jedi Artisans. Youngling III’s take this once they are ready to try and find a Kyber Crystal, if they find one they will pass. If they remain inside Ilum and are unable to exit without one, they will be locked inside and left for dead.# Kyber Crystal Colors\nDue to the Kyber Crystal having somewhat of a connection to the Force, it creates a bond to another Force Sensitive. The Kyber crystal color would rely mainly on what a Jedi’s chosen class would be. Most Sith do not have lightsabers that are not red. The reason is because in order to embrace the Dark Side, they are required to bleed a Kyber Crystal. The process entails infusing the Kyber Crystal with hate and anger, turning the once colorful crystal, a bloody red color. Although some Sith may have purple lightsabers, some notable users with purple lightsabers are Revan, who dual used red and purple lightsabers, Darth Traya, and a few handful of other Sith.\n\n# Blue Lightsabers\nBlue is one of the most common lightsaber colors. The shade may vary from a deep blue, to a light blue, to a cyan. Jedi Guardians usually possess this lightsaber color. They are known to be well skilled lightsaber combatants. Popular users who possessed blue lightsabers were; Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Luke Skywalker.\n\n# Green Lightsabers\nGreen is the second most common lightsaber color. The shade may vary from a forest green, to an emerald green, to a light green. Jedi Consulars possess this color Kyber Crystal, as they believe that they can solve conflicts through the Force. Instead of combat, they prefer to meditate and negotiate. These users have strong force abilities. Popular users who possessed blue lightsabers were; Qui-Gon Jinn, Yoda, and Ahsoka Tano.\n\n# Yellow Lightsabers\nYellow lightsabers are less common than both the green and blue lightsabers. Jedi Sentinels and Temple Guards tend to have these lightsaber colors. Most commonly noted for resembling intrigue and pursuing those who break laws, or oppose the Jedi Order. They are known as the in-between choice between Consulars and Guardians. Usually being skilled both in the Force and lightsaber skills. Popular users who possessed yellow lightsabers were; The Temple Guards, Yarael Poof, and Rey Skywalker.\n\n# Purple Lightsabers\nPurple lightsabers are one of the rarest lightsaber colors. This color resembles Force Sensitives who use both the light and dark side of the Force. Since Blue and Red create purple, it resembled the mixture of the two. Popular users who possessed purple lightsabers were; Mace Windu, Mara Jade Skywalker, and Revan.\n\n# White Lightsabers\nWhite lightsabers were only seen by a few Force Users. These lightsabers were used by those with the purpose of a larger cause before anything else. Most were neither Jed, nor Sith and resembled the inbetween between them. In order to have a white Kyber Crystal, one must purify a bleeded and corrupted Kyber Crystal, purifying it of any pain. This will release the color, not turning it back to the original color, rather making it pure white. Popular users who possessed white lightsabers were; Ahsoka Tano and  Imperial Knights\n\n# The Darksaber\nThe Darksaber is a unique weapon, used by Mandalorians. This weapon was used by those who tended to show signs of arrogance and selfishness. There is only one known Darksaber in the entire galaxy. Popular users who possessed the Darksaber were; Pre Vizsla, Darth Maul, and Sabine Wren.\n\n# Synthetic Kyber Crystals\nSynthetic Crystals, or Synth-Crystals were crystals that were artificially made, rather than being naturally made. Due to the method which involved creating these crystals, they would usually be a ruby red color, but these artificial crystals could be made any color depending on the method one uses. Due to the way the synthetic crystals were made, they were frowned upon by most Jedi.\n\n# Ghostfire Kyber Crystal\nThe Ghost Fire Crystal was a very rare crystal which grew on rocky mountains. These extremely rare and unorthodox crystals were found on multiple planets in the Outer Rim Territories. To even obtain a single crystal in the markets would cost 14,000 credits. They cost this much, due to their special ability with a lightsaber. Instead of it emitting a blade of a certain color, the blade would appear invisible to the naked eye. A lightsaber with this crystal would not even make a sound. When dueling someone with a ghost fire crystal, it could easily disorient the opponent on where the blade was, which would eventually end in their downfall.\n\n","meta":{"index":64,"author":"OfficiallyMommy","name":"Kyber Crystals","release_year":2022}},"IG-227 Hailfire-class Droid Tank":{"content":"# Overview\nThe IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tank, otherwise known as the IG-227 droid tank, hailfire droid, wheel droid, or simply Hailfire, was a model of droid tank crafted and produced by the Haor Chall Engineering Corporation, which was subservient to the InterGalactic Banking Clan and the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars, and to the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War.# Description\nThe IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tank was able to quickly roll into action, armed with armored missiles, and it was easily identified by its treaded, hoop-like drive wheels. Its possible speeds were extremely high, making it capable of flattening anything standing in its way. Hailfire droids were mostly used to eliminate enemy vehicles. Despite being so fast, they had a weakness in infantry attacks. Their red photoreceptor eye could rapidly lock onto any target, be it in the air or on land. Wheel droids carried a pair of Hailfire missile launcher pods, equipped with 15 guided missile warheads, very effective when used on still or slow-moving targets, but with little to no effect on fast targets. A single warhead was capable of destroying a Low Altitude Assault Transport. When the missiles were depleted, the droid relied on forward-mounted twin auto-blasters.\n\n# History\nThe hailfire droid was first manufactured by Haor Chall Engineering Corporation and originally commissioned by the InterGalactic Banking Clan, which needed an increase in debt collection for the IG-series battle droid army prior to the Clone Wars. During the Separatist Crisis, the Muunilinst Banking Clan donated multiple Hailfires to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which fought in the Separatist Droid Army during the First Battle of Geonosis. During the war, Hailfire droids were colored in blue to distinguish them as Separatist equipment. Despite how powerful its presence was on the battlefield, the Hailfire didn’t last long because of the limited number of missiles carried and was soon replaced by the NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer. During the Galactic Civil War, the Alliance to Restore the Republic adopted these droids.

Due to this, it facilitated and reinforced the shield, making it stronger and much more durable. This would allow the ship to go through tough terrain better than most starships.

On top of this, its size and myriad of weapons meant it required a crew of around 700,000 personnel, with 4000 being gunners.# History\nThe Eclipse began construction sometime around 0 BBY (exact timeframe unknown) and, as stated previously, took nearly a decade to finish construction. As such, it was never deployed in the Battle of Endor as was never put to use by Palpatine during his initial reign. 4 years after the Battle of Yavin, the ship was taken by crime lord Tyber Zaan in order to retrieve data from its memory banks. The ship was later abandoned by Zaan and moved to the secret Imperial Fortress world Byss. Once its construction was completed, the reborn Emperor Palpatine took command of the vessel, finally putting it to use as his own personal flagship. Palpatine would use the ship to wreak havoc on the New Republic in 10ABY on their stronghold on Da Soocha during the Battle of Pinnacle Base. During the battle, the Eclipse was destroyed in a Force Storm created by Palpatine, into which Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa redirected the dreadnought.\n\n","meta":{"index":18,"author":"KenjiVolt","name":"Eclipse-class Dreadnought","release_year":2022}},"Terminus-class Destroyer":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Terminus class Destroyer was mostly used by the Sith Empire during the Cold War and Galactic War alongside the Harrower class Dreadnought as a capital ship. Although it was classified as a capital ship, the ship's firepower was nothing in comparison to any other capital ship at the time, which is why it was mostly used as a support-type ship by the Imperial Navy. Because of how easy it was to produce a Terminus class Destroyer, the ship was mostly stationed on captured planets to save more capable ships for skirmishes. Currently, there are two known types of the Terminus class Destroyer; the first one being the Ascendant Spear commanded by Darth Karrid, it was modeled after the Terminus class frame and had firepower similar to the Harrower class Dreadnought. The second type of the Terminus class Destroyer has no recorded name but it was present during the Meridian Complex Assault, in which the ship was modified to have reactors and engines that used the substance called Isotope-5, one of the rarest substances. The Terminus class Destroyer's design is similar to a Gage-class transport ship, they were practically the same ship but with differences in size and firepower; it was expected that the Terminus class Destroyer's design would be based on the Gage-class transport ship as the Imperial navy needed a new capital ship that could also act as a transport and support ship.

These substances were predominantly traded and distributed across the Outer Rim worlds which are delivered inside luminescent sticks, however they were also readily available in significant quantities on the planet Coruscant. Initially created within illicit pharmaceutical laboratories located in CoCo Town, these products were characterized by their affordability and were secretly transported into urban clubs by individuals involved in illegal drug trade. The cilona extract elicited a state of euphoria, but at the cost of a distressing consequence, resulting in an altered perception of reality characterized by vibrant colors. Because of this, death sticks were a favorite among desperate addicts and thrill-seekers. With each dose, the user's lifespan was diminished, and subsequent doses shaved off larger portions of a lifespan. The urge for a more intense reaction grew with each successive intake. Consequently, it posed a significant challenge for young people to overcome their addiction without the use of medical treatment.# Characteristics\nThere were two common variations of death sticks. When in a liquid state, these substances were composed of small tubes containing red or yellow ixetal cilona fluid. These tubes could be introduced into an alcoholic beverage (some individuals choose to combine them with Fizzyglug) or given intravenously. One might potentially consume the substance by smoking or pulverizing and afterwards insufflating dry granules in a more concentrated & physical form. The substance was capable of significantly diminishing one's connection to the Force when ingested.\n\nRehabilitation programs targeting death stick addiction were accessible at medical facilities, with a typical price range of 2,500 to 3,500 credits.\n\n","meta":{"index":82,"author":"Rysesaka","name":"Death Stick","release_year":2023}},"TIE Defender":{"content":"# Origins\nThe TIE Defender was conceived during a period of increasing desperation for the Galactic Empire.

The bioweapon attacked biological tissue, swiftly but painfully turning the victim into a hideous, mindless undead creature.# History\nSometime before 4645 BBY, Sith Lord Darth Dear created the pathogen in an attempt to grant himself immortality. Drear’s experiments failed, resulting in the Sith Lord falling victim to his own creation, becoming a mindless zombie. Over a millennium later, following the Great Galactic War, the experiment was continued by Sith Lord Darth Scabrous, who attempted to fix the mistakes of Darth Drear. He too failed, spreading the virus to the entire Sith academy on Odacer-Faustin, transforming all Acolytes and Masters into mindless zombies. Knowledge of ‘The Sickness’ survived on Odacer-Faustin for millennia until it fell into the hands of Darth Vader one year before the Battle of Yavin. The Sith Lord ordered a scientific team within the Galactic Empire to research it and use it as an Imperial bioweapon under the codename ‘Blackwing’. Unfortunately, the virus was once again set loose after an accident aboard the Star Destroy ‘Vector’. The crew, now infected, took control of the ship and used it to cripple ‘Purge’, an Imperial prison barge, forcing the barge’s occupants to board the Star Destroyer and fall victim to the virus.\n\n# Biology & Infection\nUnlike actual viruses, ‘The Sickness’ was self-aware and used the undead to spread itself pathogenetically. Symptoms of the virus varied, with the most consistent being pale skin, a gray liquid leaking from the site of infection, severe pain, and hallucinations. The mixture that composed this viral agent contained several ingredients, most of which are unknown. The main ingredient, however, was the Murakami black orchid, a force-sensitive plant capable of sentient thought and telepathic communication. The intended outcome was a yellowish liquid substance meant to be consumed by the alchemist in order to grant them physical undeath, therefore granting them immortality. \n\nTransmission of the pathogen was incredibly swift and difficult to contain. It could be carried through blood, saliva, or the coagulation of fluids found within the infected. Methods of transmission varied, the most direct method being through a bite from an infected individual. Symptoms were known to vary in speed and severity, with most cases reporting a full range of symptoms within minutes of transmission. The pathogen could also cross species barriers, affecting not only humanoids but non-humanoids and even plant life. In addition to this, even dead flesh was at risk of infection, as was the case with Von Longo, a human killed 2 weeks prior to the outbreak aboard the Vector who still managed to become infected.\n\n","meta":{"index":26,"author":"KenjiVolt","name":"The Sickness","release_year":2022}},"Providence-class Dreadnought":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Providence class Dreadnought, also named the Providence class destroyer, was a combination of a dreadnought, battleship, and destroyer developed by Quarren engineers on the world of Pammant.

The Armored Transport was an extremely massive transport that was feared by citizens all over the galaxy. The Walker played a role in many Star Wars events, ranging from the Clone Wars to the Second Imperial Civil war. Despite the AT-AT being a massive and heavily feared superweapon, it was extremely slow and required many small fighters alongside it for safe transport.# General Description of Functionality\nThe AT-AT was a massive armored walking tank. It was often considered a “behemoth of a war machine.” The walker was specifically designed to replicate ancient beasts of war that conquered the Dark Side of the Force. The walker was made to crush and destroy everything in its path, while also serving as a transport for imperial troops and weapons. Hundreds of AT-ATs were produced for the Galactic Civil War, and due to their massive size it was often the first weapon on the battlefield.\n\nThe head of the AT-AT acted as a central command for the Pilot, Commander, and Gunner. These war machines could carry up to forty Imperial Troopers and five Speeder Bikes. The body also contained sliding ramps for easy in and out access, especially when leaving or entering on a speeder. The AT-AT had an odd way of unloading, which was by kneeling and opening the sliding ramp, where soldiers could leave and enter. A quicker way to deploy troops was through its grapple system, where the Trooper simply latched on and was dropped.\n\nThe AT-AT contained intense weaponry, hosting guns such as Fire Linked Heavy Laser Cannons, Medium Repeating Blasters, and Heavy Repeating Blasters. The Walker also has an extremely durable armor plate that allows it to withstand huge hits. This armor not only needed to be strong for defense but also to hold the intense weaponry and massive cargo.

In appearance, these sentient humanoid droids exhibited feminine features with distinct red sensors for eyes. They were wrapped around in a silver framework. A showcase of the scientific marvel was their ability to communicate via a hivemind to operate the Eternal Fleet, controlled by a GEMINI Prime. GEMINI Captains commanded the Fleet's warships via a specific frequency, allowing them to transmit information to each other even after their physical droid bodies were destroyed.# Encounters with SCORPIO\nDuring the Iokath Civil War, the creators drove the Eternal Fleet and GEMINI droids into Wild Space to save their creations from the conflict. However, both technologies were eventually captured by Eternal Emperor Valkorion. His son, Arcann, finally succeeded him and launched the Eternal Empire conquest. This event would make the Iokath super artificial intelligence, SCORPIO, aware of the existence of GEMINI, sparking its partnership with the Eternal Alliance to stop its potential threat.\nDue to their common creator, SCORPIO had intended to examine GEMINI droids to determine whether they were a false copy of itself. Once the Alliance captured the Prime, the calculative intelligence enacted a plan, the GEMINI trap; by infiltrating the GEMINI frequency, GEMINI droids were set free from their leader. In another deceitful plot, SCORPIO surrendered the Eternal Throne to Arcann's sister, Vaylin, and became a possession of the Alliance.\n\n# New Possession\nHaving free will came at the detriment of the droids since they were hesitant to face their opponents without fear. In response, Vaylin rebooted the GEMINI Captains to their factory settings using a purifier drone, eliminating their free will and returning them and the Eternal Fleet to the command of the Throne. The newly dubbed Eternal Empress destroyed several Alliance strongholds with even more power than ever. Curious about its creation, SCORPIO convinced its owner to explore the planet Iokath, which led to its demise at the hands of the last remaining Old God and Vaylin fleeing the world.\nIn the Assault on Odessen, the GEMINI Captains reverted to their secret primary objective - to destroy all sentient life in the galaxy. The Alliance stopped the massacre from occurring, and its commander could take hold of the Throne, controlling the droids. The Eternal Throne was subsequently moved to the Alliance base on Odessen. Later, he would use them to find a hostile presence on Iokath.\n\n# End of GEMINI\nUnbeknownst to him, a single droid, GEMINI 16, managed to stay under the radar of the Alliance and avoided capture, still having free will. Knowing it was vulnerable to outside control, it was determined to destroy the Eternal Fleet and the GEMINI network. After encounters with the Order of Zildrog on the planet Zakuul, the rogue robot tracked down another Iokath creation, Zildrog, on the planet Nathema. This was significant since it gained control of the Gravestone, the only frigate able to destroy the Fleet. Though successful, GEMINI 16 and Zildrog were then destroyed by the Alliance, triggering the self-destruction of the Gravestone.

It was highly effective in both medical treatment and general healing, and it had been especially sought after during the time of the Jedi Civil War. Despite it holding significance in the war efforts for both the Republic and Recan’s Sith Empire, it had lost value over time with the synthetic and easily made bacta replacing it as the mainstream healing liquid.# History of Kolto\nAccording to Selkath folklore, the inhabitants of Manaan, kolto was said to have originated from a large Firaxan shark named the Progenitor, which had been said to have been responsible for creating it. However, according to Republic scientists Kono Nolan and Sami, the shark had actually reached its great size and old age due to long-term consumption of highly concentrated kolto.\n\nDuring the time of the Jedi Civil War, kolto was one of the most highly valued one-of-a-kind materials that was one of the many deciding factors in the war. However, the Selkath had monopolised the opportunities, remaining neutral and forcing an agreement between Sith and Jedi while they were stationed on Manaan to have an equal distribution of the product. This did not mean that there was total peace, as there was tension between the two factions and there were often conflicts behind the backs of the Selkath. Not only that, a secret project dealt with Republic emissaries and Selkath officials saw the creation of a facility to harvest Kolto in the Hrakert Rift due to the fear the officials had of the Sith and their abilities. \n\nAfter the Jedi Civil War and until the Galactic Civil War, kolto had slowly lost its value in the market and means of production over time, losing to the cheaper and more mass-produced bacta. Due to this, the economy of Manaan collapsed due to its one reliable source of income becoming obsolete.\n\nAt some point in the reign of the Galactic Empire, Emperor Palpatine knew of kolto’s existence as a healing product and its historical importance. He ordered the invasion of Manaan and enslaved the Selkath on the planet, turning it into his large-scale resort and exploiting the supply of kolto to use as a cheap alternative to normal Bacta.\n\n","meta":{"index":13,"author":"deadima","name":"Kolto","release_year":2022}},"Star Forge":{"content":"# Article\nThe Star Forge was a giant automated shipyard designed and constructed by the Rakatan Infinite Empire to create the most powerful army of all time. The Star Forge was able to create an endless supply of any war material, most notably ships and droids; The energy required for the Star Forge to operate was drawn from the nearby star Abo in combination with the power of the Force. The Star Forge’s defences were based on the Star Forge’s infinite manufacturing of ships and droids to defend against any threat; But the Temple of the Ancients held a mysterious and powerful disruptive field that would force any starship to land or crash on the planet, this together formed the defensive system of the Star Forge.\n\nThe Rakatan were a cruel species, known to the galaxy for their inhumane and infamously savage treatment of other species. These negative and dark traits were what the Star Forge would start feeding off of, slowly turning the Star Forge into something based on the dark side’s energy, reflected by the Rakatan their dark principles and behaviour. All of the dark energy required for the Star Forge to operate would start to corrupt and destroy the Rakatan, resulting in dark side corruption taking control and feeding off of the Rakatan their strength in the Force, this ultimately resulted in the collapse of the entire Rakatan Infinite Empire.\n\nThe Star Forge was sought-after thousands of years later by the Emperor of the Sith Empire; he directed the fallen Jedi, Revan and Malak, to search for the Star Forge. After finding the Star Forge through the Rakatan’s Star Maps, it would ultimately be in the service of Revan and Malak, which would then see the creation of the New Sith Empire under their control. However, where Revan would not allow the Star Forge to feed off of him or let it gain too much control, Malak would do the opposite and further explore the powers of the Star Forge.\n\nAfter the Jedi wiped Revan's mind, he was tasked with finding the Star Forge, which led to a confrontation between Malak’s Sith Empire and Republic Forces; This is known as the Battle of Rakata Prime.

The TIE Oppressor was constructed shortly after the Battle of Yavin for bombing purposes and space domination.# Characteristics\nThe Oppressor was similarly structured to the interceptor. Having the same curved wing design but with an added wing on the top of the TIE to support additional armament. The Oppressor was equipped with two L-s9.3 Laser Cannons and two Missile Launchers. This armament allowed the Oppressor to act as both an anti starfighter craft and a light bomber. Due to the craft getting the same engine as a standard TIE despite the added weight, the Oppressor was slower than most other craft but still considered fairly maneuverable for a bomber.\n\n# Usage\nThe Empire only allowed the most experienced of pilots to fly the Oppressor due to its cost and the skill required to fly the Oppressor well. During the Galactic Civil War, the Oppressor served in the vanguard of the Imperial Navy’s fleet as a “Limited Fielding Test Initiative”. During this time, the Oppressor was used as a bomber against Capital Ships as well as being used in anti Starfighter operations. Rebel pilots found these ships to be slow and unmaneuverable in the bomber configuration. Making them easy targets and caused rebel pilots to lower their guard. When in the anti Starfighter configuration, most Imperial pilots would pretend to move like they were in the bomber configuration and then use an advanced piloting technique known as snap speed changes to become unpredictable and decimate the bewildered rebel pilots. Due to the small number of Oppressors made, there weren’t many battles where they were the ultimate factor in a victory or loss.

This chemical compound was found on every planet that supported life, for example, Naboo. Midi-Chlorians would give information about someone’s potential in the Force according to their amount of Midi-Chlorians. If someone possessed 2,000 or fewer Midi-Chlorians, they would be classified as non-Force-Sensitive persons. Instead, if their Midi-Chlorians count was above 2,000, they would be classified as Force-Sensitives. \nThe only way someone could know their amount of Midi-Chlorians was through a blood test, though they wouldn’t give the specific amount. Another way to identify Force-Sensitive users was through the Force detector device, an artifact used by the Galactic Empire. The Jedi Order would find Force-Sensitive children through the Jedi Healers, a Jedi Knight specialization that served the Medical Corps within the Jedi Order, and the non-Jedi medical circles.\nDarth Plagueis the wise was known for almost discovering the way to manipulate Midi-Chlorians, but was stopped by his Sith Apprentice, Darth Sidious.

The species classified as sentient were those that were capable of thinking with reason, being able to communicate through verbal speech or language, and possessing the intelligence to make use of resources, particularly tools. Sentience was not just applicable to living organisms, as droids and even objects such as artifacts were capable of possessing sentient nature. Non-sentience was a term to define organisms that did not possess sentient nature, but this did not imply that they were unintelligent. Some species that relied on their natural survival instinct were classified as non-sentient, sometimes even sub-sentient depending on their awareness level.# Sentient Beings\nThe Sith possess sentience given their feats throughout history. They were able to speak with reason through the form of written and verbal language as well as utilize the resources provided to them in their landscapes to craft weapons and begin their alchemy. That wasn’t the only instance of sentience being displayed among the Sith, but the sect of Dark Side wielders also managed to create an entire tradition and philosophical culture in the name of what they stood for.\n\n\nNon-living beings can also be classified as sentient, even artifacts such as the Darkstaff. The Darkstaff presented enough intellect to understand what was being spoken to it by other sentient creatures, even displaying acts of anger if the staff felt as if other beings were a pest. Not only that, but the Darkstaff relied on the suffering of others to bring itself joy, believing it had the right to decide when the life of a creature should come to an end. Due to its ability to understand emotion, comprehend concepts such as compassion, and perceive communication, the Darkstaff is classified as a sentient object.\n\n# Sub-Sentient Beings\nSith hounds spawned from Sith alchemy known as the Tuk’ata were considered sub-sentient due to their methods of communication. While the Tuk’ata did not communicate through means of verbal speech or even language, they were capable of communication in some manner. This form of communication was unknown and nobody has ever understood how these Sith hounds translated to each other. Tuk’ata can perceive Sith language on a limited scale likely because these creatures were created from the alchemy of the Sith. Even with their ability to understand Sith language to an extent and wield the intelligence to communicate with each other, it is not enough to classify them as complete sentient creatures.\n\n# Non-Sentient Beings\nSith familiar is a type of scavenger bird-like creature also created from Sith Alchemy. Their non-sentience shows itself from the behavior these obedient creatures display to their masters. Sith familiar did not act on its own but instead by the will of its master. The master would be capable of seeing and hearing whatever the ravager happened to. These birds may have been Sithspawn as well as force sensitive, but they lacked the independent intelligence to directly communicate, display or understand emotion, or make use of tools. The closest feat to resource usage was their ability to use Force powers projected to them by their masters but this was entirely from the master’s will and not the familiar’s prowess.\n\n","meta":{"index":8,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Sentience","release_year":2022}},"Nssis-class Clawcraft":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Nssis-Class Clawcraft was a starship designed for combat that was originally developed by the Galactic Empire, but was modified by the Chiss.

Its most notable difference was the change of the wings that a normal TIE fighter would have, but instead replaced with two pairs of curved wings that resemble an X-wing strike foils. In weaponry, the Nssis-Class had a L-s72 laser cannon on each tip of the wingin its shields, the Nssis-Class had a deflector shield and a thick hull armor to make it more durable. For their speed in combat, it wasn't very efficient, with its ion engines reaching a maximum speed of 1000 Km/h with an acceleration of 40k m/s, making the Nssis-Class have less speed than other notable starfighters. However, despite its speed, it had great maneuverability due to its curved wings and mounted jet in each wing that permitted the Clawcraft to adjust its position very efficiently.

Amongst the Gree, only the Gree masters knew how to construct and operate the gates. The Gree eventually refused to create more gates, as to not duplicate what they saw as sacred relics.

Its limited ground assault capabilities left a substantial gap in the Imperial Navy's starfighter fleet, particularly in heavy bombing operations, and the call for a more advanced and robust alternative grew louder. Sienar Fleet Systems, well-versed in supplying the Imperial fleet, saw an opportunity to innovate and fill this strategic gap. This realization gave birth to the TIE/x2 project, an initiative aimed at developing a starfighter that could deliver heavy payloads and operate effectively in hostile situations.\n\nThe project was a collaboration of talented engineers and military tacticians, who built upon the lessons learned from combat encounters, insights from reconnaissance reports, and the evolving dynamics of interstellar warfare. The goal was to create a starfighter that was not only a bomber but also capable of executing precision strikes to disrupt enemy formations and break through fortified defenses. The road to the TIE/x2's creation was paved with challenges, as the team grappled with the intricacies of integrating a dual hull design and balancing enhanced firepower with maneuverability. Despite these hurdles, their tenacity paid off, and the first TIE/x2 models emerged, ready for battle. These starfighters were swiftly deployed to the front lines and proved their worth in the subsequent engagements, providing a tangible validation of the strategic need that spurred their creation. The TIE/x2’s development stands as a testament to the Empire's commitment to tactical innovation and adaptability in its bid to maintain galactic dominance.# Imperial Use\nBattle of Yavin:\nIn the Battle of Yavin, TIE/x2s were deployed to deter the Rebel's X-Wings and Y-Wings, as well as to deliver devastating payloads to Rebel command and control structures, disrupting their communication and coordination.\n\nSiege of Lothal:\nDuring the Siege of Lothal, the TIE/x2 was vital in the Empire's strategy to subdue the planet. It rained down destruction on key defensive installations, weakening the Rebel defenses and clearing the path for Imperial ground forces.\n\nBattle of Hoth:\nThe TIE/x2 also played a pivotal role in the Battle of Hoth, performing targeted bombing runs against Echo Base while simultaneously engaging in aerial combat against the Rebel Snowspeeders. The Bomber's heavy firepower and tough armor ensured the Rebel's defenses were significantly weakened, paving the way for the Empire's victory.\n\n# Design and Technology\nThe TIE/x2 possessed the characteristic solar panels and spherical cockpit found in TIE starfighters, but with an added distinct feature of a second hull pod. The twin hull design, where one pod was dedicated to the pilot and flight systems, and the other accommodated the bomber's ordnance bay, stood as a unique feature.\n\nLength: 7.9 meters\nHeight: 5.4 meters\nHull: Reinforced durasteel\nCargo Capacity: Depending on ordnance\nWingspan: 10.6 meters\nMaximum Atmospheric Speed: 850 km/h\nEngine: Twin P-s5.6 Twin Ion Engines\nShields: No standard shields\n\n# Ship Armament\nThe TIE/x2 was heavily armed and carried an impressive payload.

Its capacity for delivering a variety of heavy payloads was crucial for demolishing heavily fortified structures, clearing the way for Imperial troops. This combination of bombing capabilities and strafing potential made it a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.

With the Jedi Order’s purpose at the time being shifted to military affairs as opposed to law enforcement, it allowed for the rise of crime in areas that were less heavily guarded, specifically the Outer-Rim. The Black Sun was founded on Mustafar by Xomit Grunseit and maintained bases on planets such as Ord Mantell throughout the galaxy, stretching their reach far and wide. \n\nDuring the Clone Wars, the syndicate instantaneously became very influential, and was run by a group of Falleen noblemen on Mustafar. During the war, the Black Sun was coerced by Maul into joining his Shadow Collective after his brother, Savage Opress, killed their leader, Xomit Grunseit. Under the Shadow Collective, the faction banded with the Pyke Syndicate and participated in the Battle of Ord Mantell, defending against the Confederate Trade System’s Separatist army. \n\nTowards the end of the Clone Wars, Ziton Moj, the newly appointed leader of the Black Sun, proposed merging with the Pyke Syndicate. However, in a turn of events, Marg Krim, the leader of the Pyke Syndicate, rejected his proposal. He retaliated by kidnapping his family in order to force Krim to change his mind. This led to Krim hiring two bounty hunters to rescue his family. The two bounty hunters raided the Blade Sun fortress on Mustafar and succeeded in rescuing Krim’s family. The Black Sun retaliated by sending a fleet to attack the Pyke stronghold of Oba Diah. \n\nIn the aftermath of the fall of the Galactic Republic, and the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Black Sun maintained a durable relationship with the autocratic government, and kept watch over the Outer-Rim. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, the notorious crime syndicate Crimson Dawn returned after a long absence and sent out a message to various criminal factions by the leader Lady Qi’ra, inviting the syndicates to bid for the carbonite encased Han Solo.

Serving during the time of the Jedi Civil War, the majority of Sith Troopers were actually traitorous Republic soldiers while others were volunteers from worlds conquered by the Sith. To ensure weakness was eliminated from all troopers, enlistees were subject to merciless Sith training schemes, turning them into formidable and fearsome soldiers. These training methods also instilled fear into the troopers, ensuring they would not falter in combat or think to betray the Sith.\n\nSome Sith Troopers took advantage of the fear they instilled in others for personal gain, threatening and intimidating people to get what they wanted. Others were legitimately loyal soldiers who simply believed the Sith were more suited than the Republic to control the galaxy. Sith Troopers were often seen as expendable by their superiors, such as when Darth Malak ordered the destruction of Taris to kill Bastilla Shan, showing no regard for the thousands of Sith Troopers stationed on the planet. Following the Jedi Civil War, most Sith Troopers fell under the command of the Sith Triumvirate, later participating in the battles of Onderon and Telos IV.# Equipment\nSith troopers were outfitted with unique reflective armour, coloured either black, red, or white with padding underneath and a visor to conceal their faces. This armour did not have any distinct indication of rank, so higher-ranked soldiers often wore red or copper armour to show their rank.\n\nWeapons carried by Sith Troopers varied depending on their specialization, though standard Troopers were equipped with a Sith assault gun, Sith sniper rifle, stun baton, and vibroblades; some were additionally equipped with Sith energy shields.

A powerful Jedi Knight who became one of the most powerful Sith Lords of all time, only to turn on the Sith once more and strike down his former apprentice and fellow Sith, Darth Malak. After Malak’s death, Revan seemed to disappear from the galaxy, seemingly out of nowhere. However, little did the people know, Revan was being held in captivity by the Sith Emperor, Vitiate, hidden away from the galaxy that he once protected and terrorised. \n\nVitiate’s Sith Empire attempted to eliminate all traces of Revan from their history. They desired the name to be forgotten. And it very well could have been, if not for a small, secretive group operating within the Sith Order and Empire itself. The Revanites. \n\nThe Revanites were bound by one code and one philosophy; the teachings of Revan. They resisted the attempts made by the Sith to censor any previous history of Revan, and began to follow his teachings. The Revanites sought to balance both the light and dark sides of the Force, believing it to be the ultimate path to power. They came to believe that the Sith Emperor Vitiate was no more, and that he had been slain by Revan himself, now apparently free of imprisonment. They claimed that this information was being withheld by the Dark Council, who were supposedly fearful of the repercussions such a revelation could have on the Sith Empire. \n\nThe Order of Revan was founded by Tari Darkspanner, a Sith training in the academy on Korriban. She happened to stumble across records of Revan that the Order had failed to remove. After much reading, she came to learn that Revan and a party of supporters had previously confronted the Sith Emperor on Dromund Kaas. History would tell you that Revan was unsuccessful, and he was imprisoned by the Emperor while his friends were all slain. However, Darkspanner believed differently. She came to believe that Revan had actually slain Vitiate and claimed the Empire for himself. \nAfter these supposed revelations, she came to found the Order of Revan. Unlike the Empire it was birthed from, the Order welcomed alien species as equals, and accepted individuals from across the Empire’s many service branches and organisations. The Order grew to several hundred members strong, and began to publicly voice their beliefs across the Empire. However, this caught negative attention from the Dark Council, who branded the Revanites as heretics and forced them into hiding. From the jungles of Dromund Kaas, the Revanites conducted their operations in secret, with varying levels of devotion in its members. Some forgot their Sith teachings entirely and devoted their entire lives to the Order. Others were more closeted in their beliefs, going about their daily lives while secretly hailing Revan as their true master. The Dark Council attempted to stamp out the organisation on frequent occasions, viewing their attempts to combine the teachings of both the Jedi and the Sith as heresy. \n\nTari Darkspanner may have been the founder of the Order. However, Revan himself later emerged as their leader. Revan had prieviously been split into two halves; his light and dark side, due to the torture he endured at the hands of Vitiate and his Dreadmasters. His light side was cast out in the form of an apparition, with his dark side maintaining Revan’s physical form. Under Revan’s leadership, the Revanites grew in strength exponentially. Placing agents into all corners of both Empire and Republic, Sith and Jedi. Some of these agents included Darth Arkous of the Dark Council, and Colonel Rian Darok of the Republic Special Forces branch. \n\nThe Revanites waged war on both the Republic and the Empire, enlisting the help of many groups such as the Nova Blades pirate gang. Both the Empire and Republic also began to root out and detain sleeper agents embedded in both factions. Theron Shan of the Republic was able to broadcast the identities of every sleeper agent and their location, which promptly led to their detainment. \n\nAfter this defeat, Revan rallied his forces on Yavin IV for his ultimate objective. Revan planned to destroy all life on the moon in order to wake the slumbering Emperor Vitiate. Once awoken, Revan sought to destroy him once and for all. Realising the sheer amount of death and destruction this act would cause, both the Republic and Empire formed a temporary truce to combat the Revanites. Coalition forces would confront Revan and defeat him in battle. Despite this victory, the Emperor awoke, fueled by the death brought on by the war between the Revanties and the Coalition forces. \n\nAfter Revan’s defeat, the Order of Revan disbanded.

They used this level of advanced knowledge and technology to not only conquer, but enslave everyone they conquered. The Rakata had gained this level of knowledge and technology by a species named, the Kwa, a force sensitive species. The Kwa had a piece of technology called the “Infinity Gate”, they used this Gate to instantly travel to the Rakata homeworld of Lehon. The Kwa gave them knowledge of the Force, and even gave them highly advanced technology. However, the Kwa soon realized that a lot of the Rakata species was ignoring the Kwa’s interpretation of the Force, and instead, diving into the Dark Side of the Force. This gave them the jump start that they needed to begin conquering worlds other than their own, but not any normal planet, rather planets that were attuned with the Force. The Infinite Empire was now created, and they would go on to conquer and enslave. Before doing that, they decided they wanted the Kwa’s Infinity Gate’s technology.

This group of curious and enlightened monks was among the first to study and uncover the philosophies, principles, and abilities surrounding the Force as well as midi-chlorians. It was very much speculated that the Order of Dai Bendu played a large role in the foundation of the Je’daii Order, the beginning organization of the Jedi. Some even say that the Dai Bendu directly established the Je’daii Order themselves, but there has never been any solid evidence to prove such.# Organization/Philosophy\nThe Dai Bendu monks lived in isolation on Ando Prime, away from all the larger cities and other communities. Each monk praised and dedicated their learning to the most sharp-witted of their group, the “High Priest.” They had constructed tents in the mountains of the snowy planet and gathered their pure water from the mountains through pipelines which the monks had considered a vital aspect of their tradition. Many of the monks kept their principles prevalent by building an abundance of temples and other structures in the name of their tradition on the other worlds they migrated to in the Tython system. \nDai Bendu's attire consisted of a basic long robe with the addition of a pointed hood and orange/red robes for the High Priest in the later years. Numerology was also a big part of their initial beliefs before the discovery of the Force. The Dai Bendu adopted the belief that the number nine expressed the Force’s beneficial presence in a galaxy unified by many aspects. Because of their ideologies surrounding numerology, they developed a sigil to represent their Order, the radius being nearly identical to the ones carved onto the Tho Yorr.\n\n# Early History\nThis ancient order originated from a planetary object found in the Mid Rim region of the galaxy known as Thape in the era of the Early Hyperspace age, an era that saw the beginning of technology for space travel purposes across the galaxy. Monks from this age first studied numerology but became further enlightened upon the discovery of midi-chlorians, microorganisms that reside in the cell of all living beings, allowing the Force to establish a connection with each one. This allowed for leeway for much more convenient studies of the Force, which is the reason for their journey across the galaxy. Following their instincts, the Dai Bendu was led to the planet known as Ando Prime, a world located within the Mid Rim territories housing a Force nexus. As a result of their migration to this snowy world, the newer arrivals to the Order of Dai Bendu consisted of monks of Talid descent, the primordial sentient species to the snowy world of Ando Prime.\n\n# First Migration\nSometime during 37,453 BBY, the Order of Dai Bendu recovered a mysterious pyramid-like structure buried in the snow. Feeling a great power within, the monks dug up the strange construction. Providing the ancient structure with the name of ‘Tho Yorr” in the Dai Bendu language, the monks would congregate before this pyramid to meditate even in the harshest of cold. Claiming that one day with enough patience through meditation, they would hear the voice of the Tho Yorr. It was precisely a thousand years for the Dai Bendu to finally witness the prophecy they had formulated come true when the Tho Yorr released a call to a group of monks, opening the object simultaneously. Naturally out of curiosity to uncover what their great years of patience brought to them, the monks entered the mysterious object to discover that it was indeed a starship. \n\n\nThe Tho Yorr transferred this group of monks to another world, a world in the Deep Core of the galaxy that has seen many impactful events throughout its time: Tython. Upon arriving on Tython, the group of monks was surprised to see that seven other Tho Yorr were present to repeat the same process of transferring sentient beings to Tython that happened to hear their voice. As a result, the monks along with a few other select species became known as the first sentient organisms to inhabit the world of Tython, otherwise known as Tythans. With the assistance and unification of other force-sensitive species, the Dai Bendu contributed to the foundation of the Je’daii Order, a sect of force-sensitive individuals seeking to maintain peace throughout the galaxy by adopting principles of balance. One of the monks of the Dai Bendu known by Lha-Mi, a Talid monk, went on to become one of many Je’daii Temple Masters. The term “Je’daii” would be derived from two Dai Bendu words: “Je” being mystic and “dai” being center. With all of the desires for balance, it did not come easy as the planet eventually grew to pose too much of a threat to non-force sensitive beings, a root cause for the second migration.\n\n# Second Migration\nSometime after the year 35,453 BBY, the city of Aurum built by the Tythans was destroyed by a Force Storm, a type of Force occurrence on Tython in particular. This event led to the death of many non-force-sensitive Tythans and was the reason behind their migration to other worlds in the Tython system. The non-force-sensitive Tythans traveled in search of a newer, much safer place to settle. Their expeditions produced wonderful results as they were able to find Kalimahr, a green surfaced planet, the very first new settlement as a reward for their search. Due to their travels, planets such as Kalimahr would be a center for religious practices and philosophy. Some of the Dai Bendu monks that chose to travel with the Tythans built additional temples and monuments on Kalimahr, further establishing their beliefs and reputation. One of their structures was built within the eastern quarter of the Khar Peninsula but was later abandoned and became a place for the Stargazer cult to seek shelter in. Many inhabitants and residents of Kalimahr were enlightened by the knowledge that the Dai Bendu possessed, sometimes even stopping by to listen to the monk’s chants by the spaceport.\n\n# A New Order Arises\nIt took thousands upon thousands of years before the Je’daii Order and the Order of Dai Bendu’s principles had been forgotten, leading to the foundation of a newer group known as the Jedi Order. The Jedi Order formed after the Force Wars that transpired in 25,793. These conflicts between the Dark (Bogan) and Ashla (Light) resulted in the Dark follower's defeat. Principles of the Je’daii Order demanded that there be balance, otherwise known as “Bendu.” Due to the conflicts that presented themselves during the Force Wars, the philosophy behind Bendu was abandoned and the followers of Ashla later succeeded the Order of Dai Bendu as well as the Je’daii Order to become the Jedi Order.\n\n","meta":{"index":15,"author":"Chilimeni","name":"Order of Dai Bendu","release_year":2022}},"Zann Consortium":{"content":"# Overview\nThroughout the duration of the Galactic Civil War, the underworld consortium and criminal syndicate of Tyber Zann undermined Rebel and Imperial operations.

Kamino served as headquarters for a brief time, but the Kaminoans had few resources and were unable to provide much assistance.

He led the Consortium to victory over the Imperial forces on Ryloth, the only obstacle to utilizing the planet, and then hid until Tyber Zann was ready.\n\n# Post-reformed Zann Consortium: Accumulation of Power\nThe Consortium's only asset was the Palace on Ryloth and a few mercenary soldiers. Zann had Fen kill the Imperial Governor on Honoghr to proclaim the Zann Consortium's return to the galaxy. Shola was targeted for racketeering, followed by Mandal Hypernautics raids. This offered the Consortium some money and ships while power was covertly developed. Zann was obsessed with avenging the Empire and heard the Emperor kept his money in vaults. The Consortium scouted the Yavin system after the Death Star's destruction, thinking it was common protocol for Imperial stations to evacuate data pods before they were destroyed to loot them. Tyber led a small force through the first Death Star's remnants orbiting Yavin Prime. He recovered a data pod with designs for the Eclipse-class dreadnought, which was being built in the Kuat Drive Yards, and the Aggressor-class destroyer after engaging Rebel Alliance forces in the region controlled by Wedge Antilles. Zann planned to steal the Eclipse, which would be the Emperor's flagship like the Executor was for Darth Vader.\n\nJabba the Hutt destroyed the Consortium barracks on Ryloth and certain Consortium assets around the galaxy as Zann fought the Rebels and Imperials in the Yavin system. This forced Zann to end the Hutt threat. Consortium spies found a relay station on Saleucami where Jabba the Hutt was organizing his forces, which Urai Fen quickly took. The Consortium then headed to Hypori, where Zann ended his fight with Jabba in a former Confederacy of Independent Systems battle-droid factory. After shutting down the automated production lines and bribing Bossk, Zann had Jabba by the throat, demanded the bounty on his head be removed, the attacks on Consortium personnel and property stop, and Saleucami and Hypori be permanently ceded to the Consortium in exchange for his release. Jabba agreed on the provision that Hutt Space was to be left alone. Hypori factories now produced second-generation Droidekas.\n\nThe Zann Consortium secretly established themselves on many planetary systems around the cosmos. Sullust, Kashyyyk, Dac, and Naboo were its main slave markets, and some were used as cannon fodder during Consortium ground operations. The Consortium kidnapped Imperial and Rebel officials, including Kuat's Bevel Lemelisk, the most renowned \"victim\". Even when Imperial soldiers, including Darth Vader, arrived, Zann blamed Prince Xizor for taking tibanna gas from Bespin, bringing him down.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Endor, Tyber commandeered the Eclipse and annihilated a second Super Star Destroyer. The Consortium seized billions of dollars, decades-old technological information, and valuable art from Emperor Palpatine's vault network, thereby ensuring the Consortium's galactic expansion. Tyber abandoned Eclipse following his robbery because it was a \"target that even the Rebels could not ignore.\" The Eclipse was reclaimed and reconstructed by affiliates of the Imperial Remnants. Zann also permitted the Rebel Alliance to establish the New Republic's \"ownership of a senator.\"\n\nThe Consortium also sought to comprehend the Sith holocron, which had been confiscated from Jabba during his negotiations with the Galactic Empire on Felucia. During the robbery on Coruscant, Consortium's Nightsister Silri seized the holocron before they could interpret it and disclose its secrets. The item led her to a Sith mausoleum containing thousands of carbonite-frozen soldiers.\n\nAdmiral Natasi Daala's fleet emerged from the Maw Installation and launched a succession of attacks against the New Republic in 11 ABY, many years after the Zann Consortium fleet had been defeated.\n\n# Consortium's Military Units\n~ CONSORTIUM ARMY ~\nInfantry:\nDefiler\nMercenary Assault Squads\nGrenadiers\nEwok Handlers\nVornskrs\nNightsisters, riding rancors\nSlaves of various species, including:\nBothans\nGeonosians\nGungans\nMon Calamari\nSullustans\nTwi'leks\nWookiees\n\nDroid Works:\nDroideka Mark II\n\nBlack Market Technology:\nDisruptor rifles\nCore overload\nProximity mines\nPistoeka sabotage droids\nCloaking devices\nPoint-defense laser cannons\nSensor jammers\nCarbonite missiles\nShield leeching devices\n\nVehicles:\nMZ-8 Mobile Pulse Cannon\nF9-TZ Transport\nMissile Attack Launcher\nCanderous-class assault tank\nMobile Defense Unit\nAll Terrain Attack Pod\nInfantry Support Platform\nBantha-II cargo skiff\nHAVt B5 Juggernaut (originally Empire)\n\n~ CONSORTIUM NAVY~\nStarfighters:\nStarViper-class attack platform (equipped with buzz droids)\nStarViper M-2 fighters\nSkipray Blastboat\nTIE/LN starfighter (originally Empire)\nTIE/sa bomber (originally Empire)\nTIE/D Defender (originally Empire)\nA-Wing (originally Rebel)\nRihkxyrk Assault Fighter\nAggressor assault fighter\n\nTransport Ships:\nTZ-86 transport\nRZ-52 Dekard transport\nTZ-15 shuttle\nLambda-class T-4a shuttle (originally Empire, only known use is during Theft on Bespin)\nAction VI transport\n\nCorvettes:\nCrusader-class corvette\nTartan-class patrol cruiser (originally Empire)\nBroadside-class cruiser kdb-1 (originally Empire)\nCR90 corvette (originally Rebel)\nMarauder-class corvette (originally Rebel)\nIPV-1 System Patrol Craft\nPB-950 patrol boat\n\nFrigates:\nVengeance-class frigate\nInterceptor IV frigate\nEF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate (originally Rebel)\nAcclamator-class assault ship (originally Empire)\nImmobilizer 418 cruiser (originally Empire, only known use is during Piracy over Bespin)\nStar Galleon-class frigate\n\nCapital ships:\nAggressor-class Star Destroyer (stolen Imperial design)\nKeldabe-class battleship\nVenator-class Star Destroyer\nEclipse-class dreadnought (During Battle for the Eclipse)\n\nKnown ships:\nIG-2000 (Theft on Bespin onwards)\nHound's Tooth (Until Space Battle at Carida)\nMerciless (Space Battle at Carida onwards)\nEclipse (During Battle for the Eclipse)\nEnd of Days\nFlatline\nVanity's Price\nRetribution\nBrilliance\nCensure\n\n","meta":{"index":66,"author":"Rysesaka","name":"Zann Consortium","release_year":2023}},"Order of the Sith Lords":{"content":"# History\nThe Order of the Sith Lords was assembled roughly one thousand years before the fight of Yavin by a Sith Lord called Bane.

The brotherhood would carry on the will of the Dark Lord alongside the Mandalorian crusaders and the Karth in the following Great Sith War and beyond.# Deceived and Rebirth\nThe brotherhood began when Exar Kun traveled to Ossus just after the death of the revered Jedi Arca Jeth. With his proficiency in persuasion and the current situation of the Jedi Order combined, 20 Jedi knights had been deceived by the Sith and followed him to Yavin IV with a promise to find “Ancient Jedi technique” for the purpose of strengthening the order.\nBefore the Dark Lord departed from Ossus, he did not forget to pay a visit to Odan-Urr. a Jedi master and Jedi librarian who guarded the Sith Holocron. With his might, Exar Kun was able to break into Odan-Urr’s chamber, slew the Jedi Master, and claimed his artifact. However, fate itself seems to be against the Dark Lord of the Sith. Just after he ended the Jedi Master’s life, his convinced knights found him in the act of claiming the artifact. Utilizing his quick wit, Exar Kun proclaimed himself the successor of Odan-Urr. Explained the death of the Jedi Master as a natural death after the burden of duty had been lifted from him and from now on the Sith shall be the guardian of Odan’s Holocron. Increasingly impressed by the savior in their eyes, those knights would follow him to Yavin IV with no longer deliberation.\nContrasting to what they might have expected, Yavin IV was bloating with Dark Side energy. The scenery of ruined temples and huge bestial Massasi warriors only amplified and sowed even more doubts into the mind of the Jedi. One of the Jedi, Oss Wilum attempted to escape from the planet. Fortunately, his attempt was a failure as he was stopped by Massasi warriors. \nAfter Exar Kun realized how his plan was almost undone by the unresolving doubt, decided to feed them with one more lie. He proclaimed that the reason they came to Yavin IV was to cleanse it from Dark Side influence. Solidify his claim by explaining that the reason he brought Odar-Urr’s Holocron with him was to use it for the purification process. \nFinally fully convinced, 20 Jedi Knights followed Exar Kun into the Sith temple. The Dark Lord shattered the Holocron of Odan-Urr, instead of the purification they had been promised, they got brainwashed and fell into the Dark Side from the sinister influence of the Sith Lord’s teaching which got released.\n\n# The first Test\nThe former Jedi knights now the Brotherhood of the Sith embraced the teaching of Exar Kun wholeheartedly. Their education on the Dark Side went well without much trouble. When Kun was confident in their abilities, he initiated a test and a mission for all of his students called “The Jedi Program”. This program made his disciples go back to their former Jedi Masters and assassinated them. It was a huge success, most of his students succeeded, proving the Sith’s superiority. Although some had failed. Unable to kill their masters or defeat their masters at the cost of their own lives.\n\n# Defeat\nAfter the capture of Ulic Qel-Droma, Exar Kun decided to invade the Jedi Library on Ossus. The successful rescue of his apprentice revealed the treachery of the Death Witch Aleema Keto. Desired to rid himself of further complications, Kun ordered the Witch and the failed disciple to set the Star off to supernova in the Crone Drift. Killed both of his undesirable followers.\nEverything was gone according to the Dark Lord’s expectation until Ulic Qel-Droma got shot down and captured once again. The arrival of the Jedi and the implementation of the Lightside technique, the Wall of Light, were the last catalysts that settle the result of this war in stone.  \nDespite the unlikeliness of the circumstance they were facing. Some members of the Brotherhood of the Sith did survive the event. They fled to planet Empress Teta and used it as their last stronghold. The Galactic Republic did not hesitate to throw everything they had at them in the hope to end the Sith’s threat quickly. All remaining Sith stand their ground and resist far longer than anyone would have expected. Still, their defeat is immanence. In the end, the Brotherhood was no more.\nEven though the Brotherhood as a whole was no more, some of its members survived. At Least one of them not only survived but went on to set the foundation of the later Sith Order. At the Sith ancient home Korriban, an academy had been erected. This same academy would soon be used by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Reven in the restoration of the Sith Order.\n\n","meta":{"index":22,"author":"nuariel","name":"Brotherhood of the Sith","release_year":2022}},"Bergruutfa Clan":{"content":"# Overview\nClan Bargrutfa was one of many clans assigned to young would-be Initiates who began learning the ways of the Jedi Order.

Shortly before the Clone Wars, the lore of Clan Bergruutfa was overseen by the Abyssinian Jedi Master Qarmal, and its members were mostly humans, including Whiphid, Zabrak, Qel-Dor, Duros, and Nautolan. In 20 BBY, they were aboard a Mon Calamari starship when it was attacked by General Grievous and a Separatist fleet.\n\n The ship came under heavy fire, and Grievous and his army boarded the ship. Master Quormor did his best to protect his initiates, but he was forced to die while the cyborgs took off with the youths. After landing on the C-9979 landing craft on Versus, which was captured by the CIS, the clan was taken to a cell, where they awaited Grievous' orders.

Also known as the Pyke Family, The Syndicate, or The Pykes, this ruthless group of criminals was at the forefront of dealing in raw spice. This raw spice was the main ingredient in creating a powerful drug commonly used across the galaxy. The Pyke Syndicate became one of the most powerful crime families in the galaxy by creating a monopoly over this spice, and by being the best and transporting and selling it.# Section 1\nHailing from their homeworld, Oba Diah, the Pyke Syndicate almost entirely controlled the flow of spice throughout the galaxy. This shady organization did not do it alone, however, as they had many alliances and dealings with other groups. These groups include the Black Sun, Maul’s Shadow Collective, the Crimson Dawn, and the Hutt Clan. Through illegal dealings with these other organizations, the Pyke Syndicate constantly acted on what would make them the most money and give them the most power.\n\n# Section 2\nAlthough many might believe it, the Pyke Syndicate are not simply smugglers and criminals. The family possessed a powerful army of troops, known simply as the Pyke Syndicate Foot Soldiers. Soldiers in this group often were seen carrying CC-420 pistols, or larger rifles given to them. There was also a larger, more fierce type of soldier at the Pykes’ disposal: the Pyke Sentinel. These well-trained, powerful warriors were armed with larger, more specialized weapons, including electro-staffs, stun spears, and blaster turrets. \n\nThe Pykes used their formidable forces in a variety of ways. Their footsoldiers and Sentinels would often be seen accompanying the Pykes’ freighters as they moved spice from planet to planet. These forces were not simply security forces, however. The Pykes participated in the Syndicate War, a great war between rival criminal gangs and drug smuggling organizations.\n\n# Section 3\nWhile the Pyke Syndicate at one time was a terrifying force ruling the drug trade across the galaxy, by 18 ABY, the Syndicate’s power had faded greatly. While they still had holdings and power in some parts of the galaxy, many losses to individuals such as Boba Fett, Ahsoka Tano, and the mercenary Ledesmar caused their grasp on the drug trade to slip.\n\n","meta":{"index":95,"author":"TorrykkTheGod","name":"The Pyke Syndicate","release_year":2024}},"Jabba's Criminal Empire":{"content":"# Information\nIn the vast galaxy of Star Wars, few criminal organizations are as notorious and feared as Jabba's Criminal Empire. Led by the infamous Hutt crime lord, Jabba Desilijic Tiure, this sprawling syndicate has left a lasting impression on the galaxy's underworld. From its base on the grimy desert world of Tatooine, Jabba's Criminal Empire exerted influence over smuggling, piracy, and various illicit activities across the galaxy.# Section 1\nJabba's Criminal Empire traces its origin to the Hutt species, renowned for their insatiable greed and cunning. Born into the influential Desilijic clan, Jabba inherited a vast criminal network that was honed and expanded over time. Utilizing a combination of ruthlessness, manipulation, and the strategic use of resources, Jabba quickly rose to the top of the galactic criminal hierarchy. At the heart of Jabba's Criminal Empire lies its involvement in smuggling operations. The syndicate trafficked illicit goods, including spice, weaponry, and forbidden artifacts, using Tatooine as a central hub for these activities. Furthermore, Jabba's empire played a significant role in the slave trade, capturing and selling sentient beings for profit.\n\n# Section 2\nJabba's Palace on Tatooine stands as a testament to his power and influence, providing an iconic representation of underbelly Star Wars universe crime. Situated near the inhospitable Dune Sea, its location made it the site for criminal meetings, lavish parties and even executions - creating its unique architectural design and extravagant decorations as a powerful visual metaphor of crime in Tatooine. Jabba used manipulation and coercion to cultivate relationships with various factions such as corrupt politicians and bounty hunters in order to expand his empire further beyond illegality while using legitimization tactics such as legal business ventures to further consolidate power within his criminal empire.\n\n# Section 3\nJabba's reign of terror eventually came to an end. A group of rebels led by Princess Leia Organa were instrumental in infiltrating Jabba's Palace and eventually overthrowing him and ending his life. Jabba's Criminal Empire left an indelible mark on the Star Wars universe that will live long beyond Jabba himself. Jabba was responsible for sparking power struggles between various criminal organizations who vied for control, leaving Jabba an empty position to fill. Jabba left an irrevocable mark. Eris has earned her place among cinematic history as an unforgettable villain due to her unchecked criminality, luxurious lifestyle and iconic presence - qualities which made her one of cinema's most striking villains. Further, her empire served as a cautionary tale highlighting its effects as well as tempting allure of darker paths for everyone living within its borders.\n\n# Conclusion\nJabba's Criminal Empire stands as a testament to the depths individuals can sink in pursuit of power and wealth. From its origins in the seedy underbelly of Tatooine to its arrogant display of influence, the empire has captivated audiences and served as a reminder of the complexity and allure of villainy.

The Onderon resistance group would be successful in freeing the Onderon, with this the first Rebel Cell was formed. Close to the end of the war another resistance would grow but within the Senate. When Supreme Chancellor Palpatine obtained a huge amount of emergency power, senators like Padme Amidala, Bail Organa and Mon Mothma would start to oppose the Chancellor and wanted him to get rid of his huge amount of power quickly. This attempt to dispose of the Chancellor’s power would fail and in the end Palpatine would call himself the Emperor and convert the Republic into the Galactic Empire.\n\n# Section 3\nWith the Rise of the Galactic Empire numerous Rebels cells would form across the galaxy. At first they would operate independently but a secret communication between Rebel Cells would be formed. The Rebels Cells would start being more organized in attacks, making them more successful. With the Rebels proving that the Empire wasn’t invincible, more people across the galaxy started taking up arms. With the sudden resignation of Mon Mothma the plan to form the Rebel Cells into one faction was initiated. Mon Mothma would be transported to Dantooine where she would make a speech to the galaxy, telling them to join the Rebel movement. This would infuriate the Empire and make them set their full attention to this new opposition to their rule. The Rebels Cell Phoenix Squadron and the Massassi group would make a temporary base on the planet of Atollon. The Empire discovers the base and a fleet led by Grand Admiral Thrawn was sent to blockade it.

Mon Mothma ordered the Rebels to set all sights on destroying the second Death Star. Through determined preparation the Rebels laid siege to the second Death Star. Little did they know until the last minute that the Emperor had let the Rebels know the second Death Star location to end them once and for all. The Rebels would be surprised to learnthat the Death Star was operational but through the leadership of Admiral Ackbar they would be able to surpass that challenge. The Emperor severely underestimated the Rebels and as the shields went down a team of small Star-Fighters broke the Imperial Star-Destroyers blockade and flew all haste to the Death Star. The Imperials tried to stop them but it was too late and seconds later the second Death-Star was no more.

Led by Kal Skirata, the clan would grow to become one of esteem and respect in Boba Fett’s reunited Mandalorian society. \n\nClan Skirata would be unique as it was mostly made up of clones who had chosen to leave the Republic instead of complying with Order 66. The Clan would be made up of Null-Advanced Recon Commandos and Clone Commandos from Omega Squad, all of whom would be traditionally adopted by Kal Skirata and embrace Mandalorian culture. \n\nThe Clan, while small, would become known as extremely capable due to the abilities of its unique clone members who were all veterans of the Clone Wars. As a result of this, the Clan would grow to prominence under the rule of Mand’alor Boba Fett and would be responsible for saving the Mand’alor’s life by reversing the effects of the cloning process on Fett’s body.# Pre-Clone Wars\nPrior to the Clone Wars, Clan Skirata was made up of Munin Skirata and his adopted son, Kal Skirata. Munin would train Kal to become a Mandalorian mercenary like himself, a job Kal would come to excel at. \n\nThe Clan would then grow when Kal Skirata would take a wife and have three children; Tor Skirata, Ijaat Skirata and Ruusaan Skirata. Unfortunately for Kal, his wife would leave him as a result of Kal’s long time spent away at war and due to the fact Kal wished to take his two sons with him to war, despite their young age of 8.\n\nKal Skirata would then answer Jango Fett’s call to serve as a member of the Cuy’val dar and take part in the training of the Clone Army.\n\n# Clone Wars\nKal Skirata would save the lives of the Null-Advanced Recon Commandos after they had been deemed defective, he would mentor the ARC Troopers and raise them as Mandalorians, giving each one a Mandalorian name. These ARC Troopers would become the finest soldiers in the Grand Army of the Republic and declare staunch loyalty to Kal Skirata. Towards the end of the Clone Wars, Kal Skirata would officially adopt the Null-ARC Troopers as Mandalorians and induct them into Clan Skirata. \n\nKal Skirata would plan for the Null-ARC Troopers to desert the Republic alongside as many other Clone troopers that would be willing. The Republic Commando Squad, Omega Squad would follow Kal Skirata’s plan and refuse Order 66. Kal Skirata would also have his daughter, Ruusaan Skirata broken out of prison to rejoin the Clan around this time and together the group would flee Coruscant and travel to Kal Skirata’s farm; Kyrimorut, to hide from the newly established Galactic Empire.\n\n# Post Clone Wars\nAfter the Clone Wars, Clan Skirata would grow with multiple members of Omega Squad and the Null-ARC Troopers getting married, with Darman Skirata even having a son with his deceased wife, Jedi Knight Etain Tur-Mukan. The Clan by this stage even included the ex-Jedi Knight Bardan Jusik, who had adopted the Mandalorian lifestyle and joined Clan Skirata. After some time, Kal Skirata’s own two biological sons would reconcile with their father and rejoin Clan Skirata. \n\nLate in Boba Fett’s life he would hear of a Clone trooper who had found a way to reverse the clone aging process that was making Boba Fett sick. This Clone trooper would be Jaing Skirata, the Null-ARC Trooper and Mandalorian responsible for figuring out how to reverse the Clone aging process. Jaing Skirata would use the process to save the life of the now Mand’alor Boba Fett, and as a result, Clan Skirata would become well respected in the Mand’alor’s eyes.\n\n# Clan Members\n(Clan Chieftains)\n\nMunin Skirata - Father of Kal Skirata\nKal Skirata - Clan Chieftain\n\n(Null-ARC Troopers)\n\nOrdo Skirata - Adoptive son of Kal Skirata\nA’den Skirata - Adoptive son of Kal Skirata\nJaing Skirata - Adoptive son of Kal Skirata\nMereel Skirata - Adoptive son of Kal Skirata\nKom’rk Skirata - Adoptive son of Kal Skirata\nPrudii Skirata - Adoptive son of Kal Skirata\n(Omega Squad Commandos)\n\nNiner Skirata - Adoptive son of Kal Skirata\nCorr Skirata - Adoptive son of Kal Skirata\nDarman Skirata - Adoptive son of Kal Skirata\nAtin Skirata - Adoptive son of Kal Skirata\nFi Skirata - Adoptive son of Kal Skirata\n\n(Ex-Jedi members)\n\nJusik Bardan - Member of Clan Skirata, ex Jedi Knight\nEtain Tur-Mukan - Member of Clan Skirata (posthomously), ex Jedi Knight, wife of Darman Skirata\n\n(Wives and children)\n\nIlippi Skirata - Wife of Kal Skirata\nBesany Wennen - Wife of Ordo Skirata\nParja Bralor - Wife of Fi Skirata \nLaseema - Wife of Atin Skirata\n\nTor Skirata - Son of Kal and Ilippi Skirata\nIjaat Skirata - Son of Kal and Ilippi Skirata\nRuusaan Skirata - Daughter of Kal and Ilippi Skirata\nVenku Skirata - Son of Darman Skirata and Etain Tur-Mukan\n\nJusik Bardan’s wife, as well as numerous children and grandchildren.

They were a family of three composed of a dark side user son, a daughter who was won with the light, and a father, who was a balance. The Father's job was to control both siblings and make sure there was always a balance in the force. As long as the father stayed alive the two others would live forever with great power unless killed. Their species were called Force Wielders which is a mysterious species with high force sensitivity and the ability to change into different forms. They were considered gods.# Section 1\nThe Son was a male Force wielder who was selfish and truly embodied the dark side of the force. He was angry, bitter, and arrogant. As the father grew weaker he looked for someone to take his place. Eventually, after sending a mysterious help single out, Anakin Skywalker came alongside his padawan and his master to Mortis. The Son was angry about his father's decisions and wanted to escape Mortis. Despite the son's anger, he used this new arrival as an opportunity. The Son wanted to turn Anakin to the dark side to help him escape, first starting by converting his Padawan.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Daughter was a female Force wielder who was selfless and embodied the light side of the force. She was humble and compassionate. She also agreed with the Father's goals of keeping a balance in the force. Despite her brother's obsession with the dark side she still loved him a lot.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Father was a male Force wielder representing a balance of both the light and dark. After Anakin declined The Father's offer of taking his spot he ran into a huge problem stopping him from leaving, his padawan had been brought to the dark side by The Son. Anakin rushed to where The Son had taken his padawan but at this point, The Son was trying to kill The Father. The Daughter insisted that Anakins Master retrieve The Dagger of Mortis to stop The Son from killing the father. But by the time Anakin got back The Son had overpowered the Father due to his gaining in weakness and knocked him unconscious. Once they returned they fought back against The Son. In time The Son took The Dagger of Mortis and went to stab the father but the daughter got in the way giving her a fatal wound. In her last moments, The Daughter told the father to combine the little bit of energy she had left to save Anakin's padawan's life, killing the daughter and saving the padawan. Because of the imbalance of the force Mortis grew into darkness, which now brought The Son to his original goal, to convert Anakin to the dark side so he could escape. The Son lured Anakin to a volcanic place deep in Mortis where he showed Anakin his dark future. Anakin devastated by this vision, fell under The Son's control and asked The Son if he could help him stop this from happening. The Son lied and said he would agree to help him. After the padawan and master heard about The Son succeeding in converting Anakin the padawan sabotaged their ship so The Son and Anakin couldn't escape. The Son went to get The Dagger so they could stop The Father again. But this time despite The Father's weakness, he was able to take The Dagger from the son and then did something unexpected. The Father stabbed himself as he fueled his kids' power. Because of this, the son lost all his power making Anakin snap back to the light. Anakin stabbed The Son with his lightsaber, making an end to The Ones and bringing a balance in the force back to Mortis.\n\n","meta":{"index":3,"author":"ChaseTheStarWarsNerd","name":"Ones","release_year":2023}},"The Galactic Empire":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe  Galactic Empire is a an authoritarian regime led by Emperor Palpatine, also known as Darth Sidious. The Empire controlled most of the galaxy and was known for its military might, using massive machinery projects such as the infamous Star Destroyers and the Death Star as symbols of its power. The Empire’s oppressive sovereign led to the formation of the Rebel Alliance, which sought to overthrow the Empire and restore freedom to the galaxy. The Galactic Empire was relatively recent on a galactic scale and largely undocumented. As the fortunes of individuals and groups have changed in the Empire, and Emperors have risen and fallen, historical documents have been altered, misplaced, or outright destroyed. Much of what remains is lacking and has been pieced together with what remnants. It was poorly sourced and often blatantly propagandistic remaining from those years.# Section 1\nThe Empire put up little resistance until numerous rebel cells banded together to start the Galactic Civil War, with the growing rebellion achieving its first major victory against the empire in Mustafar in 4 BBY. These rebel cells formed the Alliance to restore the Republic in 2 BBY, and the Rebel Alliance itself achieved its first major victory by stealing the plans for the Death Star on Scarif, which in turn led to the destruction of the Death Star at the Battle—Yavin in 0 BBY. The Alliance achieved early successes in the following years until the Empire's major victory on Hoth in 3 ABY. Still, a year later the Empire suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Endor.

It was a matriarchal monarchy - the woman’s role and power in this society and as a monarch to lead the organization. Members of the organization were near-Human Hapans situated with the consortium in the Hapes Cluster, a closely packed star cluster in the inner rim of the galaxy. Besides politically being a matriarchal monarchy, the organization was a consortium due to its social structure. Multiple smaller organizations and civilizations were working to constitute the Hapes Consortium to achieve a common objective. The Consortium consisted of sixty-three different planets.\n\nThe organization’s archaeological structures were on the Hapans' homeworld, Hapes. The organization was known to have conquered a hundred and thirty more star systems with at least one habited planet each. The star systems existed before three thousand BBY after the Lorell Raiders got eradicated by the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order. \n\nThe Hapes Consortium was one of few insular civilizations in the galaxy that preferred to stay isolated from other cultures and societies to invest in their own. After this long period of isolation, a few select Hapans tried to break free from the authorities in Hapes but were ultimately defeated. \n\nThe Hapans encountered the Galactic Empire once and claimed that the pacifists and diplomats in their society were degrading the organization. With no assistance, they got to their burdens. The organization was known to be an individualistic companion of the empire. Despite this, they found themselves in a border skirmish in the Adnaila system amid the Galactic Civil War. They left their isolative past and contacted the New Republic and the Singing Mountain of Dathomir to open up to the rest of the galaxy.# The Queen Mother\nThe Hapes Consortium, ruled by the Queen Mother who held court at the Fountain Palace on the homeworld of Hapes or aboard the Royal Transport ship called Star Home when she was traveling. The Queen Mother’s title was hereditary - only her daughter after her had the authority to take her place as the Queen Mother. If the current Queen Mother failed to have a daughter of her own, the partner of her firstborn son should accumulate the title. Occasionally, relatives of the Queen Mother competed to execute the downfall of the Queen Mother out of pure jealousy to get the title. Individuals who were threatening the queen for this reason were convicted of treason and executed right away.\n\nDuring court, multiple representatives from the respective planets in the Hapes Consortium voted on political matters and updated the status regarding the economy and social structures in their homeworlds. Usually, it was matters that the queen was concerned or bothered by. The Queen Mother had the final verdict on every topic and decided the outcome of the vote.\n\n# History\nAfter the Lorell Raiders were eradicated and wiped out by the Jedi Order 4030 BBY, the remaining survivors of the series of incidents, the majority females, came together to institute a new government and political form where one woman ruled the civilization and was the Queen Mother. This chosen woman united all planets with respective civilizations in the Hapes cluster under the newly found organization - the Hapes Consortium. This Queen Mother instituted the rudimentary foundation of the organization with this decision. She began the archaeological construction of Star Home. After this crucial project, the Queen Mother decided to close the borders of the Hapes Consortium to any outsiders and conquer more worlds in the cluster to colonize and rule over. This society was isolated for three thousand years until it opened its borders again to outsiders 8 ABY. Alliance agreed upon between the Queen Mother of the time, Ta’a Chume, and the other representatives of the New Republic.\n\nDuring 27 ABY, the current Queen Mother was a woman called Tenel Ka Chume Ta’ Djo. 36 ABY Queen Mother’s daughter Allana was born. The Corellian leadership during the Second Galactic Civil War wanted the Hapes Consortium to fight on their side by attempting to assassinate the Queen Mother and her daughter but failed.\n\nRoan Fel, a member of the New Empire, got together with a woman named Elliah. Killed by the unloyal servant Imperial Knight Eshkar Niin, the Hapaan people accused Roan Fel of her case since the Knight was his servant. It led to friction developing between the New Empire and the Hapes Consortium.\n\nThe Hapes Consortium had its borders still neutral and open for the outsiders in the events of the Sith-Imperial War and the Imperial Civil War that followed.\n\n# Culture\nAssassination attempts and competition for power were frequent among the upper classes and noble houses.  It was widespread among the noble houses to plot death on someone they were jealous of, even if it was a family member, to get power in society.\n\nThe Queen Mother was portrayed as an idol and viewed as a goddess by the hapans. Her selecting a partner to stand by her side was crucial to all citizens. To be her partner and consort, one had to be included as nobility to keep the gene pool going. There was a feud between noble houses about whose son would be the Queen Mother’s consort’s son. The noble houses always attempted to assassinate the consort and the next woman up after the Queen Mother’s reign for their benefit. Due to this, the Queen Mother’s heir, Allana, had her father’s identity sealed to prevent jealous hands from touching her.\n\nMen were given the role of second-class citizens due to the matriarchal society. They solely increased the population, but some held power. This power was limited, leading to some men leaving the matriarchal society and becoming pirates, living in the Transitory Mists and preying on vessels that did not know of their background and identities. They resumed this lifestyle until Nova-class battle cruisers caught them and sent them to trial. They faced execution depending on the crimes they committed.\n\nAnti-Jediism was a popular political ideology. The Hapans praised it due to the fall of the Lorell Raiders in the series of battles against the Jedi Order. The ideology broke out among the Hapans during the reign of Queen Mother Ni’Korish. She despised the Jedi due to the damage they caused. She attempted to wipe out all Jedi who dared to fly in the Hapes Consortium. Anti-Jediists established a faction afterward in the Yuuzhan Vong War. Members named it after her.\n\n# Military\nWhen the Hapes Consortium was founded by the first governing Queen Mother, a vital and vigorous military operated on the side. Individuals who held the title of Hapan Royal Guard were considered of higher authority by the public. They were seen in crimson clothing by the citizens that resembled the role and power they held. For instance, a prince called Isolder had a Hapan Guard guarding him on orders from Captain Astarta. \n\nThe Hapan Royal Guard’s uniforms were one-piece and compared to a flight suit. The uniforms were tight and adjusted to body types. Members painted the uniforms in a deep red color.\n\nAnother role with an authority even higher was the Elite Commando present in the so-called Her Majesty’s Select Commandos that served her and performed crucial and secretive missions.\n\nThe Hapan Security was the most important agency for the preservation and upkeep of law enforcement. The Hapan Royal Navy guarded the planet Hapes of the Hapes Consortium space administration.\n\n# Commerce\nThe galaxy knew the Hapes Consortium due to its possession of great wealth. Trading groups with power could trade with their traders excellently due to their fame and wealth. After leaving the age of isolation, the Hapes Consortium, goods were the base in trading, and the Hapans continued to utilize their currency. Their currency was more valuable than Imperial, Republic, and New Republic. The Hapan currency swung in their favor, uplifting them as great traders. \n\nThe items they had access to ranged from rainbow gems to guns of command. Illegal and legal markets sold these items for high prices. Even though a business could function on all planets in the Hapes Consortium, the government, and Hapan law made an institution that said that Hapes is where all vital business and financial transactions go.\n\n","meta":{"index":93,"author":"Clumpat","name":"The Hapes Consortium","release_year":2023}},"Gen’Dai Bounty Hunters":{"content":"# Information\nGen’Dai Bounty Hunters were not only tall, large, and immortal-like beasts, but had many special abilities that came in handy, which included the ability to revitalize after death - especially during and after the High Republic era. Somewhere in 200 BBY, a Gen’Dai named Rayvis stumbled upon a fallen Jedi Knight by the name of Dagan Gera and fought. Rayvis’ defeat eventually marked the beginning of a life vow as a sign of eternal loyalty to his new master, where he would assist him in disorderly activity, until Dagan’s disappearance not long after. However, the pair eventually united during the prime of the Galactic Empire centuries later.# Section 1\nLike Rayvis, another bounty hunter named Durge had a notorious status for being a fierce and powerful opponent who worked for the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the Clone Wars, he was known for being extremely unkillable at the time, as he had fought a variety of higher ranking Jedi and troopers, where none had the opportunity to successfully defeat, nor weaken him. He became rather fearsome across the pirate communities across the galaxy, where he even managed to frighten experienced leaders. Therefore, he came in contact with very few pirates throughout his life, as they wanted nothing to do with him or his businesses.\n\n# Section 2\nHe was eventually employed by the Galactic Empire in 3 ABY, many years after the Clone Wars, to fulfill a contract that required him to apprehend weapons smuggler Ebann Drake aboard the abandoned spaceship \"Opal Empress.\" On the ship, he unintentionally came across a few doctors, notably Lona Aphra, who reminded him that parasitic cymotes were concurrently infesting the ship. As they decided to resolve this issue by pairing up, Aphra betrayed Durge and blew him into space, where he somehow managed to survive. Following this encounter, Durge was determined to become a part of bounty hunter guilds, where he was ultimately tasked with finishing other challenging assignments throughout the rest of his lifetime.\n\n","meta":{"index":92,"author":"Iridinia","name":"Gen’Dai Bounty Hunters","release_year":2023}},"Antarian Rangers":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Antarian Rangers were a part of the Security force. It was founded in 620 BBY on the planet Antar IV to help the Jedi Order. This law enforcement agency, another name for it being a Planetary Security Force, had two more names it was called, Police Force and Security Force. The organization was the ones to enforce the laws. This group was to make sure they make sure everything was under control and protected many things, such as life and places.# Organizational Structure\nThe one of a kind organization of the non-force users were different to the civilians in the galaxy. They were to show no fear of Jedi and their powers. Yet, they had promised to help them and work as support troops that the Jedi needed, also dedicating their lives to it. The troops' objective was varied, such as taking reconnaissance duties and covert operations. This had been put in place for the Jedi’s work to be less laborious but meant they had to do dirty work sometimes. \n\nEventually, they increased to thousands of individuals and the ranks were diverse just like the ones in the Jedi Order. The Jedi had found useful ways to use the Antarian Rangers, only affiliating with little groups that they were familiar with. It seemed that the Jedi had permanent companions of Antarian Rangers.\n\nNot many members had managed to join the Antarian Rangers without being chosen by an existing member. The recruits were to be watched as some were rejected for training with their Jedi counterparts. The faction consisted of Explorers, Lieutenants, Rangers, Ranger Captains and Ranger Generals.\n\n# Origins\nRangers had been created within the planet of Antar IV around 620 BBY - the one who caused this action was a human Jedi Knight from Coruscant, Marus Timpel. After he arrived at the planet to supervise some tasks that were given, he had an encounter with a Gotal called Kaskutal. He was one of the people who had been turned down on the Jedi training. However, they eventually formed a group to assist the Jedi Order’s issues in the galaxy.\n\nThe increase within the core was leading to the rangers being mostly humans, but many species were still joining the cause, helping them to grow bigger and better. The Jedi did not stop the expansion of the Antarian Rangers due to them  proving themselves useful in many ways, including during the Clone Wars.\n\n# Dark times\nIn the Imperial Era, the rangers turned into an unofficial military force and a resistance underground unit. The rangers weren’t able to get to the same level as the Rebel Alliance. In order to find and save the Jedi from Order 66, they had to use military operations to save and find the surviving Jedi. This also had conflict with imperial oppression while making sure their people were safe.\n\n\nMany people of the organization had been tracked by Darth Vader and his Inquisitorius, both with a ruthless dedication. As a part of the rangers, individuals faced similar consequences due to them helping Jedi, who were fugitives.\n\n# Rebirth\nIn the dawn of the New Republic and New Jedi Order, Luke Skywalker had revealed history belonging to the Antarian Rangers and figured out some survivors. People started to reconstruct the ranks, even though the New Republic were suspicious that another independent, paramilitary group was emerging. The group was small and tried to rebuild their numbers and make a success. \nIn the invasion of the Yuuzhan Yong in 25 ABY, the Antarian Rangers were back at the numbers they use to have before the Clone Wars. The Rangers were crucial for defending the underground organization that protected opposition of the Vong, called the Great River, and scouting for new paths to go.\n\n# Appearance\nWhen the rangers weren’t recruited with Jedi, they would mainly train as well as improving their abilities for when they are ready to serve, They had no official set of uniform, so they just wore brown leather jackets, which look identical to their off-duty outfits.

During the time of the era of Darth Nihilius they were doing reconstruction on the native grounds of Telos IV and became a pest to the land’s nature. Because of this the fallen Jedi Meetra Surik helped them after the Native Ithorians sought him to take down the Czerka Corporation on Telos IV exposing them of their crimes. Of course, this was still not enough to expose them and be rid of them for good as they were still a threat on Tatooine since the days of Darth Revan, they were still using illegal practices on the planet and were known to use the ancient Rakata’s nanotechnology to control the minds of the people and even some Czerka employees that found themselves going to close to the secrets they were hiding, they were in charge of a mind prison found from an ancient Rakata known as the imprisoned one, from here they would be stopped and there was no knowledge of the Czerka Corporation until the Galactic Empire years away from the rise of Darth Revan where the timeline was past 0 ABY the Galactic Empire would use the Czerka Corporation to enslave the wookies and ultimately have their final evil deeds until 4 ABY the last known data of the Czerka Corporation where the Galactic Empire was defeated and replaced by the Galactic Republic.","meta":{"index":48,"author":"Real_RedStar","name":"Czerka Corporation","release_year":2023}},"Sorcerers of Tund":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Sorcerers of Tund were an ancient order of dark side users from the planet of Tund which was located within the Outer Rim territories of the galaxy. The Sorcerers were well-known for their dark, shadowy, and Sith-like robes and outfits. Their talents with the Force were high-powered which was proven due to their mastery of deception, Force illusions, and even shapeshifting. The Sorcerers rarely left their home however and were also noted to have been driven to insanity by their explorations and experimentations with the Force.# History\nThe Sorcerers of Tund first established themselves on the planet Tund sometime after the Great Hyperspace War of 5000 BBY and also sometime around one of the Great Schisms on the teachings and philosophy of the Force. The Sorcerers first started out as a group of exiled pure-blooded Sith Kissai, though they were also believed by the Jedi to have been descendants of Sith pure-bloods who were also exiled from the planet Korriban.\n\nHowever, when they came to be on Tund, they quickly established a Sith pure-blood society that combined science, ontology, and magic together. Through their encounters with the Rakatans, whether it was through Rakatan scriptures or in-person Rakatans, they became convinced of the idea that all living sentient beings are Force-Sensitive and connected through The Force. They also called it the Unity.\n\nThe Jedi at this time viewed the Sorcerers as nothing more than another harmless dark side cult, however, that would change during both the Restoration and the reign of terror by the Sorcerer's leader, Karnak Tetsu during the Great Sith War of 3996 BBY. After these events, the Jedi Order attempted to convert members of the Sorcerers Tund over to the light by trying to convince them to use the Force without the use or assistance of their magical mysticism. When the Jedi had failed to convert all of their members, they instead chose to monitor and ensure that they didn’t fall too far towards the dark side.\n\nAs the years went by, the Sorcerers were no longer under the watchful eye of the Jedi Order as numerous events and crises had forced them to relocate their attention and resources elsewhere for more important matters regarding the Republic. After the Galactic Republic's conversion to the Galactic Empire, the first emperor of the Galactic Empire, Sheev Palpatine, saw no point in continuing surveillance with the Sorcerers as he deemed his Imperial Navy fit to deal with them should the need arise.\n\nThe Sorcerers of Tund would eventually meet their end in 22 BBY at the hands of a Croke member. Since the Sorcerers were quite welcoming of outsiders into their ranks and cult, Rokur Gepta joined the Sorcerers as a means to gain their knowledge and learn their secrets. However, when there was nothing more to learn and their usefulness was at an end, Rokur launched an electromagnetic torpedo at Tund, killing all life on the planet including the Sorcerers.\n\nWith the cult either dead or scattered, Rokur became the last member of the Sorcerers until he met his end at the hands of the renowned gambler and charmer, Lando Calrissian. Thus, officially ending the order of the Sorcerers of Tund. There was a possibility that there could’ve been members outside of Tund, though, it was rare for them to venture outside of their homeworld.\n\n","meta":{"index":90,"author":"BoarGrills","name":"Sorcerers of Tund","release_year":2023}},"Nightbrothers":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Nightbrothers, a tribe of Dathomirian male Zabrak that were loyal servants of the Nightsisters. They lived in a village on the outskirts of Dathomir and spent most of their lives training. All Nightbrothers were trained to fight with axes, daggers, spears, and their bare fists. Their members were separated into smaller tribes that were overseen by Brother Viscus around 21 BBY. They also adorned full body tattoos that were considered tradition as they were seen as the markings of a warrior. Their facial markings were seen as the equivalent to the blemishes from bursting blood vessels that streaked the faces of the Nightsisters.# Section One\nThose who proved themselves worthy after fighting in the arena of the Crucible were granted the ability to wield weapons infused with powerful Nightsister magic. They also received cuffs and shoulder armor. In rare cases the Shaman of the Nightsisters would select a chosen one and grant him powerful energy. A coven of crafters helped the shaman inject the energy of spirits into the chosen, turning him into a warrior behemoth. When transformed, Zabrak were a head taller with a broad chest, strong arms, and a crown of horns. Clan Mother Talzin said that they were powerful warriors, but lacked the ability to balance conflicting energies that came from the Twin Gods. She also thought that males were simpler and more beastlike than females.\n\n# Section Two\nDecades before the Clone Wars, a small group of male Zabrak were brought over from Rattatak during a pirate raid. The Nightsisters realized that they could interbreed with the Zabraks, which led to the creation of the Dathomirians. The Nightsisters isolated the Zabraks to a small section of the planet where they could be summoned when needed. The Shaman of the Nightsisters, Talzin, restricted the use of males once she became the leader of all Nightsister covens. She later decided to keep the sisters and brothers separated. The Sith Lord, Darth Maul, was formerly a Nightbrother before being taken by Darth Sidious to be his apprentice. During the Clone Wars, the Nightsisters trained Savage Opress, Maul’s blood brother. Opress was also next in line to replace Asajj Ventress as Count Dooku’s apprentice. Ventress recognized the Nightbrothers as adequate fighters, but felt that they were not represented very well in isolation. Her opinion was contrary to Mother Talzin’s view, that they could learn and achieve a lot under the direct tutelage of a Nightsister.\n\n","meta":{"index":39,"author":"ElysiaLValkyrie","name":"Nightbrothers","release_year":2023}},"Sun Guard":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Sun Guard was a Thyrsian mercenary company and one of the most feared in the galaxy, centered on the planet Thyrsus in the Thyrsus system.

Many Sun Guards served the Sith Lords directly, led by their Supreme Sun Guardian Thull Wulain, and other Sun Guards were considered for the position of prime clone in the Grand Army of the Republic. The 2nd Regiment of the Sun Guard fought in the Clone Wars, but were crushed by Republic general Solomahal. When Sidious needed the Sun Guard no longer, his apprentice Dooku ordered his own minion Asajj Ventress to eliminate them. Some of the few surviving Sun Guards went on to join Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's Red Guard, Royal Guard, and for those few Force-sensitive individuals, the Shadow Guard. A new generation of Sun Guards arose during the Yuuzhan Vong War almost fifty years later, defending Thyrsus against the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong and seeking to restore their group's traditions and reputations.\n\nThe Sun Guard transitioned from being a special-forces unit in the Thyrsus military to a renowned mercenary group. This piece delves into their transformation, principles, and unique organizational structure.# Origins and Early Philosophy\nThe Sun Guard finds its roots as a special-forces unit within the Thyrsus military, incorporated into its rank structure. In contrast to their Echani forebears, the Thyrsians upheld a male-dominated system, emphasizing armor and bladed combat. During its inception, the Sun Guard drew spiritual significance from the sun. As they expanded beyond Thyrsus, the unit capitalized on its unparalleled combat skills, evolving into a mercenary group akin to the Mandalorians, shifting away from religion as its primary motivation. However, religious influence resurfaced when the Sun Guard fell under the sway of the Sith, yet this allegiance did not deter them from pursuing mercenary work and demanding payment for their services.\n\nFierce and devoted, the Sun Guard gained a fearsome reputation, with their uniforms alone inspiring dread. Their services encompassed sabotage, kidnapping, rescue, warfare, and various other tasks, all sharing a common thread - previous failures by others attempting them.\n\nOrganized into regiments, legions, and hierarchies, the Sun Guard operated effectively in teams of four. Initiates held the rank of Stellar Legionnaire, enduring a provisional year during which any breach of Sun Guard etiquette, like cowardice or undisciplined behavior, could lead to expulsion. Successful initiates were promoted to Stellar Tribune, entrusted with leading a legion of 20 to 40 soldiers.\n\nThe Sun Guard's officer ranks were exclusive, granted only to heroic Tribunes. Titles such as Twisuns Legate, Twisuns Praetor, Thychani Commander, Thychani Dictator, and Supreme Sun Guardian represented the esteemed positions within the officer corps. Advancement relied solely on military heroism, while cowardice led to immediate expulsion at any rank.\n\nIn its early philosophy, the Sun Guard epitomized unwavering dedication to valor and military prowess. While they distanced themselves from religious fervor during their mercenary phase, the allure of Sith influence brought a mystic dimension to their identity.\n\n# Becoming Mercenaries\nAs they expanded beyond Thyrsus, the Sun Guard capitalized on its unparalleled combat skills and restructured itself into a mercenary group similar to the Mandalorians, relinquishing religion as its primary motivation. They offered their services for a price and undertook missions that had defeated others before them.\n\nThe allure of financial gains and professional reputation drove the Sun Guard's mercenary pursuits. Nevertheless, their fearsome reputation and unwavering dedication to their cause remained intact. Their services spanned sabotage, kidnapping, rescue, warfare, and various other tasks, earning them a formidable reputation across the galaxy.\n\nThe Sun Guard's organization revolved around regiments, legions, and various hierarchical levels, ensuring efficiency and coordination in their operations. Their small teams of four operated in harmony, executing missions with precision and unity.\n\nInitiates embarked on their journey by assuming the rank of Stellar Legionnaire, enduring a one-year provisional term to prove their mettle. During this period, adherence to the Sun Guard's code of conduct was paramount, and any display of cowardice or undisciplined behavior could lead to swift expulsion. Those who demonstrated valor and dedication advanced to the esteemed rank of Stellar Tribune, commanding a legion consisting of 20 to 40 skilled soldiers.\n\nThe Sun Guard's officer ranks were exclusive, granted only to heroic Tribunes. Titles such as Twisuns Legate, Twisuns Praetor, Thychani Commander, Thychani Dictator, and Supreme Sun Guardian represented the esteemed positions within the officer corps. Advancement relied solely on military heroism, while cowardice led to immediate expulsion at any rank.\n\nThe Sun Guard's journey from their origins in the Thyrsus military to becoming feared mercenaries exemplified their adaptability, resilience, and unwavering dedication to their philosophy of valor and military prowess.\n\n# Formation and early history\nEarly History of the Sun Guard:\n\nThyrsus, a planet inhabited by the near-Human Echani species, was one of the Six Sisters within the Echani Command, governed by a female council. However, Thyrsian culture differed from typical Echani traditions in several ways. The society on Thyrsus was male-dominated, and its people had dark hair and skin, distinguishing them from their Echani counterparts. Instead of the Echani's focus on hand-to-hand combat, Thyrsians favored bladed weapons and heavy armor. Their spiritual beliefs diverged as well, with a profound reverence for the sun, in contrast to the moon-focused spirituality of the Echani.\n\nThyrsus seceded from the Echani Command during the Begali Uprising of 1154 BBY, while Begali eventually renewed its allegiance to the planet Eshan. Despite this, Thyrsus remained fiercely independent, and its military units took on a sigil depicting Thyrsus' red suns. Over time, the special forces of Thyrsus evolved into what became known as the Sun Guard. Engaging in numerous battles with the Echani, they secured their independence when the Pact of Almera was confirmed in 899 BBY.\n\nThe Evolution into Mercenaries and Rivalry with Mandalorians:\n\nFollowing centuries of peace among the Six Sisters, the Sun Guard embraced a more independent and semi-nomadic lifestyle, gradually adopting the role of a renowned mercenary unit. Many Sun Guards became esteemed bounty hunters and gladiators, venturing into various conflicts throughout the galaxy.\n\nTheir unparalleled skills and fearless reputation led to a fierce rivalry with the Mandalorian warrior culture. Engaging in small duels to the death instead of full-scale military engagements, the Sun Guard devised tactical countermeasures to challenge the Mandalorians' reliance on jetpacks in air combat, an aspect they held in contempt.\n\nThe rivalry between the Sun Guard and the Mandalorians reached its peak during the Battle of Sintheti in 402 BBY. Both groups were hired by rival claimants to the Horned Throne, leading to a protracted and brutal three-year conflict amid the planet's crags and catacombs.\n\nTransformation into a Sith Cult:\n\nThough the Sun Guard initially held a strong focus on religion, over time, they shifted their outlook, realizing the futility of endless warfare leading to poverty. Nevertheless, religion continued to hold sway over them. About a century before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Thyrsus' culture developed a fixation on matters of the Force, particularly a prophecy about a galactic savior known as \"the son of suns.\"\n\nDuring this pivotal period, the hidden Order of the Sith Lords exploited the Thyrsian belief, encouraging Sith interpretations of Jedi beliefs and propagating the notion that the Sun Guard might fulfill the prophecy. Succumbing to the allure of Sith influence, the Sun Guard transformed into a Sith cult, drawn towards the enigmatic ways of the dark side of the Force.\n\n# In the service of Darth Plagueis\nDuring the last century of the Republic, the Muun Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Plagueis, enlisted a company of silver-armored Echani Sun Guards to provide security at his residence on the moon Sojourn. These Sun Guards replaced the Iotran Brandsmen who previously defended the world. Additionally, a contingent of Echani Sun Guards protected members of Damask Holdings, a company led by Plagueis in his public persona as \"Hego Damask,\" a powerful financier. The company brokered a deal with Foreman Wat Tambor of the Techno Union to establish the planet Hypori as a training ground for the Sun Guard.\n\nIn 67 BBY, the Sun Guards accompanied Damask's deputy Larsh Hill and other Damask Holdings members to High Port Space Center on Muunilinst, where they rendezvoused with Damask. During an annual meeting of influential beings on Sojourn, known as the Gathering, Plagueis ordered the Sun Guards to carry out various tasks. These included stranding Gossam senior managers of the firm Subtext Mining on a remote world in the Tingel Arm, as well as providing protection during a confrontation with a rival Sith Lord, Darth Venamis.\n\nIn 65 BBY, Plagueis dispatched his Sun Guards to recover the stranded Gossams and execute them, leaving their bodies outside Subtext Mining's headquarters on Corellia as a warning. Later that year, the Human Palpatine, an associate of Damask, committed a heinous crime. Plagueis sent some Sun Guards and the droid 11-4D to take control of Palpatine's ship and cover up the incident. After this event, Palpatine became Plagueis' Sith apprentice, adopting the name \"Darth Sidious.\"\n\nAround the same time, the Sith elevated a Sun Guard named Thull Wulain to the position of Supreme Sun Guardian, and Wulain pledged loyalty to Darth Sidious. The Sun Guard continued to provide security at other Gatherings held by Damask on Sojourn and performed rescue missions for Plagueis, such as the retrieval of Palpatine from the clutches of Santhe Security on Coruscant.\n\nIn 33 BBY, King Ars Veruna of Naboo attacked Sojourn, resulting in the demise of the Sun Guards stationed on the moon. Plagueis hired replacements from Thyrsus and stationed some Sun Guards to protect Damask at his Coruscant penthouse. Over the years, Damask became increasingly reclusive, and the Sun Guards' duties were limited to escorting visitors and maintaining ground-based turbolasers. Plagueis left Palpatine to his own devices, and the Sun Guards informed Palpatine of his master's erratic behavior.\n\n# Agents of Lord Sidious\nAt some point before 32 BBY, Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord, utilized his influence to consolidate the Sun Guard in the Thyrsus system under his command. These elite guards were assigned to protect his stronghold on Coruscant, eliminating any underdweller who approached too closely.\n\nThe Sun Guard played a crucial role in Sidious' intricate plans surrounding the Battle of Naboo. He utilized them to assassinate reluctant businessmen and pivotal senators, ensuring his planned election as Supreme Chancellor under his public persona, Palpatine of Naboo. Sidious' apprentice, Darth Maul, used the Sun Guard as opponents in his practice duels to hone his combat skills.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, the Sun Guard actively participated in the conflict, with their 2nd Regiment suffering a crushing defeat at the hands of Republic General Solomahal. Some Sun Guards were also deployed during a Trandoshan-led attack on the Republic-held world of Kashyyyk, where they encountered Jedi Padawans and were ultimately defeated.\n\nAmidst the turmoil of the Clone Wars, rogue factions of the Sun Guard led a mercenary army in a campaign against the Mistryl Shadow Guard, resulting in an orbital bombardment of the Shadow Guard's homeworld, Emberlene.\n\nAs Sidious' long-awaited plans for the Sun Guard unfolded, his apprentice Count Dooku ordered a significant portion of the organization to be executed, with the most devoted Sun Guards integrated into Palpatine's Red Guard, later becoming the Royal Guard. Some Force-sensitive Sun Guards were selected as candidates for the Emperor's Shadow Guard, while others, like Kenix Jir, became cloning templates.\n\nThe rise of Emperor Palpatine and his manipulations of the Sun Guard caused divisions in Thyrsian society. Many Thyrsians supported the Emperor and saw the Royal Guard as the rightful successors to the Sun Guard, leading them to enlist in the Imperial Army and Stormtrooper Corps. However, some Sun Guards viewed Palpatine's actions as detrimental to their traditions and sought to restore their organization's reputation and honor.\n\nAfter Palpatine's death in 4 ABY, Thyrsus became an isolationist world. Yet, during the Yuuzhan Vong War of 25–29 ABY, a new generation of Sun Guards emerged, defending Thyrsus against the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong and striving to uphold their organization's ancient traditions and honor.\n\n# Equipment and Techniques\nMembers of the Sun Guard wore distinctive helmets, resembling those of the Republic's Senate Guard, which likely served as inspiration for the latter. The advanced visor of the Sun Guard helmet allowed them to image thermal data, infrared, and ultraviolet wavelengths, enhancing their surveillance and sniping capabilities. The Sun Guard armor, characteristically black, was renowned for its resistance to damage without impeding their mobility. Belt-spats worn around their waists inspired the design of the kama later used by the Grand Army of the Republic.\n\nThe Sun Guard uniform was instantly recognizable and feared throughout history. It inspired the design of the Galactic Empire's Imperial Royal Guard, and even one of the Sun Guards' own, Carnor Jax, later became a Royal Guard, donning a black uniform reminiscent of his father's Sun Guard armor. The Sun Guard's reputation extended to bounty hunters like Moxin Tark, who obtained and replicated their armor. Dr. Nashiak Llalik, an Imperial armor designer, drew inspiration from the Sun Guard's armor, influencing the design of specialized stormtrooper units in the Empire.\n\nAlthough a Sith cultist group, the Sun Guard were generally not Force-sensitive, but exceptions existed. They excelled in stealth and melee combat, preferring close-range confrontations. Their combat style, believed to be the origin of the echani martial art, was modified to be more brutal and deadly under Palpatine's guidance. Sun Guard armor was designed for close combat, with vibroblades in gauntlets, spikes in boots and knee pads, forearm gauntlets, and fist plates that could be heated to burn flesh. Flamethrowers and dart launchers were common offensive augmentations.\n\nThe pike was the Sun Guard's common weapon, which they held in near-sacred reverence. These pikes, about a meter in length, featured double-edged vibroblades, some made with cortosis ore to resist lightsabers. Ritual pikes, known as solar pikes, could be activated to heat their tips to red-hot temperatures. Force pikes were equipped with stun modules to paralyze enemies. The Sun Guard developed innovative ways to use pikes as anti-air weapons against Mandalorians, neutralizing their jetpacks.\n\nThe Sun Guard's combat skills were nearly unmatched, with only Mandalorians able to stand against them. Like the Echani, they possessed the ability to read body language to predict opponents' moves. Highly skilled in personal combat and gladiatorial fighting, they excelled in urban warfare tactics, sweeping buildings and eliminating enemies block by block. Some Sun Guards were also proficient in space combat, piloting sleek ships during their missions.\n\n","meta":{"index":57,"author":"ArtamielDude","name":"Sun Guard","release_year":2023}},"Sith Eternal":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Sith Eternal were an organization that resided on the dark desert planet of Exegol in the Unknown Regions, where secretive and mysterious cultists venerated Darth Sidious and revered the dark side of the Force, and followed the ways of the Sith. The reach of the Sith Eternal was vast and went far beyond the Unknown Regions. Steeped in ancient traditions, they used rituals designed to mine the secrets of the Force, they delved into the nature of phenomena such as Force bonds and dyads in the Force and believed that the galaxy was theirs to rule by cosmic right.\n\nDue to its remote location and inherent secrecy, Sith Eternal choose Exegol as its base during the reign of the Galactic Empire and had his subordinate began to experiment with cloning technology in a bid to extend his lifespan and also with genetic machinations, leading to the creation of various artificial genetic constructs, known as strand cast, such as Supreme Leader of the First Order Snoke as well as the Emperor's cloned son, who sired a natural-born Force-sensitive daughter called Rey. The Sith Eternal constructed the Xyston-class Star Destroyers comprising the Final Order, which would become the largest fleet in galactic history.# History\nIn 19 BBY, the Galactic Emperor Palpatine, also known as Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord who masterminded the fall of the Galactic Republic and rise of the Galactic Empire, withdrew from the eye of the public in order to begin probing the secrets of the dark side and Sith lore in order to begin his quest in obtaining immortality. On Exegol, the Sith Eternal, within the ancient Sith Citadel on the planet, began to experiment with the science of cloning in a bid to extend, with the end goal of ultimately permanently sustaining, their Emperor's lifespan. During their service to Emperor Palpatine, the cult's labor and cloning experiments led to the creation of several genetic constructs, including an elite guard, and the start of the construction of a new fleet of Star Destroyers on the planet by the time of the Galactic Civil War.\n\n","meta":{"index":89,"author":"Mateo_222","name":"Sith Eternal","release_year":2022}},"Refugee Relief Movement":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Refugee Relief Movement, also known as the RRM, was a charitable organization whose origins lay in providing aid to billions of people residing in Coruscant's poorer districts.

The New Sith Order collapsed after Krayt’s death because Darth Wredd lured most of the One Sith Infiltrators into an engagement against the Imperial Knights known as the Battle of the Floating World.# Darth Krayt's new Order\nThe New Sith Order's origins date back to around 27 BBY on Korriban when Jedi Master A’Sharad Hett proclaimed himself the new Dark Lord of the Sith under the name of Darth Krayt. Unlike other Dark Lords of the Sith, Darth Krayt didn’t follow Darth Bane’s Rule of Two. Instead, he abolished it and created his own, known as the Rule of One, where many minions would serve a single Dark Lord of the Sith. The reason for such a decision was because Darth Kryat believed power had to be used by the minions, adepts, and lords to protect the only Dark Lord of the Sith.\nAlthough this New Sith cult knew about Lumiya’s Sith existence, they did not join them because of disagreements regarding the Rule of Two. After the Second Galactic Civil War, Lumiya’s Sith Order perished along with Darth Bane’s legacy against Luke Skywalker’s Jedi Order. With the collapse of Caedus’ Sith Order, the Jedi thought the Sith were extinct.\n\n# The end\nAfter Darth Kryat’s death, his troopers fell into madness because of the power and influence he projected on them. With the eradication of Kryat’s troopers, Darth Nihl ordered the remaining Sith to leave the key worlds, such as Korriban and Coruscant. Darth Nihl, along with his Sith followers, were still on the look for another war, but what was not expected was that they would dominate the galaxy through stealth and patience. To achieve a new victory, Darth Nihl ordered the surviving Sith to infiltrate every planetary government. Unlucky for the remaining Sith, their infiltration would be ruined by a Sith who wanted to re-establish Darth Bane’s Rule of Two, known as Darth Wredd.

Although it had proven itself to be very capable in specific areas such as trade and economic issues, the house was unable to marry into the royal family due to its relatively young age. To counter this problem, House Thul switched a House Organa baby with a child of House Thul. This child was to be a potential bride for the crown prince, however, the plan was foiled by the Jedi, and the entire house was exiled from Alderaan by the Alderaanian parliament. During this exile, the Imperial diplomatic service contacted House Thul and pledged the Sith Empire’s support for the house in its desperation for restored glory. With this imperial support, House Thul joined the Alderaanian Civil War following the Republics' withdrawal from the planet in hopes of installing a Thul on the Alderaanian throne.

They thought that the extinction of Sith was proven, until the ruling Dark Lord Darth Sidious was discovered for his evil thoughts of secretly plotting to overthrow The Republic with the creation of his own Sith Empire. He and his Apprentice Darth Tyranus arranged the Separatist Crisis, provoking political chaos around the Galaxy. Throughout the next three-year period of time, Sidious and his Apprentice created a so-called Confederacy of Independent Systems, a rival galactic government.

But as many say, the enemy of your enemy is your friend; a major ally of the Slave Empire was Count Dooku, also known as Darth Tyranus, and his Separatist Movement.# History\nFor many years, the Zygerrian Slave Empire managed to hold up their slave industry, supplying wealthy citizens of the galaxy with slaves. With the profit coming from the slave industry, Zygerrians managed to build their headquarters and fortified cities on their home planet, Zygerria. Later on, the Old Republic declared slave trafficking as an illegal act, decreasing the amount of earned money, which pushed the business into the criminal underworld. With time, in the era of the High Republic, the Republic has attacked Zygerria’s slave camps, liberating the lives of creatures, including Lourna Dee. After the Republic launched that attack, the Empire built by Zygerrians was destroyed.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Zygerrian Slave Empire, during the Clone Wars era, Queen Miraj Scintel of Zygerria wanted to rebuild the ancient slave-trafficking authority.

Although initially sparing the leader of the cult, Gerlun, he was eventually drained of life to activate the holocron. Doing so, Wyyrlok III had revived the body of Darth Andeddu.

Over the course of their lengthy existence they would become feared by all, including the Sith, and for good reason.# Part I: Founding and History\nImperial Intelligence was established in the earliest days of the resettlement effort on Dromund Kaas by the Reconstituted Sith Empire. It is rumoured within Imperial society that Imperial Intelligence was founded by Grand Moff Vaiken, however, the more common belief is that the Emperor’s powerbase was responsible. \n\nOver the course of its existence Imperial Intelligence would conduct many operations crucial to the success of the Sith Empire that would have a large effect on the galaxy for thousands of years.

With the scepter, Tavion went to the Tomb of Marka Ragnos and revived him in which he possessed Tavion’s body. Korr battled the possessed Tavion and managed to strike her down. Marka Ragnos was sent back into his prison, vowing to have his revenge on the Jedi and leaving Tavion a lifeless body. The republic eventually defeated all of the imperial forces that had helped the cult and when Korr destroyed the scepter all of the cultists lost their power, thus ending the Disciples of Ragnos.\n\n","meta":{"index":74,"author":"EternalTrinity","name":"Disciples of Ragnos","release_year":2022}},"Nightsisters":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Nightsisters are a relatively small clan that reside on the planet known as Dathomir and have extremely powerful knowledge in the arts of the Force. The clan is well known for their sorcery and mystical power that is used to defend their home at all costs. They have even gained other titles such as “The Witches of Dathomir.” These practitioners of the Darkside would have a hatred that could even match a Sith’s when it comes to the Jedi Order.# Section 1\nThe Nightsisters were well advanced with the dark side of the Force, using it in ways that not even Sith could replicate, at least not without proper training. They’re mastery over the arcane power that can be felt throughout Dathomir came from their mystical bond to the magical ichor deep inside the planet. The leader of the clan, Mother Talzin, was known to be a great shaman with astonishing powers and control over the ichor, going so far as to even produce a blade out of the ichor to use in a duel against Jedi Master Mace Windu. The magical feats of the ichor and the sisters know very little bounds, going so far as to even surpass death as the clan have brought back many fallen warriors, Nightbrothers included. An example of their resurrection abilities can be seen as they bring back the fallen former Apprentice of Count Dooku, Savage Opress.\n\n# Section 2\nNot every Nightsister was as attuned to sorcery as their leader, some did well with direct combat. There would be clan members who would use an energy bow to defend their planet and their fellow sisters. The archers would be highly skilled with their weapons and would not be taken down easily. There are also instances when the Nightsisters would even use lightsabers, alongside their own blades with Kyber Crystals that were soaked within the magical ichor. The ichor would disrupt the connection the crystal had to the Force. While not every member of the clan was highly advanced in sorcery, those who did would become an asset to Mother Talzin. One notable Nightsister was known as Old Daka, an elderly Nightsister whose powers didn’t weaken even with her age. Old Daka would have a strong connection to the magicks of the Nightsisters and would be somebody that even Mother Talzin would ask for help if needed.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring the Clone Wars, Talzin would sell her sister’s services as mercenaries to the wealthy of the galaxy. Some Nightsisters would even become bounty hunters. Later on, the Nightsisters were forced to give a young Asajj Ventress to a notorious criminal known as Hal’Sted for protective insurance. After many years, Ventress would return to the planet and seek out her former sisters. The Nightsisters would rush to her aid and Mother Talzin would even select one of the Nightbrothers to be sent out to help Ventress get her revenge against her former master, Count Dooku. Mother Talzin would enchant the Nightbrother and give him the power of physical strength, a power that allowed him to single-handedly take down multiple Jedi. Eventually, after attempts of assassination led by the Nightsisters, Dooku would call upon General Grievous and his forces within the Confederacy of Independent systems to raid Dathomir and the Nightsisters. The clan would hold back as much as they could, and even Old Daka would assist in the defense of their clan, but the battlefield left little to no survivors, being the last time the Nightsisters would ever rise to defend their home. The battle would be known as “The Massacre of the Nightsisters.”\n\n","meta":{"index":65,"author":"Vexrionz","name":"Nightsisters","release_year":2023}},"Kissai Heretics":{"content":"# Overview\nKissai heretics were members of the priest caste of the Sith species exiled from the planet Korriban.

The many clans were in constant dispute for territory until the Sith Adas rose to power at around 28,000 BBY, unifying the warring factions under his reign as Sith King of Korriban. His rule would otherwise be known as the Reign of the Ax. From the perspective of vast galactic history, this period was short-lived, as three hundred years later, Adas was killed in the Invasion of Korriban by the Rakata’s Infinite Empire.

The Empire also secured the Sith Emperor’s fortress and deposited it above the planet Illum. From this station, Darth Malgus declared himself Emperor and war on the Republic and Sith Empire.# Fall of the New Empire\nThe declaration by Malgus shocked both the Republic and Sith Empire who now scrambled to face this new opponent. When the New Empires forces invaded Illum, the Sith Empire and the Republic set aside their differences on Illum and worked together to defeat the New Empire. Now facing both of the galaxy's major powers, the New Empire found itself struggling for survival. During the Battle of Illum, Darth Severin, Malgus’s closest ally, was slain by allied forces at Fort Barrow, who subsequently captured his stealth fighter, marking the beginning of the end for the New Empire. Allied forces then used the stealth fighter to land troops aboard the Emperor's fortress, who then slowly crushed the New Empires forces and made their way to Malgus’s throne room. It was there in his throne room that Malgus realized his brief rebellion had come to an end. He activated the station's self-destruct sequence and then fought his attackers in a losing battle. When he was finally defeated and presumably killed, his New Empire fell along with him.\n\n# New Empire military\nDarth Malgus invited all people of the Sith Empire to join his New Empire in its goal to purify the galaxy and, differing drastically from the Sith Empire, the New Empire also accepted alien species into its ranks and forged powerful alliances with alien groups such as the Schism Collective. Its army was made up of rogue elements of the sith empire and many others, including Trandoshians, Mandalorians, and droids, making it a formidable force. \n\nThe New Empires Navy, while much smaller than its Republic and Sith Empire counterparts, was extremely powerful and made up of the Crystal fleet that the Sith Empire had been using to seize crystals on Illum.

Their attempts were futile and Jicoln was supposedly killed during battle. The remainder of Clan Cadera was made up of women and young children and they were welcomed back into the Mandalorian community. Jicoln’s revolt left the clan with a darkness that lingered overhead. His son, Torian Cadera, was called a slew of derogatory terms such as arue’tal, which meant traitor’s blood. When Torian heard the news of his father’s survival, he joined forces with the Grand Champion of the Great Hunt. They entered a galaxy-wide bounty hunting competition that was organized by the Mandalorian clans to locate and kill Jicoln.\n\n# Section Two\nTorian and the champion reached Taris, the last known whereabouts of Jicoln. They later confronted him and partook in the death game called Geroya be Haran. After the continued battle, they came out victorious, but before they could finish the job Jicoln recognized his son. Jicoln asked to talk to Torian before he was handed his fate. They talked for a brief moment and once the conversation was over Jicoln met his fate. Jicoln was turned over to a group of Mandalorian soldiers that would take him to Mandalore the Vindicated. Some time passed, and Torian chose to join the champion’s bounty hunter crew in search of new challenges. By the time the war against Zakuul took place, very few members of Clan Cadera remained.

This was due to the fact that they believed whenever a Jedi used the Force, it broke balance in the universe. This led to followers of the religion blaming next to everything on the Jedi, including the fall of the Old Republic.\n\nThis hatred led to followers of the religion celebrating the great Jedi Purge. Families who considered themselves followers of the religion were forced to put pairs of their children in a set of tests.

It was a loose alliance that was made after the fall of Darth Revan’s Empire. The Sith Triumvirate was a powerful force to be reckoned with even against the Jedi Order. One particular Jedi Council member: Master Atris rallied a force of Jedi to go to Katarr. However, Master Atris had leaked their location to be able to find out about the Sith Triumvirate.# Persons of Interest\nDarth Traya, the Lord of Betrayal, was the leader of the Sith Triumvirate. Her apprentices Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion were the joint leaders of the Sith Triumvirate. Darth Traya, originally named Kreia, was a Jedi Master before turning to the Dark Side. Kreia wanted to gain full knowledge of the Force, but her unconventional approaches caused the Jedi Council to exile her from the Jedi Order.\n\nDarth Nihilus, the Lord of Hunger, was the apprentice of Darth Traya. There is not a lot known about Darth Nihilus, but it is suspected he was once a Jedi in the Mandalorian Wars. During his time as Darth Traya’s apprentice, Darth Nihilus learnt how to drain the Force. Through his continuous training, he eventually became a shell of his former self. Darth Nihilus' only purpose was to destroy all life to satisfy his hunger.\n\nDarth Sion, the Lord of Pain, was also the apprentice of Darth Traya. Sion trained along with Nihilus together at Malachor V. Darth Sion’s body had been destroyed so many times that his own body was just fragments of his original self. His body was cracked and only held together by his sheer will-power and his Force. Traya and Sion eventually hated each other because of Sion’s lack of caring and understanding about Traya’s strength.\n\n# Fall of the Triumvirate\nMost of Revan’s and Malak’s forces had joined the Sith Triumvirate, and Darth Traya had multiple visions and echoes in the Force to corrupt Jedi to join the Dark Side. Nihilus and Sion got impatient and decided to conspire against their master because they believed together they could overwhelm her, and this would lead to her death. Nihilus and Sion used “Sever Force” to cut Darth Traya off from the Force and was exiled from the Sith Triumvirate. Meetra Surik formed the Lost Jedi but was confronted by surviving Jedi Council members who tried to cut Surik from the Force as well. Darth Traya stopped them and saved Surik.

Despite the honest work the Clan is named after, known members of Clan Fett have fought across the galaxy as soldiers, bounty hunters and even as the rulers of the Mandalorian people.# Mandalorian Wars 3976 - 3960 BBY\nThe earliest record of Clan Fett making an appearance in the galaxy was through its most notorious member, Cassus Fett. Cassus Fett would serve as Mand’alor the Ultimate’s second-in-command and Field Marshal amongst the Neo-Crusaders. Clan Fett would answer Mand’alor the Ultimate’s call and serve as some of his finest warriors during the Mandalorian Wars.\n\nDuring the Mandalorian Wars, Field Marshal Cassus Fett would order the genocide of the Cathar species during the conquest of their planet. As a result of this, Clan Fett would forever be solidified amongst Mandalorian society as a Clan of mercilessly efficient warriors.\n\n# Cold War and Galactic War 3653 - 3636 BBY\nDuring the Cold War and subsequent Galactic War, the Mandalorians would be enjoying an era of mercenary work. As the Republic and Sith Empire fought on multiple fronts the demand for military contractors only increased as the war raged on. The demand for Mandalorian warriors increased, especially within the Sith Empire. Clan Fett would spend much of its time on the frontlines of the Sith Empire’s campaign. Vorten Fett is a prime example of the trust placed in Mandalorians by the Sith. This Mandalorian Commander would be responsible for leading attacks against Republic forces and had access to Imperial Military and Mandalorian resources to do so. \n\nClan Fett would later be involved in the Galactic War against the Eternal Empire. During this period, Clan Chieftain Khomo Fett would turn Clan Fett into the most powerful Mandalorian Clan at that time. As a result of this, he was put forward as a candidate for the title of Mand’alor, though he would later refuse the honour and serve as one of Mand’alor the Avenger’s top military commanders.\n\n# Mandalorian Division 60 - 31 BBY\nAfter the Mandalorian Excision, Clan Fett would find itself divided. Many of its members would relocate to worlds such as Concord Dawn to continue their lives away from the internal politics of Mandalorian society. Centuries after the excision a farming family belonging to Clan Fett would be attacked on Concord Dawn by the Mandalorian organisation known as Death Watch. The only survivor of this attack would be a young boy by the name of Jango Fett, who would later go on to become a prominent figure in Mandalorian society. \n\nJango Fett would fight as a Mandalorian Supercommando under the command of Jaster Mereel, his adoptive father. Jango Fett would end up becoming a prominent figure in the True Mandalorians and rise to the rank of Mand’alor before the destruction of the True Mandalorians in 44 BBY at the hands of the Jedi Order.\n\nJango Fett would spend the rest of his life as a bounty hunter and become arguably the most efficient bounty hunter of his time. During his life as a bounty hunter Jango Fett would also be singled out as the genetic template for the Clone Army. Jango Fett would accept on the condition he could have one genetically unaltered clone for himself. This clone would become known as Boba Fett.\n\n# Fall of the Republic and the Rise of the Empire 31 BBY and beyond\nBoba Fett would be raised as a Mandalorian by his father but would place little importance on Mandalorian culture until later in his life. During his time as a bounty hunter, Boba would grow to become an even more legendary figure than his father. Though he would not consider himself to be traditionally Mandalorian, he did place value in honour and would still wear his beskar’gam, or Mandalorian armour with pride. It wouldn’t be until his rise to the position of Mand’alor after the death of Fenn Shysha that the Fett Clan would become part of the Mandalorian community once more. \n\nBoba Fett would lead the Mandalorians and Clan Fett against the Yuuzhan Vong and establish the Mandalorians as a united faction that would become a major player in galactic politics. This would facilitate the name Fett as one of galactic renown and bring the Mandalorians out of an era of near-extinction.\n\n# Structure\nClan Fett like most Mandalorian Clans would spend much of its existence as a name and less of an actual organisation. After the Mandalorian Excision most Mandalorian Clans would be divided or entirely dissolved, Clan Fett was one such divided Clan. \n\nDuring the Clan’s height in the Galactic War, Clan Fett would have a Chieftain but the rest of its ranks would be folded into Mand’alor the Avenger’s army. This was typical for a Clan to do when a Mand’alor was in power.\nDuring Jango Fett and later Boba Fett’s rise to power as Mand’alor, Clan Fett remained as a name and not an organisation. There were other members of the Fett Clan throughout these periods in time, but nobody other than Jango and Boba would actually use the name Fett.\n\n","meta":{"index":7,"author":"seko1111","name":"Clan Fett","release_year":2021}},"501st Legion":{"content":"# Overview\nThe 501st was a division within the Grand Army of the Republic and later the Galactic Empire that was built from the best of the best in all areas of combat, discipline, and loyalty. It was made up of over fourteen thousand troops, all of whom were experts in combat and were well disciplined. The leader of the 501st was the famous and loyal Captain Rex, who was replaced with Commander Appo after Order 66. The 501st was a prestigious division and only accepted the best. These include the well-known clones Jesse, Fives, Echo, Tup, Dogma, Hardcase, Kix, and the two leaders, Appo and Rex. Although there are many other troopers within the legion, these men contributed the most to the legion. Some even sacrificed their lives to save the entire Republic. Towards the end of the Clone Wars, Anakin Skywalker split the 501st into a new division that was commanded by Rex. Rex was promoted to Commander of the 332nd. The 501st had a lot of notable members that fought and died during the Clone Wars and by the time Order 66 was executed, the majority of their best troopers died. The only notable members that were a part of the Order were Rex, Appo, and Jesse. Unfortunately, Lieutenant Jesse died trying to kill Rex and Ahsoka and during Order 66, Rex removed his chip, as he would rather help his friend Ahsoka Tano escape than remain loyal to the Republic (soon to be the Galactic Empire].# Equipment, troops, and vehicles\nAll Terrain Tactical Enforcers (AT-TE): Six legs for walking, two armoured halves, and a power generator. It could climb sheer surfaces and be armed with a mass-driver cannon that could shoot down ships using a rocket. In addition shields for electromagnetic pulses and ion cannons. It could hold clones for transport purposes with a pilot seat at the front, a few guns at the front and back and could only be pierced by tanksmasher rockets.\n\nJet troopers: Equipped with jetpacks for aerial assaults, the 501st’s jet troopers had a unique armour design and had blue jetpacks which they used to attack the enemy more quickly and destroy their front line quicker. Jet troopers would unexpectedly attack the enemy from the air causing heavy casualties.\n\nArmour: Until the battle of Mon Cala, the 501sts had phase I clone trooper armour which consisted of a fin on their helmet. Later, the phase II armour they developed had a more round helmet and still had the same blue markings to represent their division.\n\nStormtrooper armour: Once they joined the Empire their armour was quite similar, it consisted of the same blue markings but in different areas. For example, they often had a blue line that looked like a scar on their helmet, and usually, one side of their armour had more blue, and almost their entire arms were blue. You could tell who the commander was because they wore a blue pauldron on their armour. However, some of the 501st didn’t have any blue markings and looked like normal stormtroopers.\n\nVenator-class star destroyer: The 501sts were genuinely carried by the Republic’s star destroyer and they stored their vehicles like Lateral Aerial Assault Transports (LAATs) there. The Venator-class was used for both transport and combat because of its powerful weapon system; it was a useful tool in space battles.\nLAAT: They couldn't use the Venator-class to land so they were transported onto the ground by LAATs which were piloted by clone troopers who specialised in starfighter combat and driving. Occasionally, the 501st’s LAATs had blue markings on them to represent the 501st and some were piloted by 501st soldiers.\n\nImperial star destroyers: The Imperial star destroyers were a bit more plain than Republic’s Venator class. The Imperials’ had a fully grey star destroyer which was as purposeful as the Venator-class. The Imperial star destroyer was more often used in battle, but they also carried plenty of Twin Ion Engines (TIE fighters) which were more useful in dogfights. \n\nAll Terrain Armoured Transport (AT-AT): During the battle of Hoth the 501sts mainly had to use terrain vehicles so they could be well protected from enemy fire. The most common vehicle used on Hoth was the AT-AT which could withstand all enemy fire and only had one weakness; the neck. The Rebellion found out about the weakness and used the speeders to tie a rope around the vehicle so it could collapse and they could blow it up by firing at the neck.\n\n# Order 66\nEveryone knows about this horrific event orchestrated by the deceiving Sith lord, Darth Sidious. Order 66 was a plan where the Separatist leader, Count Dooku, got his Jedi friend, Sifo-Dyas, to install inhibitor chips into the clone trooper’s minds, right before he became the leader of the Separatists so they could fight off rogue Jedi and Sith, however, Dooku also made it so they would believe that the Jedi were traitors to the Republic when they were told to execute Order 66. Before the execution of Order 66, Mace Windu and several other Jedi went to “arrest” Chancellor Palpatine (Darth Sidious) because he was the Sith Lord behind the war. Palpatine killed Mace’s companions and the two fought one on one until Palpatine was saved by Anakin. Anakin runs in to help the Sith Lord by chopping Mace’s hand off and Sidious uses Force lightning to send Mac flying out of the building. Anakin was then dubbed ‘Darth Vader’ and continued to lead the 501st into battle against the Jedi on Coruscant. The 501st suffered severe casualties on Coruscant, but they also managed to kill thousands of Jedi, which unfortunately included younglings. The 501st didn’t stop until all Jedi were dead. After Order 66 there were only a few Jedi survivors who were hunted by Inquisitors and Vader. Also following Order 66, the 501st was still a division under the command of Darth Vader, except with the discontinuation of clone production, they were replaced with regular human enlistees because they lacked the funding required to continue the production of clones.\n\n# The final battle and their forever-lasting legacy\nEndor: The final battle ever fought by the 501sts was on the forest moon planet, Endor. The Rebellion hosted an attack on the famous and powerful weapon, the Death Star. The Death Star could wipe out planets with a single blast of a super laser. The Rebels gathered all their forces to attack the Death Star and in doing so they needed to blow up the shield generator on Endor. The Empire sent the 501sts to Endor and there they fought against the Rebels who teamed up with the native EwoksThe Ewoks were a group of cute bear-like creatures who worshipped the forest and were semi-experienced in combat. The Rebels used the chatty protocol droid, C3PO, to communicate with the Ewoks for they believed he was a God. C3-PO convinced the Ewoks to help the Rebels fight the Empire and blow up their shield generator so the Millenium Falcon, piloted by Lando Calrissian, could blow up the Death Star’s core. The Ewoks accepted and gathered their forces to fight against the Empire. The Empire had more vehicles and weapons than the Rebels but the Rebels used this to their advantage. The Ewoks stole the Scout Trooper’s speeder bikes and used them to kill them. It was a sad day for the Empire because the Rebels made it to the shield generator and managed to blow it up. During the battle on Endor, Luke Skywalker was transported to the Death Star by Lord Vader so they could meet Darth Sidious. Luke fought Vader and bested him. Sidious (known as Emperor Palpatine then) told Luke to finish him so his journey to the Dark Side would be complete. Luke refused, claiming he was a Jedi like his father before him.  Palpatine used Force lightning to torture Luke. Vader, not willing to see his only son die, threw Palpatine into the Death Star’s core, and together, Luke and Vader attempted to escape. Unfortunately, Vader was going to die since Palpatine’s Force lightning had damaged his suit's internal respirator.\nKnowing this, Vader asked Luke to remove his mask so Luke could see his face. In tears, Luke brought the dead body of his father to the forest moon of Endor and burned his remains in honour. That same day, the 501st Legion disbanded after the death of Vader and all the troops on Endor. There simply couldn’t be a 501st Legion without Vader or the correct number of soldiers, so it simply fell apart. There wasn’t a single survivor, except Rex. Rex’s death is unknown but we know he helped Ezra and his crew and it is assumed that Captain Rex was one of the Rebel fighters on Endor, we have no proof of this though except that the Rebel Commander who was on Endor looks a lot like Rex.\n\n# Notable members and deaths\nCaptain Rex- Survived with the help of Ahsoka Tano who removed his control chip.\nCommander Appo- Appo died by saving Vader’s life on Kashyyyk. He was decapitated by Jedi Master Roan Shryne.\nARC Lieutenant Jesse- Jesse died in a Venator Cruiser during the time of Order 66. He and a few Coruscant Guards and fellow 501st members died trying to kill Commander Tano and Captain Rex.\nARC trooper Fives-Fives died in one of the most well-known deaths when his inhibitor chip “malfunctioned” and learned of the real Sith mastermind, Sheev Palpatine. He died a fugitive and was shot by Commander Fox.\nARC trooper/Corporal Echo- Corporal Echo supposedly died on Skako Minor when he sacrificed himself to let a team of notable clones and Jedi escape. However, we learned in the Bad Batch that he never really died and just became half droid. He was saved by a team led by Anakin which consisted of the Bad Batch. He later joined the Bad Batch.\nHardcase- Hardcase died when the 501st was sent to claim the planet Umbara. Jesse, Fives, and he stole a few Umbaran starfighters to destroy the Separatist Supply ship. He nobly saved the 501st by exiting his ship and convincing the other two to leave so he could blow up the supply ship using a cannon from his starfighter.\nDogma- Dogma’s death is unknown but he was arrested by a couple of 501st troopers for helping and later killing General Krell.\nKix- Kix was sent on a pod when he was imprisoned by Dooku but the ship that carried him was destroyed and he spent fifty years in the pod until he was found by a bunch of pirates and was recruited by them.\nTup- Tup’s inhibitor chip malfunctioned and he accidentally killed a Jedi. he was later sent to the Kaminoan facility center to recover but died in the process.\nVaughn- Captain Vaughn was one of the high-ranking Officers of the 332nd and was a part of the battle on Mandalore where Bo-Katan and Ahsoka fought against Maul and his Mandalorian followers. Vaughn had the privilege of helping Rex lead the 332nd into battle, unfortunately, Vaughn died during this by Maul.\n\n","meta":{"index":45,"author":"jinqxd","name":"501st Legion","release_year":2022}},"InterGalactic Banking Clan":{"content":"# Overview\nThe InterGalactic Banking Clan (often abbreviated to IGBC or IBC) was one of the most powerful and influential commerce guilds during the age of the Galactic Republic. It was a conglomerate of Muunilinst’s Council of Banking Clans, along with other important banking powers. The IBC’s influence spanned across the entire Galaxy, even extending to the nearest satellite galaxy. The Tonith family, one of the most powerful Muun families, oversaw the IBC. The Clan had heavy connections to the Order of the Sith Lords, as Darth Tenebrous manipulated the organization from the inside. Even though during the Clone Wars Chairman San Hill allied himself with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the IBC itself stayed neutral throughout most of its history. After a scandal related to the IBGC leader Rush Clovis, the organization was placed directly under the Office of the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, nationalizing the banks.# Organization\nThe IBC facilitated the movement of credits and financial data, alongside other currencies across the galaxy. The institution ventures used to connect this flow of currency were all controlled by the key representatives of the oldest and most prominent banking families. Iotran soldiers always accompanied IGBC staff, and although it had the reputation of being a consumer-friendly organization, it had a sizable army of droids and Iotran military personnel called the  “Collections and Security division”. Members of the IBC were mostly financiers, accountants and lawyers. The hierarchy of the Banking Clan included the most important ranks in the most valuable planets controlled by the Muuns, such as Mygeeto or Muunilinst. The Chairman of the Clan stood at the top of the hierarchy.\n\n# History\nThe IBC was founded around the time the Galactic Republic was created. The Banking Clan funded governmental institutions and had control over countless commerce guilds, trade corporations and shipping cartels. By 1000 BBY, the IGBC was very powerful, and was known to be a far better option for transactions, as they were more honest and less corrupt than Core World-based banks. At some point, Aargau was made one of its key worlds, resting in the boundaries between the Core Worlds. The IGBC was a very important piece of the Sith’s Grand Plan. Caar Damask owed his ascension to Chairman to the Bith Sith Lord Darth Tenebrous, and in exchange for the help he was given, Tenebrous received his son Hego Damask, who would rise to become the great Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Plagueis, as his Apprentice. Plagueis would make use of the IBC’s finances to aid the Grand Plan. During the Separatist Crisis, the IBC had a clearly pro-Separatist stance, sending propaganda messages inside of their own data server. The IGBC also aided the Separatist financially with weapons and Hailfire droids, although the Banking Clan denied all accusations of arming the Separatists. Chancellor Palpatine made a deal with the IBC, in which he would secretly open many tax-free accounts which provided funds to allies of the Clan, while the IGBC supported Palpatine in the Galactic Senate. During the Clone Wars, the IBC supplied the Confederacy of Independent Systems with a number of security forces, including battle droids. The IGBC later commissioned the manufacture of larger numbers of IG-series droids, including General Grievous’ elite IG-100 MagnaGuards. The Chairman of the IBC, San Hill, allied himself with the Confederacy of Independent Systems through a deal from which both ends would profit the most. During the Battle of Muunilinst, droids of the Banking Clan were assaulted, and Durge, the new commander of the IG droids, was defeated in battle. San Hill was captured, but was later given the chance to escape captivity. Senator Rush Clovis represented the interests of the IGBC in the Galactic Senate, Despite him being found to be allied with the Separatist army, the IGBC was never prosecuted, as it was far too important for the economic stability of the Republic. After the Battle of Muunilinst, the IGBC headquarters moved to Scipio. Rush Clovis was then chosen as the new head of the IBC. However, Count Dooku, who secretly endorsed his rise to power, blackmailed him to levy debts against the Republic, forcing him to be evicted along with Scipio’s droid army. After Clovis’ death, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine took control of the banks, making him gain more political power for his planned takeover of the galaxy. The IGBC also funded Grievous’ reconstruction through the same technology used to save the life of Darth Vader. During the Imperial Era, the IGBC survived as the creditor for the Empire’s currency. The Empire allowed the Muuns to keep living, but had near full control over their governments and economy. After the establishment of the New Republic, the IGBC became the creditor for both the Rebel Alliance and the Empire.\n\n","meta":{"index":42,"author":"SpawnKiller1326","name":"InterGalactic Banking Clan","release_year":0}},"Veiled Sorority":{"content":"# Overview\nThe Veiled Sorority is a small private pirate-organization governed by females located in the Outer Rim territories.

Reporting ONLY to the Emperor, they were only outranked by a portion of the Empire's ranks.# Section I\nEstablished sometime around 19 BBY, the Inquisitorius was composed of Inquisitors hunting Jedi who survived Order 66.

When these means failed, an Inquisitor would be called to take care of the Jedi themselves, be it a Force Mind trick or even more torture using force moves.

It Was one of the earliest breakaway sects of the Jedi Order but was eventually defeated during a violent war against the Jedi.# History of Xendor\nIn the early days of the Jedi Order, the Kashi Mer exile Xendor studied on the planet of Ossus which was the main fortress world of the Jedi Order with a culture primarily devoted to the study of the Force. Jedi Knight Xendor was a well-respected man within his order, however, he opposed the order’s views on the Force and deemed it as exclusionary. One of his most notable allies was a follower of the Steel Hand of Palawa named Arden Lyn. The two had shared many philosophies and views outside of the Jedi High Council’s reach, forming a close bond with each other and engaging in a relationship. The Jedi Knight was frustrated by the Jedi High Council’s ignorance, so he boldly approached them in hopes of opening a new academy far from Ossus to explore the darker aspects of the Force. To his disappointment, his ideas were rejected by the council and so he traveled to the planet of Lettow, opening a new academy focusing on the teachings of Bogan.\n\n# The war\nAround 24 500 BBY, a war had erupted between the Legion of Lettow and the Jedi Order. According to most Jedi historians, General Xendor alongside his legionaries were the ones to lead the attack on the Jedi while others believe that the Jedi declared a war against them due to their bond with the darkside. The most detailed version of these events were provided by Imperial Grand Inquisitor Laddinare Torbin, stating that it was the Jedi Order who raised an army first so Xendor took up the title of General and attacked Ossus to prevent massive amounts of slaughter. The war between the Jedi Order and the Legions had thrived in Chandrila, Metellos, Brentaal IV, and Coruscant. The war ended with Xenor’s tragic death which allowed Arden Lyn to take command of the legions and the academy.\n\n","meta":{"index":27,"author":"Edex08","name":"Legions of Lettow","release_year":2023}},"Darkseekers":{"content":"# Overview\nDarkseekers were a sect of the Sith Order.

Existence is fleeting. Destruction is eternal.” They believed that destruction was the will of the Force; they called this the Way of the Dark.\n\nThey saw destruction as a change to the universe's structure; destruction created a void, the absence of life. The void was the foundation of truth. They did not believe in the light or dark side, nor in the Force, they only believed in the Dark. The only thing relevant was the response of the Dark to those who were trained in the Way of the Dark, they saw it as the hidden energy of the cosmos.\n\nOne of the greatest powers of the Dark known by the Rhandites was Darksight; Darksight allowed them to foresee the future and manipulate certain events to achieve the desired outcome.

The Exchange dealt in Spice refinement and distribution, smuggling, extortion, weapons trafficking, slave trading, and bounty hunting. This organization was active on many worlds and would employ notorious bounty hunters, such as Calo Nord. \n\nDuring the First Jedi Purge of 3954 BBY, the Exchange would post lucrative bounties on live Jedi, some large enough to purchase an entire planet in some cases. Three hundred years later during the Cold War of 3653 BBY, the Exchange would engage in a galaxy-wide crime war with the Hutt Cartel, centering on Nar Shaddaa.# Organization\nThe Exchange was a powerful criminal organization whose main base of operations was along the Outer Rim Territories of the galaxy, most likely as a way to help keep the attention from the central government from the Core Worlds to a minimum and operate more discreetly. This organization was headed by an unknown and mysterious individual who others called the Compeer, along with a standard criminal command structure.\nThe only known way to get into the group was to be nominated by several other crime lords who belonged to this organization.\n\nThe Exchange organized and maintained various criminal cells on various worlds of interest, where each planetary cell was led by a boss who helped to maintain the Exchange's interests on the planet in question. The bosses would report to sector chiefs who operated under secret identities, usually living normal lives compared to the bosses, and had no cells of their own. \n\nThe bosses would communicate with the sector chiefs through discreet means such as secret and secured holo-comm channels and in turn, the sector chiefs reported to the head of the Exchange. Oftentimes they would use sham fronts and fake businesses to help with their operations, such as the Citadel Station’s Bumani Exchange Corporation.\n\n# History\nSometime during the First Jedi Purge, some well-known Exchange bosses during this period were Davik Kang, who operated on the planet Taris, and Loppak Slusk. who operated on the planet Telos IV, and Goto, who operated on the Hutt world of Nar Shaddaa. During the Jedi Civil War of 3959 BBY, the Exchange would be briefly yet significantly involved with, and damaged by, both Revan and Meetra Surik, also known as the Exile.\n\nIn the year 3956 BBY, Revan was able to infiltrate the Exchange's headquarters on the world of Taris and kill the operating boss there, Davik Kang. Five years after Davik’s demise, Meetra Surik would arrive on Nar Shaddaa, the largest moon of the Hutt homeworld of Nal Hutta. There Surik would eliminate the crime lords Saquesh and Visquis and destroy the Visionary, thus destabilizing the Exchange's base of operations on Nar Shaddaa.\n\nEventually, the leading crime boss of Nar Shaddaa, who went by Goto, would reveal themselves. Usually, the boss would hide their identity by using a hologram, however, Goto decided to reveal their true identity and much to the surprise of many Goto wasn’t an organic being but instead a droid designation was G0-T0.\n\nG0-T0 involved itself with the Exchange as a way to fulfill its programming. Its task was to help stabilize the Galactic Republic through any means necessary. Its smuggling rings caused the deaths of people and organizations G0-T0 considered “destabilizers”, helped to bring unofficial profits to entire sectors, and helped to strengthen and solidify Republic worlds that would’ve otherwise been ignored and left poor. \nBelieving the biggest problems with the Republic revolved around the Jedi and Sith conflict, along with the Jedi Civil War, G0-T0 would place hits or bounties on both Jedi and Sith. The reason being that the fewer Jedi or Sith there are in the galaxy, the less fighting there would be overall in the galaxy. G0-T0 was simply following its programming and wanted to keep the Republic stable and its infrastructure together since the Jedi Civil War caused much devastation across Republic Space.\n\nThe droid would eventually accompany the Exile in hopes of stabilizing the galaxy. G0-T0 would, unfortunately, meet its end on Malachor V when the Mass Shadow Generator was reactivated and destroyed the entire planet.\n\nDuring the Cold War Era and by 3653 BBY, the Exchange would continue its existence and operations in the following years. In this era, one of the Exchange's crime lords would sponsor one Jewl’a Nightbringer into the Great Hunt, as by this point the Exchange had become a major rival of the Hutt Cartel.\n\nThe crime boss of Nar Shaddaa during this time was Ukabi. An Imperial diplomat named Maro Vizhen tried to recruit Ukabi into the Shadow Syndicate, a criminal group made up of several crime lords who allied themselves with the Sith Empire. Ukabi would refuse the offer and a major crime war broke out between the Exchange and the Shadow Syndicate, which resulted in Ukabi’s death.\n\nAfter the incident on Nar Shaddaa, the Sith Empire would outlaw the Exchange and actively hunt down its members within Sith space and sometimes even outside of it.\n\n","meta":{"index":21,"author":"BoarGrills","name":"Exchange","release_year":2023}},"First Legion":{"content":"# Overview\nThe men and women who comprised the First Legion, Darth Vader’s personal stormtrooper legion, were renowned in the Stormtrooper Corps. Important figures such as Grand Admiral Thrawn admitted this. The legion was mostly made up of recruits from the 501st, which as we know, served as Anakin Skywalker’s clone battalion in the Clone Wars. As such, they had high standards placed upon them by Lord Vader, and officers who failed to meet them could expect one of two fates; demotion and transfer to the 501st or summary execution.# Mission to Batuu\nSometime before the Galactic Civil War, a contingent of the First Legion under Commander Kimmund accompanied Lord Vader and Grand Admiral Thrawn aboard the latter’s flagship, the ISD Chimaera to investigate a disturbance in the Force felt by the Emperor himself. The Chimaera also housed the Dark Lord’s personal Lambda-class-T4a-shuttle and the legion’s transport ship the Darkhawk-a repurposed Clone Wars Separatist ship. Once the Chimaera had reached its destination, Lord Vader and Thrawn boarded a shuttle to the planet. While they were gone, a fleet of Grysk freighters appeared.  Following the sudden arrival of the aliens, the First Legion utilized the Darkhawk to attempt a boarding of one of the freighters. The stormtroopers were successful in their attempt to board the ship but failed to recover anything useful, as Grysk warriors detonated explosives in the cargo hold.\n\n# Defense of the Darkhawk\nDuring the battle on the Grysk freighter, the First Legion captured several prisoners, which were transported to the Chimaera upon Grand Admiral Thrawn’s orders. These prisoners were housed in the personal quarters of the TIE pilots, which happened to be near the hangar the Darkhawk resided in. This left Commander Kimmud uncomfortable, so he, a sergeant named Aksind, and a pilot named Tephan stayed aboard the transport vessel, not wanting it to be unguarded. The prisoners attempted an escape and tried to use the Darkhawk as a means of escape, not knowing the soldiers were in it. A skirmish followed, resulting in Askind’s death.  Unbeknownst to the three men aboard, Lord Vader and Thrawn wanted the prisoners to escape, for they had planted tracking beacons on all of the ships. If not for the intervention of Grand Admiral Thrawn, Kimmund would have likely been executed. However, Thrawn had deduced that because the Grysk attempted to use the only Separatist ship on the Chimaera, the alien’s base was located in an old droid factory on the planet of Mokivj.\n\n# Battle of Mokivj\nThe First Legion, along with Lord Vader himself at the helm, infiltrated the separatist factory.  Using a ruse by the Sith Lord, three soldiers-Commander Kimmund, Sergeant Viq, and Trooper Elebe- searched for the prisoners.  When they found them, they were shocked to see that they were force-sensitive Chiss girls. After securing the children, the three made their way to a courtyard, clearing it, and extracting via the Darkhawk. After returning to the Chimaera, Vader informed the Commander that some of the Chiss prisoners remained in Grysk company, while a few escaped. However, Grand Admiral Thrawn simply requested that Lord Vader track them through the force, which he did.\n\n# Rescue Operation\nAfter tracking the Grysk down, the First Legion decided once more to board. Having support from Lord Vader in a TIE Defender who shut down the Grysk’s engines. The legion proceeded with boarding, along with Grand Admiral Thrawn’s bodyguard, Rukh. Using Rukh’s tracking skills, the soldiers successfully located and secured the Chiss prisoners, suffering minimum losses, although a trooper by the name of Jid had to be left behind.\n\n# The Battle of Hoth\nThe last recorded combat duties of the First Legion were during the Battle of Hoth. Sometime after the first Death Star’s destruction, the Empire used Project Swarm to locate a secret rebel base on the icy planet of Hoth. The First Legion’s job was to support the 501st’s elite Blizzard Force, who were commanded by General Maximillian Veers.

Eventually, tensions between the CIS and the Republic resulted in an armed conflict known as the Clone Wars. The first battle took place on the planet Geonosis, where the CIS droid army clashed with the newly formed Grand Army of the Republic, during the battle the droid army was defeated, and the Separatists were forced to retreat. During the War, the scales tipped first to one side, then to the other, until Darth Sidious decided that the CIS had done its job, and he didn’t need anymore, he sent his new student, Darth Vader, to Mustafar, who destroyed the entire Separatist Council, putting an end to the puppet government.# Section 1\nIn the years leading up to the Clone Wars, the Galactic Republic saw numerous governments, each plagued by the corruption and bureaucracy of the Galactic Senate. After the crisis on Naboo, the trade guilds were outraged by the tax on trade with outlying worlds. In this critical situation, Count Dooku appeared as a former Jedi Master who left the Order to fight the corruption that reigned in the Republic, and with the most radical methods. He was able to win over many worlds that were dissatisfied with the Republic. He became the head of a movement called the Confederation of Independent Systems. Although the Republic understood that many worlds had joined in this rebellion, the Senate refused to acknowledge the existence of the CIS, as well as their governments.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Confederation began preparing its armed forces for an invasion of Republic space to crush the hated state and capture its capital, Coruscant. After the events on Naboo, the Republic ordered the Trade Federation to destroy its army of droids, which, of course, agreed, but did not destroy all of them, some of the droids were safely hidden, and the droid production factories were moved to distant planets such as Hypori. The Techno Union also provided its droids for the CIS, so while Dooku, with his oratorical abilities, won over more and more planets to the side of the CIS, in the depths of the secret Separatist bases, millions of battle droids were created, which were just waiting for the moment to join the battle. However, the element of surprise was lost when Obi-Wan Kenobi, pursuing Jango Fett, flew to Geonosis and revealed the plans of the Separatists, transmitting these plans to the Jedi Council, but after transmitting the information he was captured by the Geonosians. Anakin and Padme followed him but were also captured at the droid factories. Dooku sentenced Kenobi, Padmé, and Anakin to death in the Arena of Geonosis. During the execution, a detachment of Jedi, led by Mace Windu, landed on the planet and rushed to help their friends. An unequal battle ensued in the Arena, during which the Jedi suffered heavy losses and were surrounded by droids. They could have died, but Yoda, who arrived in time at the head of an army of clones, saved them, and then the famous battle on Geonosis began. The Republic troops were able to defeat and drive the CIS off the planet, but they only won the battle; the War was still ahead.\n\n","meta":{"index":97,"author":"Minato_Yt108","name":"Confederacy of Independent Systems","release_year":2024}},"Task Force 99":{"content":"# Overview\nTask Force 99, otherwise known as SCAR Squadron, was an elite squadron of stormtroopers in the Galactic Empire’s 501st Legion, the legion under the control of Darth Vader, and was commanded by Sergeant Kreel.
