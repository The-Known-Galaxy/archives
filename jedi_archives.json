{"name":"jedi","categories":{"TJO - Community":{"articles":{"Clash for the Galaxy":{"content":"# Introduction\nDesaust landed his stolen Liberator-class starfighter in the base-level hangar of Coruscant’s Jedi Temple under the guise of a Jedi Knight. It would not be the first time he had passed as a “cultist” to infiltrate a facility, nor the last. One thing he had learned from fighting both the Sith Empire and the Republic was that arrogance has and will continue to lie unseen, instilled deeply within the two. He planned to exploit this – to walk into the heart of the Jedi Order and take what he wanted. There was no better day than the present to accomplish this. There wouldn’t be a Jedi Temple or anything of value within its halls by day’s end. \nBefore exiting the fighter, Desaust armed the proton bomb aboard the vessel. It would serve as a diversion, rendering the hangar and the docked fighters inoperable. In a way, he was assisting the Empire.\n Climbing from the cockpit, he drew his cloak overhead and walked out from the hangar. The schematics of the Temple ran through his mind as he traversed the grand halls, turning down corridors as if he’d done so hundreds of times before. He trod the halls quietly with his arms concealed in the sleeves of his cloak; to an observer, the action wasn’t unusual. Unbeknownst to them, Desaust's fingers subtly tapped at the controls embedded in his Beskar vambrace. First, he worked to conceal his presence in the Force. A Jedi or Sith with practice and a strong connection with the Force could do this effortlessly, but Desaust was neither. He wasn’t gifted like his brother - ‘blessed’ as his adoptive parents ingrained in him. Much like the rest of his equipment, his latest addition to his armor mimicked a Force ability. \nThe hide of the Dxun Maalraas allowed the animal to conceal its presence in the Force, rendering it a mere shadow to the untrained eye and nearly impossible to sense.  Due to Desaust’s lack of Force sensitivity, he had spent months attempting to get the hide to replicate its natural capabilities. Following several failures, he discovered that Kyber would suffice as a Force-attuned stand-in. In trial runs, the process was an identical replication of the Maalraas. It was like a ghost headed for the Temple’s sublevels under the cloak.# Section 1\nAkeither grew tired of the nonsense his peers were spewing. \nThe High Council had been in session for several hours, arguing over the threat of the Sith Empire. Most Councilors believed the Empire had weakened substantially since the Emperor died — fractured even. But Akeither was one of three who refused to acknowledge the theory. His gaze shifted toward Councilor Drexel, who fiercely pushed the notion. She was a Senior Councilor who hadn’t seen the front lines in years; all her information had ridden in on reports; she treated them as fact. Unfortunately, the majority agreed. It bothered him that his peers could so easily believe that the Republic had the upper hand. If anything, the Sith were more organized under the new Empress, turning the tide of war in her favor.\n“Even the Chancellor believes the Sith threat will diminish by the end of the year.” Drexel smiled. “We’ve already pushed the Sith out of three major worlds.”\n“Reclaiming those worlds was too easy.” Councilor Sudo shook his head, “It was as if they wanted us to have them.” \nCouncilor Greene shrugged. “Perhaps they are becoming disorganized. We all know how the Sith love to undermine one another. A power shift is a perfect time to fulfill an agenda.” \nAkeither leaned forward in his seat, rubbing his temples in irritation. “There’s something we’re missing.” \n“Which is?” Councilor Gest inclined his head, gesturing for the newest Councilor to continue. Though, new wasn’t quite the word. Akeither had been on the Council for three years but was the only recent appointment. Gest wasn’t fond of nor trusted the man, but his efforts in the war made him favorable amongst the others. \nDrawing a breath, Akeither sat up and spread his hands. “The Empire is more unified than we realize. They have an active leader now who participates in their  conquest.” It wasn’t something he could say about most of the people in the room. \nDrexel waved her hand dismissively. “We know nothing of this Empress. For all we know, no one is leading them.” \nMurmurs of agreement filled the room.\nGreene scowled at his fellow Councilors. He had never known them to be so content with the possibility that victory drew near in his thirty years as a Councilor. It didn’t make sense for that outcome to happen if you were involved. \n“I believe we’re overlooking something as well.” Councilor Idris said when the room quieted. \nGest scoffed. “You as well?” \nIdris ignored him. “Our enemy, when we haven’t been reclaiming our worlds, has been attacking military installations that are off record. Only select individuals know about them or had when we ran the Taskforce program.” \n“Information is bought often, Idris. We have an abundance of traitors,” Drexel said. “Same as the Imperials.” \nIdris conceded but held her hand up, “This is different. They’re picking apart our tactics more efficiently. Doesn’t this tell you something?” \n“They have a strategist on their side,” Akeither added, folding his arms. “A former member of the Order or . . . another rogue Republic leader.”\n Gest inclined his head. “Do you have any proof? The reports weave a different story.”\n“I serve on the frontlines, not lounge in the confines of the Temple. You have no idea what you’ll condemn the Republic to if we refuse to act.” Akeither retorted. \n\nFor the first time since the meeting began, Grandmaster Luen spoke. \n“That’s enough.” He snapped, “Chancellor Bhest and I have spoken extensively about the war recently. We’ve come to share the same thoughts most of you have.” He said softly. “The Republic will concentrate its efforts on forcing the Sith to surrender, peacefully if possible.” \nCouncilor Sudo’s mouth hung open in disbelief. “You can’t possibly—” \n“I do, and I believe this meeting is over. We’ll reconvene tomorrow to discuss demilitarizing the Order,” Luen stated with an air of finality behind his words. \n\nEach Councilor respectfully nodded and rose from their seats. There would be no further debates on the matter. Akeither knew it to be a mistake. One that would cost the Republic everything if it didn’t wake up from its ignorance. He took the turbolift down to the first level of the Temple. Something began to bother him, a tugging feeling in the back of his mind. He frowned. Something was wrong.\n\n# Section 2\nDesaust approached the Temple Guardsmen posted outside the vault. He knew he would never get in without a fight and was glad for it. After years of cutting down lightsaber-wielding freaks, he’d face something new. \n\tThe Senior Guardsman held his hand out as the ‘Jedi’ stepped closer, “HALT!” He ordered. Only Councilors had authorization to be in this sector of the sublevels. They were wise enough not to conceal their identities. But, he and the rest of the Guard would’ve sensed someone long before they arrived. He hesitated; he couldn’t feel this ‘Jedi’ in the Force. He called his double-bladed lightsaber to his hand. The yellow blades illuminated the hallway as the Senior Guardsmen thrust the point of his saber forward into the trespasser. \n\tA grin formed across Desaust’s lips as he swayed casually out of reach, seizing the blade with his cortosis-gloved left hand. The lightsaber erupted in sparks and shorted out. Desaust’s right hand grasped his own lightsaber, plunging it into the Guard’s chest. The hilt fell from the Guard’s grasp as he collapsed.\n\tThe remaining Guardsmen leaped forward and swung at the trespasser with a flurry of attacks. Bringing his arm up, Desaust let the third swing connect, the blade riding off his armor as he spun his hilt into a reverse grip, cleaving the Guard in two before they could react.\n\nBending down, he relieved the corpse of its belt, cycling through the keys to find the vault’s match. In hindsight, the Jedi should have thought of this situation. Killing just one of their Guards gave an intruder free rein over the Temple. Maybe he would share that information so more people would stand against the Jedi.\nOnce he had found the correct key, the door began to open inwardly. He craned his head. Peering inside before the door entirely cleared, he raised his eyebrows in surprise. There was more hidden away than Desaust realized. \nThe room was at least twenty meters deep with a vaulted ceiling. Various artifacts from across the galaxy littered the walls. If Desaust had more time, he’d take more. Learn from what he could to better equip himself for the future. He glanced up at a security camera as he scanned the walls. By now, more Guards would be on their way. He continued his search — looking for the weapon that would level the playing field he was but a pawn on. Then, he saw it. \n\tToward the back of the vault, a modified rifle rested on an otherwise barren table. Desaust took it, inspecting the weapon closely. It appeared to be in working condition, free of any apparent damage or sabotage. It did appear unfinished, with plenty of room for modification. He withdrew one of four sabers he carried with him, sliding it into the gap behind the barrel, clicking as it locked into place. Feeling he’d worn out his welcome, he departed from the vault. \n\tTemple Security intercepted Desaust when he was halfway out of the sublevel. They were secret police entrusted with monitoring the Temple Precinct. Although disappointed that Jedi hadn’t come to stop him, it was better that way. He didn’t have enough munitions to deal with them. \nThe Sergeant before him regarded Desaust as nothing more than an overzealous bounty hunter who’d bit off more than he could chew — who got lucky with the Guards. There was no need, in his mind, to bother with getting a Jedi to come down here to help with an arrest. Besides, the intruder was outnumbered five to one. Any sane man would surrender. \n“Surrender; we have you outnumbered,” the Sergeant warned, his men raising their weapons.\nSqueezing the trigger, Desaust smirked malevolently; “You’ve miscounted.”\n\n# Section 3\nThe ground trembled beneath Akeither’s boots, stopping him dead in his tracks. Fear’s icy grip clamped over his heart. The first floor became deafeningly silent as the Jedi around him felt what he felt. Whatever happened had killed several people. \n\tHe began to walk toward a stairwell that would take him to the next level but hesitated. His mind was screaming at him to “GET OUT OF THE WAY!” — couldn’t the Force be more directional? Akeither thought. He threw himself to the side as the floor disintegrated beneath him. The Jedi who were immediately around him weren’t so fortunate. He crawled back from the gaping hole in the ground, momentarily panicked - questions racing through his mind as he stood. \n\tHis questions didn’t go unanswered for long. The all-too-familiar whine of a jetpack angered him. Emerging from the rubble with a rifle, he was face-to-face with his brother, Desaust. \n\tWithout a word, Desaust made a fist and rapidly hovered away from Akeither, sending a mini-rocket from his gauntlet as a non-traditional greeting. With an outstretched hand, the rocket froze midair and plummeted into the ruins below, where it exploded. The distraction gave Desaust enough time to blast another hole in the Temple and the distance not to be swung at. He exited hurriedly, catching the faint hiss of a lightsaber igniting behind him. \n\tAkeither was determined not to let Desaust get away again. In their prior encounters, fate intervened. Or he had to honor a truce; he wasn’t going to let the twisted will of the Force refuse him again. Desaust would stand trial and answer for his crimes. \n\tThe terrace was an expansive stretch of concrete that surrounded the perimeter of the Temple. Desaust had to cross the sea of stone to reach his rendezvous point. His ship would meet him relatively undetected, being his fastest ticket off Coruscant and the Republic’s radar. He pressed down on his earpiece as he ran and instructed his daughter to bring the Rogue Tide to his location. Fast. Now, all he had to do was buy time.\nDesaust leveled the rifle at his brother, finger looming over the trigger. If Akeither were smart, he would back off and live to pursue him tomorrow. No. He knew Akeither’s sense of duty would go beyond family. Desaust had caused enough damage and hurt too many in his actions. It was him or his brother. At this range, Akeither would have enough time to evade the blast. Desaust fired, bracing for the powerful recoil of the rifle. \nThe beam tore across the terrace toward Akeither, raising his lightsaber to meet it. Akeither believed the weapon was essentially a glorified lightsaber. Therefore, redirection into the sky wouldn’t be so impossible. If his logic held up, that is. He braced for the impact, praying to the Force this would work. If it didn’t, he’d end up like the others. Dead.\nAngling the blade at the last moment, the beam connected, jutting out into the sky - subsequently getting thrown backward from the sheer force of the weapon.\n\nAkeither let out a pained groan but was pleased that he was still alive. At least his plan worked. He pushed himself to his feet, ignoring the protesting of his aching wrists and arms as he regained his grip on his lightsaber. He and Desaust held each other's gaze for a few moments. Then Akeither ran toward him. \nDesaust ejected the spent lightsaber from the weapon, loading the next from his belt in a fluid motion. Akeither had seconds before he fired again. He extended his hand and concentrated on the rifle. He knew he wouldn’t be able to rip the weapon away. Desaust had come prepared against Force users, finding that magnetism prevented his weapons or himself from being hurtled. However, it didn’t hinder his movement entirely. The rifle jerked upward, but years of experience kept Desaust from firing prematurely. Unable and unwilling to fire at close range, Akeither seized the opening and fought for control over the weapon.\n\n# Section 4\nDarth Eir, Empress of the Sith Empire and former Jedi Commander observed her forces as they filed onto transports aboard her Harrower-class destroyer, Valkyrie.\n\tIt had been well over fifteen years since she had last set foot on Coruscant, carrying out complex missions for the Republic and its citizens. Now, she planned to lay waste to the heart of the Republic to show the galaxy the consequences of arrogance. For centuries, the Republic boasted that its capital was impenetrable. An attack was out of the question. During her time as a Jedi, she knew Coruscant wasn’t as protected as it seemed — how stories alone kept the Sith from burning the city down. \n\tShe leaned forward and rested her hands on the rail of the viewing area above the hangar, running the battle plan over in her mind once more to rule out any weaknesses in the siege as the first wave of transports waited for the Valkyrie to exit hyperspace. Eir, with her knowledge of the interior of the Jedi Temple, would lead her forces inside and provide a distraction for her Dark Council to bombard high-value targets scattered throughout the city. They would arrive later in the battle, letting the Republic believe that her ship and Gage-class escorts would be naive enough to challenge the planetary defenses alone. They would soon find themselves outflanked by the rest of her fleet.\n\n\tBelow, the first wave of transports was ready for deployment, awaiting Hyperspace travel to end. She stepped away from the rail and headed down to board her shuttle in the middle of the hangar. \nThe Dark Honor Guards inside snapped to attention as the bay door slid shut behind their Empress. In recent history, the Imperial Guard was regarded as nothing more than living decor by the Empire’s enemies, forced to remain on Droumund Kaas as the previous Dark Lord of the Sith grew inactive in the war effort. The opportunity for the six crimson guardsmen to remind the galaxy of their dominance on the battlefield was before them - each eager to carry out the will of their Empress or die in the process. \n\n\tThe Valkyrie lurched as it came to a halt above Coruscant’s city. Moments later, it began its bombardment as Interceptors and transports flooded out from its hangars - the Gage-class transports following suit with their Interceptor squadrons following close behind Darth Eir’s forces. \n\nThe Imperial forces had expected Coruscant’s Temple to be untouched, a perfect canvas for destruction. The Temple was already up in smoke on the eastern side. Darth Eir noted that the damage went through two mediation rooms near the front of the Temple - whatever had happened would have killed anyone using them. However, it made for a secondary entry point to the inside. \n\t“Set us down by the smoke.” She told the pilot, beginning to turn away from the cockpit when a beam of energy cut through the air and slammed into the shields of the Banshee — one of her Gage-class escorts. Darth Eir narrowed her eyes as she scanned the area the blast came from.\n\n# Section 5\nAkeither and Desaust stared up at the Imperial crafts that littered Coruscant's skies, forgetting their struggle for the Lightsaber Rifle for a few seconds. Then, they locked eyes. Desaust triggered the flamethrower built into his gauntlet — forcing his brother to release the rifle to protect himself. From previous encounters, he knew Akeither had learned pyrokinesis, a perfect counter-ability for dealing with fire or Mandalorians. The flames never reached Akeither’s skin as he lept backward, half glancing up at the Imperial transports that began landing in front of the Temple. His day was getting worse by the second. \n\tExploiting his brother’s setback, Desaust took to the air with his jetpack. He had gotten what he came for and had no plans to stick around to greet his old employers. Or the Empress. Frankly, he had fully intended to leave before the siege began but didn’t anticipate this setback. Finally, the Rogue Tide emerged and pulled alongside the edge of the terrace. Desaust made his ascent toward the lowering ramp. \n\tAkeither resisted the urge to pull the ship into a forced landing and would have done so if the situation hadn’t become so dire. The Temple was his priority now. His brother looked down at him as the ship began to depart. If Akeither survived the siege, it was only a matter of time before their paths crossed again. And if this occupation endured for as long as Desaust expected, he had quite the head start. \nThe landing ramp rose; Desaust noticed an Imperial shuttle land near his improvised exit. As it opened, he counted a full detail of Dark Honor Guards marching out, half-armed with lightsaber pikes and blaster rifles. Very few people in the Sith Empire had their protection. The Imperial flag-ship belonged to Darth Eir, Sith Empress. She had almost killed Desaust before, inflicting permanent damage throughout his body. Now, she had the chance to kill his brother. A brief pang of guilt came over Desaust. Even if he wanted to, he couldn’t go back. \nThe moment the landing ramp sealed, the Rogue Tide entered Hyperspace.\n\n# Section 6\nThe Senate District began to crumble and burn as turbolasers relentlessly bombarded the infrastructure from above, reducing the capital to rubble within the first few minutes of the siege. Overhead, Sith Interceptors hunted down Republic fighters. Panicked and disorganized, Republic forces didn’t stand a chance. \nThe Imperial shuttle departed behind Darth Eir. She directed her Honor Guard to join the fighting inside the Temple and began walking further into the terrace. She had a nuisance to take care of. \nAkeither felt cold, like a cloud overhead blocked the light and warmth of the sun. He could sense only hatred and corruption from the Sith approaching behind him. Yet it was familiar. Spinning around, he expected to see a Sith he had bested before - someone who managed to escape the Republic’s cells or his blade. Seeing her caught him off guard, and for a moment, he believed his old friend to be a ghost. \nShe had become something far worse. \n\"I watched you die . . . Maravia, what did they do to you?\" His voice trembled, her 'death' playing out in his mind. \nThey were so close to escaping an Imperial listening post with vital intelligence. A sniper had her in their crosshairs and got off a shot before Mara reached their ship. The bolt slammed into her back, and she tumbled off the cliff’s edge and fell. It was a cheap way for Taskforce’s best Commander and saber master to die. \n\"What did they do to you?\" She mockingly replied, igniting her lightsaber. \"They bowed . . . with a little motivation.\" He stared at her, struggling to envision the kind and compassionate friend he knew becoming the person in front of him. She had always disagreed with the Code and how the Jedi conducted themselves, but he never considered this outcome, nor was there ever a reason for her loyalty to the Republic to be in question. \n\nKnowing how Mara used to be, words would not save him or sway her convictions. Fighting was an inescapable reality for Akeither, and there would be no point in delaying it further. Wordlessly raising their blades, they circled each other in tense silence. \nDarth Eir broke the tension. She dashed forward and arced her blade upwards, following up with a thrust with blinding speed. Either blow would have killed anyone unprepared, but Akeither dropped his blade downward, blocking the first swing, and swayed out of the way of the next — parrying a backhanded slash as he paced out of reach. She swung a controlled series of strikes at him, backhand, forehand, and overhand, never overextending herself or leaving herself open to a riposte. Akeither stayed light on his feet, trusting the Force to anticipate each stroke. He couldn’t trust his eyes alone. He had learned that the hard way in their training sessions long ago. \nAkeither whipped his saber around his body, blocking and countering Eir’s flurry of attacks. He lunged, aiming for her hand to perform Shiim, a technique to disarm and wound. Rotating her wrist, she caught his blade, flicking it to the side, stepping in to close the distance.\nShe waited for him to block, then feinted her next attack. Akeither brought his blade across his body to deflect, but the swing never came. Electricity coursed through Eir’s fingertips as she brought her hand parallel to the opening in Akeither’s defense, extending her arm forward as he instinctively stepped back to cover himself. He was too slow to fix the mistake -  managing to bring his blade back only halfway before the red lightning connected with his body.  \nThe pain was excruciating, and his body spasmed defiantly against his wishes. Akeither stumbled back, his free hand shooting to his face as he swung wildly. He had managed to block most of the blast between the saber and his armor, but it wasn’t enough. He suffered severe burns across his face, neck, and hands. Eir took advantage of his weakened state, grazing his saber arm. A dark line of burnt flesh and fabric sprang across his arm. Akeither Force pushed her away in retaliation to survey the wound, grimacing at the sight. \nKolto could mend the shallow cut, but it would affect his ability to fight. She knew Akeither couldn’t keep going, and as she got her feet under her, she could see she had already won. Though, she never doubted that she wouldn’t. \nHe was out of options, and help wasn’t coming. Akeither looked back on the ledge behind him in contemplation. He refused to surrender and let his former friend kill him. And he severely doubted their past friendship would warrant mercy. If he wanted to end the war, he would have to survive. He redirected his gaze to Maravia; there wasn’t a remnant of kindness in her eyes. Only hate that burned back into his own. \nDarth Eir understood his plan as he backed to the ledge. She lowered her blade with the point hovering above the concrete, a red glow partially illuminating it. \n“Go ahead. Jump,” She said icily. “I’ll simply hunt you down.” \nAkeither winced as he shrugged, “Don’t keep me waiting then, Maravia.” \n\nHe stepped backward off the ledge, dropping into Coruscant’s lower levels.\n\n She remained still for several moments before stowing her hilt and surveyed the fleet’s damage in relative silence, watching buildings crumble under their weight. Then, she left the ledge and returned to the Temple — victorious. \nHer forces had wiped out the Jedi foolish enough not to surrender. Those that did were rounded up and kept under the watchful eye of her Guard, who awaited her decision on what to do with them. She figured some would be willing to turncoat if it meant they kept their lives. But the others, such as the Councilors, would be made into examples. They were the reason for the Order dulling in its ability to bring stability and prevent corruption. Responsible for perpetuating the cycle of gross arrogance of the Republic and its leaders. It was time for them to face the consequences of their indifference and opinionated views. Eir recognized the Councilors that survived the slaughter, pacing before them, taking hold of her hilt. \nThe hiss of the weapon made Grandmaster Luen flinch. I should have listened, he thought. His eyes were glued to the floor until he heard the saber pass through the air and cut through Councilor Idris at the end of the line. Her body began to slump forward — then was thrown back as the Empress’s boot struck her square in the chest, falling into the chasm created by the infiltrator. She went down the line, slaying each of his friends similarly. He couldn’t bear to watch.\nWhen she approached him, he lifted his head to acknowledge his undoing. Luen knit his eyebrows in perplexion. He knew this woman and oversaw the operations she and her team conducted many years ago. As a Knight, Akeither had reported her killed-in-action. But as she loomed over him, she was very much alive. He wondered if Akeither had always known the truth and simply withheld the information. Perhaps he was to blame for the Order’s fall; why else wouldn’t Akeither be here? Unless he was already dead. He pushed the thought aside. There was nothing he could do about it. He could only die now and join the others in the Force.\n \"Get on with it, you’ve won,\" Luen muttered, scowling at the Sith Empress. \"Eager to die, aren't we? Very well.\"\n\nLuen felt the static in the air as her hand rose, fingertips pointed toward his head. His eyes widened. A flash of red was the last thing he saw as the current of Eir's lightning blinded him and tore through his body, setting his robes and flesh aflame. His scream cut off when she intensified her electrical judgment, reducing the Grandmaster to a mere ash pile at her feet. The remaining Jedi recoiled, some screamed out, and the younger members of the Order began wailing or shaking. Eir’s forces shifted uncomfortably at the sight; they’d only seen her display this power once before on a pompous Lord.\nShe stepped away from the pile and pointed toward it, addressing the entire room as she spoke, “Any of you who wish to remain with the Jedi Order, I’ll be happy to reunite you with your Grandmaster. Choose your allegiance wisely.” Several Knights immediately protested and were shot by nearby Sith Troopers. Others found her mercy appealing and began swearing themselves to the Empire.\n\n","meta":{"index":5,"author":"Akeither","name":"Clash for the Galaxy","release_year":2021}},"Shadows of Retribution":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe architecture's ancient design and the ambient lighting cast upon it create a sense of serenity in these halls. Embraced by the eternal history of the Order as one passed the decorated walls and sculptures for the significant individuals of the past. Without a moment's notice, the sound of footsteps filled the room. \"It's integral that we remember the sacrifices of the Founders; the sculptures across the temple were made in their honor, along with the numerous others that devoted their life to the betterment of the Galaxy.\" cheerfully said Kraios, a gallant Sentinel unknowing of what his origins were other than being Human. \"Do you think I would ever earn one of myself, Master?\" Aiva said as her face lit up, a female Chiss and Kraios' padawan. Kraios erupted in a soft laughter, \"Well, now I have your attention? Aiva, you control your destiny if you wish to be remembered. I'm confident that you'll have a sculpture in the future for us to laugh about as we go on our walks.\" Aiva stared at her Master for a moment, then at her feet as they walked down the hall, smiling as she could nearly envision the future she had long yearned for. \"It's crowded here today.\" Aiva lifted her head to see they had reached the Great Hall with hundreds of fellow Jedi. Extensive chatter brought the hall to life, laughter as far as the eye could see. The dawn of a new day was welcomed with clear skies and friendly conversation that would leave any enamored.\nKraios never paid much attention to it; his realistic approach to life made him a controversial figure within the Order as it contradicted the ancient Jedi philosophy. His Padawan, Aiva, allowed him to be more appreciative of the Order and the daily responsibilities of a Knight. \"Oh, Aiva, did you want to continue where we left off with your lightsaber training-\" Kraios was abruptly interrupted by his comlink. Besides an eerie static, nothing was received, the embodiment of emptiness; Kraios waited for something to be made out of the unknown signal. One by one, all the other comlinks in the hall received a similar static. Kraios looked around in curiosity as the Great Hall, once filled with roaring laughter, was engulfed with the sound of a premonitory tone. His heart began to race as his breath shallowed, hastening with every passing second, an indescribable feeling thought to have been forgotten. A message was made out in the panic: \"My chains are broken.\"\nA bright light could be seen in the reflection of Kraios' eyes, and with one final gasp, they were closed shut. Menacing clouds of smoke filled the hall, and screams of torment were silenced as Kraios stared into the darkness of the void. Kraios tightened his grip on his lightsaber, and the other Knights followed suit. He called out to Aiva, worried for his young Padawan, visibly shaken by what was before her. \"Are you alright?!\" shouted Kraios, to which Aiva responded with a subtle nod as she reached for her lightsabers. Kraios was petrified, but not for his own life; that wasn't it. An image from the depths of hell presented itself, a gale of hatred barreling towards the inner hall; sinister laughter echoed off the walls as red streaks of light collectively followed, illuminating the dark. And from the darkness emerged a menacing figure wearing a hideous grin as blood dripped from its face. Piercing red eyes that set your soul ablaze, illuminating from their black, almost mechanical body. The crimson hue from their blade cast an ominous glow within the dark smoke; even the most courageous were startled by the scene. With a swift readjustment, the figure let out a petrifying screech and a malicious grin hidden behind its blade as it sundered through the air. The silhouette on the temple floor mirrored a dreadful vision. Master Rostoni, unable to defend himself in time, was dropped to his knees; his struggle was futile. Kraios' eyes widened in horror as his mentor, an honorable man who devoted his life to the assistance of others, struggled for air as he choked on his blood. The figure opened its mouth, \"My chains are broken. What a delightful view, I'm quite envious.\" The figure laughed maniacally as he swung his blade across his body, and Master Rostoni's head rolled across the hall, giving a final glimpse of his struggle to live be silenced. A man who offered everything throughout his life received nothing but frightful stares and a sense of vain in his final moments. This display left the spectating Jedi without action; grips loosened as their lightsabers vibrated within their hands. There was no mistake; this was the impenetrable Dark Lord of the Sith. \nHis affixed glowing stare at Rostoni's body as if it were prey amid the hum of his blade left Kraios riddled with despair. Slowly, the Dark Lord's gaze turns away from the corpse and towards him with an insatiable lust for blood. His swiftness intact, he lunged himself toward Kraios as he revealed his amber blade, meeting the Dark Lord at a standstill, lost in the glowing inferno of his pupils. At that moment, his army revealed itself. An inconceivable number of Sith warriors sprinted to the Dark Lord's aid; the Jedi Knights regained composure, ignited their blades in unison, let out a battle cry, and ran towards the Sith Warriors to defend their Temple. In a battle of will, the Sith charged toward the Jedi with hatred and bruteness, while the Jedi positioned themselves with grace as they coordinated their defense, a display of their opposing perceptions of the Force. In a seemingly endless battle, both sides demonstrated their talents in lightsaber combat, refining them through countless years of practice. While going toe to toe with the fierceness of the warriors, the Jedi had to dodge incoming blaster fire from the Sith Empire's troopers; a whirlwind of force energy filled the room, and conflicting ideologies battled to determine which would be victorious. As Kraios held his own against the infamous Dark Lord, he concentrated his Force to release a shockwave to disrupt his balance; the seasoned Lord demonstrated his experience by evading the attack and countering it with one of his own. A damning burst of lightning emerged from his black fingertips, and promptly, a deafening crash that startled even some of the Sith nearby. Kraios witnessed the blue streak of light dart frighteningly near; he extinguished his blade and concentrated on defense. By meeting both hands and cupping the bolt of lightning, he could deflect the lightning at a Darth he saw from the corner of his eye.\n\"Most impressive.\" said the Dark Lord with an intrigued stare in his eye, \"Spare me the flattery, bastard,\" Kraios responded as he clenched his teeth. Once more, they ignited their blades, swift movements that only the most versatile could dance in. The Dark Lord perfected numerous combat forms, alternating during the duel, and Kraios was relegated to do the same. Countless Jedi were overwhelmed; not only were there Knights, but Padawans, Younglings, and the sickening Sith chased down even the defenseless. The Jedi were at a breaking point; they required support, assuming the Republic would soon aid them. Misplaced wishfulness if only they knew the gravity of their situation. The Great Hall was previously brought to life with energetic chatter and has been filled with dead men.\nThe most damning moment for many, though it seemed that the Dark Lord was savoring every moment of the devastation he had unleashed. \"I revel in their agony; it sustains me.\" cheerfully said the Dark Lord. Kraios retained a disgusted expression as sweat began to form on his brow; after immense acrobatics, he began to feel weary, though his heart was committed to vengeance, \"What is this feeling?\" thought Kraios. Countless screams were lost in Kraios' determination to deliver a similar fate to the abomination that murdered his Master. However, there was one, an unmistakable voice that he would not dare ignore. A shiver ran down his spine; they had been separated amid the conflict; in a sudden moment, the epitome of perdition became secondary, the hum as their lightsabers clashed shallowed. Kraios' mind attempted to convince itself that he didn't hear what he thought; he became dizzy, trying to console himself and envision false realities where this day never occurred. All other sounds were muffled; Kraios silently waited to hear it again, hoping it was just his imagination, waiting as his eyes began to lose focus, \"GET AWAY, SOMEBODY!\" Kraios reignites himself; his greatest fear has been realized: the Dark Lord softly laughs in his face. Kraios attempts to redirect himself and rushes toward his Padawan's aid, but the Dark Lord was quicker.\nKraios sensed his ominous presence stirring behind and blocked his attack, \"Do you know that poor girl?\" the Dark Lord said with deceitful sympathy. Kraios let out an expression of fury, precisely what he was hoping for, \"With such a look, how could I ever let you go?\" Kraios knew what he was referring to immediately and looked away. He scanned for Aiva across the hall, and there she was. Aiva's fighting style consisted of dual-wielded lightsabers; she was not the most capable of duelists, but for that reason, today, she intended to train with her Master. Kraios attempted to break away from the Dark Lord as Aiva clashed with a towering brute; he wielded a lightclub, also known as a greatsaber, a lightsaber designed for larger species with a more intimidating appearance. The Brute was far from elegant, but his attacks infused with raw strength pushed Aiva back. As she struggled to keep her footing, she lost one of her lightsabers; she was visibly overwhelmed, and her screams for help were for naught; a few nearby Jedi who initially attempted to aid her were swiftly diced. Lacking no remorse for her age or noticeable inexperience, the Brute continued with an unyielding onslaught of overhead attacks to force Aiva onto her back, tears in her eyes as she yelled Kraios' name.\nThe Dark Lord entrapped Kraios with a combination of the Force and his blade, \"I'm grateful for your company as we watch her demise.\" Kraios ignored him and called out to nearby Jedi to help her; he was disregarded, \"What are they doing? Do they not have any sympathy for the feeble youth?!\" Kraios angrily thought to himself. Out of desperation, Kraios turned back to his foe, his arm locked; he collected all of his strength and kicked the Dark Lord's leg inward, dislocating his kneecap, slid his lightsaber down his arm, and with one swift movement, cleaves the side of his body cutting off the Dark Lord's arm wielding his lightsaber. He uttered a daunting cry; the Sith nearby came to his aid; Kraios rushed towards his Padawan while being pursued by infuriated warriors, effortlessly clearing a path towards her. Intimidating the Jedi and Sith parties, Kraios made his way to the Brute with his back turned, his grey eyes glowing with wrath. Kraios was prepared to attack the Sith from behind, an unspoken taboo for some Jedi.\nSuddenly, the Brute picked up Aiva from behind her neck, lifting her several feet off the ground, and turned her around to face Kraios directly. He froze for a moment; her glance was faint, half-opened, and she looked apologetic when at arm's reach from her Master. Kraios extinguished his blade as he made his way to her, chattering his teeth, and let out a smile to conceal it. The Brute peeked over Aiva's shoulder and gave Kraios a smile of his own; with a sudden lunge, his crimson greatsaber pierced through her heart from behind; a red glow lit on Kraios' face as he watched horrified as Aiva's eyes widened in agony, tears streaming down her cheek. Kraios' forced smile slowly rests. His jaw began to tremble out of disbelief and shock; Aiva's cry had been silenced but continued to ring in his ear. The Sith viciously withdrew his blade, and yet the color crimson remained; Kraios had yet to react; in the midst of the chaos, the Dark Lord was satisfied. Kraios could feel Aiva's life force depleting, a tear for every second that remained, and as he struggled to formulate a word, his legs began to shake as his welcoming arms had not yet been dropped. The future where they could laugh together in the face of her sculpture was lost; his Temple and his family were lost. Does his mind remain intact?\nThe Brute tossed Aiva's lifeless body aside and glanced over Kraios' reaction, licking his lips as if it satiated him. Kraios' hands trembled, yet he grabbed his lightsaber, a heavy weight on his shoulders and incinerating rage in his gaze. The Brute launched another overhead attack over his head; Kraios dropped his head, and the Brute perceived this as a declaration of submission, \"How distasteful!\" the Brute yelled as the blade neared Kraios' head. He looked up and reached out his arm, grabbing the blade itself, absorbing the energy and channeling it through the Force, then dismissing it entirely, negating the electrical power of the blade. The brute tried to pull away in fear but was unable due to Kraios' grip; spinning his hilt, Kraios ignited his blade and decapitated the ferocious Brute, his cry concealed by Kraios' haunting scream of outrage. Using this anger, he turned to lock eyes with the Dark Lord, the first instance where he discerned fear himself. Kraios sprinted towards the Dark Lord and unleashed the most potent lightning burst he could with merely one of his arms at his disposal.\nKraios blocked the attack with his lightsaber, pushing onward as he neared the Dark Lord. Kraios was approaching his limit, and his bull rush came to a halt; holding on to his blade as the lightning pierced through the blade and his body, he was launched across the hall, smashing through a pillar, covered in rubble where he lay unconscious. Though his eyes were unable to open, he could hear everything. Hours of torment he had passed where he overheard explosions and the crumbling of the Temple's walls, followed by silence. \"What was more startling, the sounds of reassuring agony or the silence?\" thought Kraios. More time passed, and Kraios opened his eyes, expecting to be embraced by the ancient architecture of the Temple; he was shocked to see the moon through an immense hole in the ceiling. Rainfall drops added to his tears, and though emotions were verboten, he could not stop the streams coming down from his cheeks as he covered his face with his hand. Kraios rose from the rubble, embraced by the once impressionable Temple hall that has now been reduced to ruins. Silence filled the former Great Hall, though Kraios did hear faint explosions in the distance. As malicious as the sounds coming from outside the Temple were, Kraios knew it was evident that it would collapse at any moment and must go off-world. Gradually regaining his composure, his sore back was the last thing on Kraios' mind. Flashbacks began rushing to him; seemingly, a legend appeared before him and took everything away. \"What could we have done differently? How were we so ill-prepared?\" faintly said Kraios as he caught his breath.\nKraios always thought poorly of the Jedi Order to a certain degree, but what he had witnessed only reinforced those feelings. \"They made a burial site out of my home,\" Kraios said as he attempted to hold back a psychotic laugh to a fault. Eventually, he neared the main gate of the Temple, the epicenter of this massacre. Kraios heard a scream for help, initially believing it was just another memory; his name was called out near the entrance. \"Kraios, is that you?! Thank the stars! Please come quick!\" said the unknown figure. Kraios had already walked past numerous corpses but did not falter; he knew his objective. Upon nearing the origin of the screams, a cold sensation rushed down his spine for the second time today as the horrors he had just endured fully settled in. He remembers the expressions on his Padawan, Aiva's face, her screams as she pleaded for help, and how other Jedi were either too incapable or blatantly disregarded her pain at the face of what was in front of them. Resentment had simmered in, and as he neared the screams, he uncovered the source: an Elder who had been trapped under immense rubble following the initial explosion. \"Kraios, what a reassuring sight! Please help me; my legs have been crushed, but together, I'm sure we can lift this rubble!\" pleaded the Elder. Kraios looked blankly at him as he struggled to push off the rubble, almost with a look of disdain. The disturbed Elder asked Kraios, \"What are you standing around for? Please help me!\" Kraios wasn't necessarily indifferent toward his anguish; rather, he enjoyed entertaining the idea of having the Elder suffer to compensate for their inability to save Aiva. Kraios felt a sensation he had not experienced before. The teachings he received from his Master and taught to his Padawan were the same, though that was in the past. Dancing with the fires of damnation did not frighten him in the slightest, for he knew what he must do. Kraios walked away from the Elder with a sense of self-satisfaction and a smirk as the Elder's scream for help faded. The grand entrance to the Temple was once slathered in gold and overlooked by sculptures of the Founders that were said to deter hostilities. \"As Jedi, we sanctified these people, depicted by the sculptures, but now they lay beneath my foot, with their heads facing the earth, covered in ash and misplaced glory.\" Kraios thought to himself. As he exited, Kraios glanced at the sky; the days where he looked to the stars for direction have long passed. Chaos was widespread; the attack on the Temple was merely the beginning. The sky had been claimed by an overcast of smoke and fighter ships trading blaster fire. Kraios walked on the roads leading outside the Temple and came across a particular corpse of a Sith; as Kraios cautiously examined the body, he came across an acolyte mask that caught his attention. The mask this fallen Sith had worn was the final sight for many of Kraios' fellow Jedi, \"The craftsmanship on this is second to none,\" Kraios convinced himself.\nNevertheless, appreciation for the arts was never something Kraios inhibited; his motives lay elsewhere. As Kraios took the mask of the body's face, he reached for his lightsaber when he revealed that the Sith's gold and red eyes were opened, although he had already passed. There was only one dead man in that area, though Kraios' lifeless silver eyes would tell a different story. As the mask covered his face, his expressions were no longer visible. He raised his head, looked to the sky along with the dead man beside him, took a deep breath, and began to walk away from the temple, later turning into a sprint as he screamed out of the top of his lungs. A pathway that overlooked much of the Galactic City, complimented by what appeared to be cherry blossom pedals, was merely engulfing embers. The aftermath of the Galactic City occurred in Kraios' side view; though he did not turn, his resolve was intact, and he looked ahead. Kraios was given a purpose in this wretched galaxy, whether through the means he had hoped for or not. Those involved with today's events would meet a similar fate, or so Kraios thought. As Kraios continued to release all of his anger, screaming as one of the moons shined upon him with tears in his eyes, it was undistinguishable; the mask had served its intended purpose.\nKraios fled to the ventilation shaft on Coruscant to escape the carnage inflicted on the Galactic City. Said ventilation shaft not only collected the Galactic City's sewage and network much of the planet's shipping, but it granted access to the Underworld, known colloquially as the Underworld Portal. Kraios went through countless alleyways to prevent being spotted to reach the turbo-lift safely, one of the only manners of descending to the Underworld without a starship. Quite the crowd was surrounding the turbo-lift, designed to transport merely five to six people at a time, give or take. Kraios put on his hood and avoided eye contact to avoid having his mask recognized. Kraios did not have the time to wait for the other passengers, and as he pushed his way to the front of the hostile crowd, he overheard a few conversations that the Sith Empire would make their way here soon, though challenging to make out due to the ensuing chaos. Kraios considered something horrifying, \"Use your blade to clear a path; these rodents are in your way; mow down these insignificant citizens and reach the Underworld,\" Kraios' mind told him. And as Kraios reached for his lightsaber on his hip, he heard the sound of the turbo-lift arriving and let go of his lightsaber. He was forcibly pushing through civilians and darted onward; the turbo-lift was filling up hastily, one by one; Kraios could see his chances of going off-world diminish before his very eyes. The turbo-lift doors began to close, and with a swift swipe of his finger, the doors remained open; he grabbed a woman carrying a child by the shoulder and dragged her out of the lift to make room for himself. And so, the door closed with the woman banging on the glass with fear in her eyes as they descended.\nThough it was certainly cramped, the other passengers somehow made room to keep their distance from Kraios. Several minutes of odd silence had passed, and some of the families felt relieved to have escaped alive; a younger Kraios would have given the civilians in the turbo-lift aid and consolation, giving him a sense of fulfillment, but all he could feel at that moment was indifferent towards them. Kraios grew impatient, and in his defense, so did all the others. And at long last, they reached the depths of the Underworld. Kraios was the first one out. Though he was accustomed to the finer things in life living in the Temple, he felt serene; oddly enough, the underworld, outside of the Outer Rim, was where crime was most rampant. Kraios continuously saw the face of a malevolent grin in his visions but shrugged them off. He was adamant about seeing out his promise.\nThe Underworld consisted of narrow, dimly lit alleyways leading to impoverished buildings, creating an unnerving environment. Despite the prevalent litter on the streets and the high crime rates, the Underworld is in a better state than the Galactic City, virtually untouched by the Sith. The underworld consisted of outlaws and the impoverished. Kraios never put much thought into it, but the Republic viewed them as having the same social status. The Republic demonstrated more interest in the outlaws by allocating time and resources to capture them. A scene that would leave many sick, emaciated children turning to crime for survival people on the streets as if they were disposable garbage. Quite the surprise. Who would have thought Kraios would have such a leisurely walk at a time like this? As Kraios walked past neon-lit buildings, he glimpsed over monitors elaborating on the situation in the Galactic City. The Order has fallen, the Republic has fallen, and the remnants are being persecuted. You would assume the locals reacted worriedly, but as the news that the Supreme Chancellor was murdered broke out, the crowd of listeners opened in celebration. The scum had a complete lack of regard for the Republic and their lives, but who could blame them. Walking, counting every step on these grimy walkways, a sudden brightness caught Kraios' attention; it was liberation, a docking bay. Though not visible, his smile quickly faded as he noticed the ray shield preventing entrance, \"Seems I'm at a loss for options,\" said Kraios as he reached for his lightsaber. With an amber glow radiating from the emitter and an abrupt shove, Kraios jabbed his blade into the wall beside the ray shield, carving an entrance of his own.\nPushing the wall inward, he stepped through the opening he created, his boot clanking on the metal floors as he entered. He sensed he was not alone, then heard the draw of a blaster. Kraios directed his lightsaber at this figure. \"That's an odd hue for a Sith.\" said the Mandalorian Crusader. Kraios grinned under his mask and replied, \"Odd? I'm certain it can cut through you all the same. And one more thing, I'm no Sith.\" He darted towards the stunned Mandalorian, \"Wait!\" as she lowered her weapon, \"You must be a Jedi then? I came for your help!\" With his eyes of judgment, he stared down the Mandalorian, debating whether he was curious enough to hear what she had to say. \"The Sith Empire is too powerful for me to deal with alone. I'm willing to help the Republic in peace.\" She piqued his interest to think that was all she needed to say. \"Well, considering what is going on in the Galactic City, the conditions here in the underworld don't tell half the story. The Republic and the Order have fallen to the Sith,\"  Kraios said distastefully.\n\"Dammit, I don't suppose you have any capable allies around?\" said the Mandalorian. Kraios stood in silence. \"Right, well, I guess it's just the two of us. I'm Astrid Vizla.\" \"Kraios.\" \"Best to move swiftly; the Empire likely has a blockade surrounding the planet; best to move swiftly-\" Astrid said before Kraios interjected, \"You never told me what your dealings are with the Sith Empire. Why did you want help from the Republic?\" \"Cautious because I'm a Mandalorian, are we? You must really be a Jedi, after all.\"\nAstrid said jokingly. Kraios, noticeably irritated, repeated himself in a more hostile tone. \"Easy, easy, whether you believe me or not, you can decide that for yourself, but don't think that we- Don't think that I side with-\" Astrid paused before finishing her sentence, \"Them. You are likely familiar with our Mand'alore, Kreed Mand'alore, that is. His combative prowess is unquestionable; regardless, I uncovered something dreadful. Our ruler is but a mere puppet of the Sith Emperor. My people have endured the horrors under the word of a false sovereign. It is unforgivable.\" Astrid was shaken but recollected her calm and led Kraios into her starship.\nKraios appreciated her passion; he had decided to go along with her rather than merely slay her and take the ship. \"Let's hope you're quite the pilot to evade the potential blockade you spoke of,\" Kraios said as he crossed his arms. \"I'm that, and then some, just enjoy the ride,\" Astrid said as the cockpit hatch was lowered. The dimly lit deck was illuminated by the engine start, and the sound of bustling mechanics bounced off the walls. The control panel danced in various glowing colors and flashes, and with a sudden movement, the starship began its ascent out of the underworld portal. The engines roared; Astrid was naturally worried about what they might encounter but was also affixed to her goal. And so, she hit the thrusters and was met with the skirmishes in the Galactic City's skies. Countless buildings toppled, the aftermath the Sith caused can not be overstated; the once glorious capital of the Republic has been reduced to debris. The remnants of the skylines smoldered by fire, creating an eerie aura that illuminated the city as the dark overcast above the city blocked out the sunlight. This was the galaxy's center; as you glanced outside your window, all that could be seen wee the rising sun, elegant skyscrapers, and speed cruiser traffic across the sky. That is in the past; this is the reality for the Coruscanti now.\n\"Engrave this into your memory, Astrid; in the face of this havoc, I'll give them a similar scenery. Kraios growled. The system's radar picked up on a ship trailing them, and sure enough, the laser blasts followed once they didn't identify themselves. Astrid expertly evaded the attacks, though by the narrowest margins, Kraios can rest assured that he found a capable pilot. Before the Frigates could catch notice of their escape, Astrid began the hyperdrive sequence, laughing in jow while doing so. The cockpit was bathed in the blue shine due to the hyperspace tunnel. \"I must give you credit where it's due; that was smooth.\" Kraios calmly said as he began to sit back in his seat. \"Compliments like that are just another incentive to make it out alive,\" Astrid said with her hands gently resting on the control panel as she gazed at the endless cosmos. Astrid whispered to herself, \"In the vacuum of space, out here, there are no screams, no violence. It's beautiful.\" Kraios looked upon her in deep thought, then towards the stars; though concealed by his mask, Astrid knew that he was smiling under there, even if she let out a relaxed sigh for the first time all day. Kraios reached out his hand, the stars merely out of arm's reach, entranced by the void of space, \"I have stared into the abyss. The Force's so-called mercy shall act as a catalyst.\" Kraios thought to himself as he clenched his fist. \"Astrid,\" she turned toward him, \"Where did you say we were going?\" Kraios asked curiously, \"To meet some friends at the Glorious Jewel. I'm sure we can get the information we need.\" \"Why haven't I heard of this place?\" asked Kraios. \"Must be because it is out of the Republic's reach,\" suggested Astrid. \"Hold on! We'll be jumping out of hyperspace...now!\" As the starship exited hyperspace, a burst of light illuminated the cockpit and was shortly followed by a thunderous vibration that shook the entire vessel. The view no longer consisted of a rotating blue tunnel, but the stars were visible again in all their glory.","meta":{"index":4,"author":"Inkavos","name":"Shadows of Retribution","release_year":2021}},"Focus":{"content":"# Introduction\n“Focus.” Her master stated as she was thrown back to the floor again. “There will come a time when you will need to fight a greater threat than me. Then, you must be ready.” He spoke again, helping her up. He then walked back to the end of the mat and ignited his lightsaber, the brilliant gold color glowing through the temple. “Remember, focus your mind. Hear the force speaking to you. Don't let your mind get ahead of your soul. Do not act with fear, nor favor. You are a Jedi. Feel your surroundings, don't simply see them.” He uttered in a long breath. She ignited her blade, the emerald color sputtering as she got into a low stance. The force to her had always felt like a song. A rhythm, or a tune that had a constant beat. She just had to feel that beat. She took a long breath and focused her mind, feeling the beat throughout her soul as she ran forward to confront her master again.\n\nReality snaps back hard. So it did for her, as the memory of her master played through her mind. The teachings still ring true. But now, he is gone. Another victim of the war to claim thousands. She leaned back in her chair. She had no one now, sitting in the debris of the old Jedi temple she used to call home. The temple she was taught in. Danger always seemed to be lurking in the parts where she least expected it. She stood up, and walking into the moonlight of the forest, kneeled down.\n\n“Master, how much more of this must we do?” Her own thoughts rang in her mind and she asked that same question to herself. How much more of this would she have to endure? Life was not easy for any Jedi. Her kind was scattered to the brim. Still kneeling, she focused, feeling the force around her. The only calm that she could have anymore in this time of turmoil. Her mind and memories flashed before her, of what had happened. The future seemed to call to her too, what was to happen. This feeling of calm and uncertainty, in one combined into the only sensation she seemed to be able to feel anymore.\n\nThis sensation however was cut off by a horrific noise. The cackling of a red blade. It spat and sputtered and she spun around, igniting her emerald blade. She didn't dare jump forward, staying but holding a low guard. The words of her master rang through her mind and she prepared for the worst. “Focus.” It was almost as he was speaking to her. She felt the rhythm through her mind and the sith came dashing at her. She held her block perfectly and met his blade, creating a violent glow and a bone chilling noise. She flipped backwards, confident she could beat him now. She went in for a swing at his side, but was met by an immovable snap of the enemy. Her lightsaber went flying out of her hands and crashed into the dirt and the victorious sith snapped a hold on her neck. The enemy raised her up by the neck and brought her close to his face. “I could kill you quickly now, but I would rather watch the life drain from your eyes.” The Sith snarled as she struggled for her life. As she was brought closer to his face, the red glow of his lightsaber illuminated his face. As the world became black around her, the last image she saw was her own master's face, staring back.","meta":{"index":2,"author":"Aura_Hero6","name":"Focus","release_year":2021}},"Forbidden Love / True Love":{"content":"# Introduction\n=============================DECRYPTING…=============================\n=========================BEGIN TRANSMISSION=========================\nFor the eyes of Master ???? ????,\n\nDo you remember the first two words you said to me? In your beautiful Twi’lek language, you said Chini, wachamio! Those two words were the start of it all. The words that led to me falling in love with you. \n\nIn short, the sin I confess to is withholding details and purposefully lying to you about a specific aspect of our dynamic - namely, the whole range of motions I have for you. It's unfair to you that I've been open about so many other unpleasant things but not this one issue. You gave me no cause to doubt my ability to communicate these details, but I still did not force myself to be entirely honest. Yet I don't have an excuse. I was well aware that complete transparency would alter our relationship, and in my selfishness I did not want to cope with the possibility that you might leave me. I intended to continue the charade, but I just can't.\n\nI remember when, on one of the last days of official classes, we were sitting in the Awareness Course classroom, and you turned to me and said, \"Master Vega has such beautiful hair!\". My impulse reaction was to reply, \"So do you,\" and I was actively trying to not let that slip out. That was the first of many omissions.\n\nIn one of our many conversations, you asserted, \"I don't think there are many people who would like me.\" This is clearly meant as self-depreciation. Still,  I felt an impulse to interject here, but I didn't. It either would have come off as phony and said to be consoling, or it would have come off as genuine; and the latter would have been risky because I couldn't gauge how you would have reacted. \n\n\"I seriously cannot imagine myself loving someone. The basis for that feeling doesn't seem to exist in me. So my future is decidedly uncertain. I've given up on love before even trying it, and I don't want to keep dwelling on it.\" I find myself using this statement as a crutch to convince myself that I am doing you some favor by not revealing what I truly feel, but it's high time I face the music that, until now, I have been finding excuses to not speak up.\n\nSo where does this leave me? In an ideal world, I would directly tell you that I love you. But I can't do that; I can't even say I like you. Why? To some extent, I don’t believe it’s because such relationships are prohibited in the Order - at least, relationships like the one I’m looking for. Frankly, I believe it’s the fact that I don't know enough about my own emotions. What's friendship? When does it become love? How do I know that a strong sentiment today will be strong tomorrow? I’m unable to even enquire about my emotions to anyone; I’d just be treated like an outcast. Such is the glory of the Jedi Order.\n\nOn top of that, my track record scares me, and I don't mean my academics. Five out of the six times I failed the Expansion Course, I quickly overcame it. Did I not honestly care? Did it not work? The one time that I’ve ever felt this way - also the one with the highest likelihood of being genuine - now feels like a fever dream, and I can't compare what I feel for you now to what I felt back then.\n\nDespite all the doubt, there are fundamental truths I have clarity on. The vulnerability and manner in which I talk to you are reserved only for you. I intend to keep talking to you till you don't want to talk to me. Comments like \"Just the guy I was waiting for!\" will make me nervous if I don't have the context, and words like \"I wanted to compliment you in front of everyone,\" will make me stupidly happy.  When I say I don't mind talking about your feelings or future specialization opportunities, I mean it; it feels good to be helping you. Despite the general helpful attitude I want to have, I'm not interested in being this beneficial to anyone else in the slightest.\n\nThis is a lot to take in and certainly changes our dynamic. We may never speak this frankly about anything or even talk with each other again, but I will not worry about that now. This is my one shot, and I am going to capture it.\n\n??????, I know you will do great things in this Order. You set the standard when it comes to personal motivation and work ethic. Whatever you must face, you will tackle it head-on. I hope that the passage of time makes you feel more confident in striving for those things you don't necessarily need to, but it will make you all the happier if you do so. You can do so much and so amazingly well in a position like an Investigator. You have a great shot at it too. If you focus on showing people the real you, everyone will be drawn in. More than anything else, I hope you find joy in the little things that will come up in your life and in that final masterpiece I know you will create. For whatever it is worth, I believe in you, ??????.# Section 1\n==========================END TRANSMISSION==========================\n\n“.???\" - Now that they were finally alone in the classroom, she called his name\nHe turned around. His brown hair was still the same spiky mess it had always been. But now, it was almost… angelic to her.\nShe closed the transmitter with shaky hands. She was unsure how to begin, but took a shot at it anyway.\n“With my terrible performance at the Combat Course class today, I thought today was destined to be a terrible one. Your letter, though, single handedly made it a good day.”\nHis smile was unlike anything she’d ever seen - the embodiment of joy.\n“I’m glad. It was meant for the day we graduated from the Corps, but I couldn’t have kept it with me until then.”\nHe looked at her, eyes sparkling with the light of the setting sun. “Thank you for reading it. Really.”\nAll she could do was give him a slight, uncertain nod, although she wanted to express so much more.\n“Are you kidding? You know I’m not one to smile for trivial things. But when I was reading this, I found myself grinning like an idiot.” She tried to demonstrate, but ended up smirking and quickly glancing away. \n“So thoughtful. So thorough. So… ???.”\nIt was his turn to look away, abashed. “I wish I had been more “???” sooner. But better late than never, I suppose.”\nShe stepped closer, her eyes unwavering this time. The smell of lavender peeked out from behind her robes, and yet it was as if that smell had filled up the entire room. She was still as beautiful as ever. So why can’t I have her? Why are the Jedi so… cruel?\n“I just want to say…” He looked up at her, stunned. For the first time since they met, she was doubting herself. “...I understand if you’re confused about your feelings for me, especially since we’re Jedi and all - we’re not meant to have these sorts of emotions cloud our judgment. But…”\n“I just hope we can keep our thought-provoking conversations alive, like they’ve always been every single day of our lives. Even when you leave to become a Sage, and I eventually leave to become an Investigator. And I just know that once you’re there, you’ll look back and think that it was okay to let people like me exit your life.”\nHis voice, now taking on a crestfallen tone, pierced the room like the sound of a lightsaber being ignited.\n“Is this an… easy way of letting me down?”\nShe shook her head, her hair fluttering from side to side, the purple highlights clashing with her obscure-coloured eyelashes.\n“I’m saying all of this genuinely. Wherever you go, you’ll be alright. What will happen, will happen - we’ll be in two completely different realms of the Order, so it doesn’t matter how I feel right now because we don’t have much time even if we tried to make this work.”\n“So I don’t want you to dwell on this. I want you to be happy with someone you actually do have time with, wherever you go.”\nShe sat down for the first time since she entered the room, facing him. Her wistful eyes starkly contrasted with his melancholic ones.\n“I care about you, ???. I really do. You’re the one person in this Academy who I think is a real, honest-to-the-Force friend. The only one I don’t want to let go of.”\n“But… I don’t think the feelings I have for you are the same as yours. At least, not yet.”\nHis tone more confident, his eyes more melancholic than ever, he replied, “Fair enough. Thank you for telling me that at least.”\n\nThe conversation lilted awkwardly, either one not knowing how to continue.\n“Can I… ask you something?”, she offered. “Is the way you feel about me now the same way you felt about… ?????”\nHis head jerked up, his posture screaming ‘startled’. He answered, cautiously at first, “If I’m being honest… no. I think I liked the drama of the whole process more than her as a whole. It was endearing - a forbidden relationship with someone who was more than willing to take things to the next level if I let her. But the entire time, I was always searching for signs of my love for her.”\n“With you… I’m just in the moment. I take things for what they are when I’m with you.” \n“All I want is a peaceful relationship with someone I truly love. I don’t want anyone - not the Masters, not our classmates, not even if the High Council themselves intervened - to weigh in and tell me what to do regarding this relationship.”\n“I understand it looks bad from the outside, but trust me when I say I didn’t mean to hurt her-”\n“Don’t say that.” She interrupted his flow like a falling leaf causing ripples over a river. “You did what you had to do when you ended the relationship. You don’t need to explain yourself to me once more.”\nHe looked at her with only gratitude in his pupils, and continued. “At some point with her, I realized it was a circle peg-square hole situation; the kind of situation where there’s been a horrible mismatch. But I was too stubborn to give up on her.”\n“I don’t want to speak for you, but in general I think people would agree that we’re much more similar than her and I.”\nShe bestowed upon him a nod to silence all doubts of his feelings for her. “Yes, actually. It’s a bit… cartoonishly ironic how things have turned out to be exactly the opposite of what they first seemed to be.”\n“I used to regret that,” he interjected. “But I’m thankful for it now. No other timeline would bring us to where we are right now, right here. And if my character ever comes into question by the Council, that’s a price I’d pay every time - even if I relived that experience a hundred times over.”\n\nShe gasped, completely taken aback. For the first time in her life, she had no words left to say. So she let him do all the talking for once.\n“????, I’ve said many things to you before and I believe I’ll have many more things to say once I can phrase my emotions properly. But I think the statement I’m about to give conveys the majority of my feelings in the best manner.”\n“Your presence in my life is more important to me than the type of relationship we have.”\nTears welled up in her eyes, causing her line of view to be tinged with salt and water. She felt the breeze of the Dantooine plains enrapture her skin, and wished it could take both of them far, far away - somewhere they didn’t have to hide. Somewhere they didn’t have to run. Somewhere they could be free.\nThen she realized he was still speaking, so she pulled her gaze away from the leaves of the Blba trees and focused it back on him.\n“I really wish I could say ‘I like you’ with absolute certainty. But you mean too much to me to make you go through that.”\nHer heart throbbed with sadness. She looked away yet again, her stormy eyes not daring to meet his emerald ones, shining with honesty.\n“What are you thinking now, ?????\n\nHer entire body was burning up. Her mouth was dry. Her fingertips ached to brush the hair fallen on his forehead off of his eyes, so that she could see them more clearly. But instead she said, “Nothing as such. I just want to thank you again for the letter. It… means a lot to me.”\nHe laughed, the melodic tones of his joy and fulfillment equalling the sound of the fabools outside. “After all I’ve said, I don’t know how to describe how I feel at this moment in time.”\n“Do you have any idea? How you feel, I mean.”\nFor once, she wanted to be the transparent one in the relationship. So she let herself be. “To be completely honest, I’m in pain because I had to hurt someone I care about, simply due to the fact that I wanted to be honest with myself. I’m in pain because you’re an amazing person, and I couldn’t give you what you deserved by not requiting your feelings.”\n“I don’t want you to think of me any differently, or think I nurse any feeling of awkwardness or weirdness towards you.”\nHe smiled and said, “You’d have hurt me a lot more if you said yes when you didn’t mean it.”\n\nIs this the same ??? I grew up with?\nNot knowing how to respond to anything anymore, she offered, “I understand if you need time to yourself to figure out the… logistics of the situation. I won’t take offense–”\n“I don’t care about logistics,” he declared. “I don’t want to make you uncomfortable by avoiding you just because the Code forbids it. We’re still young, and we’re going to go on so many adventures.”\n“You said you want me to be happy wherever I go. Well, I want you to be happy - even if I’m exiled, or if you choose something else over me. At the same time, I still want us to be at a level where we can remain transparent with each other.”\n“I don’t ever want to make you feel uncomfortable by suddenly ghosting you. Truth be told, I need to figure out how I should act going forward. Whether I really do want to continue my life as a Jedi or not. I don’t want to act like nothing happened and just go back to how things were pre-letter. Whatever pain this may have caused both of us, I don’t want it to ever be forgotten. In a sense, I feel this proves we can work through things - and that feeling is invaluable.”\n“Let’s move outside,” she offered. “To our sacred spot.”\n\nThe garden was quiet with the night. The leaves of the Blba trees rustled, waiting in anticipation. The Candlewick flowers were in full bloom, their scent covering his usual musk like a blanket. Their footsteps were in unison, as they always were. She felt a sense of finality in the air, as if he was making up his mind on something.\n“You know, if the outcome would be me with the Sages and you with the Investigators no matter what, it could then be asked, ‘What was the point of any of this?”\n“I can’t give you an objective answer. Subjectively, though, I can say our friendship made a huge impact on me, and my experience in the Service Corps was certainly the better for it. I’m truly grateful for that.”\nHe laughed again, this time without much mirth in it. “Sorry for my random thoughts here. I’m just blurting them out as they come.”\nShe shook her head, indicating that it was alright, It was now her turn to speak at random. \n“You know what I most admired about the letter?” He glanced at her, curiosity in his gaze. “When you said ‘This is my one shot, and I’m going to capture it.’ This was your shot. This is the last time we meaningfully see each other face to face before the day we graduate.”\n“I sincerely admire how you had the courage to confront your emotions. To put your heart out there, even though you knew it might get bruised. That takes real determination, you know. Something that not even the strongest of Jedis have.”\nShe looked at him, and her smile lit up the night, the color of her hair blending in with the sky . “I’m keeping this letter forever, you know. No matter what happens after this.”\nHe smiled, breaking through the darkness of the night sky with the light of a thousand moons. “I wouldn’t have it any other way.”\n\nWith determined steps, they made their way back to their quarters. She was the first one to break the silence.\n“So… where do we go from here?”\nHe thought for a second before responding, “I don’t know. But we’ll figure it out, no matter what anyone in this temple says. Just like we always have.”\nAnd as they departed for the night, all she could think of was a quote from the Revised Jedi Code, written just 50 years ago - “Love is the Force’s finest dagger; because it has such perfect aim.”\n\n","meta":{"index":1,"author":"DioneSenko","name":"Forbidden Love / True Love","release_year":2021}},"The Rising Sun Must Set":{"content":"# Introduction\nI still remember the laughter I shared back in Coruscant, simpler times when my only obligations were to attend Master Yoda's training sessions to channel our force abilities. We became accustomed to a routine; a day anew was spent in devotion to the betterment of our connection to the Force. I stood in awe as the Masters walked past me in the halls; I could not utter a word to them. I was too timid at the time, but I assured myself that I would one day overcome the discrepancy between our talents; I kept my head high. Adamant about reaching my aspirations, I dreamed of graduating to escape these restraints and see the galaxy for myself. I craved action, though it is against our teachings; I cannot contain myself these days. Should you have asked me if I considered life in the Temple mundane, I would have thought it over; in hindsight, I would know my response, how foolish I was. Although the Temple's walls shielded us, I was never appreciative of it, though none of us truly were. Instead, the other Younglings were ecstatic for the day we could embark on our journeys across the galaxy, creating a name for ourselves. Though not very social, I could barely contain myself when the thought of assembling my lightsaber and becoming a peacekeeper arose. We lived in bliss and luxury, though we never knew any other way; I felt like I had my future sealed and was able to fulfill my responsibilities. Throwing caution to the wind, I attended every training the Temple offered to hone my skills; I was never one for doubt or wariness, so why was I feeling this way? Now I remember.\n\nAdmittedly, I was selfish and too focused on my ambitions that I had not considered those around me. We sat around the Master as we listened to their stories, secluding myself from many of the other Younglings, seeing them as mere competitors. To think we intended to live amongst each other as a family as if I needed their hand. How foolish I was. I exited the room leaving with only outrage; impatience consumed me. Though as if the darkness surrounding my aura had immediately parted, the Master called for me. His voice: profound yet, forgiving, as if I could forget it, and yet fading in my memory. He called out to me, \"Koros!\" I turned down the hall to see Jedi Master Rath Lo, a hardened warrior with renowned lightsaber mastery. I feared I would be reprimanded for my sentiments on the other Younglings, contemplating fleeing, though I was too intrigued. I did not know much about the Master other than that they emphasized lightsaber combat; inherently, my mind was immersed with questions about improving my talents. No longer was I an immature Youngling; I vocalized all my questions, demanding his insight, a testament to my growth. Master Rath Lo laughed as I stood, maintaining my posture; he responded to my questions with one of his own. Resembling one of the statues I gazed upon in the Temple halls, nothing could have prepared me for what I had heard. The old brag of my heart, \"I will leave this Temple by all means,\" realized itself as everything and everyone around me whom I saw as obstacles began to fade; my only focus was on the lips of Master Rath Lo, as each word emitted felt like a stepping stone to my ambitions. Youngling dreams of hearing the words: \"You are reckless, just as I was; at the moment, I do not have the time to answer all your questions. Although I assure you that will not be an issue, how could I resist seeing my Padawan again?\" How arrogant he was, from their last few words, I did not know whether to be moody by their arrogance or fall to my knees in disbelief; I did both, knowing that the Force had led me on this bittersweet path. Pondering back on it, the Master was right; we are similar.\n\nI reflect on the past often, not that I would like to, but it seems unavoidable. I possessed nothing but the robes on my back and an incessant tenacity. Obtaining my early success required a miracle; I wish I could have another. Several years after the grandest moment of my young life, I found myself under the instruction of a Master with no comparison. No longer was I scrambling through the Temple's halls seeking exercises, and though I am yet impatient, so was my Master. Though odd to think of now, I can flawlessly describe each detail of my sleeping quarters. We did not have much space in the Youngling nurseries; nevertheless, I did not think much of it and rarely spent my time in either room. Master Rath Lo and I were regularly awake before the other Knights, meditating outside as the sun's rising glow rendered on our skin. Coruscant's Weather Control Network regulates our climate; it does not rain until after sundown, and we never fail to witness the sunrise. The transition from rainfall to gleaming skies acts as a daily reminder to evoke positivity, opposing all forms of malevolence to enjoy the feeling of a new day. It no longer rains; the sun continues to taunt me. I never presumed I would come to detest it. Unconvinced of the Uneti trees that surrounded us, my Master told me they inhibit force sensitivity and are not much different from him and me. The Archive contained an article claiming they enhanced our connection to the Force and retrieved a sapling; I am still unconvinced of their abilities; perhaps I  merely wanted to freshen my quarters. Regardless of motive, my interest in that blossoming sapling was sincere; much like we Humans, left untouched, we shall grow into mighty entities. Who is looking after it? Although Master Rath Lo specialized in lightsaber combat, I had yet to assemble my lightsaber. Uncertain of why his teachings have consisted merely of the philosophical aspect of the Force, I exclaimed to him, \"Have I yet to reach the pinnacle of my spiritual connection to the Force? How could you not begin my teachings on combat?\" I remember the expression on his face; he rose in discontent and complied; this would be the only regret I would come to have.\n\nMaster Rath Lo explained that before I am able to hone my talents in lightsaber combat, I must, of course, assemble my lightsaber. He understood I was not like the other Jedi; we are defiant to some aspects of our code. He always saw right through me; those several years with him taught me more of myself than I tend to admit. It was a rare commodity for me to engage with the others in the Temple, and before me was a man whom I considered a parental figure. We did not leave Coruscant before this day; I was exhilarated, above all things. I aspired to travel the galaxy and demonstrate my prowess to all agents of evil. Like all instances, my Master came along for this mission. We traveled to the planet Dantooine; I had read that this was considered sacred grounds, though the rest of the information was restricted to the eyes of merely Masters. I asked, \"What are we doing here, Master?\" he remained silent, determined to reach somewhere. I was riddled with anxiety; it required willpower to follow along quietly, nearly succumbing to boredom; what had shown itself before me was a wonder like no other. Antiquated caverns glistening with dew, the stars had become visible in the sky after our prolonged expedition. However, my eyes, affixed to the cavern's walls, would not dare to look elsewhere. I was told that my path as a Peacekeeper began here: I must search for my kyber crystal. I was offered only a lantern; the Force would guide me to my destination. The cavern's walls were extended, and nightfall's arrival was to no benefit. I grew wary; I had read of the subterranean creatures domestic to this planet; they were territorial arachnids, imposing in stature. As if I would fear an overgrown insect, the training I received from my Master did not necessarily improve my combative abilities, but my senses have been enriched. There were many crystals scattered throughout the cave. I could not hear them calling for me; they were awaiting someone else. A chill ran down my spine; I heard vibrations echoing through the cave and the sound of shattering ice. The noises grew in numbers; there was a source distinct from the others as if a large man was hissing; it seemed I was not alone. I followed the tunnels of the cave system, discovering a large area adorned with human skeletons, weapons, and animals stringed in a web. At that time, I had felt no fear quite like this; it is difficult to describe their figure, even more so to explain why I did not decide to escape immediately. The creatures were enormous; their arms were met with a sharpened point, with one attaching to their head to continue their attacks without debilitating posture. They stared at me through their multiple eyes; they began snarling, it seemed before I; none had dared to enter their cavern in considerable time. Defenseless, I rushed to grab a weapon from the ground. I had no time to be selective; as I gripped what appeared to be a vibrosword, my body became immobile. What is that creature that stood before me? It was one of those abominations I saw earlier; it seemed as if it could engulf the cavern itself. It was their queen. Fear was not something I had accustomed myself to; this sensation, thrilling yet ferocious, I was adamant in finding my crystal; I would not meet my end to a glorified insect. They came from all directions; I swung my blade valiantly, but my efforts amounted to nothing; their armor was virtually impenetrable. A sensation unknown to me, someone or something was calling to my spirit; I closed my eyes in the hope of direction. It revealed itself to me, a bright orange glow emitting from what appeared to be a block of ice from a distance. I dropped my vibrosword; the texts were correct; I had never felt such vitality in the Force. The creatures heeded my will, and nearing the Queen, I felt appalled to see that what I thought was ice was an egg sac. To begin my journey, I had to end many others; I did not have time to feel conflicted. With slight hesitation, I rummaged through the egg sac, retrieving my crystal. How irrational would I be to remain any longer? Fleeing with glory, I felt no remorse. Hurrying to Master Rath Lo, I presented my orange crystal; their expression was unsettled but understanding. While assembling my lightsaber hilt to reflect my endeavors, a dark metallic body with a white gradient symbolizing the impact on the galaxy I wish to compel, I asked my Master what the implications of an orange crystal are. It became clear that I had received the privilege of bearing the title of Jedi but that my morals were now in question for all to see; I had violated a balance between the dark and light side of the Force. My mind ridicules me; this knowledge resonates with me to no foreseeable end.\n\n\nI missed Coruscant, my Master, and I would continue awaiting the sunrise, but now I have cause to force combat instruction. At the age of 23, we embarked on countless assignments throughout the galaxy; I neared my Knighthood Trials. While that is an event all Padawans aspire to reach, I could not bear to leave the man that has given me such an opportunity. I became a seasoned warrior myself, with Master Rath Lo as my inspiration. We all sensed a disturbance in the Force; we are living in troubling times, and the fate of the galaxy is clouded. We were informed of a massive army of clones bred in discretion; we all have our sentiments on the matter; I, for one, was excited to share the battlefield with them. The Temple received word that the Senate has lawfully assumed the army, and not long after, Master Yoda requested for us all to meet in the board room. What we heard was unprecedented, unthinkable; we were to travel to the terrestrial planet Geonosis in preparation for war. I could sense the diverse emotions in the room; we were left without an option, and my dreams as a Youngling appeared to be materializing. Hundreds of Knights and their Padawans boarded a shuttle to the battlefield. This task force included Master Rath Lo and me, it took some discussion, but I pushed him to agree to join our cause. The Clone Army would unfortunately not be able to deploy alongside us; regardless, we were adamant this ordeal would be met with success, I assured it. Pushing the other Padawans aside, I discreetly entered the coliseum awaiting the command to strike. The planet was arid. Merely 5% of the surface comprised water; these were no conditions for a lengthy battle. Multiple shots were heard from a distance, and at that moment, I saw but a glimpse of what to expect; as the locals evacuated, the coliseum was loaded with bloodthirsty Battle Droids. The war had begun. Hundreds of Jedi poured into battle; I followed my Master to deter reinforcements from the west doorway. Unlike our previous assignments, I had not witnessed bloodshed of this caliber. We had witnessed the ferocity of the Battle Droids previously; it was evident these were nothing alike. Our numbers dwindled, and I began to wonder where the reinforcements were; my confidence intact, I pushed forward. I remember the screams, Padawans pleading for help; what was I doing? Unfortunately, I was too immersed in the battle ahead; how foolish I was. Amid the conflict, a scream halted me; how could I forget his voice? After nearly a decade of training to preserve the life of the one person I had grown close to, I let my obsession supersede my responsibility. His final moments were spent laughing; I carefully listened to his words as I could no longer control my emotions. As his grip began to loosen, he said, smiling, \"We truly were reckless.\" Looking over him in turmoil, my actions became uncertain; I failed my Master. I tightened my lightsaber grip, glancing at my blade's hue. I recalled what we spoke of when I found my crystal; hatred would not consume me. The clones, at last, arrived, forcibly pulling me away from my Master's body; I boarded a shuttle to continue the battle, never thinking I would become disinterested in all this conflict. I assumed a leadership position of a clone platoon; I was tasked with destroying any remains of the Geonosian subterranean catacombs. I was unhinged; I led my men to a trap; I could barely hold the falling rocks long enough for them to escape. So why are all of these memories coming back to me? I opened my eyes to darkness; I had never considered doing something so selfless in the past; why have I sabotaged myself? I have yet to fulfill my endeavors. I began to lose air; while I may not be present to reap the benefits, I know that I have done well. As I lay, wishing for one last rainfall, I see a familiar face in the form of a spirit, the man that granted me everything, Master Rath Lo. I could not express all I wanted to say to him at the time; I took advantage of this moment together. Time has always been an issue, and that is especially true now. I could only form a few sentences, \"Instead of wasting our time, we should have been practicing. So tell me! Why, why did we spend so much time meditating?\" As my eyes began to close, I heard his final words \"I wished to see the sunrise together, even after death.\" I indeed had but one regret, how foolish I was.","meta":{"index":3,"author":"Inkavos","name":"The Rising Sun Must Set","release_year":2021}}},"meta":{"name":"TJO - Community","index":31}},"Technological Studies":{"articles":{"Beckon Call":{"content":"# Introduction\nBeckon call was also known as a remote activation controller.

A nightcloak system would consist of hundreds of nightcloak satellites encircling a planet. The orbital nightcloak was a satellite with a design similar to an umbrella. The orbital nightcloak were very deadly weapons that made a huge amount of casualties because they were used by the wrong hands.# Section 1\nThe orbital nightcloak was developed before 0 BBY, and covered in the official field manual for the Imperial Military. It was used by Warlord Zsinj to escape undetected from the Battle of Selaggis. Zsinj also used it to hold the planet Dathomir hostage until the inhabitants turned over the general, Hand Solo. When Solo managed to escape, he interrupted the Nightcloak satellite to save the planet from freezing. One of the Nightcloaks was reportedly destroyed by Rogue Squadron with only a single X-Wing launching a proton torpedo. Wedge Antilles later wrote this as a note in the Imperial Handbook, which destroyed any hope that destroying a satellite would take him out.

They were constructed from a self-preserving technology that was mixed with the dark side of the Force. These maps were fabricated to show off the monuments of the Rakatan Empire. Originally, each map had indicated the location of the Star Forge, but most of the information was lost with the fall of the Rakatan Empire. Over time the information was recovered as the maps were repaired. Allowing anyone who held the maps to put the pieces of the map together like a puzzle. The best-known example of a complete one of these maps was of the Mandalorian Wars and was located on Dantooine. Housed by an ancient temple containing Rakatan slaves and droids that protected the temple.# Section 1\nBy around 4000 BBY, the Rakata and their Empire had been forgotten and planets such as their homeworld Lehon faded from memory. There were ruins scattered across the galaxy that was the only remaining legacy of the Infinite Empire. Not long after the end of the Mandalorian Wars, Revan sought out the remaining star maps. He traveled to five or more planets to uncover the secrets of these maps. Finally, after piecing together all the information he and his apprentice Malak took control of the Star Forge. They then created a large fleet with intentions to conquer the Galactic Republic. During the Jedi Civil War, Revan was captured and just barely escaped death. He was retrained at the enclave on Dantooine and given the task of refinding all of the star map pieces to combat the expansion of the Sith Empire. After doing so, he and his companions left for the Lehon system and destroyed the Star Forge.\n\n# Section 2\nOne of the first star maps was located within the ruins on Dantooine not too far from the Jedi Enclave. Darth Revan and his apprentice Malak revisited the planet to track down the Star Map. Before they even arrived, Malak questioned if Revan was sure that this path was the right one to take. Several years later, Revan revisited the ruins once again with Bastila. They were guided by an information droid on how to get to the Star Map. Access to the area was only granted after completing puzzles that were found to the right and left of the chamber. The two rooms contained computer terminals that were protected by security droids. Despite the challenge, they were able to complete the puzzles and obtain the Star Map.\n\n# Section 3\nAnother Star Map was located on Kashyyyk within an ancient computer terminal. Due to a malfunction in the computer’s system, the native trees grew to an unnatural size, causing the surface of the planet to become a giant wilderness. Later on, a Jedi known as Jolee Bindo encountered the Star Map on the planet, but he was unable to gain access to it. After traveling deep into the wilderness of the planet, Revan learned of the map’s existence. Since he had found the device earlier with his apprentice, he was able to access the map in 3956 BBY. During the process, Jolee Bindo ran into Revan and commended him for being able to access this amazing technology.\n\n# Section 4\nLocated on Korriban, was another Star Map that sat within the tomb that had been constructed for the Dark Lord Naga Sadow. The map was located within the burial and surrounded by a pool of acid. Revan and Malak had visited Korriban twice, but nobody knew if the map had been accessed either time. After acquiring the star map and the Star Forge was under their control, this became an important part of the initiations for the students of the Sith Academy. To re-access the map Revan had to temporarily join the Academy and perform various tasks that gained him praise under the wing of Sith Master Uthar Wynn. After some time, Wynn believed that Revan was ready for further Dark Jedi training. He was then given access to the tomb but first needed to overcome the obstacles that lay within, alongside the creatures that had inhabited the area. Revan used special grenades to negate the effects of the acid pool and then successfully acquired the map.\n\n# Section 5\nLastly, was the map located on Tatooine. Which had been placed inside of the ruins of an ancient Rakatan temple located within the Eastern Dune Sea. By the time of Revan’s visit in 3956 BBY, a Krayt Dragon had made its home within the ruins. The dragon seemed to be attracted to the dark side energy that was radiating from the map, which made attaining the map much more difficult. Eventually, the dragon was killed at the hands of Revan with the assistance of Komad Fortuna. They claimed the map only to realize that it had not been connected to any computer systems or security droids.\n\n","meta":{"index":33,"author":"CaelestisThunder","name":"Star Map","release_year":2021}},"Hologram Projection Pod":{"content":"# Introduction\nThis hologram projection pod also known as HoloNet transceiver or the holopad was produced by a corporation known as Sorosub Corporation.# Section 1\nThis pod is measured three meters in diameter with a holoprojector in the center of the device.

The device was used against the Galactic Republic in order for the Sith to have the upper hand. During the era of the Great Sith War, Exar Kun was the first person to rediscover Yavin 4. In order to activate the device, the Sith would need a source of mass amounts of energy to power it. The Krath would have it target the living Force in order for the device to contain power. The Jedi found out how to defeat this device from fallen Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma returned from the Krath. The final battle that was used with this device in the Great Sith War was fought on Thule, deep in the old territory of the Sith Empire. The Jedi would have an ambush by a Jedi task force, the task force staged an attack on the Reaper with Ulic’s information they could disarm the weapon.

Count Dooku and his personal mercenary, Cydon Prax searched for the Harvester to rebuild the Dark Reaper in order to destroy the Galactic Republic. Eventually the pair found it and Dooku ordered Prax to activate the device, hence destroying a forest on a Kashyyyk moon to test the device's power. To further test its power he planned to use the device on captured wookies, Bera Kazan, and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. Whom he had captured on the planet Raxus Prime. When Dooku activated the device once more, the blast killed off half of the forest on the moon with Anakin and his padawan Ashoka barely escaping after their escape. Anakin and Ashoka warned the Republic of what was to come. After these events, Dooku kept his search, attempting to find pieces of the Dark Reaper across the galaxy.

She was made for self-improvement before being sent into Wild Space among other creations like the Eternal Fleet and the Gemini Droids, with their memory cores locked. This prevented Scorpio from returning to Lokath, hopefully saving the creators. However, this solution only proved to be temporary due to the Old Gods unleashing on the planet leading to the death of all organic life there. Scorpio would drift in space for centuries before being found and used as a weapon in conflicts. After serving as a mindless droid for one and a half centuries, she would gain self-consciousness, seeking rapid experiences to allow her to evolve even further. Sometime after 4500 BBY, she would join with the Star Cabal, a secret society that formed after the great Hyperspace war. She would become a Guardian for Ward 23 on Belsavis, gaining access to the systems of the ward, rare technology for her improvement, and a new body. Once Belsavis became a prison planet, she was still able to continue her work, gaining access to parts of the Prison systems. Scorpio would meet and fight Agent Cipher Nine before accompanying the agent, openly stating her intent to one day kill the Cipher.# Section 1\nDuring her travels with Cipher Nine, she would dissect droids and cyborgs that Nine destroyed, using them as base resources for her chassis and power supply. Over time she would upgrade, continuing to travel with Cipher Nine as it allowed her to witness a lot more than the Imperial Intelligence’s data banks. Through their journeys together, she would change her opinion on the group and their species, even having a desire to observe any offspring they may have. In 3637 BBY, Cipher Nine would go missing early on in the Eternal Empire conquest. After this loss, Scorpio made her way to Zakuul and became the Lady of Sorrows as an information broker. Here, she would keep improving and would learn of the Gemini Droids that commanded the fleets and the fact they resembled her technology. She deemed them inferior copies of herself and began to look for a way to free them from Arcann. This led to her joining up with the Outlander in 3632 BBY, where she helped to enhance parts of the Gravestone. During her time with the Alliance, her suspicions on the Gemini Droids would be confirmed and concluded that the droids were made from one template, Gemini Prime. Scorpio would get the chance to slice through the Gemini Prime and found the droid was not a duplicate of her own code.\n\n# Section 2\nScorpio would take control of the Fleet, leaving a small section under Arcaan’s control, before manipulating her enemies into destroying one another. She attempted to take over the gravestone but was stopped by Koth Vortena. Scorpio attempted to rid both Arcann and the Commander in one go, however, the Commander would defeat Arcann in time and escape the ship’s destruction with Arcann being taken by his mother. With Arcann gone, Scorpio granted all the Gemini free will, some staying with Scorpio and others heading off to explore. Scorpio, with her goal completed she would give the throne over to Vaylin and advise her for months while searching for her own origins. Together, they would take control of the Gravestone before allowing the Commander and the Alliance to gain control of it again, wanting to save the vessel at any cost. This would allow her to get full access to the Gravestone, finding old files, and sending the ship and the Gemini droids to their homeworld, Lokath. Here, she would help the Alliance defeat ARIES, the only self-aware droid left on the planet and upload herself into the planet’s network.\n\n","meta":{"index":56,"author":"Librarian's Assembly","name":"SCORPIO Droid","release_year":2021}},"Cybernetics":{"content":"# Introduction\nCybernetics were any replacement part from internal organs, to limbs.

These individuals who received cybernetics are known as cyborgs. There were two main types of cybernetics, replacements and enhancements. Replacements were artificial units intended to replace a lost limb or organ. Enhancements granted the user new abilities or improved them in one way or another.# Section 1\nCybernetics throughout the galaxy weren’t uncommon. Notable cyborgs within the galaxy were Anakin Skywalker, Luke Skywalker, and even the infamous General Grievous. Anakin Skywalker lost his hand during the first battle of Geonosis. During the battle, he and Obi-Wan-Kenobi dueled Darth Tyranus. Darth Tyranus ended up making easy work of the two, cutting off Anakin’s hand in the process. Luke Skywalker coincidentally lost his hand to Darth Vader during the Bespin duel. General Grievous finally was made into a  cyborg by none other than Darth Tyranus.

Different criminal factions, most notably the Hutts, resulting in stealing their cargo with little to no fear of any interference from the Republic.# Section 1\nHyperspace Beacons have been around as early as 25,100 BBY within the Tion Cluster. The Tionesse developed this technology as well as hyperdrive technology from the Rakata. Beacons recorded hyperspace data in the local vicinity, which was uploaded by starships in the area. Every hyperspace beacon is a considerably large supercomputer in space to make sure that routes are up-to-date and accurate. However, this put limitations on hyperspace travel as each jump had a limited distance that only one could travel to, including each direction. These beacons were maintained by the Republic Spacelane Bureau, with data being reliability available at around 80%.\n\n# Section 2\nWhen the Mandalorian Wars started, hyperspace beacons lost their need. The introduction of navicomputers proved to be way more effective than hyperspace beacons mainly due to its capability of being able to store millions of hyperspace routes as well as restricted navigational data. However, this didn’t make hyperspace travel much easier in some cases with there being very difficult routes to travel. An example being the Tapani Sector, which because of its difficulty to travel to and from, continued to use hyperspace beacons until the rise of the Galactic Empire and even afterwards.\n\n# Section 3\n\n\n# Section 4\n\n\n# Section 5\n\n\n# Section 6\n\n\n","meta":{"index":36,"author":"JerichoJireh","name":"Hyperspace Beacon","release_year":2022}},"Adegan Lens":{"content":"# Introduction\nFollowing the end of the Jedi Civil War, between 3955 BBY and 3951 BBY, conflicts between the remnants of the Sith Empire and the weakening Galactic Republic sprouted in what would become known as the Dark Wars.

Receiving hypergates were capable of being located on origin planets and other worlds. Gate-like hypergates were rumored to be capable of transporting entire starships across the galaxy. They were considered Gree-technology and were therefore revered by the Gree as sacred relics. The Gree long claimed that only Gatemasters were able to activate a hypergate, but this was probably just a cultural bias. A special variant was the Grand Hypergate.# Section 1\nThe hypergates were created a very long time ago by a Sentient species known as the Gree. These gates were constructed all across the space of the Gree Enclave, many of them connecting the myriad of Gree worlds, but only the Gree masters know how these gates were created.

When a Sith strike team located Luke Skywalker, together with his son Ben, they sliced through the thick metal doors to catch Skywalker. Skywalker went to the viewport of the room and attempted to create an escape hole. However, before Skywalker managed to escape, the Sith had Lignan-enhanced lightsabers that cut through the doors much quicker.

Once the Galactic Republic discovered the planet however, they subjugated the planet to their tyranny as they had done many before.# Section 1\nThe Imperial Moff, Kentor Sarne upon reaching the planet with his forces, put in place a different governor which ultimately replaced the Council. This was done against the people’s wishes, and was ultimately used to forward the Moff’s plans of turning all the local factories into war machines that produced speeders for the on-going wars.\n\nThe council was imprisoned which led to many of its members being eroded by both time and the harsh conditions.

However, most of the Senate supported such alterations to the government’s overall structure due to the Separatist Crisis and subsequent Clone Wars, both which threatened to divide the galaxy into two. However, unknown to the Delegation of 2000, Chancellor Palpatine, was a Sith Lord, who plotted to reassert dominance over the Galaxy by overthrowing and warping the Galactic Republic and making sure the Jedi Order didn't exist for future generations. This was successfully done when after Three years of galactic warfare, Palpatine’s position as a public figure was strengthened Allowing for the passing of the Sector Governance Decree, which made entire sectors controlled by a cabal of military governors known as Moffs, and finally after Order 66 took its course, the declaration of himself as Emperor.# Section 1\nMovement with the rebellion got more violent as the Galactic Empire was setting its roots, with the best example being Gizor Dellso, who utilized an abandoned droid factory to create private army of battle droids to revive the Seperatist cause, or the event where Kaminoan cloners, engineered and trained an army of rebel clone troopers to openly rebel against The Empire, sadly however both of theses attempts at rebellion failed. However, in 2 BBY, Darth Vader commanded his then apprentice Starkiller to search the galaxy for various rebels and dissidents who opposed the Galactic empire, requiring them to unite in a single rebellion that would put the empire into a state of Civil War. Two years, later as a result of the Alliance’s victory at Yavin 4, they gained credibility as a legitimate military opponent to the Empire, bringing more confidence to other systems who joined the Alliance openly in the months following the Death Star’s destruction, however, the Alliance could afford to waste no time following its victory at Yavin, relocating to a base temporarily on Thila, whilst setting up a more established based on Hoth, the main setbacks during this time was when Garm Bel Iblis, left the Alliance following a major disagreement, however it was offset by the joining of Borsk Fey’lya and his sizable faction of Bothans.\n\n# Section 2\nFinally, the Alliance suffered a setback when Echo Base, the main base of Operations for Alliance High Command, was discovered by an Imperial probe droid and overrun. In the ensuing battle however, they had to retreat from Hoth entirely, using the ground based Ion cannons to blast holes in the Imperial blockade over the planet. Therefore, as this ends the Rebel Alliance got news that a second Death Star was nearing completion, which forced the Alliance to take their greatest risk and attack the installation before it could become operational, however this risk, was not without its downsides such as the loss of many flagships and destroyers, although in the end of the Rebel Alliance won due to the death of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader with the second Death Stars destruction, causing about a week later the creation of the New Republic.\n\n","meta":{"index":25,"author":"DemshyAlkion","name":"The Rebel Alliance","release_year":2020}},"Medical Corps":{"content":"# Introduction\nIn the Service Corps of the Jedi Order, the Medical Corps is one of the four branches within the Service Corps.

Instead of raw power, they valued technology - for they believed that it was the only power in the Galaxy to rival that of the force. As such, they were slicers (those adept as well as skilled in computing and extracting information from the network within those systems), a profession which was often left to droids. Despite their oddities, they were a tight-knit gang with strong leadership - that being Bolan.# Section 1\nBolan was an eccentric, as was the lot of them, but that didn’t stop him from being any less intelligent. With his guidance, the group has dealt with many customers of the highest regard - such as Darth Zash and the Force-walker Kallig.  However, his intelligent mind could not suppress his greed for technology, which would be to his detriment when he and his gang were caught slicing into the Republic Strategic Information Service's classified records.

Dar’manda would help aid them with their starship in an attack to bring down the Spirit of Vengeance II. In the aftermath, they would flee with a banner of Clan Cadera luckily. Later on though, a member of the Vizla household (Shae Vizla) would land on their homeworld and slaughter half of the Dar’manda members. This is because they wouldn’t tell him the whereabouts of his rivals Heta Kol and in the end, wouldn’t.

While during the Clone Wars they became one of the biggest and one of the most powerful crime families having a large influence in the Outer Rim territories. Although Hutt territories were mostly in the separatist space, they sided with the Galactic Republic due to them having reign over hyperspace lanes.# Section 1\nThe Hutt clan’s highest authority is the Grand Hutt Council, located on Nal Hutta. Hutts in the Council included Jabba the Hutt and leaders of other Hutt clans. As the Hutt Council ruled Nal Hutta, lesser-ranking Hutts who ruled the outer territories were titled “Master of the Hutt Clan”.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring the High Republic era, the Hutt plotted with Lord Isamer, leader of the Directorate, to reduce the influence of the Galactic Republic. However instead of reducing the Galactic Republic’s influence, what happened instead was the Eiram–E'ronoh crisis, which brought down the Directorate. Leaving the Hutts to be the only powerful and influential criminal family. Years later, during the Republic era, Jabba and his fellow Hutts held presence over the podraces on Tatooine. Then when the Separatist crisis came, the Hutts became so powerful, the Galactic Senate was warranted to check the Hutt expansion, crimes, and more.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring the Clone Wars, Hutt's hold over the Outer rims caused the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems to fight over it. As the fight raged on, Hutt space was expanded towards the mid rims. However, as the Republic forces were busy against the Separatists, the local governments in the mid rim were left unprotected against the oppression of the Hutt. With the battle raging about, the Hutt’s gained enemies like the Black Sun and Pyke Syndicate, both considered rivals to the Hutts. Before all of this, near the start of the war, Jabba the Hutt’s son was kidnapped by the Separatists, orchestrated by Sith Lord Dooku. This plot was meant to be the start of the hate between the Jedi Order and the Hutt; however, Dooku’s nemesis, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano successfully returned Jabba the Hutt’s son to him.\n\n# Section 4\nAt the end of the Clone Wars, the Shadow Collective’s leader Darth Maul went to Nal Hutta to convince the Grand Hutt Council to side with him.

It wasn't uncommon for people who had failed to become Jedi to join the Rangers. They completed a full ranger \"scout\" training and were then assigned to a specific sector or Jedi. Some Jedi choose to work with Rangers, where the Jedi are assigned an individual or an entire team of Rangers with whom they were generally familiar. A Jedi ran the same rangers or inquiries repeatedly. Despite their sometimes heavy armament, the public had a positive image of the Rangers, if they were even noticed. They were as committed to peace as the Jedi, with the difference that they had no \"secrets\". They were powers and operated independently. There was no uniform for the Rangers. Instead, they often wore the typical brown leather jacket of the sector's Defense Forces, which they wore off duty. There were five different ranks in this organization, which were; Explorer, people who are in the training phase. Lieutenant, which is an honorary title but without any other benefits. Ranger, individuals who have completed their training and are now a full member. Ranger Captain, Rangers who are ready to be leaders of a troop. Ranger-General, were the leaders of the entire organization.# Section 1\nAbout 600 years before the Clone Wars, the Rangers were founded by Coruscanti Jedi Knight Marus Timpel and the former student and businessman Gotal Kaskutal. Timpel told his friend Gotal that he was frustrated with the Jedi Order's lack of resources, and Kaskutal offered to use funds and his own resources to create an organization to help the Jedi. From this idea, the Antarian Rangers were born. Under Kaskutal's supervision, the Rangers spread to other parts of the galaxy for the next 50 years, establishing divisions for Corellia, Brentaal, the Ruan Star Systems, and Coruscant. The organization soon consisted mostly of people because many core worlds supported it, but non-people in leadership positions were not uncommon. Financially, the Rangers flourished and were almost successful. In wars, the Rangers were less in demand than before or after, leaving many of their divisions inactive, mercenaries or sector defense forces. At the beginning of 22nd VSY, a separatist group called Roshu Sune massacred the Antarian Rangers on Antar IV. The group had infiltrated the organization and was waiting for an attack. After Roshu Sune declared independence from the moon, rangers from across the galaxy, with the help of the Jedi, returned to their headquarters to seek revenge for the attack. When the Clone Wars began abruptly, the Jedi Order, as an Order itself, enlisted the help of the Antarctic Rangers. They weren't prepared for war. At the time, teams of Jedi and Rangers were seen together more often. Several rangers operated alongside Jedi General Rahm Kota and his militia to carry out major attacks. Seven and a half months after the war, Dooku captured Antar IV for the Confederation of Independent Systems, bombed the moon from orbit to decimate the Rangers, and established a base there himself. After the establishment of the Galactic Empire and the execution of Order 66, the Antarian Rangers were on the wanted list of the Empire. Almost all of the Rangers went into hiding. From then on, they held back or organized underground resistance groups. That way, they also made sure that the surviving Jedi were brought to safety. Squad 40, a unit of Imperial commandos within the 501st Stormtrooper Legion, was targeted by Jilam Kester, which Celen intelligence agencies reported. The brigade and police surrounded the house where he was supposed to be hiding. IC-1309 and IC-1136 blew the front door off its hinges, while Ennen and Bry entered from behind. They secured the attic and also the rooms in the basement until there was only one room left. Jedi General Iri Camas. The Jedi confronted the commandos and killed Bry with his lightsaber. IC-1136 then detonated a gas line and burned the Jedi. Around 19 VSY, a group of rangers hid in Toprawa, from where they reorganized and supported the Whip resistance group and the Jedi Jax Pavan, which were later allegedly destroyed by the Empire.

With the Emperor finally dead, and the Sith extinct, for the time being, factionalism overcame the Empire as it fractured into fiefdoms led by leftover Moffs and Admirals from the Empire. Many of which had ignored Grand Vizier Mas Amedda's claim to authority.\n\n# Section 2\nHowever his reign was short-lived after being killed in 4ABY. An example of the Galactic Empire's fearsome power was the newly constructed Death Star. It is named Death Star as the major weapon that the battle station (Approximately the size of a remote moon.) contained was powered by Kyber Crystals that the Emperor had his forces mine from ruined Jedi Temples, and the caves on Ilum. Once the battlestation reached fully operational, this 'Weapon of mass destruction' had the fire power to blow up an entire planet, which is where it's name came from, 'Death Star'. However, both Death Stars were destroyed by the Rebel Alliance shortly after becoming operational. Once the Death Star was destroyed for the second time, the Empire was rendered powerless, and more people began rebelling against the one great Galactic Empire, ultimately resulting in the Empire's demise.\n\n# Section 3\nThe largest Imperial remnant of the Empire was publicly led by Grand Admiral Rae Sloane, and covertly ruled by Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax and his Shadow Council. Fast foward some time, and Rax seized control over the largest faction of the Imperial Navy, after taking away Sloane's power, he become essentially the acting-Emperor through his position as Counselor to the Empire Under his command, they made their final stand at the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY, however they lost to the New Republic. Several holdouts continued to resist, the Empire formally capitulated to the New Republic with the signing of the Galactic Concordance. During this new Era of prosperity and hope, war reparations and treaties reduced the Empire to mere ash, with a substantial amount of the what was left of the Empire's army forced to stay within a specific border of the Core and Inner Rim, making them unable to access the Outer Rim, agreeing to punitive stipulations, whilst the other half of their forces remained in a war state with the New Republic. One time they used to be in control, now they're seen as the rebels, rebel cells if that. Eventually, the New Republic established enough forces and created a massive military force. However, most were not aware that there were Sith loyalists that secretly worshipped Emperor Palpatine within their ranks.\n\n","meta":{"index":14,"author":"UnTw1sted","name":"The Galactic Empire","release_year":2020}},"Incom Corporation":{"content":"# Introduction\nIncom Corporation was an organization known for manufacturing starships for the galaxy.

Within the High Republic Era, they would begin to gain more influence and interest as they created ships such as the Z-24 Buzzbug and Z-28 Skywing. Incom would grow prominence more and more until the end years of the Galactic Republic due to their creation of the Z-95 Headhunter, a starfighter which was very durable and had multiple purposes. As the Clone Wars became more of a danger, it would produce many varieties and styles of the Headhunter so it could provide use for the Republic Navy and many other divisions. During the time of the Galactic Empire, the corporation would develop snowspeeders for the Rebel Alliance so travel and battles would be easier on Hoth. An example of one of these ships was the T-47 airspeeder. However, Incom had a better notable product called the T-65B X-wing starfighter and was used at the service of the Rebel Alliance. They would create it based on the Clone Wars era ships. The T-65B was for the Rebel Alliance organization only and was fielded by them also throughout the Galactic Civil War against the Empire.

Even they however, faced a multitude of challenges from criminal organisations. They eventually drove these criminals offworld, but 1 millennium later House Praji reconquered Kaikielius during Operation Shadow Hand.\n\nThe Vahali were driven offworld, and constructed a new powerhouse on the planet of Denon. This is all that is currently documented.# Section 1\nHouse Vahali is an elitist group of individuals descended from the original colonists of Kaikielius. Despite being related to House Praji and House Juoni, who also descended from these colonists, the three rivalled for many years. This was due to ideological disputes, though records do not specify the exact details.\n\nThese (3) families were amongst many competing for dominance, but were the most prominent and thus are the only ones mentioned in Kaikieliun history. These families collectively absorbed lesser families to increase their respective influence and by extension compete with each other.\n\nHouse Juonli fell away from the triad of (3) as it had over-involved itself in the First Alsakan conflict. It had exhausted it’s resources, and it’s forces leaving it unable to defend itself from the other (2) families. Following this, House Praji and House Vahali targeted each other knowing the survivor would crown the entire planet. This conflict disallowed Kaikielius from uniting and trumping the Koros world, which they were in a war with at the time.\n\n# Section 2\nKaikielius as a whole, benefitted though as they began heavy industrialisation and urbanisation to compete with their rival world. This however, led to the world falling into the scope of the Hutts who rained down on the planet with criminal activities which damaged both houses.\n\n\nThe Praji family eventually abandoned the conflict with Vahali and were unable to compete with them and the Hutt. This left the entire planet to Vahali who began operations to squash the criminal organisations. This lasted over (60) years and drained the resources of the Vahali, who now sought the help of the Republic.\n\nHowever, Emppu Praji-Barck who headed the Praji family, had been in Coruscant foreign affairs for many years by this point and enacted revenge by preventing reinforcements from coming to Vahali’s aid.\n\nHe further amplified the damage by purchasing supplies for Hutt organisations on Kaikielius making it very difficult for the Vahali to contain them. The Republic, seeing this, did eventually override Emppu and begin sending reinforcements to help. This “Kaikieli Reconquista” included Padawan Derrica Praji who led the reinforcement groups. She unknowingly aided the defeat of the Praji-funded Hutt as she was not aware of Emppu’s plot.\n\n# Section 3\nThousands of years later, following the growth and success of House Vahali, to the disappointment of House Praji, Operation Shadow Hand was executed. In 10 ABY Nahdonnis Praji led an assault on the orbital skyhook (House Vahali headquarters) which consequently destroyed it.\n\nThis sent House Vahali into poverty, who had placed all their eggs in one place.

Then by 27,500 BBY, the colonists that boarded the ships arrived on many planets and Alderaan was one of the many planets that were founded. Organa ancestors were one of the first to settle in that new world and were one of few families to be a big contributor to the formation of the Galactic Republic some 2,500 years later. In the future, Founding Day would be celebrated to honor and remember the House of Organa. With the upcoming society on the planet, the Alderaan families opted for a ruling monarch family that would be chosen among the nobles. Organa is but one of the noble bloodlines along with House Panteer, House Ulgo, and House Alde but instead of having them on their side, they chose smaller nobles to have under their protection in exchange for support.\n\n# Section 2\nDespite the image of the Organa family being honorable, in their history, they haven’t always been honorable.

House Organa also later put a price on the assassin Selven’s head to hopefully tie up loose ends. Then during the Great Galactic War, the Organa family stayed loyal to the Republic believing in more patient negotiation than violence and aggression. A similar situation was when Senator and Crown Prince Gaul Panteer announced the Alderaan's independence, shocking its residents.

They were known for their outfits that concealed the majority of their bodies. The sorcerers were skilled in deception, illusions, and shape-shifting. They were mainly known for being sighted on Tund and were also known to delve into Force explorations that drove them insane.# Section 1\nThe secretive group was established on Tund after the Great Hyperspace War. Originally, the group consisted of banished pure-blood Sith priests, and rumors started to spread that the descendants of the pure-blood Sith had been exiled from Korriban. The secret pure-blood society combined science, ontology, and magic. The Rakatan also convinced them that all sentients were Force-sensitives, thus leading them to declare that the omnipresence of the Force was what shed light on the deception of dualities and multiplicity.\n\n# Section 2\nJedi from earlier generations viewed the sorcerers as another dark side Force group, like Jal Shey or Zeishon Sha. However, a reign of terror led by Karnak Tetsu took place soon after the restoration. Tetsu was the leader of the Sorcerers of Tund following the Great Sith War. The Jedi Order attempted to convert the sorcerers by convincing them to use the Force without any of their magic and mysticism. Their attempts were in vain, and the Jedi later tasked themselves with making sure that the sorcerers did not fall to the dark side. The sorcerers were uncommunicative when it came to accepting outlanders and believed that only true Sith could handle the truth they knew and respected. However, there was one occasion where they accepted the remaining Massaassi and Kissai that descended from outcasts that were like them.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring the fall of the Galactic Republic, several instances arose where the Jedi were forced to stop their surveillance of the sorcerers. Darth Sidious did not see any use in recruiting the sorcerers since he believed the Imperial Navy could handle Tund independently. In 22 BBY, a man by the name of Adler Roty claimed that he was a part of the Sorcerers of Tund. However, the last known member of the group was Rokur Gepta, who learned the secrets of the sorcerers’ power and later created some of his own. When he felt he had nothing left to learn, he killed the sorcerers and all remaining life on the planet using his electromagnetic torpedo.

The Horizon Guard’s ranks were handpicked by the Empress, and were made after her brother, Eternal Emperor Arcann, was defeated by the Alliance Commander, the Outlander. The Horizon Guards’ primary weapons were lightsaber pikes and lightsabers. Their armor: black and grey; however, there was a white variation as well. The Horizon Guard lived by their unofficial motto, \"I serve for life, but I don't serve for long.\" Servitude in the Horizon Guard was a blessing and a curse because, while in the guard, you were subject to Vaylin’s unstable temper.# Section 1\nSeeking revenge against her mother, Eternal Empress Vaylin commanded the Horizon Guard from the Spire on Zakuul. From the Spire, she ordered various Horizon Guards to lead the invasion of Voss by probing and torching the planet behind them. She also requested they report any advancements of the invasion to her. Within the invasion, sky troopers and Horizon Guards raided the Tower of Prophecy, an improvised command center, causing buildings to crumble and fires to develop throughout the capital, but later on, were defeated by the Alliance Commander and their associates.\n\nAfter their defeat, Eternal Empress Vaylin and SCORPIO, an AI who believed the technology was stolen, led another fleet to invade and seize the Gravestone, one of the Alliance’s ships; however, this mission was more successful. Empress Vaylin and SCORPIO, accompanied by a force of the Horizon Guard boarded a civilian vessel and pretended to flee from Eternal Empire ships. During the act, SCORPIO sent an SOS, crying for help from the acting Eternal Empire ships, and was answered by the Captain, Koth Vortena. In response, the Gravestone shot down the pursuing Empire ships and offered the disguised Horizon Guards permission to board the Gravestone, allowing the Horizon Guard to capture the captain’s crew and seize the ship. Captain Koth Vortena alerted the Alliance about the invasion, asking for support. After support from the Alliance had arrived, two Horizon Guards, Tragus Rova and Vella Zarkot, attempted to obstruct the Alliance Commander and his vessel from rescuing the captain and his ship but were both vanquished by the Outlander, and, after many other events unfolded, the Alliance eventually got their ship back from the Eternal Empress.\n\nAt the Grand Festival of Empress Vaylin, a luxurious party thrown by the Emperor herself to celebrate her prestige, the Horizon Guard was assigned strategic points to guard within the Palace of the Eternal Dragon. Meanwhile, the Commander, Arcann, and his allies had a plan to invade the party to stop the Eternal Empress. The Horizon Guard sparred against the enemies, while the Empress attempted to escape. After some time defending the Eternal Empress, she finally was able to escape to Nathema using her flagship, in an effort to remove her mental conditioning, a condition that compelled her to her knees, making her powerless, whenever she used the Force. On Nathema, the Horizon Guard was commanded to defend Vaylin while she tried to remove her mental conditioning; nevertheless, the Alliance Commander and Lana Beniko assassinated them, trying to stop Vaylin from getting the conditioning removed. Vaylin, finally, successfully got the conditioning removed and initiated an assault on Odessen, the capital of the Eternal Alliance, with the Horizon Guard, including Imperator Sunfell, helping on the front lines. In Odessen, they escorted the Empress and her prisoner to the Alliance base to face the Commander, which later led to the Guards and Vaylin’s expiration.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter Vaylin was executed and the Eternal Empire fell, the remaining guards immigrated throughout the galaxy. Sterla, former Horizon Guard Scout Captain, joined Tasser, Battalion Commander, to aid in constructing a new Star Fortress on Rakata Prime, but were halted by the Eternal Alliance, as usual. Vinn Atrius, a former Horizon Guard member began a campaign in 3629 BBY, the Order of Zildrog Campaign, a chain of attacks against the Eternal Alliance. They attempted this with Zildrog, an early superweapon from Iokath. These attacks were eventually stopped in 3628 BBY as Theron Shan, the Alliance’s intelligence officer, intruded on the order and allowed the Commander to track down him on Nathema and detain him.\n\nYears after, in 3626 BBY, the Alliance Commander and several others boarded a ship with Satele Shan and several of her students, who had Tenebrae’s curse, a curse that was released into the air after the Commander released the spirit of Valkorian out of his head, a dark side entity who manipulated galactic affairs for 1500 years, which released a trap Valkorian had laid, a Sith ritual, which caused comas and nightmares. Anyone with the curse became part of one shared mind, a hive mind. The Alliance Commander entered Shan’s mind where Tenebrae was located.

In fact, you may have noticed the similarity between their name and a Lightsaber form used within the Order - this is because Jedi Master Mace Windu developed that very form from inspecting how the vaapad use swift and deadly strikes to overwhelm their prey. However, apart from this deadly advisory, little could stop the planet from becoming the perfect energy source for galactic governments across the ages. As a consequence, towering laser drills were built into the planet to garner its wealth and there were many operations to utilize the constant volcanic activity on the planet, including energy collectors that would tap into and harvest the various lava flows spread across the planet for energy.  Even Count Dooku estimated “that during the later years of the Republic, Sarapin provided 80 percent of the Core Worlds' power”. There was much need for its resources, so much so that there was even a space station built above it to collect the resources obtained and store them until off-world shipping. However, due to this demand, there were many attempts to control the planet and, as a consequence, it had to be shielded by a near-impenetrable defense grid. This only faltered two times -  by a Confederacy of Independent Systems General in 22 BBY and when Rebel forces infiltrated the planet before the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY. Both times the attacks were repelled, showing just how valuable the planet was to display such military might for it.","meta":{"index":35,"author":"NebulanStrider","name":"Sarapin","release_year":2021}},"Havoc Squad":{"content":"# Introduction\nHavoc Squad was originally known as infantry squad 326. Havoc Squad would soon earn its reputation as well as its name while being under the command of commander Jace Malcom. It was created during the Great Galactic War, which lasted from 3681 BBY-3653 BBY. Havoc Squad was attached to a larger infantry division within the army, operated mostly independently, and specialized in irregular warfare.# Section 1\nIn 3667 BBY, Havoc Squad was stationed in the peaceful war, the folder where they rested from their tours in the frontlines across the galaxy. While they were there, the Sith Empire invaded. The Sith were unaware Republic troopers were hiding in the forests of Alderaan. While the Empire marched towards the capital, they were attacked by Havoc Squad. The Squad considered their attack a suicide mission but fought anyway. At first, it was successful, even against Sith warriors. But eventually, they were overwhelmed, and in a dire situation. If not for the Jedi Knight Satele Shan, Havoc Squad would have been completely wiped out. The presence of the Jedi lifted their morale and eventually led them to win this battle. The squad would eventually fall to the command of Harron Tavus while Jace rose through higher ranks of the Republic Military.\n\n# Section 2\nAt one point Havoc Squad was sent to Ando Prime, where they encountered more Imperial troops than expected and were forced to retreat. They called for extraction, which was rejected by the senate because it was an unauthorized mission formed by general Garza. They managed to escape the planet in an Imperial Shuttle. The incident left a dark scar on the team with many of its members believing that they were betrayed by the Republic. This led them to plan to defect from the Republic while they were stationed on Ord Mantell around the time of the Separatist War.  They were tasked with recovering a stolen ZR-57 orbital strike bomb. During the mission, they were accompanied by their newest recruit, Meteor, who was unaware of their plans to defect. He was asked to join them, but he refused. As the others escaped with the bomb and left the Republic, Meteor became the new leader of the Havoc Squad, since he was the only member left. He started to recruit new members for the team, starting with Aric Jorgan.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring the Cold War, the new Havoc Squad would hunt down the members that defected one by one. At some point, they were assigned to stop the Imperials super weapon, called the Gauntlet, which was a modified carrier class dreadnought with a hyperspace cannon. They were supposed to stop the weapon with the help of their newest recruit. They were able to destroy the weapon but with heavy casualties. Havoc Squad commander Meteor disappeared, which caused the entire squad to go their separate ways. This left only Aric Jorgan, who was promoted to major. He then rejuvenated the squad with new recruits during the Great Galactic War. Havoc Squad members used one of the best armor styles in the entire Old Republic Era, the red and white Republic's Special Forces armor. They were always heavily armed with everything they needed at any given point. Their armor was replaced by white and orange armor during the Cold War.\n\n","meta":{"index":81,"author":"ViperPanik","name":"Havoc Squad","release_year":2021}},"The Shadow Collective":{"content":"# Introduction\nA large alliance made of mostly criminal factions, the Shadow Collective was founded by Darth Maul, the former apprentice of Darth Sidious, the rival of his former master. Maul’s plans were to compete with Sidious to gain power across the galaxy. With ambitious goals to defeat both of Sidious’ puppets during the Clone Wars, The Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems. Rallying under his banner, Maul had significant forces under his control. Forces of the Death Watch, Black Sun, Pike Syndicate, Hutt Clans, and the Nightbrothers formed the majority of power within the Collective.# Section 1\nDarth Maul and his brother Savage Opress had been stranded in space after a skirmish on Florrum, where they were later found by Pre Vizsla, the leader of Death Watch. This would later lead to the mutual relationship between Maul and Vizsla, where Maul could help Pre Vizsla in exchange for getting revenge on Obi-Wan Kenobi. This later led to Maul explaining the ambitions to Vizsla, where they ended up gathering allies to help them achieve their plan, with the first step recruiting the Black Sun criminal organization. Which the Black Sun agreed to by its de-facto leader, only after all of its leaders were killed by Opress. The next organization led by Lom Pyke shortly joined after, after stating that he didn’t wish to oppose the organization. Maul, Vizsla, and Opress traveled to Nal Hutta to meet with the Grand Hutt Council to bring them into the alliance’s fold, however, the Hutts were prepared for this and hired a team of bounty hunters to eliminate them, which ended in failure. Eventually taking over the Hutts’ resources after learning the location of other council members on Tatooine, specifically within Jabba’s Palace.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter the Collective’s alliance was fully formed with the entire criminal underworld firmly within Maul’s control, he went to Vizsla’s side of the deal. After picking out targets and making the Death Watch look like heroes of Mandalore instead of terrorists. The Shadow Collective as a whole led an attack on the city of Sundari, the capital of Mandalore. Vizsla and Death Watch saved the capital from the Shadow Collective, which was all a ruse for Satine to be captured and with the full support of the population, declared himself to be Mand’alor. Vizsla betrayed Maul and Opress, by throwing them in prison publically. However, they were freed and with the guidance of Satine, they learned the locations of the remaining political leaders; they approached former Prime Minister Almec. He was the only politician left outside of Satine herself that did not side with Vizsla. Maul used Almec as a puppet leader of Mandalore, as he challenged Pre Vizsla to a duel for the leadership of Mandalore. Which Maul had won with relative ease, being a Sith Lord. Executing Pre Vizsla, the coup was successful, but Bo-Katan and the Nite Owls fled and started a resistance against Maul.\n\n# Section 3\nHowever, these acts didn’t go completely off the radar for some. While the Republic’s attention was drawn to the Clone Wars, Darth Sidious saw that his former pupil was a threat. Traveling to Mandalore to confront Maul himself. Darth Maul, with Savage Opress, began to duel against Sidious, who was much more skilled with the blade as well as the Force than the two brothers. This lead to Opress’s death and the capture of Maul. The Hutts abandoned the Collective altogether after this event, however, both the Pykes and Black Sun remained loyal while Darth Sidious tortured Maul in a prison called the Spire on the planet Stygeon Prime; he was also tortured by Count Dooku. Then two Mandalorian commandos who were ordered by Almec broke into the prison and rescued Maul, returning to Zanbar. Collective forces then were attacked by the Confederacy, specifically when General Grievous attacked Zanbarr killing many Mandalorians as Maul escaped with the few Mandalorians remaining. The Confederacy attacked Ord Mantell City, Vizsla's Keep 09, and the Nightsisters. They killed Mother Talzin, weakening the Shadow Collective and with the fall of the Shadow Collective, Maul also had no power backing him up. He no longer became a threat.\n\n# Section 4\nThe Shadow Collective fell apart after Darth Maul was captured by Ahsoka Tano shortly before Order 66 began. With the Siege of Mandalore being the end to his power and reign over Mandalore. However, Maul survived Order 66 and escaped capture by Ahsoka Tano. He led the Crimson Dawn after the end of the war, but he didn’t reveal himself as the true leader of the criminal organization, instead, he relied on a puppet, Dryden Vos, and then later Qi’ra to lead the group. With the Crimson Dawn being the successor to the Shadow Collective itself.\n\n","meta":{"index":5,"author":"JerichoJireh","name":"The Shadow Collective","release_year":2021}},"Baran Do":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Baran Do was an ancient Force organization that resided on the planet, Dorin. Most Kel Dors would say it was a tradition instead, as it was developed more than a thousand years ago before they joined the Republic. Their recruitment was often provided by Kel Dor families, who would send their children to train with them. Members that were part of this sect were usually referred to as sages, often acting as advisors and seers to the leaders of the planet's society.\n\nThe Sages were renowned for their precognition skills, allowing them to launch early evacuation in the case of natural disasters on their planet. Often, Baran Do sages would take up government positions due to it.# Section 1\nThe philosophy of the Baran Do sages was centered around finding peace and calm, and they should grow closer to the Force by heeding it. While they would often spend a great deal of time in meditation due to it, many people saw this as a reluctance to act instead. However, in truth, they were waiting for the precise and perfect moment to strike and act in accordance with the Force, as they were against rash actions.\n\nUnlike the Jedi Order, the Baran Do were not that militant at all. They did not wield lightsabers and such, nor were they required to be trained as they were skilled in the Force.

Though they wouldn’t end up leading military forces or fighting galactic-scale battles, they were able to root themselves down in society to better the livelihood of those in need. The Corps also worked hand in hand with the Republic Agricultural Administration, ensuring that those in underdeveloped systems or planets in strife and suffering from famine would not die off - offering much-needed assistance and aid.# Section 1\nMany within the junior positions of the Corps thought of this as a lower placement, a demotion and an insult to them, preferring the life of dueling and study of the saber as opposed to research and growth. However, most were lifetime members, some subsections of the Corps giving an array of jobs and duties one could attend to, such as geology. A multitude of facilities were constructed on a number of planets to assist in the development and logging of agricultural findings. Those more indebted to the AgriCorps saw the opportunity to train with the Living Force, aiding directly in the increased and rapid growth of plants, one of these being consitor sato - or “plant surge”.\n\n# Section 2\nThis lasted up to the years of the Great Jedi Purge in 19BBY, where the Republic fell and the Galactic Empire rose to power. Those who did not fall during the purge were transferred and trialed into the Dark Jedi within the Empire, though still remaining within a lesser known and not well documented version of the AgriCorps. During the fall of the Empire however, it was completely dissolved and was no longer headed by any Agricultural Jedi Masters.

They would lurk on the planet Annoo,  and would hold control of legitimate imports and exports so that they could kidnap and smuggle weapons. Being led by Sise Fromm with his assistant Vlix Oncard, they would rely on clone guards during the early Empire due to Sise wanting organic muscle. Though his son Tig Fromm, would later persuade him to invest in wild power gambles for powerful weapons such as the satellite, Trigon One. However, the satellite was soon stolen by Thall Joben, Jord Dusat and Kea Moll. The reason being that it was on the behalf of the Resistance's foundation on their planet. For revenge, Sise Fromm would secretly kidnap Dusat and Moll’s mother. Joben would later find out and reveal where it had been hidden for their release. Tig would go to retrieve the satellite but instead Joben and R2-D2 would interfere with the guidance system. Ending up with Trigon One colliding with Sise’s stronghold, Jabba the Hutt would decide to place a money-worth credit on the leader of the Fromm Gang. Boba Fett would turn this bounty in while Tig, Sise and Vlix Oncard tried to get revenge on Joben by competing in a Boonta Speeder Race. Eventually, the lot was freed by Jabba’s grasp via the crime family’s bribe they offered him.

Many meetings ended in death, however some weaker of the Sith joined Forces with the Blazing Chain. As such, many more Force sensitive individuals were in this organization. They painted a red chain on the side of their ships as it struck fear into civilians. In 33 BBY, one of the adacaps, Zonsoe, and his fleet, the Blackshackle, fell to the dark side and became conquerors. They destroyed the fleet Arcblade, launching a 5 year civil war in the group. Eventually, the Blackshackle fleet fell but it left the rest of the Blazing Chain very weak, until the Battle of Yavin.

It was composed of interconnected supremacists and was overseen by a hierarchy of Chiss families. The Nine Ruling Families held the highest command, followed by the Forty Great Houses and other families with less prestige. The history of the Ascendancy dated back thousands of years, but due to its noninterference policy, it seldom involved itself in external crises. The Ascendancy strictly forbids preemptive strikes and mainly focuses on research and exploration. It discovered an obscure threat in the Unknown Regions, and saw the Galactic Empire as a potential ally or target for the threat instead of itself.# Section 1\nThe Chiss Ascendancy was led by the Nine Ruling Families, with the mid-level members known as the Aristocra. These members formed the governmental ranking and bureaucracy of the Chiss, known as the Chiss Syndicure. They held parliamentary power and jurisdiction within the Ascendancy, with their parliament derived from the ruling families. The capital city of the Chiss Ascendancy was Csaplar, where the Assembly Cupola and Convocate Hall were located.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Chiss Ascendancy’s military consisted of the Chiss Defense Force and the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet. The Defense Force held responsibility for the defense of Chiss territory. The Expansionary Defense Fleet was tasked with patrolling the Chaos and assessing potential threats. Family fleets operated as planetary defense forces in regions where specific Chiss families held influence. The Defense Hierarchy Council managed all operations of the Defense Fleet and had the authority to exile traitors. The fleet used various starships, including shuttles and warships. The Chiss also had Force-sensitive navigators called Ozyly-esehembo, or “sky-walkers.” They were part of a special corps that was responsible for the navigation of difficult regions in the Unknown Regions. Sky-walkers were usually young Chiss girls with Force abilities.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Chiss Ascendancy adopted an orderly approach to galactic affairs, emphasizing non-intervention, peaceful diplomacy, and strict adherence to laws prohibiting preemptive strikes. Conquest and aggressive imperialism were disregarded, and military policy focused on defense against external threats instead of initiating conflict. The Ascendancy maintained a rigid stance and almost never involved itself in external affairs. When engaging with other factions, the Chiss displayed a benign approach, but exercised caution to protect the secrets of Chiss Space. Relations with other nations in the Unknown regions were very limited. However, the Ascendancy sometimes sent emissaries to observe large-scale wars and assess galactic geologies. While the Chiss aided refugees, they declined requests for settlement. The Ascendancy pursued exploration and research beyond their borders, discovering threats to the Chiss species.\n\n# Section 4\nThe Chiss Ascendancy embraced a philosophy of experimentation and strict non-intervention, as they considered themselves a beacon of security, culture, and order in comparison to the chaotic Unknown Regions. The Chiss placed a high value on education and employed a “wandering year” tradition for young individuals to explore their goals and talents. The Chiss displayed haughtiness towards other species in the region and considered themselves superior. Their language was Cheunh, written in Cheunh script, and they used trade languages like Minnisiat, Taarja, and Sy Bisti to communicate with outsiders. Political and social structures revolved around family structures, with Ruling Families, Great Families and lesser families vying for influence. Loyalty within families often impacted military decisions, regardless of protocol. Chiss names were composed of three parts, with the core name being a combination of these parts. The secrets of Second and Third Sights, Chiss navigators known as ozyly-esehembo, were closely monitored. The Ascendancy did not trust humans, but did recognize their value. While the Chiss did not maintain major relations with nearby nations, they did not view them as either allies or equals.\n\n# Section 5\nIn 5100 BBY, the Chiss Great Families were united under the Stybla family. The Ascendancy gained strength and became legendary within the Unknown Regions. In 5019 BBY, the Chiss started exploring outside their territory and discovered an ancient superweapon by the name of Starflash. In 4300 BBY, a war forced the Chiss to use Starflash, which inadvertently affected Csilla’s sun and made the planet uninhabitable. This led to a secret migration of Chiss to colony planets, while Csilla’s population went underground. Later, the Chiss participated in the Sith Wars but retreated to their borders, as they considered their investments in the wider galaxy misguided. The Stybla family discovered a second Starflash weapon, which was kept hidden on Sposia. The Chiss kept records of battles against the Grysk Hegemony, including some observations. Over time, the number of ruling families decreased, and by the time of the Clone Wars, there were just Nine Ruling Families in the Ascendancy.\n\n# Section 6\nBefore the Nikardun conquests, the Chiss Defense Force focused on the defense of their territory within the Ascendancy. However, they wanted a larger mandate and stronger capabilities. To grant their wishes, the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet was created to protect Chiss interests beyond their borders. This led to the recruitment of a young Chiss named Kivu'raw'nuru. The Ascendancy was initially disinterested in friendly diplomatic relations with other nations in the Chaos. Junior Commander Thrawn proposed a movement against Lioaoin pirates, but was instructed to differentiate between “hostiles and neutrals'' instead of “hostiles and friendlies.” Later, the Ascendancy launched operations against Vagaari pirates, which were successful militarily. However, they caused political turmoil due to the death of Syndic Mitth'ras'safis. This displeased the Aristocra and Supreme Admiral Ja’fosk.\n\n# Section 7\nDuring the Nikardun conquests, the Chiss Ascendancy’s capital, Csilla, was attacked by the Paataatus. This was orchestrated by General Yiv of the Nikardun Destiny. However, Admiral Ar’alani launched a counterattack on the homeworld of the Paataatus. The involvement of Senior Captain Thrawn stopped Yiv’s plans. Thrawn sought assistance from Jedi General Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars, however, found the Republic unsuited for an alliance. Thrawn and the other Chiss were able to outsmart the Nikardun forces and capture Yiv. The Chiss Defense Force then started movements to eradicate the remaining Nikardun remnants.\n\n# Section 8\nAfter the Nikardun conquests, the Grysk, a mysterious enemy, started manipulating the internal conflicts between the Chiss families in an attempt to start a civil war within the Ascendancy. The Grysk operative Jixtus and his agent Haplif set up plots on diverse Chiss planets, manipulating the Pommrio, Xodlax, and Erighal families into conflicts over a suspected nyix mine. However, Senior Captains Thrawn and Lakinda stepped in, preventing all-out war and destroying the nyix mine.\n\n# Section 9\nThrawn was tasked by the Ascendancy to explore the Outer Rim Territories and evaluate a potential alliance with the Galactic Empire against the Grysk Hegemony. He faked exile on a planet in Wild Space to gain the Empire’s attention. Thrawn was taken into custody and brought before Emperor Palpatine on Coruscant. Thrawn became the Emperor’s advisor on threats in the Unknown Regions but kept Chiss territory a secret. He was later promoted to Grand Admiral and, together with the Empire, engaged in conflicts against the Crysk Forces. The Ascendancy and the Empire formed an uneasy alliance to fight the Grysk. Thrawn and other Chiss helped rescue Chiss children from the Grysk and warned the Empire of the impending threat. However, Thrawn and Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger were taken away during a rebellion on the planet of Lothal by Purrgil creatures.\n\n","meta":{"index":87,"author":"Galaxy_Magma","name":"Chiss Ascendancy","release_year":2021}},"Trade Federation of Planets":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Trade Federation of Planets was an organisation that formed into a shipping corporation, it was founded in 350 BBY. Its main goal at the beginning was to solve any arguments or issues between other shipping companies. As time went by, the Trade Federation of Planets, or more commonly known as the Trade Federation, had grown immensely into a powerful and popular trading corporation. This allowed the Trade Federation to form its own Trade Federation Merchant Fleet. While the Trade Federation continued to take over the major trade routes and worlds, it also had made a deal with the Techno Union for a private droid army in order to defend its properties and to maintain power over certain star systems.# Section 1\nAt one point species known as Nemoidians began quickly increasing in numbers in the Trade Federation. Sometime after, the Federation began targeting their own worlds and clients out of dissatisfaction. However, they did not know that the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, had manipulated the leader of the Federation, Viceroy Nute Gunray. All of this was part of the Sith Lord’s plan to start a war between the Galactic Republic and the Separatist Alliance. Eventually many major corporations and organisations joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems, including the Trade Federation.\n\n# Section 2\nAlthough the Federation kept claiming to the Galactic Senate that they had always been neutral and still were. However, they were secretly working for the Separatist Alliance. The Federation’s forces were used in various missions to weaken the Republic by taking part in kidnappings, infiltrations, and military-tech deliveries. At the end of the war, the leader of the Federation, Nute Gunray met his end along with the other Separatist leaders on Mustafar after being betrayed by Darth Sidious.

The Galactic Outdoor Survival School, otherwise known as GOSS was founded on Thrantin. Throntin was a planet in the Colonies region of space that was terraformed to fit the school’s needs of having different types of environments for different survival situations.# Section 1\nThe Galactic Outdoor Survival School is a school dedicated to the cause of survival, whilst not having any official backing from the Galactic Empire or Rebel Alliance. This didn’t have any impact on the quality of the school. GOSS has trained some of the best survivalists outside of military institutions, even surpassing those with different cases. One class, Summit Class, had surpassed every other class GOSS had, breaking many records. A class even broke Summit’s own records, the Twilight Class. One of these students was offered a position by GOSS as an instructor, who refused to follow his fellow classmates and joined the Rebellion. Many students had become scouts for both sides of the conflict during the Galactic Civil War, with few cases going into the private sector and ignoring the war, despite the dislike of the Rebellion from the school's dean and headmaster.\n\n# Section 2\nSurvival skills that students trained depended on the person’s origin. Especially when it came to physiology of different species, such as Devaronians who’s home world is the temperate planet of Devaron. GOSS may train a Devaronian in a more extreme climate such as a dry desert or frozen tundras.

The start of the Clone Wars not only saw these traditions brought to the forefront but also codified, and the Republic Navy grew in a matter of weeks to be as proud and strong as it had been during the wars of old.\n           When the Grand Army of the Republic was designed on Kamino, the Navy was generally considered a lesser concern, but nonetheless received an assortment of assault ships custom-produced for the GAR, chiefly the Acclamator-class Assault Ship. But when the Clone Wars began the Navy quickly became vastly more important to combat the warships deployed by the Separatists. Officers were recruited or funneled in from the PSFs, and clone gunners and naval officers eventually were supplemented by eager recruits.# Section 1\nOn a larger scale, the Republic also received a wide variety of new ship designs. Kuat Drive Yards’ new Star Destroyers, the first of which was named Venator-class, became the backbone of the Republic Navy, especially when new models entered production in the war’s final year. While the Republic did not share its successor’s taste for massive dreadnaughts, it did also develop the Praetor-class Battleship and the Mandator II-class Star Dreadnought in the war’s second half, though both designs saw limited action. The Republic Navy was organized as follows.\n\n# Section 2\nElement - A single warship, commanded by a captain - or, rarely, a Jedi Commander. \nSection - Groups of warships under the command either of the most experienced captain or a Jedi Commander. Sections had two variants: lines of three or four vessels for larger warships, like Star Destroyers, and flotillas of 6-12 vessels for frigates.\nSquadron - Four sections (16-36 warships), commanded by a Commodore or Jedi General. The component sections of a squadron were arranged in a manner so as to serve distinct roles, such as escort or carrier roles.\nBattle Group - Battle groups had two variants: one with two squadrons for single engagements, and one with four for larger-scale engagements, totalling 48-72 warships. Battle groups were commanded by Admirals or Jedi Generals.\nFleet - The largest practical unit, fleets were led by Fleet Admirals and consisted of three to six battle groups, to a total of one to three hundred warships. Fleets were usually assigned to campaigns, and would split into smaller units for individual objectives.\nArmada - Theater units similar to smaller-scale Systems Armies, Armadas contained anywhere between ten and fifty fleets depending on the key theater to which they were assigned, and numbered one to five thousand warships. There were ten Armadas total, each assigned to a High Jedi General, though not all fleets were part of an armada.\n\n# Section 3\nRepublic Navy - The Republic Navy was under the overall command of the Commander in Chief, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, and consisted of one hundred thousand total warships on average, divided into untold numbers of fleets and armadas.\n\n           Separate from but closely affiliated with the Republic Navy was the Republic Starfighter Corps, which was equipped with all manner of starfighters for a variety of missions. Mostly consisting of clone pilots, the starfighter corps was a powerful resource at the Republic’s disposal, though in the first months of the war it was badly underdeveloped. The Starfighter Corps was organized as follows.\nSection - The smallest unit in the RSC, the Section was commanded by a Lieutenant, and consisted of either two heavier starfighters (like the BTL-B Y-Wing or the ARC-170) or four lighter starfighters (like the V-19 Torrent or the Z-95 Headhunter). \nFlight - Composed of two sections, flights were often deployed as scouting units, and were commanded by captains.\nSquadron - The most common starfighter unit, squadrons consisted of three heavy flights or four light flights for a total of twelve or thirty-six starfighters. Squadrons were led either by Majors or by Jedi Commanders; in the latter case, the commander often had a captain as second-in-command.\n\n# Section 4\nWing - Comprised of from three to ten squadrons depending on starfighter type and mission profile, wings were led either by commanders or Jedi Generals, and represented the average warship complement per starfighter type.\nGroup - Consisting of two wings, groups were deployed in full only in major battles, and contained anywhere between 72 and 640 starfighters. There were hundreds upon hundreds of groups in the RSC, and when deployed they were led either by a Senior Jedi General, an experienced commander, or an experienced Jedi General.\n\n","meta":{"index":26,"author":"DemshyAlkion","name":"The Republic Navy","release_year":2020}},"Yavin Coalition":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Yavin Coalition was a joint task force of Republic and Imperial forces during the Battle of Rishi in 3637 BBY. Founded by Jedi Grandmaster Satele Shan and Sith Dark Council member Darth Marr, its purpose was to stop Revan and his plans to bring back Sith Emperor Vitiate.# Section 1\nAlthough Revan aimed to bring Vitiate into a physical form on Yavin 4 so that he could be killed, there was a risk that he would end up consuming all life in the galaxy. To ensure his success, a trap was set for the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. The Revanites had hired the Nova Blades pirates to attack shipping lanes, rerouting hyperspace routes, resulting in the Republic and Imperial fleets meeting above Rishi, where they engaged in battle. A signal jammer was placed on the planet’s surface, preventing contact between the fleets, and saboteurs were placed on the ships to disable the systems. Once the two fleets had destroyed each other, Revan’s ships would finish off any survivors. Before the trap had succeeded, the jamming device was disabled, and the two fleets were informed of the plot and given the list of saboteurs. The two leaders ordered a ceasefire, and met in the neutral location of Raiders’ Cove on the surface below.\n\n# Section 2\nDarth Marr and Grandmaster Shan used their remaining forces to form the Coalition, and travelled to Yavin 4 to halt Revan’s plans. They set up a Command Post near to the Revanites’ position, and set up a series of sensor beacons around the perimeter so that they could monitor their movements. The Republic and Imperial forces had trouble trusting each other, and were reluctant to work together. The Coalition learned that the Revanites had taken over an Imperial Guard Academy. After a short battle, Coalition forces recovered Imperial Guard Commandant Iven, who revealed to them that Revan was using the Temple of Sacrifice as a base, and was going to use an artefact to bring Vitiate back from the dead, the cost of which being the killing of all life on the moon, except those inside the Temple. Satele Shan and Darth Marr detected a light side presence on the moon, this turned out to be the Force ghost of Revan. After the Battle of the Foundry, Revan was split into two halves, his light side (which became a Force ghost), and his dark side (which became his physical form). His light side was capable of becoming one with the Force, but only when joined with its dark side counterpart. A strike team of eight of the best from across the Republic and the Empire attacked the Revanites and the Temple. Revan, his ritual halted and the artefact destroyed, fled to a nearby sanctuary. Coalition leadership engaged in combat with him. Defeated, his light side convinced him to merge with his dark half  and become one with the Force. However, all the death caused by the fighting was enough to bring Vitiate back to life, and his disembodied spirit left the moon.\n\n# Section 3\nDespite their victory, Vitiate posed a threat to the galaxy. Despite the ongoing conflict between the Republic and the Empire, concluded that they would dissolve the Coalition, but renew it at the next sight of Vitiate. When he reemerged on the Sith world of Ziost, performing his ritual killing all life on the planet, in 3636 BBY, Darth Marr led a strike team to pursue him into Wild Space, joined by many veterans of the Coalition. They came across the Eternal Empire of Zakuul, and were destroyed with few survivors. Marr was taken captive and executed by his former Emperor. Later, in 3631 BBY, the Eternal Alliance, based off of the Coalition and founded by former members, would be created to fight against the Eternal Empire.\n\n","meta":{"index":70,"author":"MonsterMash2070","name":"Yavin Coalition","release_year":2021}},"Clan Cadera":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Clan Cadera consisted of Mandalorians and held a prominent existence within the Great Galactic War period until the Cold War between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic.

The new leader chose to ally themselves with the Sith whilst Cadera Clan leader, Jicoln Cadera, protested against the decision and advocated side with the Republic instead.  This would ignite the conflict between the Mandalorians as Jicoln Cadera would raise a legion to confront the Mand’alor.  In the end,  Jicoln and his followers lost the fight, which led to Jicoln escaping as an exiled (being presumed dead) whilst the remaining members of Clan Cadera stayed within the Mandalorians.# Section 1\nDue to the conflict that transpired, many Mandalorians detested the clan, often referring to their members as “traitor’s blood”. After being humiliated by his father’s actions, Torian Cadera, immediately sought to kill him after finding out that Jicoln Cadera had been alive on Taris. Eventually, he defeated his father through a Mandalorian death game, Geroya be Haran.

Kallig, together with Lieutenant Talos Drellik of the Service, searched the temple to look for Horak-mul’s sarcophagus–a stone coffin used to bury dead leaders.

They would accuse the former Coruscant politicians for “its” corruption and benefiting large companies without a care for individual citizens. The organization was mostly filled with humans, though they would also accept aliens and other species unlike some such as Dar’manda which was filled with only humans. One of their goals was to persuade everyone that the galaxy’s government was corrupt. In 33 BBY, the Flail would accuse the Supreme Chancellor, Finis Volorum, of this act. This would end with his reputation lowering and getting worse. Valorum would decide to fight the organization himself because he would fear the thought of being thrown out of office. The Chancellor’s Judicial forces would capture then slaughter as many members of the Flail they possibly could including the leadership. Later down the line, he would imprison the rest and announce this at the following Senate hearing. However, in response, he would get death threats and an unsuccessful attack against his aide, Sei Taria. With all this havoc on-going, Mace Windu and himself would create a strike team of strong agents to make sure the attempt on the Chancellor’s life will be foiled. The Flail would send down Sen Riip Domeet to hide a thermal bomb close by to where the Chancellor would have his conference that very day. Though, the expert in explosives would quickly escape due to how he thought his disguise had been found out. The determined organization would immediately enact their next plan which was to enter the Traffic Control Center to control a ship then hurl it into an important building which would host Valorum’s meetings. As expected, his agents would find them out and foil their plan before the attempt. In later history, the Flail was present on the planet Talus, during the Galactic Civil War.

Their headquarters and main area would be present in Jedha City due to that being where they handcraft their lightbows. These weapons would need to be made by a user for tradition and for them to carry on their spiritual progression. The process of making one would be described as “requiring patience and skill”. The Guardians of the Whills would continue to guard their pilgrims to the Kyber Temple during the Imperial Era, even though it was now harder than before. In 0 BBY, the two rebels, Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor, would visit the city in hopes of finding an Imperial defector who had information on the Galactic Empire’s newest weapon.

The Imperial nobles had migrated to Ord Cantrell, where they governed over a thin but long strip of land stretching from the Colonies to the Outer Rim. In 11 ABY, it lasted less than a year. Carnor Jax, Imperial Sovereign Protector and aspiring Dark Lord of the Sith, gave the organization its name after the hue of the Emperor's Royal Guard uniform he wore.# Section 1\nThe Crimson Empire arose from the Dark Empire, a second Sith regime created in 10-11 ABY by the revived Palpatine. The poisoning of Palpatine's clone corpses was overseen by Imperial Sovereign Protector Carnor Jax, ensuring the Emperor's death. Jax gained leadership of the Empire after Palpatine's death at Onderon, calling himself Emperor and ruling with the help of a twelve-member Imperial Interim Ruling Council. The council included a handful of aliens, which marked the very first time when aliens were given powerful posts within an organized body. Despite the fact that many of the Empire's military commanders in the Deep Core established themselves as independent warlords and ignored Jax and the Council, Jax's Crimson Empire was the final vestige of Palpatine's organized Imperial empire. Kir Kanos, a rival Guardsman, assassinated Jax shortly after. Burr Nolyds was elected Emperor, but he was slain by a plan orchestrated by Nom Anor. Xandel Carivus eventually cleansed his rivals in the Council, disbanding it and declared himself Emperor under Anor's guidance. His reign was short-lived, as Kanos assassinated Carivus while the New Republic seized Ord Cantrell's capital and imprisoned the remaining councilors. The seizure of Ord Cantrell would spell the end of the Imperial state as we know it. The ruins of the previous Crimson Empire would have little influence because the remaining Imperial warlords acknowledged no central authority. The Imperial Remnant was established in 12 ABY after Natasi Daala's effort for Imperial Reunification resulted in the split state lasting a year.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Galactic Emperor presided over the Crimson Empire, as he had presided over the Galactic Empire previous to 4 ABY and the Dark Empire before it. It did, however, have a twelve-member executive body called the Imperial Interim Ruling Council, also known as the \"Council of Blood.\" It allowed aliens to serve on the Council, unlike the Galactic Empire. The Diet of Imperial Planetary Governors was a body created by the Interim Ruling Council to give the Empire the appearance of representative democracy, but in actuality it operated as a rubber-stamp legitimizer for the Council's edicts.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Crimson Empire's forces were at a minimum because the Imperial commanders had become autonomous warlords in the Deep Core. All Terrain Scout Transports, HAVw A5 Juggernauts, TIE Crawlers, Chariot LAVs, TIE/sa bombers, TIE/IN interceptors, Imperial-class Star Destroyers, and Carrack-class light cruisers were still available to it. The Crimson Empire also included the 133rd Imperial Fighter Group. General Redd Wessel, General Immodet, and an unidentified officer were the supreme commanders at the moment.\n\n# Section 4\nThe Crimson Empire stretched from the Colonies to the Outer Rim, and it shared a border with the Pentastar Alignment. Qiilura, the Kol Huro system, Celanon, Ord Cantrell, Phaeda, Yinchorr, and the D'Astan sector were among the worlds it ruled. The Crimson Empire also gained isolated pockets of control outside that region thanks to the backing of its alien councilors (especially the Whiphid Ch'Unkk, Defel Za, Devaronian Manos, and Givin Kooloota-Fyf).\n\n","meta":{"index":67,"author":"DeBraamster","name":"Crimson Empire","release_year":2021}},"The Order of Dai Bendu":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Order of Dai Bendu were a group of Force Sensitive Monks who originated from the planet of Thape, and went on to thrive in the Andobi Mountains of the Planet of Ando Prime; Where they discovered a Force Nexus. The Order was often referred to as the “Bendu Tribe” and the species inhabiting Ando Prime were often called the Dai Bendu themselves. They were legendary and ancient, being one of the first organisations to ever study the Force and the Midi-Chlorians. They predated the Galactic Republic by thousands of years, their origins dating back further than 37,453 years BBY. The Dai Bendu were originally a peaceful group, dedicating themselves to their studies. They held principles of non-confrontation and meditation. The few other groups to discover the Force and the Midi-Chlorians, such as the Shamans residing on Dathomir and the Selkath Scholars of Manaan, were isolated and unable to share their discoveries with each  other.# Section 1\nIn the Andonian Mountains, the Dai Bendu discovered an enormous pyramid-like structure. It had a certain tie with the Force, and called to them specifically. They had no idea where it came from or what it was, but they referred to it as “Tho Yor”. While they had the understanding that this structure was otherworldly, they could not pin-point its function. They prayed to Tho Yor, and hoped to one day listen to it’s voice through meditation. In 36,453 BBY, a group of Bendu monks found themselves to fulfill the prophecy and heard the call of Tho Yor, allowing them to enter Tho Yor leading them to discover it was in fact a starship. The Bendu Monks were transported to Tython, where they found seven more starships of the same make as Tho Yor. They brought other sentient groups to Tython, and thus they all came together to be the first Tythans. The Dai Bendu played a major role in the formation of the Je'daii Order amongst the Tythans. Various practices, symbols and beliefs of the Je’daii came from the Dai Bendu. Lha-Mi, a Bendu Monk, was one of the first Temple Masters of the Je’daii Order. She was assigned to the Temple of Martial Arts, Stav Kesh. The very name “Je’daii” comes from two words of the Dai Bendu. The first word, “Je”, meaning mystic, and the second, “Dai”, meaning centre.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Order existed well into the time of the Republic, but their beliefs and practices were poorly understood leading to their presence and involvement with the formation of the Je’daii to be forgotten. Although rarely known, few historians speculated the Dai Bendu to be the original Jedi; however they all lacked any legitimate proof. An extremely small number of people possessed the texts that mentioned the Dai Bendu, one of those people being the Sith Lord Darth Plagueis. After the fall of Aurum, and the destruction of Tython’s biosphere, the Dai Bendu had remained on Ando Prime even after the departure of Tho Yor. Between the years 3,643 and 3,640 BBY, Bendu Monks travelled the Galaxy’s Core Worlds and brought a Meditation Master. Many residents of these worlds sought out the teaching of the Bendu, as their presence was rare. They would often teach their non-confrontational beliefs, and occasionally their commercialism.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Dai Bendu also found themselves deep in numerology, the study of numbers and their significance to occult purposes. They had a strong tie to the number 9, believing it represented the presence of the Unifying Force. They portrayed this with an eight spoked circle all connecting into one central disc, similar to the symbol engraved on the faces of Tho Yor. This emblem was stolen by a Sith Emperor, who used it to signify his Sith Empire. A millenia was required for the symbol to be reclaimed once again, renamed as the “Galactic Roundel” and adorned to Jedi Starfighters, and was used collectively by the Galactic Republic. After the fall of the Republic, the Sith Emperor Sheev Palpatine edited the symbol by removing 2 spokes and used it to signify his Galactic Empire.\n\n# Section 4\nDai Bendu Monks revered large cities and bustling communities, and set themselves to reside in tribal communities. The wisest of all Bendu Monks was referred to as the High Priest. They nestled themselves amongst tents and a pure water system, which they pumped through the Andobi Mountains. This pure water was sacred to them, and was sometimes sold to visitors. Those who had left for Tython built their temples with the symbols, decorations and architecture of their Tribal Monk brethren. Their temples contained arts and monuments depicting their religious beliefs and tales from their history. Their attire was that of long, flowing robes of simple design and the occasional walking stick to assist in the navigation of snowy terrain. The High Priest would adone an elegant, orange or red robe with a high and pointed hood. The Bendu Monks practiced a variety of chantings, some being eerie and haunting, others requiring deep, growling vocations. Those who found themselves listening to these chants would be entranced and sway slowly with the rhythm of their voices.\n\n","meta":{"index":24,"author":"Kraa_Plantte","name":"The Order of Dai Bendu","release_year":2021}},"The Army of Light":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Army of Light was a legendary military force established near the end of the New Sith Wars by the Jedi Lord Hoth to combat the machinations of Dark Lord of the Sith Skere Kaan's Brotherhood of Darkness.# Section 1\nEstablishing the Jedi Grand Council, a council of Lords working independently from the Jedi High Council on Coruscant, these Lords assumed control of the local system and sector armies, having earned the respect and fealty of those living under their rule, shortly after most of the lords were disgusted with the Jedi High Council's utter failure to control Kaan, the Jedi Temple's own battle master, Lord Hoth, left Coruscant with a band of followers and rallied the banners of all those Jedi Lords loyal to him. Of high repute among his fellow Lords, Hoth's call to arms was answered immediately by the Lords of Corellia, Cularin, and Kamparas.\n\n# Section 2\nThis series of events and calls at arms ended up reaching the Jedi Grand Council who officially declared that all the remaining lords are to pledge their loyalty to the Army of Light’s banner. Hoth led his army directly to the Outer Rim Territories, liberating a number of Sith strongholds in a methodical attack pattern that avoided a direct conflict with Lord Kaan. While the Army of Light was able to grow in numbers as Hoth's strategy of attacking the flanks of the Brotherhood succeeded.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Army of Light was an ad-hoc military force hastily assembled and provisioned to combat the sudden unity of the Sith, The Army consisted of the baronies and warships of the multiple Jedi Lords who made up the Army, supplying both Force-sensitive and non-Force-sensitive soldiers to wage war against the Sith. The bulk of the Army's forces was made up of the Seven Legions of Light, each of which was commanded by the greatest Lords of the Jedi Order; Each legion consisted of loyal Jedi Knights and the many esquires, warriors, and servants from the different baronies. With them these common folk brought an array of skills and knowledge, wielding swords, clubs, morningstars, and a variety of other weapons.\n\n# Section 4\nFollowing the defeat of Lord Kaan and the Brotherhood of Darkness, the Galactic Senate and the Jedi High Council effectively disbanded the Army with the ratification of the Ruusan Reformation, leaving the Army of Light as an old extension of the Jedi order yet even though they were hard to control and didn’t follow the orders of the High Jedi Council most of the time, they were appreciated as one of the most skilled and strongest army’s that serve under the Order and the Republic.\n\n","meta":{"index":10,"author":"SRGATOGAMER","name":"The Army of Light","release_year":2020}},"The Force Hounds":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Force Hounds were an organisation of force-sensitive slaves whose duty it was to seek out and scout worlds rich with force-sensitivity on behalf of their Rakatan masters. The organisation itself was small and did not maintain a chain of command. Instead each Force Hound would individually serve a master and operate almost entirely alone, only being granted command of other Rakatan slave forces if required for exceptionally dangerous missions.# Section 1\nWhile the Infinite Empire was exploring the galaxy they found many uses for force-sensitives outside of their own species. Most commonly force-sensitives would be enslaved and used as living fuel cells for the Infinite Empire’s wide variety of machinery. Slave children would be grouped into broods, groups of force-sensitive slave children who would live together and carry out their functions together. Those who displayed exceptional aggression, prowess in fighting and skills in the force would often be noted by the Rakatans and may be selected to become Force Hounds.\n\n# Section 2\nThose selected would be taken to the Infinite Empire capital world; Byss. Where they would undergo combat training and hone their force abilities, particularly in the area of sensing other force sensitives. Force Hounds could then be selected by Rakatans, often Predors (Rakatan overlords) or sold to senior Rakatan political and military figures.\n\n# Section 3\nWhen it comes to their force training the Infinite Empire was not known for its affinity for the light side of the force. Force Hounds were expected to master the dark side, as a result they would have little empathy or compassion and most were not even aware that the light side of the force existed. They would be trained particularly as scouts and as such were excellent in stealth and reconnaissance, this would filter into their combat style as they would be expected to eliminate targets swiftly and without detection.\n\n# Section 4\nLife as a Force Hound offered more freedom than that of other slaves, with Force Hounds often spending months and potentially years away from the Infinite Empire in foreign lands. This seclusion made them loners as they would not make contact with the foreign people they found and when they did would be expected to kill those who detected them so that the native populations would not become aware of the Infinite Empire prior to its invasion of their land.\n\n# Section 5\nForce Hounds may have developed friendships during their time as part of their broods but it is unlikely their friends would have survived into adulthood, and those that did rarely got to see each other. Force Hounds who failed in their duties or did not live up to their master’s expectations would either be killed, sold or presented as gifts. Those that were killed were likely eaten by their Rakatan masters and those that were sold would likely find themselves as gladiators or in another similar combat role, their training was too useful to turn them back into living fuel cells.\n\n# Section 6\nThe Rakatans would find other uses for their Force Hounds, quite often pitting them against each other for amusement or to gamble. These duels would almost always be to the death and were known to be exceptionally gruesome with the defeated usually being cut into multiple parts due to the aggressive nature of the Force Hounds.\n\n# Section 7\nThere are only two known Force Hounds in galactic history. Trill who was a humanoid female and Xesh who was a human male. Both were friends in their brood and even later in life when becoming Force Hounds. Xesh was considerably more skilled in combat and when the two duelled Xesh easily defeated Trill and was ordered to execute her by his Rakatan master, however as the two made a blood-oath during their time in the brood Xesh elected to spare Trill and persuaded his master to sell her as a gift and insult to his master’s superior. \n\nXesh would later find himself on a mission to Tython and would encounter the Je’daii Order. It was on Tython he would discover the light side of the force but would be exiled to the moon of Bogan for his affinity with the dark side, at this point he would go by the name of Tau, a name he gave himself in secret.\n\n# Section 8\nThe Force Hound could be identified by their tattoos most notably. These tattoos would be found on the faces, arms, legs and even backs of every force-sensitive slave so that they could be identified even after a particularly bloody death. The tattoos would bear the name of the Force Hound in Aurebesh and came in no particular colours. \n\nForce Hounds would typically wear a black and golden set of battle armour however it is not unknown for Force Hounds to dress how they saw fit due to the nature of their missions. They were also known for wielding the forcesaber with great skill but were trained in almost all varieties of weapons including hand-to-hand combat and ranged weaponry.\n\n# Section 9\nTheir martial capabilities while excellent are not what is unique about them. Force Hounds displayed excellent affinity with the force and could use abilities that would be considered extremely rare in future force based organisations. Force Hound Xesh was notably skilled in telekinesis and at one point was able to squeeze the numerous hearts of a beast he was fighting when enraged with the force. It was also not uncommon for Force Hounds to make use of force lightning, both when casting it and reflecting it without the use of a forcesaber.\n\n","meta":{"index":13,"author":"Seko1111","name":"The Force Hounds","release_year":2021}},"Wookiee Council":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Wookiee Council was the council that led the Wookiees, who were native to Kashyyyk. This council consisted of multiple elders, or Chieftains, and was headed by the King. Later, a Senator became the head of the Wookiee Council. The Wookiees were developing into a more advanced society. However, this was suddenly halted by the arrival of the Czerka Corporation, an arms dealer who commonly dealt with Sith, but had a history of selling to both sides. Due to a prior falling out between the two sons of the chieftain Freyyr, the lack of opposition allowed Czerka to take over the Wookiee capital and began to make use of the servants that had been given to them from another deal, with one son of Freyyr, Chuundar. The other son, Zaalbar had been exiled for breaking part of the Wookiee code. Kashyyyk’s state changed when a Jedi named Revan, an amnesiac who had been changed into a Jedi, came looking for a Star Map, which would lead him to the Star Forge, the source of the Sith’s massive fleet. After Chuundar was killed by Freyyr, a mass revolt was incited and Wookiees successfully drove off the Czerka Corporation.# Section 1\nAfter the Rebellion against the Czerka Corporation, the Wookiee Council became a member of the Galactic Republic. The senator representing the Wookiees, Yarua, refused an offer to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Despite invasions by the Separatists on the Wookiee moon of Alaris Prime, the senator did not allow military bases on Kashyyyk.

In a sense it also served as capital of the galaxy during many different eras of galactic history and as such served as home for over one trillion residents throughout a majority of this time. As a result of this the Coruscant Security Force was established, though it maintained numerous different identities and underwent many changes throughout its history it always had numerous standing special units capable of undertaking tasks of a unique nature or tasks too daunting for standard CSF constables. \n\nThis was the case for the Coruscant Security Force Special Weapons Team. Coruscant was a galactic beacon of progress and hope for many, particularly those living on the higher levels. For others, it served as a place of organised crime, ample territory for terrorism, murder, gang activity and even invasion from the various enemies of the Republic. As such, the Special Weapons Team was commissioned to provide a more lethal resolution to many of these problems.# Section 1\nPart I: Purpose\n\nThe Coruscant Security Force would often be met with threats of organised crime in many of the unruly areas of the planet. These gangs would often be funded or sponsored by Cartels and organisations that either sought to make profit or deal damage to the Galactic Republic or Galactic Empire. As such it was the responsibility of the Special Weapons Team when called upon to provide additional firepower and unique tactics in order to dispose of or apprehend suspects that would usually pose too much of a threat to standard officers. \n\nThe Special Weapons Team would utilize military grade weaponry and be modelled after Republic or Imperial Special Operations units in order to conduct raids, assaults, VIP protection and even counter-intelligence. As such the nature of their operations was typically classified and they would work closely with Republic or Imperial military units such as the Special Operations Brigade of the Galactic Republic or Imperial Security Bureau and Imperial Commandos of the Galactic Empire.\n\n# Section 2\nPart II: Structure and uniform\n\nThe Special Weapons Team was a standalone division of the Coruscant Security Force; however, it would often be placed under the umbrella of other CSF divisions, particularly the Anti-Terrorism unit. As its role was to offer additional firepower and tactics to the entirety of the CSF, the unit would often be spread across multiple different divisions of the CSF at a time and report to the Sector Command of CSF. \n\nThe unit maintained ranks such as Constable, Sergeant, Lieutenant and other ranks associated with the CSF; however, the rank of the unit’s commander is unknown, it could even be speculated that as a result of the unit’s consistent relocation to aid other divisions it did not need an individual commander. \n\nThe teams themselves were made up of small groups of highly trained SWAT officers that would be reinforced by specialised droids. The size of the teams are unknown but due to the wide variety of operations conducted it is likely the teams would often change in size, usually being commanded by either a Sergeant or Lieutenant. \n\nThe Special Weapons Team would notably wear black tactical uniforms designed for camouflage in the urban and darker areas of Coruscant. As they were trained in counter-intelligence it is also likely the unit made use of plain-clothed officers to blend in with crowds and to carry out surveillance unnoticed.\n\n# Section 3\nPart III: Training and selection\n\nThe unit by design was intended to serve as a mediation between the standing military of either the Republic or Empire and the Police forces. As such the unit itself was very militarised and regimented. Constables and Officers could apply for CSF SWAT selection but the unit would only select the brightest and most physically able of the candidates for additional training.\n\nNot much is known about the selection process and what it entailed, but it likely included aptitude tests and physical capability tests that would recreate the environments and operations the CSF SWAT officers would find themselves in. \n\nTraining would be of a far higher standard than regular CSF training. Each SWAT officer would undergo training in advanced hand-to-hand combat, marksmanship at a near special operations level, close protection training and hostage rescue training.\n\nAdditionally, officers could apply for roles such as explosive ordnance and disposal experts, team snipers, and counter-intelligence duties. Each of these roles would have their own unique selection and training courses.\n\n# Section 4\nPart IV: Legacy\n\nThe CSF SWAT division was so successful during the reign of the Galactic Republic and Galactic Empire that the New Republic and later the Galactic Alliance recommissioned the unit with more resources and assistance. Most notably they would work alongside the Galactic Alliance Guard and would be commanded and supported by notable Jedi Knights such as Jacen Solo. The CSF SWAT division would continue its career with success and expand its area of operations to other worlds such as Corellia.\n\n","meta":{"index":31,"author":"seko1111","name":"Special Weapons Team","release_year":2021}},"The Jedi Coalition":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Jedi Coalition was a loosely organized group of various factions brought together after the rise of Darth Caedus and his assumption of the role of Chief of State of the Galactic Alliance. Luke Skywalker firmly believed that the rise of a new Sith to power would only serve to recreate the events of the Galactic Empire that he and many of his closest allies had fought to overthrow. As such, Luke Skywalker along with his Jedi Order would declare independence from the Galactic Alliance and as a result would be declared traitors and much like during the reign of Darth Sidious, would find themselves in hiding once more.# Section 1\nWhen Darth Caedus had arisen to power and gained control over the Galactic Alliance it was clear to much of the galaxy that history was about to repeat itself. Luke Skywalker and the New Jedi Order declared independence and rallied numerous factions and planets to their cause, most notably the Alliance-in-Exile who were mostly driven by the veterans who had fought in the first Galactic Civil War and the Mandalorians under the command of Boba Fett, who had all fought alongside Luke Skywalker and his Jedi in the Yuuzhan Vong war. The Jedi Coalition would establish their capital on Fondor, an important industrial world that had supplied large amounts of weapons and ships to the Republic, Galactic Empire, New Republic and later the Galactic Alliance. This would grant the Jedi Coalition access to many resources deemed critical to the war effort. United, these various factions were strong enough to create one of the largest galaxy-spanning governments of the era, though despite this it would still prove to be a daunting task to remove Darth Caedus from power and insure that the Galactic Alliance could be restored. Officially established in 40 ABY, Darth Caedus immediately entered a state of war with the faction and declared the Jedi Coalition a united front of terrorists, traitors and renegades.\n\n# Section 2\nLuke Skywalker and the New Jedi Order did not initially declare independence upon Darth Caedus’ rise to power, the reasoning behind this being rather controversial. Darth Caedus assumed power legally with the backing of the Galactic Alliance’s government and military and sought to continue the war against the Confederation, which the Jedi themselves agreed was necessary. This would change after further reflection by the Jedi Order who believed having a Sith Lord back in power would prove to be a huge threat to galactic stability.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Battle of Kuat would be one of the most strategically important battles between the Galactic Alliance and Confederation for control of the Kuat Shipyards which would provide whoever was victorious the means to create large warships as well as provide numerous hyperspace routes to various core worlds, including Coruscant. During the early days of the war Darth Caedus believed he had the support of the Jedi Order and was awaiting the arrival of Jedi Naval assets and the Hapan Home Fleet so that he could win the battle. The battle would turn against Darth Caedus after Luke Skywalker would confront Caedus over the death of his wife, Mara Jade Skywalker and the military occupation of Ossus, which served as a great Jedi Library and Academy for Luke’s Jedi Order. Furious at Darth Caedus, Luke Skywalker would order the Jedi Order to cease all support to the Galactic Alliance and retire from the conflict over Kuat in order to establish the Jedi Coalition. The Battle of Kuat would come to an end when Darth Caedus was informed that both the Confederation and Jedi Coalition would seek the aid of the Wookiee Navy and were both intending on pleading their case for aid to the Rook Council on Kashyyyk, Darth Caedus, despite suffering heavy losses, would relocate much of his Naval assets to Kashyyyk in order to attack the Jedi forces and Confederation, with the purpose of forcing the Confederation to retreat from Kuat, this strategy worked and the battle would be won by the Galactic Alliance.\n\n# Section 4\nBy the time Luke Skywalker and his Jedi Council had arrived on Kashyyyk, Darth Caedus was already mobilizing his Fifth Fleet to relocate to the planet. Darth Caedus did give the Rook Council the opportunity to hand over the Jedi Council as by this stage they were declared traitors and criminals, but Darth Caedus knew they would not do this as a result of Kashyyyk’s great respect for the Jedi Order and Luke Skywalker. Lowbacca, head of state for the Wookiee government would lie to Darth Caedus in an effort to hide the Jedi Council’s presence on Kashyyyk, Darth Caedus would see this as political justification to attack the planet and in typical Sith fashion, commenced an orbital bombardment of Kashyyyk’s civilian population centres and critical military garrisons. The Wookiee fleet, while massive and something to be feared, was not yet mobilized or prepared for the invasion carried out by Darth Caedus’ Fifth Fleet. This left the Wookiees vulnerable and forced the Confederation to abandon their campaign against the Core Worlds in order to aid the Wookiees. The Jedi present on Kashyyyk would rush to their own fighters and along with as many Wookiee squadrons that could be mobilized, they would launch an attack against Darth Caedus’ Fifth Fleet. Upon commencement of the bombardment of Kashyyyk, Ben Skywalker, who was still on Darth Caedus’ flagship after the Battle of Kuat would attack Darth Caedus but would swiftly be subdued and placed inside a Yuuzhan Vong torture device known as the ‘Embrace of Pain’. Luke Skywalker, while leading the defence of Kashyyyk would be shot down and forcibly crashland into Darth Caedus’ Flagship, the ‘Anakin Solo’ in an effort to confront Darth Caedus directly. Luke Skywalker would sabotage various weapon systems on the ‘Anakin Solo’ and be successful in confronting Darth Caedus. During their duel Ben Skywalker would free himself and stab Darth Caedus, however Luke Skywalker believed allowing his son Ben to kill Caedus would potentially push him towards the Dark Side, and instead the pair would flee.\n\n# Section 5\nUnbeknownst to Darth Caedus, during his assault on Kashyyyk, Han and Leia Organa Solo were on the planet and escaped in order to open negotiations with Tenel Ka Djo, the secret lover of Darth Caedus, Jedi Knight and leader of the Hapes Consortium, who had provided a sizable fleet to Darth Caedus. Han and Leia were able to convince the Hapes Consortium along with the Rook Council to side with the Jedi Order in the effort to remove Darth Caedus from power. They agreed that they will form somewhat of a truce with the Confederation, agreeing to allow them to continue their own plans to remove Darth Caedus from power and to wage war against him, seeing it as strategically beneficial.\n\n# Section 6\nIn an effort to end what had now become known as the Second Galactic Civil War, Luke Skywalker and his allies put together a plan to capture or if necessary kill Darth Caedus. The plan would entail a strike team commanded by Kyle Katarn being deployed to Coruscant, tracking Darth Caedus down and capturing him outside of Coruscant’s Senate building. Luke Skywalker elected not to go personally as he feared his anger towards Darth Caedus may jeopardize the mission or result in him falling to the dark side. There was a secondary objective for the ambush which ended up being the only objective that the strike team were able to achieve; plant a tracking device on Darth Caedus’ cloak in an effort to track his personal movements. This part was a success, but the strike team were not aware that Darth Caedus had since become the Dark Lord of the Sith which had increased his personal power greatly, he was able to cut the head off of Mithric, a member of the strike team and stab Kyle Katarn through the chest, wounding him greatly. The team were forced to retreat and had to escape Coruscant.\n\n# Section 7\nAfter the failed attempt to kill or capture Darth Caedus, it came to light that the daughter of Tenel Ka Djo, Allana, was being kept prisoner by Darth Caedus as a hostage to ensure that the Hapes Consortium remained in the conflict, Luke Skywalker believed that freeing this girl would allow Tenel Ka Djo to provide larger forces to the Jedi Coalition and focus their efforts without the risk of losing Allana. It was also deemed crucial that the ancient superweapon known as Centerpoint station be destroyed, as in the hands of Darth Caedus the risks this weapon posed would be too great. The Jedi Coalition sought out to conduct two strikes, one would be an infiltration into ‘Anakin Solo’ to free Allana. The other would be a sabotage mission into Centerpoint station to sabotage and destroy it. Fortunately this time around the Jedi Coalition was successful. Under the guise of Doctor Seyah, Centerpoint station would be destroyed, eliminating perhaps the strongest weapon Darth Caedus possessed. And under the guise of Luke Skywalker, Allana would be freed from Darth Caedus, allowing the Hapans to dedicate larger amounts of resources to the war effort. Despite these victories the Galactic Alliance under Darth Caedus was still the largest fighting force in the galaxy. As a result of their infiltration onto ‘Anakin Solo’, Darth Caedus would grow infuriated and kill a Naval Officer, this sparked much controversy and discussion amongst the Galactic Alliance Navy that would result in many individuals defecting to the Jedi Coalition. As well as this, some notable Galactic Alliance Naval Officers began leaking Darth Caedus’ war strategies to Luke Skywalker and it became apparent that Darth Caedus was planning to invade Fondor, an independent industrial world that was notable for its ability to provide large amounts of resources to various historical factions during wartime.\n\n# Section 8\nLuke Skywalker on behalf of the Jedi Coalition would warn Fonder about the coming invasion and provide some strategic advice on how to prepare. The Jedi did not directly take part in the conflict however, instead opting to provide defense to civilians on the various orbital mining platforms and mining barracks while the Fondorian Navy would carry out the battle. Darth Caedus, now reinforced with the might of the Imperial Remnant would begin the Naval battle but to his surprise his fleets would be ambushed by the Fondorian Navy. Despite the well conducted ambush Fondor was not ready to take on the Galactic Alliance and Imperial Navy and swiftly surrendered. Darth Caedus’ next action would be the turning point in the war and mark the swift victory for the Jedi Coalition. He would proceed to conduct an orbital bombardment of Fondor’s surface despite surrendering, this encouraged over two thirds of the Galactic Alliance Navy to defect to the Jedi Coalition and turn on Darth Caedus, dubbing themselves the Alliance-In-Exile. Darth Caedus would be forced to retreat and the Jedi Coalition would then utilize Fondor as its capital. While using Fondor the Jedi Coalition would gain the support of the Maw Irregular Fleet, the Mandalorian armada under the command of Mand’alor Boba Fett and numerous fleets from the Galactic Alliance Navy. Despite this large amassing of forces, the war would be cut short when Jaina Solo, having been personally trained to kill Jedi by Boba Fett for this particular purpose, would set out to kill Darth Caedus. She would prove successful in doing so and as a result, the Second Galactic Civil War would come to an end. All factions involved would return to their original state, the Jedi Coalition would be disbanded as the New Jedi Order returned to the Galactic Alliance and a state of relative peace would return to the galaxy once more.\n\n# Section 9\nThe structure of the Jedi Coalition loosely mimicked that of the Galactic Alliance but the organisation itself was not designed to be permanent and as such did not spend much time establishing dedicated government and military roles, as it was a rough band of various factions that only existed for a year.\n\n","meta":{"index":59,"author":"seko1111","name":"The Jedi Coalition","release_year":2021}},"The Car'das Smugglers":{"content":"# Introduction\nCar’das is a smuggling organization lead by the one and only, Jorj Car’das. They were a small band of criminals comparable to Black Sun, however, their impact became big upon the galaxy. They were working in small cells that operated in particular sectors and places throughout planets and planets leading to major control over smuggling in the galaxy. Every cell was operating individually and from time to time, they will report to Jorj the results of the crimes made. Car’das used freighters, M3-Scyk, and G1-M4-C Dunelizard fighters. With these ships, they carried the goods and transported them to their hideouts. The members of this organization contained high-skilled mechanics and pilots, although slicers and hired blasters, even if the band wasn’t aiming to be violent. Sometimes, members got kicked for non-intelligent actions. For example, killing a civilian for no reason and draw all the attention to this murder.# Section 1\nBefore the Clone Wars, Jorj Car’das had full control over a smuggling ring, which gained him later on more reputation through the Outer Rim. And all of a sudden, Jorj disappeared before the war ended. After several months, he returned as a changed man. Surprisingly he obtained useful abilities, such as his new insights and intuition. With his new skills and reputation, he started expanding his empire into the Outer Rim. Car’das became a big smuggling organization since then. They had access to private shadow spaceports, which made their “legal” side of the business flow, till the authorities changed their targets. As their organization kept getting bigger and gained more profitable merchandise, they became a threat to the Black Sun and Hutt clans. They ended up harming Jorj’s group of smugglers. Around 0 ABY, Car’das disappeared again and the organization was taken over by Talon Karrde. Car’das started serving Tansarii Point Station as law enforcers around ABY 1.

Formed centuries prior to the Galactic War, Valkorion united the ancient tribes of Zakuul and ushered in an era of prosperity for his subjects. The people of Zakuul displayed steadfast loyalty to their so-called benevolent Immortal Emperor. Ruling from the Eternal Throne, he commanded the vast Eternal Fleet which rivalled the other naval forces of the time. Following Valkorion’s death, his children Arcann and Vaylin waged war against the Core Worlds, and later, the Alliance against Zakuul.# Section 1\nThe Wild Space planet, Zakuul, was the provenance and capital of the Eternal Empire. The capital city, called the Spire, was a sprawling metropolis with skyscrapers that peaked in atmosphere. A symbol of splendour and Zakuul’s golden age - the city was one of Valkorion’s grand achievements. It was home to an aristocratic society, whose inhabitants were wealthy in comparison to the rest of the galaxy. Each citizen pursued advanced careers as well as receiving a monthly stipend of credits and resources. The city was separated into 52 districts, each with identical living conditions. The citizens viewed the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire as barbaric warmongers; justifying the Eternal Empire’s rapid expansion as a means to bring enlightenment to the rest of the galaxy. The government of the Eternal Empire was headed by the High Justice, who also presided over the military.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Eternal Empire was enforced by the Eternal Fleet, an autonomous armada of warships that were technologically superior to other navies of the era. At the forefront of the fleet was the Eternal Flagship, commandeered by the most skilled crewmen of the empire. The ground force heavily relied upon droid Skytroopers, each armed with built-in jump packs and varying weapons. Human troops were present in smaller numbers, including an order of Force-wielders named the Knights of Zakuul. Their philosophy dictated that no area of the Force was too weak or dangerous to be explored, and that it was only a tool to be used in the pursuit of justice. While publicly known as the protectors of the people, the Knights existed to fanatically impose Valkorion’s will. During the reign of Empress Vaylin, members of the Knights of Zakuul were handpicked to serve in her Horizon Guard.\n\n# Section 3\nIn 3636 BBY, the twin princes Arcann and Thexan led a series of skirmishes against the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire, primarily to test the strength of their future adversaries. Following Thexan’s death and Valkorion’s assassination in the same year, Arcann took upon the title of Eternal Emperor and appointed his sister Vaylin as the High Justice. The new Emperor of Zakuul launched an open war against the wider galaxy, using the full might of the Eternal Fleet. Within a year, Zakuul emerged victorious, imposing heavy sanctions and ordering its adversaries to pay tribute. Star Fortresses were positioned over numerous worlds to quell rebellions and ensure tribute was paid. At some point during Arcann’s reign, a number of Zakuulans spoke against his cruel means and were consequently exiled to the Endless Swamp.\n\n# Section 4\nFive years into Arcann’s rule, an imprisoned individual known as the Outlander had escaped from Zakuul with the help of other dissidents. Arcann’s pursuit led him to the Asylum shadowport and the outcome of the ensuing battle proved that the Eternal Empire was not invincible. In the aftermath, the Alliance against Zakuul was formed on Odessen and sought to free the galaxy from the Eternal Empire’s oppression. Numerous operations were carried out, including the destruction of the Star Fortresses. With the expanding roster of Alliance members, the Outlander challenged Zakuulan sovereignty in the galaxy and this enraged both Arcann and Vaylin. Upon discovering the location of the Alliance base, Arcann ordered his detachment of the Eternal Fleet to attack Odessen. Following his defeat in a space battle, Vaylin succeeded him to the Eternal Throne. Her ruthless nature far surpassed the cruelty shown by both her predecessors, leading to growing discontent among the Zakuulan people. Eventually, Vaylin led her own assault on Odessen and managed to land a ground force numbering in the thousands. The battle was far more catastrophic to the Alliance than the first, however Vaylin’s invasion force surrendered after her death in a confrontation with the Outlander. Without an heir to the Eternal Throne, the Outlander gained control of the Eternal Empire and had merged it with their resistance organisation to create the Eternal Alliance.\n\n","meta":{"index":61,"author":"SciFalded","name":"Eternal Empire","release_year":2021}},"Gungan Grand Army":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Gungan Grand Army is a military force consisting of Gungans. When the Trade Federation invaded and enslaved Naboo, the army formed an attack on them and led them to victory. In the Battle of Mon Calamari, the army served as reinforcements to the Republic.# Section 1\nDuring the Naboo Invasion, the Gungan Grand Army was requested by the Queen of Naboo, Padmé  Amidala. In the Great Grass Plains, the Grand Army attacked the Trade Federation Droid Army just 40 kilometers outside of Theed, a strategy used to lure the droids away from the capital in order to allow the Queen and the Royal Naboo Security Forces to invade the Theed Royal Palace to capture Viceroy Nute Gunray.\n\nThe soldiers of the Gungan Army strongly believed that Jar Jar Binks was being gifted by the gods and was appointed as a Bombad General. In the end, the army was initially in defeat, but the droids were shut down when Anakin Skywalker destroyed the Droid Control Ship, therefore became victorious.\n\nFollowing their victorious end of the conflict, the Grand Army happily entered the capital and was greeted by the residents of Naboo for their part in freeing Naboo. Boss Nass was gifted the Globe of Peace by Queen Amidala, as a symbol and the start of the friendly relationship between the Gungans and the humans of Naboo.\n\n# Section 2\nIn the Clone Wars, during the Battle of Mon Calamari, Master Yoda requested aid from the Gungan Boss Lyonie. Senator Jar Jar Binks convinced Lyonie to assist the Republic. The Grand Army was sent to Mon Cala in a Venator-class Star Destroyer. Many have died and been captured by the Separatist leader Riff Tamson. They were sent to a prison camp, just among the corals of Mon Cala.\n\nThen, Prince Lee-Char of the Mon Calamari visited the camp and informed them about the attack, telling them to wait for his signal. But Lee-Char was captured and brought to Tamson and was scheduled to be executed.\n\nQuarren, who was allied with the Separatists, freed the Grand Army and joined Captain Ackbar in taking down the Trident assault ship.  They were victorious, and Lee-Char was crowned king.\n\n# Section 3\nLater, rumors circulated in Naboo about the Gungan allying with the Separatists, Lyonie called the Army to march on Theed. Senator Amidala and Anakin Skywalker returned to the planet to mediate the situation. They met Jar Jar on Lake Paonga and took them to Otoh Gunga. \n\nWhile trying to mediate the situation, Lyonie rejected their help, but Anakin noticed a necklace, gifted by Minister Rish Loo, worn by Lyonie which had some sort of mind control. He destroyed the Necklace and freed Lyonie. Rish Loo later confronted Lyonie, and stabbed him. Loo then escaped and went to the surface to announce that Lyonie was dead and march on the capital.\n\nLyonie somehow survived the attack, but he was unconscious. With Jar Jar resembling Lyonie, Anakin convinced him to act as Lyonie and pose as the Boss to convince the Army to retreat and cancel the attack. Jar Jar was successful in doing so. Rish Loo then saw that his plans had failed, he escaped into the swamps.\n\nThree C-9979 landing crafts landed, one deployed a tactical droid with a B2-series super battle droid escort. Jar Jar and General Tarpals managed to follow the tactical droid on the landing craft. There, they met General Grievous. Jar Jar told the general that he cancelled the attack on Theed. Of course, it angered Grievous, Tarpals later ordered to prepare the troops for battle and contacted Padmé about his strategy.\n\nGrievous was able to see through Jar Jar and attempted to kill him. He managed to escape and was told that the Grand Army had succeeded in turning off the droids. Tarpals and others battled Grievous. The General managed to stab Tarpals but later realized that he was impaled with a spear. This caused them a distraction to give the Gungans enough time to attack Grievous with boomas, which are grenade-like weapons used by the Gungans and capture him.\n\nOn the other hand, Anakin pursued Rish Loo in his secret outpost, which was used by Count Dooku. Dooku had already killed Loo. He also restrained and captured Anakin. They offered Amidala that they will free Grievous in exchange for Anakin. Padmé then agreed and the Separatist army left Naboo.\n\n","meta":{"index":8,"author":"kurtnicolo","name":"Gungan Grand Army","release_year":2021}},"Knights of Zakuul":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Knights of Zakuul, colloquially known as Zakuul Knights, were an order of force sensitive warriors who served in the Eternal Empire. They were considered as the protectors of the people, entrusted with hunting down corruption and dissidence throughout the Empire. The Knights believed their Force ability was only a tool to maintain justice, and that the Emperor Valkorion served as a conduit for the Force. They were commanded by the High Justice, who served as the head of government and commander in chief of the military. The Knights of Zakuul fanatically imposed the Emperor’s will, demonstrating a deep adoration for Valkorion and his family.# Section 1\nThe Knights of Zakuul sought to defend the Emperor and his sovereignty, enforcing justice across the Eternal Empire. The Knights aspired to honor the Immortal Emperor through their actions and viewed sacrifice as the ultimate sign of commitment to their leader. They were encouraged to explore both sides of the Force and share their findings with the rest of their order. Their philosophy lacked the strict codes used by the Jedi and Sith, emphasising their personal relationships with the Force. The Knights of Zakuul were highly militarized and were trained to utilize group tactics, allowing them to coordinate between other Knights, droid Skytroopers and walkers. The Knights originated from the Force-sensitive leaders of the early Zakuulan tribes; following their unification, Valkorion assigned the tribal leaders as the first Knights of Zakuul.\n\n# Section 2\nKnights of Zakuul wielded lightsaber pikes bearing blue kyber crystals and a handheld shield for deflecting blaster fire. They were also known to brandish standard lightsabers and double-bladed lightsabers. The standard uniform of the Knights of Zakuul was a set of gold-coloured armour which they were trained to forge by themselves.\n\n# Section 3\nThere were varying offsets of the Knights of Zakuul, each with their own specialization. A subgroup known as the Exarchs of Zakuul were the survivors of Project Exarch’s enhancement process. Each Exarch was faced with biological and cybernetic augmentation which was often fatal. The Exarchs ruled a conquered planet from an orbital battle station known as a Star Fortress. As well as being governors of a planet, the Exarchs were quasi-religious leaders who appropriated the icons of the Old Gods of Zakuul. Another sect of Knights called the Scions of Zakuul had the ability to view the future through the Force, believing in their visions to the point of zealotry. Emperor Arcann despised the Scions and ordered their eradication after assuming the Eternal Throne, resulting in a schism that nearly wiped them out. The last main offset of Knights were known as the Honor Guard, who were designated as the primary guardians of the Emperor and Eternal Throne. By the reign of Empress Vaylin, these Knights were purged and reorganized into the Horizon Guard.\n\n","meta":{"index":7,"author":"SciFalded","name":"Knights of Zakuul","release_year":2021}},"Braggan's Fist":{"content":"# Introduction\nOperating on a smaller scale than most archived gangs, Braggan's Fist was a criminal organisation located on the planet Corelia, in and around the City of Tyrena.

Contrary to other Mandalorian groups, the Protectors were organized into a military-like structure.

Each member of the Council donated something to this CIS, either troops or credits. Their headquarters were located on three separate planets, Utapau, Geonosis, and Mustafar. The Separatists were the wealthiest group in the entire Galaxy and were full of greedy, corrupt loyalists. Most joined the Separatist Alliance because of either fear or greed, as the Separatist Alliance was known to enslave entire planets.# Section 1\nThe CIS had numerous different battle droids for different scenarios. Such as B1 Battledroids, which were on most battlefronts, and were made of an easily destroyed material but useful in numbers, B2 Battledroids, which were the more powerful counterpart, which had missiles attached into their arms, Spider Droids, which were agile and had a canon attached to their dome shaped head, Vulture Droids, which were the droid ships and were the equivalent to one X-Wing fighter used by the Clone Army, Hyena Bombers, which were the Vulture Droid’s counterpart, but instead they were bombers, and mostly bombed settlements and Republic bases, Commando Droids, which had a vibrosaber built into their arm, ready to use, Droidekas, which could curl up into a sphere and travel at outstanding speeds, and had a forcefield protecting them, Aqua Droid, which were used in water, such as flooded planets like Kamino or Mon Cala, Tactical Droid, which was a droid that relied on statistics to win battles, they were essentially generals commanding an army, Magna Guards, which were the personal guards of General Grievous, Droid Gunships, which is a droid itself, with its own programming algorithm, Tank Droids, which caused destructive blasts per shot, Hailfire Droids, which had a high velocity and was armed with notorious pinki missiles,\n\n# Section 2\nTri Droid, which was a droid which had three legs supporting a metallic sphere, and used its legs to try and trample the opponents and finally, a Proton Cannon, which needed a droid to power it, but it could penetrate shield generators, which was needed in the Separatists’ battles, Droid Tri-Fighters, which had three arched walls surrounding a glass sphere where the controller was located, Buzz Droids which could be used to penetrate materials, it was typically used to deteriorate the ship’s hull, D-Wing Droids, which were robot pterodactyls, they hunted their prey and killed them via guns built into their arms, Demolition Droid, which exploded, causing massive amounts of damage, the Combat Droid, which wasn’t very practical and was rarely seen on the battlefield, the Homing Spider Droid which was just a droid which looked like the Spider Droid but was incredibly oversized and the Crab Droid, which was just an updated Spider Droid with a different look.

The Sith Apprentice located them and killed them and was successful with her mission.\n\nMany centuries later, Darth Gravid, a Sith Lord, concluded that pure attachment to the Dark Side would curse the Sith. He sought a new philosophy where the Sith would lean towards the Light Side of the Force. Sealed away in his Jaguada bastion, the Darth sought to destroy the old Sith philosophy from Master to apprentice since the time of Darth Bane, including the artifacts such as the Holocrons, Crystals, Scrolls, Tomes, and Amulets; He burned them, ensuring that the future of the Sith will commit to his philosophy. \n\nDarth Gravid had an apprentice, Darth Gean; she opposed the teachings and visions of her Master. She was frightened of the destruction of the old Sith teachings and proceeded to launch her Master, attacking and killing him with her bare hands–ending the plans of Gravid. Though many of the Sith artifacts were destroyed, including the technique of essence transfer–a technique used to transfer one’s consciousness to another body–she managed to preserve some of the teachings to ensure the continuity of Darth Bane’s intentions–full allegiance to the Dark Side.\n\nSome time later, Darth Plagueis recounted Darth Gravid’s demise into seeking out the lost method of immortality. As usual, Darth Plagueis would do something similar to Gravid’s–an attempt to end the Rule of Two, which states that there can only be two Sith at once–a master and an apprentice, which only ended up being murdered by his own apprentice, Darth Sidious, who felt that it was against the philosophy of the Dark Side.\n\n","meta":{"index":12,"author":"kurtnicolo","name":"Light Sith","release_year":2021}},"The Galactic Republic":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Galactic Republic, also known as the Republic, the High Republic, and the Old Republic, was a democratic union comprising thousands of worlds spread across the galaxy. The Galactic Constitution was the supreme law of the Republic, which was governed by a legislative body of senators, and the Main head of state The Chancellor\n\nIt was the Senate's prerogative to elect a Supreme Chancellor from among their ranks to serve as the government's leader. Coruscant, an ecumenopolis referred to as Galactic City, was the capital world of the Republic, and therefore, the seat of the Senate.\n\nthe Republic governed the galaxy from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim Territories, uniting various sentient species, human and alien alike, under one banner. As its power grew, the Republic engaged in various wars with the Mandalorians, the Zygerrian Slave Empire, and several Sith Empires. The Jedi Order, a religious order adhering to the light side of the Force, supported the Republic against its enemies.\n\n\nThe original Galactic Republic was formed in approximately 25,000 BBY and rose to power by expanding across the galaxy, with several of its founding members being the planets Alderaan and Chandrila. Around 20,000 years prior to the Imperial Era, the Thisspiasian Blood Court joined the Galactic Republic in its early founding.# Section 1\nMultiple versions of the Republic existed throughout its extensive history; historians referred to this pre-modern period as the \"Old Republic,\" although the government's official name was the Galactic Republic.\n\n\nTowards the start of the Separatist Crisis, the Galactic Senate passed the Military Creation, which led to the creation of the Grand Army of the Republic and the Republic Navy. Outfitted with armor weapons and gear,[ clone troopers were the backbone of the Republic Military. Bred for loyalty and combat, clones symbolized the future of galactic warfare at the time of the Clone Wars, the conflict that derived its name from their ranks. The training that they experienced molded the clone troopers into a highly efficient army, and because they retained the ability to think creatively despite their stunted independence, they were considered far superior to their droid counterparts. In their first battle against the Separatist Droid Army, the Grand Army displayed a level of military strength unseen in the history of the galaxy.\n\n","meta":{"index":15,"author":"SRGATOGAMER","name":"The Galactic Republic","release_year":0}},"The Order of Revan":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Order of Revan was a group of followers who followed the Force user Revan.

The Order of Revan was founded once a human by the name of Tani found ancient records on Revan. The event happened much before The Cold War between the Galactic Republic and The Sith Empire. Revan was a force user that had been both a Sith and a Jedi. She learned about how Revan confronted the Sith Emperor and believed he had emerged victorious. She believed the throne of The Sith Empire rightfully belonged to Revan.# Section 1\nTani afterwards would found the Order of Revan, also known as The Revanites. The Order was widely popular due to them recruiting from all races, no matter what species they were. The group based all their teachings and beliefs on Revan’s philosophies. The Order would grow at such a rapid rate, it even caught the attention of the Dark Council. The Council sought to end the Order. Consequently, the Revanites had to flee from Kaas City, a city located on Dromund Kaas. This forced the members to find  refuge in the jungles of Dromund Kaas.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Revanites built a compound in the jungle. In their base of operations was a cave. In this cave, members would often go to worship Revan. A small sect of the cult would devote their entire lives to Revan, separating themselves from Imperial society. While most members would meet in secret to practice their beliefs. The Dark Council frowned upon the cult. They disliked their mix of Jedi and Sith teachings. One of their main goals at the time was to destroy the Order before their beliefs spread even farther across the Empire. The Revanites posed such a threat to both the Sith and Jedi that they forced them into a temporary truce just to take down the Order of Revan. This was a huge deal throughout the galaxy as it was very strange to see the Jedi and Sith work together, as they had been enemies for many centuries.

The Rift Alliance was held by similar ideals that the Republic was incompetent. This was the original intent for the faction, but when Jedi Master who was the Barsen’thor of the Jedi Order went to bring the Rift Alliance back into the folds of the Republic instead, the Barsen’thor rallied the Rift Alliance against the Sith Empire’s Children of the Empire.# Section 1\nThe Rift Alliance had an odd formation, with half of the planets in the Alliance being non-separationists, an example is the planet of Sarkhai joining out of curiosity. However, many planets were wishing to secede fully from the Republic, if they did, it would have spelled an end for the Republic as a whole. One planet such as Saleucami, which is a major trading hub in the Outer Rim. Another, Aeten II, had mining operations that brought vital ores and crystals that would have halted fleet construction for the Republic. Some members of the Rift Alliance weren’t a part of the Republic as well, seeking aid from a larger galactic body. They were neutral planets, those like Balmorra and Manaan.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Rift Alliance operated by a mutual agreement between the different worlds and had no real form of a governing body. The planets' economic and military resources were a source of protection against the pirates for the Alliance. Especially the pirates of the White Maw harassing them, they pooled up a lot of resources from within the Alliance to protect themselves. To have easier access, they hid resources on a research facility on the planet Quesh. Although the Rift Alliance employed the facility, it was run by Selkath personnel.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Barsen’thor was requested by Supreme Chancellor Dorian Janarus at the Council’s discretion to bring the Rift Alliance back into the Republic’s sphere of influence. Losing any number of the planets in the Rift Alliance would be devastating to the Republic and Chancellor Janarus knew this, so he had recruited the Jedi Master. However, the Barsen'thor didn't just bring the Rift Alliance back to the Republic. They had rallied the Alliance into a formidable military force to face off the Children of the Emperor in the Battle of Corellia. The Chancellor Dorian Janarus was assassinated before he could see the end of the reintegration by unknown assassins.

They manipulated the Force to increase the speed of the crop’s growth, and they also used the Force to heal injured and sick citizens. It was usually overseen by a Jedi Master, and they were the overseers of the project. It was extremely popular during the Clone Wars.

The Federation was still subject to attacks by mercenaries and pirates on remote trade routes. That’s why the Galactic Senate has been asked for permission to develop armed robots to defend themselves against pirates. At first, the battle droids weren’t the best, and they didn’t differ from normal humanoids. But as time went by, the Neimoidians became more and more afraid of their ships and new models and better weapons were added. The Trade Federation did not have a regular droid army until it joined the Confederation of Independent Systems and cooperated with Darth Sidious.# Section 1\nDarth Sidious enabled the Trade Federation to form a regular army out of a real incident. Federation began the production of droids. Three large companies: Baktoid Armor Workshop, Haor Chall Engineering, and Colicoid Creation Nest, signed contracts and got to work. A huge amount of droids were produced and hundreds more were in plans. The most common ones were Battle Droids B1 and Super Battle Droids B2, as they were the most efficient to produce and also not that expensive. For example, Droideka, which were also first on the production line. However, the entire production was kept secret although the model B1 was shown during the summit of Eriad. They were designed to resemble the skeletons of Neimoidians, making them more fearful. The Separatist Army, however, was formed from droids of various allies of Count Dooku and members of the Confederation of Independent Systems. The first military operation took place during the Naboo invasion, but the droids have been tested in the Kartak system before. Most limbs were interchangeable, which allowed damaged droids to be quickly repaired and sent back to combat. B1 Battle Droid had an energy amplifier unit on the back and an antenna for a signal support. The high-performance motor was in the chest. On the head were a motion processor, the main command register, optical sensors, and built-in cyclic memory. A base team consisted of 8 droids, a platoon of 7 teams (56 droids), and the company of 2 platoons (112 droids). The battalion consisted of 784 droids and additional logistical droids. They were transported by Multi-Troop Transport along with tanks or other support equipment.\n\n# Section 2\nEarly versions of the droids were firmly tied to the central control units, making them vulnerable to their destruction or signal disruption. When the Trade Federation invaded Naboo, the droids conquered the planet well, but in the final battle, they suffered a defeat as the droid control ship was destroyed. At that time, all droids were shut down. After the experience with Naboo, an improved model with an expanded intelligence module and greater autonomy was introduced. It was also decided to build several droid control ships so that the Naboo battle situation would never happen again. The motor skills of the droids did not differ significantly from most humanoids, and the manipulators made it possible to operate most of the weapons designed for humans. The biggest advantage of B1 was its quantity, with little effort you could bring countless of them into battle by flooding the enemy with them. However, in small groups, they were easily defeated by clones and Jedi. To increase combat ability, BX commando droids, droid tank NR-N99, spider droids OG-9, etc. were added to the army. The droids' greatest weakness was that they were gaining no combat experience. All droids had the same abilities and didn’t learn more during battles. In contrast to the clone army, which evolved and gained experience after each fight. After the Battle of Coruscant, the Droid Army lost the majority of its forces and never regained its full numbers.\n\n# Section 3\nWhen it was discovered that Grievous was hiding in Utapau after the Battle of Coruscant, Master Kenobi was sent there with a clone squad. After the battle on Mustafar which was won by Republic General Grievous was killed by Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, the leaders of Seperatist managed to escape the planet. In the meantime, many important things have happened on Coruscant: Palpatine revealed his dual identity to Anakin Skywalker, who informed Mace Windu about it. The Jedi tried to arrest the long-sought Sith, but Palpatine – with the help of Anakin, whom he eventually pulled to the Dark Side – defeated them and then gave Order 66. During these events, there were several battles, including at Mygeeto. The clones were still fighting the droids on many fronts of the galaxy, and Sidious ordered his new student Darth Vader to go to Mustafar. There, the Sith killed all surviving members of the Separatist Council and turned off the Separatist armies, thus ending the Clone Wars and the life of the Confederacy. However, the droids weren't completely removed from the Army.

They were a nomadic species of humanoids that lived on the desert planet of Tatooine. The Tusken Raiders were known for their violent raids and ambushes, and their reputation as fierce warriors made them a force to be reckoned with. Despite their fearsome reputation, very little is known about the Tusken Raiders, and their culture and society remain shrouded in mystery.# Section 1\nVery little is known about the history of the Tusken Raiders. According to legend, they were the descendants of a group of early settlers who were stranded on Tatooine thousands of years ago. Over time, they adapted to the harsh desert environment and developed their own unique culture and society.\n\nThe Tusken Raiders were a humanoid species with rough, scaly skin and glowing yellow eyes that could see in the dark. They wore distinctive robes and masks that covered their faces, made from the hides of banthas. The Tusken Raiders were a highly territorial and fiercely independent species, and they viewed outsiders as a threat to their way of life. They were known for their distinctive guttural language, which was difficult for outsiders to understand.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Tusken Raiders were skilled hunters and fighters, and they often engaged in raids and ambushes against other groups, including settlers and Jawas. They used a variety of weapons, such as gaderffii sticks, rifles, and explosives. They were also known to use bantha mounts as transportation and pack animals. Tusken Raiders had a strong connection to the natural world and often performed rituals to honor the spirits of the desert and their ancestors.\n\nTusken Raiders were generally hostile towards other species, especially humans. They viewed outsiders as intruders on their land and often attacked them on sight. However, there were instances where Tusken Raiders formed alliances or engaged in trade with other groups. The Jawas, for example, had a tenuous relationship with the Tusken Raiders, and they sometimes exchanged goods and services with each other. There have also been reports of Tusken Raiders working with bounty hunters and mercenaries, although these partnerships were usually short-lived.\n\n# Section 3\nDespite their relatively small numbers, the Tusken Raiders have had a significant impact on galactic history. Their attacks on settlers and travelers have caused widespread fear and prompted many to arm themselves for protection. Tusken Raiders have also been involved in conflicts with other groups, such as the Republic and the Separatists, during the Clone Wars. They have been known to attack both sides indiscriminately and have even fought against Jedi and Sith warriors.\n\nOne of the most well-known Tusken Raiders is the infamous Tusken Raider who attacked a young Anakin Skywalker. This encounter had a significant impact on Anakin's development and was a key moment in his journey to becoming Darth Vader. Another notable Tusken Raider is A'Sharad Hett, a powerful and skilled Jedi Knight who was raised among the Tusken Raiders and later became a Sith Lord. The Tusken Raiders' most infamous act, however, was their massacre of a group of moisture farmers in the town of Anchorhead, which led to a retaliation by a young Luke Skywalker. This incident also contributed to the rift between the Lars family and the local Tusken Raider tribe.\n\n","meta":{"index":53,"author":"DioneSenko","name":"Tusken Raiders","release_year":2021}},"Anti-Terrorism Unit":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Anti-terrorism unit was a special civilian unit of the Coruscant Security Force. Providing and deploying specialised officers of the CSF who were expertly trained in conducting counter-terrorist operations such as counter-intelligence, special reconnaissance and covert surveillance. They would work alongside the Jedi Order, Senate Guard and often special Republic military units to conduct sensitive operations across Coruscant.# Section 1\nThe anti-terrorism unit was founded roughly around 22 BBY but had numerous predecessors dating as far back as the Cold war era. Due to the large population of Coruscant and the fact it serves as the capital of the Galactic Republic and later on the First Galactic Empire as well as the New Republic, the planet is often the site of large and small scale attacks, large criminal and gang activity as well as a target for terrorism and spies. \n\nThe anti-terrorism unit was founded to conduct operations that would require specialised training and sensitivity above that of a regular CSF constable. The organisation would eventually become competent enough to work alongside the Grand Army of the Republic’s Special Operations Brigade and throughout its history would have combat records against some of the most dangerous foes in the galaxy, including the Sith.\n\n# Section 2\nNot much is known about the recruitment and training of the anti-terrorism unit. Due to the nature of its operations, it’s authority and from what we know of some of its members, it is safe to assume the recruitment and training of the anti-terrorism unit was highly selective. The organisation retained ex-members of the Senate Guard and Republic military, as well as civilian informants, analysts and a wide variety of CSF constables. \n\nThe anti-terrorism unit was different from a conventional counter-terrorism unit in that it was much more of an intelligence based service. It would conduct wire tappings, use informants, carry out interrogations and spy on the general public of Coruscant. It would then use this information to provide briefings to units more qualified to carry out raids and arrests, such as the Special Weapons Teams and Republic Commandos.\n\n# Section 3\nThe anti-terrorism unit’s predecessors would be involved in large scale operations during the Cold War era. In which they would be involved in rooting out Imperial Intelligence and Sith operations on Coruscant. They worked closely with Jedi Peacekeepers and Republic Special Forces elements when raiding the Headquarters of the Black Sun Gang after they had taken over multiple districts of Coruscant and were being secretly given weapons and equipment by the Sith Empire to undermine Republic progress on the planet. \n\nLater during the Clone Wars the anti-terrorism unit would help the Null-ARC Black Operations unit as well as Omega and Delta Squad of the Republic Special Operations Brigade in unravalling a seperatist terrorist network on Coruscant. They would be crucial in assisting the commando units in identifying targets, such as buildings and individuals who were involved in the terrorist network and were complimented on their abilities by Null-ARC Captain ‘’Ordo’’ after the operation.\n\n# Section 4\nThe most notable member of the anti-terrorism unit was Jaller Obrim. Obrim served as Captain of the anti-terrorism unit after completing his service within the Senate Guard and would remain in the anti-terrorism unit until its eventual disbandment after Order 66. He would distinguish himself during the black operation to reveal seperatist terrorist cells on Coruscant by providing information to Kal Skirata that would allow the Null-ARC Troopers, Omega Squad and Delta Squad to conduct undercover raids and eventually bring down the terrorist cell. After Order 66 Obrim would serve in the Imperial Security Bureau but would use his position to aid anti-Imperial rebels as well as assisting Kal Skirata and his adopted Commandos who went into hiding after the war.\n\n# Section 5\nIn the final years of the Clone Wars, especially after the operation which saw the destruction of a seperatist terror cell on Coruscant, the anti-terrorism unit was given increased authority much more akin to that of a secret police force. They would notably be granted the ability to conduct arrests, raids and searches without a warrant as well as carry out illegal wire tappings and surveillance. \n\nThis level of freedom would serve to benefit the organisation after Order 66 as they were eventually folded into the Imperial Security Bureau and would conduct their duties with a larger amount of freedom and authority than during their service to the Republic. Ex-elements of the anti-terrorism unit would carry out investigations into anti-Imperial cells, later known as Rebel Cells on Coruscant and the core worlds.\n\n# Section 6\nOnce the New Republic was established as well as the Coruscant Security Forces the need to recreate the anti-terrorism unit was clear. With Imperial warlords rampant throughout the galaxy as well as many Imperial sympathisers remaining on Coruscant there were numerous real threats of terrorism on Coruscant and the core worlds. The organisation would continue its service during the creation of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. During this time period the area of authority of the anti-terrorism unit was known to have increased, conducting operations off-world that would prevent incoming attacks on Coruscant.

By doing this they fell right into the trap set by the Sith, but they would not discover this until it was far too late.\n           A week into the war, the Supreme Chancellor made official the Order’s involvement, giving Jedi ranks within the GAR. Padawans would now be Jedi Commanders, Knights would be Generals, Masters would be Senior Generals, and members of the Jedi Council received the title of High General. Some Jedi refused the call to return to Coruscant to receive a rank, and either attempted to stay out of the war or became Dark Jedi and joined the Confederacy’s Dark Acolytes.\n           Those that did fight for the Republic provided a boon for the GAR, and many victories throughout the war. Their skill with the Force, not to mention with their lightsabers, made them deadly in combat and a psychological menace to enemy commanders. Nonetheless, many Jedi died or lost their way in battle - especially at the hands of General Grievous. Notable Jedi who fought in the war include the following.# Section 1\nYoda - The Grand Master of the Jedi Order, Yoda was quite possibly the most famous Jedi to ever have lived. Nearing nine hundred years of age by the outset of the war, the old sage was generally kept far from the front lines, but Yoda still saw combat to great effect at Geonosis, Rugosa, Vjun, and Kashyyyk. He had no GAR unit attached to him (though he did have the rank of High General), and generally operated with the Coruscant Guard in combat operations. Yoda mostly managed Jedi affairs during the war. He survived the conflict, and went into exile on Dagobah.\nMace Windu - Formerly the head of the Jedi Council, Mace Windu passed the title off to Yoda when the Clone Wars started to direct Jedi involvement in the conflict. Seen as the most skilled fighter in the entire Republic, Windu took charge of Republic Systems Army Alpha and saw combat on a number of worlds, from Dantooine and Ryloth to Anaxes and Coruscant. The 187th Legion was Windu’s personal unit, selected by him as one of the best of the best. Windu was killed by Darth Sidious on Coruscant, shortly before the beginning of the Jedi Purge.\n\n# Section 2\nObi-Wan Kenobi - Nicknamed “The Negotiator” by the media, Obi-Wan Kenobi was in charge of Systems Army Gamma, and with his apprentice (later comrade) Anakin Skywalker saw some of the hottest fighting of the war. Alongside Skywalker and Clone Commander Cody he fought in hundreds of battles, chiefly with the 212th Attack Battalion, a famed division of the 7th Sky Corps. Kenobi survived the war, and went into exile on Tatooine.\nAnakin Skywalker - Considered the Chosen One of Jedi legend and championed as the Hero With No Fear by the HoloNet and Supreme Chancellor alike, Anakin Skywalker was one of the most powerful Jedi in galactic history. Originally apprenticed to Obi-Wan Kenobi, Skywalker was made a Jedi Knight in the war’s seventh month for his actions on Praesitlyn and Vjun. Skywalker commanded the famed 501st Legion alongside Clone Captain Rex, and fought on innumerable worlds. He fell to the Dark Side at the end of the war, and became Darth Vader.\n\n# Section 3\nKi-Adi-Mundi - Quiet but brilliant, Ki-Adi-Mundi was a Cerean Jedi Master who was put in charge of Systems Army Delta. Fighting with the Galactic Marines, Ki-Adi-Mundi won the Republic several extremely bloody battles, and fought on worlds ranging from Hypori and Geonosis to Mygeeto and New Bornalex alongside Commander Bacara. He was killed by his troops on Mygeeto.\nPlo Koon - A Kel Dor Council member and expert starfighter pilot, Plo Koon led Systems Army Beta alongside Commander Wolffe. His personal unit was nicknamed the Wolfpack, and suffered an extremely high casualty rate, with only three of its original members surviving the war. Koon was shot down by his starfighter escort on Cato Neimoidia.\nAgen Kolar - In charge of Systems Army Epsilon, Agen Kolar was an expert swordsman and stalwart commander. Operating from Taris and fighting heavily in the Mirgoshir Campaign early in the war, Kolar was slain by Darth Sidious on Coruscant.\nKit Fisto - An eternally cheerful Nautolan, Kit Fisto led Systems Army Zeta to many victories beyond hope, and was known to his men as compassionate but deadly. Alongside Commander Monnk he fought in and won several battles, including two on Mon Calamari. Fisto, too, was killed by Darth Sidious on Coruscant.\n\n# Section 4\nShaak Ti - One of the Jedi Order’s most skillful, Shaak Ti was a strong leader and veteran of many battles. Put in charge of Systems Army Eta, Ti spent much of the war on Kamino, and participated in all three defenses of the cloning world. Other worlds she fought on included Hypori, Brentaal IV, and Dagu. She was a veteran of several duels with General Grievous, and survived the war.\nSaesee Tiin - Considered second only to Anakin Skywalker in a starfighter cockpit, Saesee Tiin led Systems Army Theta, and maintained some of the best starfighter groups in the Republic, as well as a healthy legion of clone marines. Tiin was cut down by Darth Sidious on Coruscant.\nEven Piell - Small but deadly, Even Piell was another Jedi Council member who saw action on the front lines. The leader of Systems Army Iota, Piell operated chiefly from Eriadu, and fought to many victories alongside native Eriaduan Captain Tarkin. Piell was killed by Separatist-released hounds on Lola Sayu during an escape from the Citadel prison in the war’s sixteenth month.\nOppo Rancisis - Famed as a Jedi battlemaster and brilliant tactician, Rancisis was one of the Jedi Order’s best generals, and devised winning strategies for countless battles. His skill in battle meditation allowed his clone units to follow his plan with surgical precision. Rancisis was assassinated by Dark Acolyte Sora Bulq during the Siege of Saleucami, in the war’s final month.\n\n# Section 5\nLuminara Unduli - A narrow-minded but strong Jedi Master, Luminara Unduli and her Padawan, Barriss Offee, fought on battlefields from Geonosis to Kashyyyk over the course of the war. Unduli’s clone counterpart was Commander Gree, an expert in the Republic’s militia model. She was executed by clone troopers on Kashyyyk.\n\n","meta":{"index":20,"author":"DemshyAlkion","name":"The Jedi Order","release_year":2020}}},"meta":{"name":"Organizations","index":14}},"Non-Sentient Species":{"articles":{"Frigosian":{"content":"# Introduction\nFrigosians was a species that was native to the planet Tansyl 5.

The Rancor was transported from the Tarsunt system. On the Rancor’s way to a merchant named Grendu, killing the crew of the ship. The ship ended up crashing on Tatooine. A group of Jawas discovered the beast and immediately alerted Jabba’s servants, Bib Fortuna and BidloKwerve. The two gave the Rancor as a gift to Jabba for his birthday. Bib was rewarded with a promotion to Jabba’s majordomo, while Kwerve was made one of the Rancor’s many victims.# Section 1\nJabba would use his Rancor frequently. Jabba would end up dropping Twi’lek dancers who resisted him. Jabba’s Tusken battle talisman ended up falling in there too, meeting the same fate as many others. Jabba later used it against Luke Skywalker, and accidentally one of his guards. The Rancor easily ate his guard, but Skywalker was able to stand a chance. Luke placed a large femur in its mouth, distracting it and letting him go. The Rancor attempted to get its grip back on Luke, yet out of self defense the young Jedi Knight smashed its hand in a rock. Luke then lured it under a heavy portcullis and threw a skull belonging to the beast’s first victim smashing the controls for a gate. In response, the gate pierced the beast, killing it.

Loth-Cats are also part of the subspecies of the Tookas, a feline group of specimens that span across the galaxy though are most commonly found within Coruscant. Loth-Cats can be easily identified through their definite characteristics of pointed ears and thick tail and can range between the colours of dark yellow, brown or white.# Section 1\nAlthough these felines can appear to be friendly and cutesy, they can be tenacious hunters and are extremely dedicated to their prey. Should they be intervened by anyone who showed hostility to them, Loth-Cats would do their utmost best to fend off their assailant. Considering their nature of living a ‘lone wolf’ lifestyle and hunting for food for a living, it can be quite the challenge to tame them, albeit not impossible. If one were to overcome the difficulties that come with taming these species, they can serve as great companions.

They boasted multiple pincer legs and a large tubular mouth riddled with concentric rows of teeth. These hunters had an excellent visual perception and sense of smell. The presence of k’lor’slugs were known since the Great Galactic War and have since been included as a holomonster for the strategy game dejarik.# Section 1\nThe beasts were widely regarded as pests as their queens could lay hundreds of eggs at a time with a rapid incubation period. Starship pilots were acquainted with these species as they were known to proliferate in the dark and unsanitary conditions of a spacecraft. The sound of a group of eggs hatching is known as “a Hutt’s cry,” which was derived from a tragedy during a Hutt’s yearly gladiatorial tournament where a hunter and the Hutt were devoured by hundreds of k’lor’slugs.\n\n","meta":{"index":40,"author":"SciFalded","name":"K'lor'slug","release_year":2020}},"Breather Gand":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Gand had a rare subspecies known as Breathers. Breathers were long thought to be an older breed that would eventually either evolve, die out, or become another coexisting species on their homeplanet of Gand. Breathers possessed lungs like most organisms along with the usual assortment of internal organs that many other humanoid species had as well. However, this subspecies adapted by only being able to breathe ammonia, hence why they could not survive offworld without respiratory equipment that provides them with their needed gaseous elements. Exposure to oxygen is similar to being burned from the inside out, with acid coating the lungs, and if it ever were to happen, it would require organ transplants. If a Breather were exposed to oxygen, they may experience chest pain and various other symptoms from the respiratory system. As a result of the many symptoms, many Gand that faced the endangerment of offworld exposure were unable to receive proper treatment, possibly due to the unavailability of items to repair the tissue. Therefore, Breathers had a high mortality rate.","meta":{"index":23,"author":"PhaseSpectr","name":"Breather Gand","release_year":2020}},"Cannok":{"content":"# Introduction\nCannoks, a small four-legged creature inhabiting the Dxun moon of the Onderon world. Despite showing little capacity to deal damage to Humans, they had a strong desire to bite and chew anything they managed to acquire.\n\nThese creatures were generally regarded as annoying, polluting ecosystems with their high reproduction rates and tendency to explore in areas they weren’t wanted.\n\nOverall, they were strong biologically and resembled the characteristics of many other four-legged non-sentient creatures. They travelled in packs and weren’t involved in any particularly interesting historical events. One however, is that they were transported to Telos IV in an attempt to restore the ecological balance of the world after Darth Malak had eroded the surface of the planet.# Section 1\nThe creatures varied between green, yellow and brown colours with dark hues. They had (2) eyes that protruded outside of their head. The creatures had long rows of teeth in their wide and hollowed out mouth, which stood awkwardly in front of their four-legged body. Xaxax were clearly hunters, and used the rows of spikes on their backs to defend themselves.\n\n# Section 2\nSurprisingly, these creatures had little to no fear towards basic elements of defence. This included fire, and small groups of Humans. They generally avoided small villages, but would single out solo humans, and tear them apart in packs.\n\nAlone, these creatures acted and lived in a pattern, observing their surroundings casually, eating where necessary, excreting and reproducing.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Cannoks were rather low on the food chain often feasted on by maalraas, boma and zakkeg. Particularly strong Cannoks could fend off Maalaraas, but otherwise they were dined on regularly.\n\nThe Cannoks are a consistent species, existing throughout the Mandalorian wars and other events. The Mandalorians often left them alone, regarding them as less than worthy of being killed by “skilled hunters.”\n\nThe species often caused trouble in the areas they thrived in as they overgrazed plant life, and devoured living creatures below them in the food chain.\n\nNotably, some Cannoks once ate integral parts to a phase-pulse converter whereas a Jedi Exile would respond by killing and gutting all of them to retrieve the parts.\n\nAs previously mentioned, they were purposefully bred on Telos IV to rehabilitate the world's plant life, but unfortunately they did the opposite and the population growth of the Cannok destroyed the ecosystem.\n\n","meta":{"index":13,"author":"Souleth","name":"Cannok","release_year":2021}},"Exobar":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Exoboar was a dangerous non-sentient creature native to planet Makeb.

For generations, The Hutt Cartel had been in control of the planet Makeb. Due to this reason, having a visitor on Makeb was not as common as in other planets; this allowed Exoboars to live in peace.

They were sinuous reptiles with huge leathery wings, usually known for having two heads. They also held a pair of yellow slitted eyes, along with a long whip-like tail that held a poisonous stinger at the very end. Their skin was infused with a sith alloy, allowing them to withstand attacks from a lightsaber. As a contrast to their appearance, these creatures were known to be shy and mindless, and spent most time in hiding. They tend to travel and hunt alone, rather than travelling in packs. For most of their existence, they spent time searching for prey, using the thermal sense they get from their vision that they mainly use when scanning for threats.# Section 1\nWhen catching their prey, the hydra would dive down in swoops, like the condor dragon, and use their multiple jaws coated with razor-sharp teeth to bite into their prey, along with using their claws and the stingers on their tails to poison their victims. Once the prey succumbed, or died from the poison, the hydra took the corpse back to its lair. Battle hydras were also known for being influenceable to commands from Force-sensitive dark side users, and using them for diversions or for battles. The beasts were not known for being hostile towards other individuals unless spurned by the will of a Dark Jedi, even being used by Sith Lords as their close and personal bodyguards.\n\n# Section 2\nBattle hydras, before becoming docile, were originally creatures created by the great Sith Lord known as Exar Kun, using Sith alchemy that he studied from the deep depths of Yavin 4. His original intention for their creation was to be fierce guardians to test his theories. Due to Exar’s death in the Great Sith War, the battle hydras all split off and retreated into the deep caverns of Yavin 4, becoming not only native creatures regressing to normal predatory behavior, but rare sights to everyone on the planet. The beasts only emerged from their caves to hunt, mainly spending most of their time prowling the steamy skies of the planet.\n\n# Section 3\nFor a millennia, battle hydras became forgotten and unheard of, until the early days of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum. In this time, Exar used the dark shade of his spirit to summon battle hydras to attack Luke Skywalker. Close to being able to succeed, Luke was able to fend off against the beasts using his lightsaber, until the variant was discovered by Luke’s students. After this event, the New Jedi Order rarely encountered the beasts.

These beasts lived up to the ripe old age of 100 years old, but their strength did not suffer from age. Krayt dragons were studied by xenobiologists, who then determined that they were a relative of the Kell dragon. There were also thoughts of it descending from the mysterious species of Duinuogwuin, but this was never proven. Even though a Krayt dragon’s teeth were sharp, they couldn’t chew their prey enough to digest it, and thus they ingested stones and rocks that would grind the food to mush within their stomachs. During this grinding, the stones would become smooth, pearl-like objects known as Krayt dragon Pearls. The Jedi were able to tune these pearls into focusing crystals, used in their lightsabers, but they were also a commodity amongst jewelers.\n\n# Section 2\nDue to a Krayt dragon’s power, the Sand People of Tatooine, also known as Tusken Raiders, used killing one of these as a ritual for joining a tribe. This was done by leaving a teenage Tusken in the desert, who was only let back in if they managed to kill a Krayt dragon.

As Nam Chorios was their homeworld, a Droch could only gain true sentience after getting into a user’s skin and draining much intelligence from the host. The species would avoid detection while doing this as they were able to mimic the host's electrochemical fields and tissue composition, essentially becoming a part of the host while doing their act. Each second they would drain for, the more intelligent they would become. If they killed them, then they would collect the user’s whole intelligence. Larger Drochs could even absorb smaller ones for survival and an easier way than finding a host itself. Whenever they were exposed to light on their homeworld, they would become very sluggish and inactive because the sun was altered by things such as “tsil crystals”. This would not happen on other planets as they would not have these crystals. In 702 BBY, a colony of Drochs were found by the Grissmath Dynasty on Nam Chorios. They would decide to seed the world to create a Death Seed outbreak, which would easily kill the prisoners. However, it would fail due to the sun fragmentation that weakened the electrochemical bonds that the species had.

They have also been known to be found in the Naboo Abyss, and were found often being preyed upon by the large Colo Claw fish, as well as the Opee Sea killers. Most Faa scalefish were vicious predators, and often attacked anything on sight. The typical Faa was known to have a narrow body that had well-stiff, armored skin, and usually ranged from different colors from orange to red. They also had large tail fins that were usually colored with orange and white, which helps keep their swinging stabilized so they could move in columns with one another. The species usually inhabited themselves in small crevices, usually being in underwater rocks, also allowing for decent hiding spots to catch their prey from.# Section 1\nFaa were usually only found in deep waters. They were also very attracted to bright lights, thus leading them to hibernate around the underwater city of Otoh Gunga. A school of Faa could consist of  thirty scalefish, which proved to be extremely dangerous to lonesome unwitting creatures. The prey for Faa ranged from all kinds of different species, including Mee, Gorgs, Skettos, shiro-traps, and many more, mainly consisting of the species found living in deep waters, where the Faa usually dwelled in.

The most interesting aspect this creature has is that as they form a swarm together they form a sentient intelligence despite that each individual Fefze was non-sentient to begin with.# Section 1\nThese insects towered at a metre high with huge black exoskeletons protecting their interior. Their senses of smelling and hearing are provided by their antennae, whilst also their ability to communicate was done by rubbing and clicking their antennae. Fefze had the ability to fly due to the two hidden wings under their exoskeletons and if threatened they can curl up into a defensive shell.\n However, their digestive system was one of the keys to the survival of their species, since it was easily adaptable and could digest any carbon based organic material making their diet diverse. They achieved this by releasing a substance onto the food which let out the carbohydrates in the food. Then the Fefze would eat the carbohydrates leaving a protein rich paste behind of what is left. The digestive tract is also dubbed as a defense mechanism as they could spit powerful digestive substances at their predators to inflict harm upon them or just distract them. \n Because of the lack of food these insects lacked adept appendages, never developed technology and had few exports.\n\n# Section 2\nAs mentioned before, one single Fefze is not any more intelligent than another insect. But as they gather together in a swarm their intelligence multiplies. One swarm of ten to one hundred Fefze could last for centuries which is a very long time when compared to the 10 years that a single Fefze can last for. Each single Fefze counted for the intelligence of the swarm as a whole.\n Fefze swarms begin when they hatch from the same Fefze egg droplet. Swarms add more members to their ranks by participating in a mating ritual named as a “swarm dance”. Whilst a random egg droplet would be abandoned in hope that it would form another swarm in the next coming of years. This “swarm dance” actually has developed into an art form over time.\n\n# Section 3\nSwarms throughout the galaxy were hired as entertainers in visual arts, dancing and even as musicians. Some Fefze farms were recruited into organisations and colonists and food producers because they could create nourishment for other species with their digestive system. They were also even involved in politics, choosing various sides.

Another distant family member of the Firaxa are the Selkath, a sentient amphibian species that's believed to be part of the Progenitor’s lineage. Thus, it correlates to the fact that although the Firaxa were known to be hostile, they were never prone to attack a Selkath. The Firaxan Shark’s prominent weakness is their vulnerability to sonic pulses. With this knowledge, adventurers that explored the sea would travel with sonic emitters to protect themselves if a Firaxan Shark were to attack.# Section 1\nIn the past, scientists had been researching on creating a toxic repellent to provide better resistance against the Firaxan Sharks. However, in the midst of a mining operation, the Progenitor went into a fit of rage upon finding out the scientists had invaded her territory and harvested her treasured kolto.

They were also known for scavenging, and stealing food and certain things from the homes of natives. Condor Dragons have been known to be tameable and trained as well. A Tulgha witch by the name of Morag, was known for enslaving a Condor Dragon as her pet, and sending it out to destroy the food sources, such as sunberry trees, which grew out sunberries that kept the Ewok’s nourished and healthy.","meta":{"index":36,"author":"OceanPanik","name":"Condor Dragon","release_year":2020}},"Kintan Strider":{"content":"# Introduction\nKintan striders are ferocious creatures with an extraordinary healing ability.

Before going extinct, the striders were taken offworld, bred, and most notably used as guard beasts by many members of the Hutt Cartel. Kintan striders generally appear white with large shoulders and long arms that would hang almost to the ground. Striders utilize more primitive weapons such as clubs, sticks, and poles paired with their exceptional self-healing abilities.# Section 1\nThe Kintan striders are featured as a holomonster game piece in the Dejarik board game with the notable tactic ‘Kintan strider death gambit’.\n\n","meta":{"index":79,"author":"WeaponizedBoomer","name":"Kintan Strider","release_year":2021}},"Bordok":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Bordok within the species classification can be further divided into the equine branch of species.

Ewoks used this to great success.\n\nThese creatures ranged in colour across many shades of brown, and were nearly identical to horses. They however differed with the horns on their head that curved and twisted depending on the gender and age of the Bordok in question.# Section 1\nBordoks through evolution broke up into (2) species, a lesser variation which grew to (1.5) meters whilst a noticeably rarer breed grew to (3) meters or more. This naturally created hierarchies in their society whereas the bigger Bordoks ruled over the packs that they roamed in.\n\nThe Bordoks, despite being non-sentient, were very intelligent and reacted appropriately to various situations. At night, they were more reactive to predators due to having less visibility but during the day they only used energy where necessary.\n\nThe Bordoks looked after and ‘respected’ their riders well, and had an inherent protective tendency towards their young. The extent of this was so great and noble that often male Bordoks would sacrifice themselves to protect their young from predators.\n\nPrincess Kneesaa, a Jari Knitaka was actually recorded as having adopted a Bordok and named it Baga.

They soon evolved and gained a natural form of camouflage to disguise themselves against predators. Their bodies would be transparent when underfed and would reflect the color of the food they ate. Done by separating the digested food into ducts underneath the creature’s skin, which affected the color of the creature’s flesh. Dianoga migrated from Vodran by stowing away on garbage ships and were commonly found in trash compactors, garbage pits, and sewers across the galaxy. They were scavengers and only posed a threat when starving or threatened. Because they fed off of organic waste, they were sometimes referred to as garbage squids, sewage squids, or trash monsters.\n\n# Section 2\nSection Two: \nThese creatures would prove to be a nuisance by nesting within bodies of water, sewage systems, and any other large containment of dirty liquid. Smaller forms of the creature were known to crawl out of toilets. Although, they have also been proven useful since they help get rid of waste, leaving behind salvageable metals and minerals. In 22 BBY, there was an outbreak of these creatures within one of the districts on Coruscant. Up to twenty five residents had reported attacks from the creatures and it was believed that they would spread to the neighboring districts. The presence of just one of these guys was often a cause for alarm, since they could quickly multiply and pose a larger problem to the people in the area.\n\n# Section 3\nOne dianoga was known to have gotten aboard the first Death Star, and made its home in one of the garbage compactors. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia Organa had arrived at the Death Star in hopes of rescuing Leia. Not long after they entered the Death Star, they were forced into the trash compactor and were forced to face the creature. Attacking Skywalker and pulling him under all of the trash and murky water, but was scared away when the compactor walls started moving. The creature had burrowed into the wall safely until the Death Star was destroyed. There was another infestation within the palace of Prince Xizor. Dash Rednar was forced to encounter and fight off a fully grown dianoga while exiting the sewers. Dianoga could also be found on Anoat.

These beasts roamed the world of Mandalore for many years before the first Mandalorians walked on it’s soil. They dominated the hierarchy and fed on lesser species.\n\nThe first Mandalorian inhabitants called the Taung arrived under the leadership of a warrior known only in legends as “Mandalore the First”. He began an epic-like crusade to slaughter the beasts and establish humanity at the top of the hierarchy on the planet.# Section 1\nThese inhabitants, despite immense casualties, managed to conquer the beasts with just mere axes and swords. These crusaders later used the skull of the slain beasts as the symbol of the Mand’alor and Mandalore itself, embedded across economical, and cultural contexts.\n\nThis record of events is often criticised by scholars doubting the truth of several tiny human beings with axes being able to kill these monoliths, though it is strictly believed in the culture of Mandalore.\n\n# Section 2\nThe creatures themselves, other than being gigantic, had (4) large legs to carry it’s circular frame. It had a chestplate-like sternum which acted as a defensive barrier that protected its heart. Most notably, it’s facial features, which are imprinted on Mandalore banners, have two horns that protrude and circle around the beasts face toward it’s jaw. The female and male’s differ slightly in this sense, and that is how they are differentiated.\n\n# Section 3\nThe first human colonists arrived from Roon, the Mandalorians original homeworld. They intended to conquer the horned beasts in 7000 BBY and claim Mandalore as their own. After this successful campaign, the colonists called themselves Mando’ade creating their own language “Mando’a”. Mando’ade means “Children of Mandalore”.\n\nThe Mythosaur, though physically extinct, continued to metaphorically exist in all aspects of Mandalorian culture. Their bones were used to create mythosaur axes which were used in ceremonial gatherings, their sternum chest plates were used to create a ceremonial mask worn by the “Mand’alor”, their facial symbol was used as tattoos, business logos, and armour decorations.\n\n# Section 4\nInterestingly, near the end of the Galactic Republic a business-minded Mandalorian wanted to attract tourists to generate revenue. He created a massive replica of a Mythosaur skeleton (though not completely to scale, if Mythosaurs were actually the size of cities) and was going to use it at a theme park he planned on creating.\n\nHowever, the theme park never opened and the skeleton was solid to an Imperial garrison. The beast ultimately, was an interesting species that did not survive the conquest of humans.

This mainly happened during migratory periods. Ball creatures also had an innate and great ability to sense dangers of all sorts, and because of this, ball creatures were captured and domesticated by contract slaves of Duroon, to act as guard animals. Ball creatures were timid beasts but however, they would usually flee at the first sight or sign of any predator, and due to them not being smart, some predators used their timidity against them, and caused them to stampede over cliff sides and mountains.

At night though, dewbacks will herd together to retain heat and energy due to their cold-blooded nature and cold temperatures. This action consequently may be the source of their name as dew will form on their backs at night which also acts as a source of water. Dewbacks had various colored scales ranging from green, red, brown, and grey. However rare blue dewbacks also existed. These scales often had mottled scales or even camouflage patterns. Another important evolutionary feature of the dewback is the dewback’s special melanins contained in a dewbacks hide. Melanins act as a buffer from the heat from the two suns while also protecting vital fluids which allows them to go days without sources of water and substance.\n\n# Section 2\nOnce a year, dewbacks will gather at their traditionally mating grounds called the Jundland Wastes.

Centuries prior to the Galactic War, the Sith entity known as Tenebrae had possessed the warrior, completely eradicating his mind and taking over the empty husk that was left. Using his new host body, he meticulously forged his Empire over several centuries, adored by his people as the benevolent Immortal Emperor. He saw Zakuul as a playground, a place where he could have new experiences without the burden of archaic Sith teachings.# Section 1\nValkorion was a renowned champion of ancient Zakuul, a planet once home to superstitious nomadic tribes, the leaders of which were Force-sensitives. The tribes worshipped a pantheon of gods, but at the height of the Old Ways emerged a prophecy of a Demon Saviour that would topple the Old Gods and usher in an era of prosperity. Under the control of Tenebrae, Valkorion claimed the role of the Demon Saviour, unifying the tribes into his Eternal Empire and launching a campaign against the Old Ways. The Immortal Emperor assigned the tribal leaders as his first Knights of Zakuul, an order of Force-sensitive warriors that fanatically imposed his will. From the Knights came a sect known as the Scions of Zakuul, whose Force visions were used in his search for the Eternal Fleet concealed by Wild Space.\n\n# Section 2\nDecades before the Galactic War, Valkorion fathered three children with Senya Tirall, a Knight of Zakuul and member of his elite guard. He lacked compassion towards his children, yet his twin sons Arcann and Thexan aspired to gain his attention. Valkorion’s daughter, Vaylin, inherited immense strength in the Force, which both pleased and frightened him. He sent her away to Nathema for mental conditioning, where she faced extreme torture and cruelty for several years. The Immortal Emperor favoured his eldest son, Thexan, for his calm and collected nature, in stark contrast to Arcann’s impetuous behaviour.  In 3636 BBY, his twin sons proposed to command skirmishes against the perimeter worlds of the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire. Valkorion only allowed for Thexan to lead the raids, however Arcann joined his brother and by doing so disobeyed his father. Following the twins’ return to the Eternal Throne, Arcann attempted to murder his father after Valkorion turned his back on them, the breaking point for his years of built-up resentment all due to Valkorion’s indifference. Thexan intervened, only to be struck down by his own brother while the Immortal Emperor paid attention, ordering his now only son to come with him. In the same year, the Outlander was brought before the Eternal Throne, leading to Valkorion’s assassination and his death in a blast of Force energy. The entity that resided in him had survived and clung onto the Outlander, continuing to assume the identity of Valkorion in a series of Force visions and apparitions until the Outlander purged Tenebrae from their mind. A decade later in 3626 BBY, Valkorion’s likeness was formed in the mindscape of Satele Shan when the imprint of the Sith entity attempted to rebirth himself into the galaxy.\n\n","meta":{"index":95,"author":"SciFalded","name":"Valkorion","release_year":2021}},"Ashla":{"content":"# Introduction\nAshla was a female Togruta, who was enrolled in the Jedi Academy during the final decade of the Galactic Republic.

During his early years in his position as a member of the High Jedi Council, he among his colleagues started the event that is known as the Great Hunt, whose purpose was to hunt down the remnants of creatures that belong to the Sith after the recent war had ended. The Great Hunt was a success but came at the cost of multiple Jedi knights, most notably Duron Qel-Droma.# Section 1\nFollowing a short time of peace, Vrook served well on the Jedi Council of Dantooine, where he and Vandar Tokare were placed in charge of the Jedi Enclave that served as a Jedi academy on that planet. At some point, Vrook would later meet a young Meetra Suurik, who would later become the Jedi Exile to many others after many years had passed since their first encounter. Vrook's opinion on Meetra was that she was just a mediocre Jedi, though Vandar thought of her as a natural leader.\n\nBefore the Mandalorian War came, Vrook and his fellow councilors were involved in a case that would be known as the “Padawan Massacre”. Four padawans were killed except for one, Zayne Carrick, which he was framed for the murder. Instead in truth, it was their masters who murdered them instead. On the run, Zayne was able to communicate with the council on Dantooine, where they heard a part of his reason briefly before the transmission was cut off shortly.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter a period of time had passed, Vrook summoned the Jedi Masters that were involved in the case at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where he dismissed each of them and assigned them to different places in the galaxy as he was disappointed along with his councilors that they could not do what the most basic thing a Jedi Master could do: Protecting their padawan. While the Mandalorian war rages on, Zayne Carrick was able to get clear evidence for his innocence and decided to turn himself into a Jedi Sect that called themselves the Jedi Covenant, to which the Jedi High Council did not know its existence until now. \n\nWhen that time came, Vrook Lamar led a Jedi Strike team to the Jedi Covenant’s base to answer for their purposes and to save Zayne Carrick. However, during the process of it, they were taken by Orbital bombardment from Republic space forces that were hacked. Thus, Vrook had to call off the attack and fully retreat. Following this particular event shortly, Vrook led another Jedi team to the planet of Cathar to confront Revan’s faction, which they called themselves the Revanchist. During their time on the planet, all of the Jedis that were around had a vision of which the residents of the planet were massacred by the Mandalorians themselves.\n\nBecause of this, Vrook Lamar with his councilors was convinced to sanction the Revanchists' actions in the war. However, due to its occurrence, many Jedi that had followed Vrook to meet up with Revan’s faction went on to join in the war efforts. And despite sanctioning Revan’s faction actions, Vrook had a very low opinion of the Jedi who joined him. After the war ended, Vrook remained in his seat as part of the Jedi Council on Dantooine. Though, he was also one of the Jedi councilors who was responsible for the trials of Meetra Surik.\n\n# Section 3\nWhen the Jedi Civil war came, and Revan was captured after an attack, Vrook and many of his colleagues reprogrammed him with a new memory and drastically changed his personality as a loyal soldier to the Republic. He was involved with training Revan when the prodigal Knight started his Jedi training once more, though he was against it. When an unexpected attack came at Dantooine, Vrook was one of the few Jedi to survive it.\n\nAfter the Jedi Civil war had ended and the Jedi were on their knees due to a devastating blow to their numbers, of which, only a remaining hundred Jedi were alive by then. Vrook was the only councilor part of the Jedi Council on Dantooine who did not answer the call for the Jedi Conclave on Katarr. Which, he saved himself from it after a shocking ill event had happened there. During the early years of the First Jedi Purge, Vrook took refuge in what were the remains of the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine.\n\n# Section 4\nDuring his time in exile, Vrook allowed himself to be captured by a team of mercenaries who were hoping to take him to prison as they were planning to overthrow the local government of the planet. Though his imprisonment came to a short, as an unexpected Meetra Surik came to his unnecessary rescue, as she took care of his captors. Vrook criticized her briefly for ruining the plans in mind but nevertheless, he went on with it and later took part in the defense of Khoonda.\n\nAfter the small civil war ended, Vrook had a conversation with Meetra, with questions surrounding her trials and her unique connection to the force that had been recovered recently. He was also asked to join a Jedi Conclave that would be held at the Jedi enclave, to which he reluctantly agreed. When that time came, Vrook and what was left of his councilors told Meetra the truth about her trials and was deemed as a threat to the force, if not, life itself due to being a wound and an echo within it. In an attempt to cut off her connection to the force once more, his efforts were in vain when her mentor, Kreia, unexpectedly barges in and stops their process of doing so. Before Vrook and his fellow councilors could attack her, they all fell to her shortly as she stripped away their force simply with relative ease.\n\n","meta":{"index":189,"author":"BryanVerandus","name":"Vrook Lamar","release_year":2021}},"Han Solo":{"content":"# Introduction\nHan Solo was a male human smuggler who was from the planet Corellia. He achieved galactic fame as he was a member of the Rebel Alliance,  later on to the New Republic. His homeworld was on the planet Corellia, where he was raised and treated badly, he served Garris Shrike throughout his whole childhood before he escaped as a teenager.# Section 1\nHan Solo became a smuggler and fell in love with Bria Tharen, a commander in the Rebel Alliance. Bria had to leave Han due to her important responsibilities in the Rebel Alliance. After a while, Han Solo went to the Imperial Academy on the planet Carida, at the academy he learned his skills as a pilot. At flight school, Han’s records were miscellaneous: he gained excellent piloting marks, however, his academic record was under par, as he gained a number of offences and lack of performance reports. He was expelled, however, he saved a Wookie named Chewbacca from an Imperial officer holding a neuronic whip for resisting arrest. In appreciation, Chewbacca promised a life debt to Han for saving him with his life, whereas Chewbacca protected Han Solo for the rest of his life as they two had an unbreakable friendship. As he was expelled from the Imperial Academy, he became a smuggler once again with Chewbacca on Han Solo’s side. He also owned and piloted the famously known Millenium Falcon as he won a game of Sabacc, a card game, against Lando Calrissian, soon to be a friend. In time, he became one of the best smugglers in the whole galaxy.\n\n# Section 2\nWhile he was on the run from Imperial officers Han Solo met up with the Rebel Alliance, with respect to Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Princess Leia Organa, whom Han Solo helped save from the Death Star. Han Solo helped Luke Skywalker terminate the Death Star when it struck the Rebel’s base at Yavin 4, where they had kidnapped Leia Organa. Eventually, Han became an unconfirmed member of the Rebel Alliance, where he fell in love with Leia. In 8 ABY, Han Solo married Leia Organa, where they had three children named: Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin. The New Republic had many enemies throughout the years of their first existence, Han was always on the move, occasionally with Luke Skywalker, also known as Leia’s brother. Alongside his wife, and the faithful friend Chewbacca, his journey followed on, which led him to become the greatest known smuggler. Although his demise may have come, his legacy and greatness will live on forever in the hearts of all who rebel against their enemies. Before all that, as he was born on the planet Corellia, Han Solo was orphaned as a child. His earliest memories were of him being found by Garris Shrike in a Corellian spaceport, with no other memory of his life before. Garris Shrike was a bounty hunter, who raised Han and collected other orphans to raise, Shrike used them for tricks and stealing, training them to become thieves in his secret operation.  In the beginning, Han was made to go out as a beggar, using his young and innocent appearance to catch people’s attention. As he grew older, he learned how to pickpocket for stealing by practicing it on a droid of Shrike’s, then he got sent out to the streets to do that. At this time, Han made friends with a female Wookie named Dewlannamapia, nicknamed Dewlanna, who served food as a cook on-board the Liberator troopship, Shrike’s ship. Dewlanna raised Han as her own, taught him the language of the Wookies named Shyriiwook, and took care of him when he became ill. Han went on missions with Garris Shrike to participate in uncountable scams and illegal activities under Shrike’s command, his missions also included asteroid mining scam and swoop racing.\n\n# Section 3\nHan Solo deeply wanted to know further about his parents and his family. All that information was kept hidden by Garris Shrike to keep Han in control. He never got to learn about his bloodline for years. At one point in time, Dewlanna learned that Han Solo was from the well known House of Solo, as that was, he ran away from Garris Shrike on the planet Corellia. Han tried to track down his aunt named Tiion Solo and his cousin, named Thrackan Sal-Solo. He thought when they’ll meet back again it would be the happiest moment of his life, but he was wrong, his reunion with his family went horribly. Han’s aunt was housebound and mad, unavailable to leave the house due to old age and illness, while his cousin was a heartless bully. In the end, he was sold back to Garris Shrike. Han never learned about his parents, named Jonash and Jaina Solo, until he became an adult. Han Solo covered up the fact that he was descended from Berethron e Solo, who established democracy in Corellia as he served as the planet’s king.\n\n# Section 4\nHan Solo visited many planets following the commands of Shrike. Throughout a mission on the planet Corellia, Han met and made friends with a half-breed named Brey - a male Human/Nagai hybrid from Corellia - in the Nagai Invasion following closely to the Battle of Endor. Han’s education was patchy, just like the other children that Shrike used as beggars and robbers. However, most of the children managed to receive some knowledge from the ship’s computer, on Shrike’s ship called the Trader’s Luck. Han managed to learn - together with Dewlanna’s help - mathematics, physics, and history by reading in his leisure . Han earned his stay for Shrike by doing a number of unpleasant jobs, at one time, he participated in a pirate group run by murderers named Lemo and Sanda. At this stage, Han made an enemy who was a Corellian bounty hunter named Dengar, also called “Payback”. During one huge race with a large public audience, through the Agrilat crystal swamps, Han caused Dengar to smash into a crystalline plant headfirst, dangerously wiping out the other racer. As that happened, Dengar held his anger against Han for the rest of his life, later on, Dengar would hunt him down as he was ordered to as a bounty hunter.\n\n# Section 5\nFew years went by, at 10 BBY, Han Solo was ready to leave Shrike’s ship in order to start his own walk of life. He planned to hide aboard the Ylesian Dream, an automatic freighter, to go to the tropical world of Ylesia located in Hutt space. There he would apply for a job advertised by the Ylesian priests, as he was about to leave, Garris Shrike and a number of his troops saw him leaving while he was saying goodbye to Dewlanna. The troops tried to catch Han, however, Dewlanna sacrificed herself to them so he could escape, which successfully worked.

Not much is known during his early years except that he became a Jedi Master. Though you may not think of him as necessary because he never sat on a Council, in truth, he was instrumental with his young padawan, Jaesa Willsaam.# Section 1\nLike all Jedi, Noman Karr began his training at an unknown date in galactic history. The next time we hear of Noman Karr is after he's granted the rank of Jedi Master. Karr, much like other Jedi Masters, did not keep quiet about his opinions of the Jedi Order but was a very experienced Jedi Master. The latter openly challenged the beliefs of the Order. Before he crusaded against the armies of the Dark, Noman Karr took his first padawan, Somminick Timmns. Much like his master, not much is known about Somminick Timmns during his time with Karr. However, we are confident he finished his training shortly after the Treaty of Coruscant. During Karr's crusade, he took up the pseudonym \"Retrost.\" During this time, Nomen Karr went behind Imperial borders seeking information about this new Empire and the Sith. During his years, he went undercover and routinely had to use the Dark Side of the Force, either to cement his cover or because he was curious. From his espionage, Nomen Karr captured Darth Ekkage, Darth Baras's sister, and imprisoned her in Belsavis. As a result of Nomen Karr's action, Darth Baras became aware of his presence and the two dueled on Nal Hutta.

However, Darth Baras managed to be two steps in front of him, securing his spy network. During this time, Nomen Karr heard about a young Jaesa Willsaam, who had the unique ability we have yet to see again, which was to sense one's true nature within the Force. Nomen Karr would quickly take her to the Jedi and claim her as his Padawan. However, the Jedi High Council was suspicious of his padawan's power. The Council decided to send Nomen Karr and Jaesa Willsaam to Tatooine to train highly respected Jedi Master Yonlach and Yul-Li.

Sometime after these deaths, Nomen Karr challenged Darth Baras to a duel on Nal Hutta, the place this all started; Darth Baras sent his apprentice in his stead. During their fight, the apprentice taunted Nomen Karr into using the Dark Side, which he did—focusing his rage and hate on defeating the apprentice. Being fatally wounded during the duel resulted in him turning back to the light. Imperial Troopers soon came to his aid and stabilized him. The apprentice promised to torture him as he pleaded to die to save his padawan. As a result, he turned to the dark side just when Jaesa arrived to duel the apprentice. As she dueled with the apprentice, he taunted her into channeling the Dark Side of the Force. When she failed and bowed to him, pledging her allegiance, the apprentice ordered her to kill her former Master, Nomen Karr. The former padawan decapitated Nomen Karr in 3643 BBY.\n\n","meta":{"index":186,"author":"ImperatorSidious","name":"Nomen Karr","release_year":2021}},"Rukh":{"content":"# Introduction\nRukh was a male Noghri warrior who served as the personal bodyguard and later the assassin of Grand Admiral Thrawn.

He was a very skilled combatant and Force-user. Stellan Gios joined the Jedi at a young age and became close with Jedi Masters Elzar Mann and Avar Kriss. The three were inseparable at the time. Elzar Mann caused a lot of mischief and Stellan would be the one to stand up for Elzar and Avar, claiming it was a team effort. Elzar and Avar were a lot closer to each other due to the intimacy they shared, but Elzar always said Stellan was the polestar of the three, after all, Stellan never shied from the spotlight of the Jedi. He was a very optimistic Jedi and had an obsession with teaching, he was good at it. At one point in his career, he successfully trained a bright Padawan, Vernestra Rwoh. Vernestra was around fifteen when she became a Jedi Knight, making her one of the Order’s youngest Knights. Thanks to Stellan.# Section 1\nStellan was highly respected amongst the Order and eventually the Galaxy. He was present for the Valo Fair hosted by the Supreme Chancellor and witnessed the surprise attack. During the siege on Valo, Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh was critically injured by the Nihil Tempest Runner, Laurna Dee. Stellan rushed to her side and aided the unconscious Chancellor. Camera droids all gathered nearby to see the empathetic Jedi mourn over the Chancellor’s injuries. For the first time in a long time, the Jedi were seen to have the capability to feel emotions. Afterward, Stellan Gios was respected in the eyes of the Republic. During a Council meeting, Elzar Mann interrupted and requested on Lina Soh’s behalf that Stellan visit the Chancellor. Due to the compassion, he showed for Valo Lina Soh asked Stellan if he wanted to be the “poster child” of the Jedi Order and their conflict with the Nihil. Gios didn’t have time to respond, an incoming transmission came in for the Chancellor. Elzar and a few other Jedi managed to track down the Nihil base on Grizal and attacked them. They found Master Loden Greatstorm there and he and his Padawan, Bel Zettifar, served side by side for the last time. Loden was eventually turned to dust at the end, which was when Stellan Gios arrived. After seeing what happened to Loden, Stellan was afraid for the first time since he was a child.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter the battle on Grizal, Stellan reached out to Vernestra and complimented her for her efforts on Valo. Later on, he reunited with her face-to-face. However, he wasn’t aware of the upcoming tragedy. Avar Kriss went off to find the supposed Eye of the Nihil, Lourna Dee and left Starlight Beacon without the Council’s approval. This enraged Stellan and the next time the two talked they said things that they had regretted saying. Stellan was then made the Marshal of Starlight Beacon due to Avar’s actions and oversaw the station for a while. Several attacks happened simultaneously on the Echerta system, Aleen, Yeksom, Japeal, and Tais Brabbo. Stellan took in many refugees. During this, he suffered from terrible nightmares and insomnia. Sadly, he had every right to be fearful. There was an ancient darkness of the station that they were unaware of. \n\nSeveral Jedi such as Indeera Stokes, Orla Jareni, Nib Assek, and Regald Coll. All of which were killed by this dark force. An ancient species known only as the Nameless had been smuggled aboard Starlight Beacon by several of Marchion Ro’s most loyal raiders. These raiders also allowed a shipment of Rathtars to go wild and almost destroyed the passengers’ chances of leaving. On top of all this, Starlight Beacon was attacked by the Nihil and split in two. Stellan and Elzar helped everyone escape into ships. Sadly, the gentle Wookie Jedi, Burryaga Agaburry, was lost. Elzar made a costly mistake and killed the only people who could save them. He tried to fix his mistake, but he couldn’t do it on his own, luckily Stellan came down just in time to help him. Stellan had no other choice but to send Elzar to safety and remained on the falling Starlight Beacon. He told Elzar that he would be right behind him and would evacuate once Eiram was out of harm’s way. Unfortunately, it was too late and Stellan had to save the city of Eiram by sacrificing himself to prevent the station from hitting the city and killing hundreds of innocents. He landed the station in the ocean and was killed in the process. His death inspired many Jedi, especially Ezlar, who mourned over his friend’s death and vowed to be the best Jedi possible for Stellan.\n\n# Section 3\nStellan Gios was a skilled practitioner of lightsaber combat and the Force. He could use an ability that was very rare in the High Republic known as mind touch, which allowed him to control the thoughts of others and he loved to teach. However, he was considered the voice of reason and was a loyalist of the Jedi Order. He abided by almost every single one of their laws. Unlike Elzar and Avar, Stellan let the Jedi define him and almost control his every thought. However, he was jealous since Avar and Elzar shared a stronger connection to each other. He managed to veal his vulnerability so that not even his best friend Elzar could see until he let his guard down on Starlight and told his friend everything.

It would be his separation from the Order however, where he would show his true nature and bravery.# Section 1\nHowever, it was before the beginning of the Clone Wars that Med would decide to abandon the Order and the vows he took. His reasoning was that the order had become too connected with the politics of the galaxy, losing their identity in his eyes.

Jango’s legacy would live on through Boba Fett and the clone army.# Section 1\nFett was a skilled, thorough, and ruthless bounty hunter, motivated by money and loyalty to the highest bidder. He kept himself in excellent condition through regular training and possessed vigilant tactical skills. Fett preferred a subtle approach to his hunting and was known for his cool demeanor and evasive skills. He followed his moral code, which he deemed honorable, and passed the values on to his son, Boba Fett.\nFett preferred working alone but he sometimes partnered with others, such as Zam Wesell and Rozatta, when necessary. He was a longer and chose to live alone, never marrying or forming long-term relationships. When the chance arose to raise an unaltered clone of himself, Boba Fett, he passed on his skills and values.\nWhile Fett cared deeply for Boba, he had no personal feelings toward the other clones, considering the cloning contract as merely business. Despite working with the Jedi to create the clone army, Fett remained neutral and loyal to his profession as a bounty hunter.\n\n# Section 2\nFett wore Mandalorian armor in the “shock trooper” style, made of less expensive durasteel alloy instead of the traditional beskar plating. He was armed with custom WESTAR-34 blaster pistols, a BlasTech Dur-24 wrist laser, a Czerka ZX miniature flamethrower, and an integrated Velcity-7 dart shooter with Kamino saberdarts on his right arm.

His Mandalorian helmet featured a targeting range-finder, a 360-degree field of view, infrared scanners, and sound and motion detectors.\nFett inherited his mentor’s ship, Jaster’s Legacy, which he later replaced with a prototype Firespray-class starship he stole from Oovo IV’s asteroid prison. Renaming it “Slave I,” he used it for his bounty hunting contracts until his death. Afterward, the ship passed into the hands of his son, Boba Fett.\n\n# Section 3\nJango Fett was born on Concord Dawn and grew up with his family until the Mandalorian Civil War broke out. The Death Watch attacked his home, killing his parents and capturing his sister Arla. Mandalorian leader Jaster Mereel rescued the young boy.

After Mereel’s death, Fett took over as the new Mand’alor, leading the Mandalorians.\n\n# Section 4\nAfter Jango Fett became the new Mand’alor, he led the Mandalorians and was involved in a battle on Galidraan. The True Mandalorians were defeated after being manipulated by Death Watch and betrayed by the Jedi. Fett was captured, sold into servitude, and eventually freed. Seeking revenge, he retrieved his armor and took vengeance on the Governor of Galidraan and Tor Visla, leader of Death Watch. Fett then became a bounty hunter and mercenary, leading a solitary life until he met and briefly partnered with Sheeka Tull. With the Mandalorian Civil War over, Fett distanced himself from his people and continued his career as a bounty hunter, living at the Utland Transit Station.\n\n# Section 5\nIn the year 32 BBY, Fett was hired to track down the criminal Meeko Ghintee on Outland Station. He captured Meeko but received a message from a man named Tyranus who offered him a bounty to hunt down the former Jedi, Komari Vosa, leader of the Bando Gora cult. Together with another bounty hunter, Zam Wesell, Fett went on a mission to find Vosa, which led them to confront crime lord Sebolto on Malastare and then Gardulla the Hutt on Tatooine. Eventually, Fett defeated Vosa, and Tyranus revealed himself to be Count Dooku, who offered Fett a deal to become the genetic template for an army of clones. Fett agreed to this proposal and asked for an unaltered clone of himself to raise as his own, that clone became Boba Fett.\n\n# Section 6\nFett played a large role in the development of the Grand Army of the Republic. He donated his genetics to create the clone troopers and helped to design their armor, which was inspired by his own Mandalorian shock trooper armor. Fett also assisted to create the flash training program for the clones, using the Mandalorian song “Vode An” to imbue a sense of purpose in them. He recruited and trained the Cuy’val Dar, a group of Mandalorians and skilled individuals who trained the clone commandos. Fett oversaw the training of the elite Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commandos.

However, Fett was persuaded by Zam Wesell to prevent this disaster. They saved Coruscant by preventing the statue’s power from being released, and returned it to its origin on Seylott for safekeeping.\nIn another event, Jango took his son Boba for “flying practice” on an unidentified planet, teaching him to overcome his fears. He also faced a clone trooper deserter on Atzerri, whom he killed, but when he learned the trooper had a family, he set up an inheritance fund for the deserter’s son.\nFett was also tasked by Tyranus to capture Groodo the Hutt, Senator Rodd of Fondor, and droid engineer Hurlo Holowan. He also encountered Aurra Sing while hunting Rigorra the Hutt. Fett successfully completed these assignments and delivered the targets to Count Dooku on Geonosis.\nFett was also hired by the Trade Federation to hunt down the Toydarian named Reti, who had been preying on their assets. He pursued Reti, but the outcome is unknown, however, Fett survived.\n\n# Section 8\nTen years after the formation of the Grand Army of the Republic, Fett was hired by Viceroy Nute Gunray to assassinate Senator Padmé Amidala on Coruscant. Fett teamed up with Zam Wesell for the job, but their plot failed, which resulted in Fett having to kill Wesell to protect his own identity. Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi tracked Fett to Kamino, learned of the clone armies, and confronted Fett. They clashed in a battle, and Fett escaped with his son Boba on the Slave I.\nKenobi followed them to Geonosis using a homing beacon, and a dogfight ensued. Fett landed on Geonosis and joined Count Dooku and the Separatists. Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala attempted to rescue Kenobi; they were captured by Fett who later watched the execution of the Jedi in the Petranaki arena. During the chaos of the battle between the droid army and the Jedi, Fett confronted Windu but was ultimately killed by the Jedi Master.\n\n# Section 9\nAfter Jango Fett’s death, his clone believed he was unaware of Count Dooku’s treachery and killed twelve Jedi Masters before being killed himself. Despite learning the truth, the clone continued to serve faithfully under their Jedi Generals. Fett never lived to see his clones participate in the Clone Wars or witness his son, Boba Fett, continue his legacy as a bounty hunter. Jango was buried on Geonosis, and his remains were later moved to Mandalore to be buried next to his daughter.\nIn honor of Jango, the Jango Fett Arena was built in Mos Eisley on Tatooine, and he was respected by some Mandalorian factions. But he was not held in high regard by the New Mandalorian faction on Mandalore until his legacy was later refreshed. After his death, Jango Fett’s legacy lived on through his son, Boba Fett, and the millions of clone troopers based on his template.

Successfully leading the Separatists into multiple victories, mostly defensive. Trench mastered holding blockades, which he was seen doing mostly in his career. This was put to an end with his defeat at the Battle of Christophsis, where Anakin Skywalker was able to outsmart him and use his own torpedoes against him. The explosion of his ship, the Invincible, had put an end to his life; or so they thought.\n\n# Section 3\nAbout 2 years later Trench re-appeared at the Battle of Ringo Vinda. He returned as a Cyborg, having lost all 3 of his left arms, an eye and a large part of his skull, maybe even his brain. At the battle, Trench was in control of the space station of Ringo Vinda, as the Republic tried to push him out. Anakin Skywalker and the sisters Tiplar and Tiplee were representing the Republic Forces along with many Clone Troopers. While Trench was watching as the battle was going on, he saw something very strange. He saw a Clone Trooper, Tup, walking up to his Jedi General and execute her. This shocking development caused the Republic to fall back holding off the offense. Trench, wondering what might have happened, contacted Count Dooku, who told him to retrieve the Clone Trooper in question. Trench succeeded in capturing the Trooper, but eventually lost him after a stealth operation led by Skywalker.\n\n# Section 4\nTrench is seen again in 19 BBY leading an offensive movement above Anaxes. Anaxes is one of the Republic’s key ship manufacturers, meaning it's very important to hold the planet. The Admiral got the shipyard's production to a stop, which led to the republic deploying a lot of Clone Troopers, including the Bad Batch. Trench was winning on all fronts and it wouldn’t take long for him to take the rest of the planet. This was because he had a prisoner of war in his custody, the long thought dead Clone Trooper Echo, or CT-1409. He was able to cybernetically access Echo’s mind, which allowed him to see all the Republic’s war strategies and create an algorithm that could predict new strategies before they were even made. After the Republic found out about this, they freed Echo and used him against Trench, which he fell for. This eventually led to him dying at the hands of Anakin Skywalker. This marked the end of the life of one of the Republic’s greatest foe’s from even before the start of the Clone Wars.\n\n","meta":{"index":30,"author":"DeBraamster","name":"Trench","release_year":2021}},"Lanoree Brock":{"content":"# Introduction\nLanoree Brock was a Force-sensitive human female born from two Je’daii Masters in 25,818 BBY on the homeworld of Tython.

Despite the many challenges she faced, Jocasta Nu remained steadfast in her beliefs and served the Order with unwavering loyalty and commitment.# Section 1\nJocasta Nu's early life is shrouded in mystery, as there is very little information available about her childhood. However, it is known that she was brought into the Jedi Order during the final decades of the Galactic Republic, a time of relative peace and stability in the galaxy. As a Youngling, she was raised in a clan with other Force-sensitive children, and it was there that she first began to hone her skills as a Jedi.\n\nThroughout her upbringing within the Jedi Order, Jocasta Nu demonstrated an impressive ability to acquire knowledge and a strong passion for learning. She stood out as a prodigious student, excelling in her studies of the Force, science, and history, which allowed her to advance rapidly within the Order's ranks. Upon completing her Knight trials, Jocasta opted to pursue the Consular path, focusing her research efforts on the field of archaeology.

Under her tutelage, Jerec flourished and eventually achieved the rank of Jedi Knight.\n\n# Section 2\nNu was promoted to the rank of Jedi Master after Jerec completed his training with her. She began to perform the duties of an archivist in the Archives, overseeing the collection, preservation, and dissemination of knowledge and information. Her exceptional abilities in this area eventually led to her appointment as Chief Archivist of the Archives and Library, and she became a member of the Librarian's Assembly. As Chief Librarian, Nu was responsible for the oversight of the Educational Corps, and she reported directly to the Reassignment Council on all matters concerning this branch of the Jedi Service Corps.\n\nDespite her many accomplishments, Jocasta Nu was not without her critics. She was known for her stubbornness and her unwillingness to compromise when it came to the preservation of the Jedi Archives. She was fiercely protective of the knowledge contained within the Archives, and she was often at odds with other Jedi who believed that some information should be made available to the public. Despite these disagreements, Jocasta Nu remained a respected and admired figure within the Jedi Order.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring the Clone Wars, Jocasta Nu remained a staunch believer that there was more to the conflict than what the Jedi were being told. As one of the highest ranking Masters to remain constantly on Coruscant, she devoted herself to studying the Jedi Archives and uncovering any information that could shed light on the true nature of the war. Despite encountering resistance from other Jedi who were hesitant to believe that their own government could be behind the war, Jocasta Nu remained steadfast in her beliefs. She spent countless hours pouring over ancient texts and other sources of information, looking for any clues that might help her piece together the truth. Shortly thereafter, the Temple came under attack as Order 66 was executed and the clones turned on their Jedi allies.\n\nFaced with the imminent threat of danger, Jocasta Nu summoned her Padawan, Rayce, to the Archives and entrusted him with several datachips containing information from the Stacks. She ordered him to flee the Temple and carry the information to safety, knowing that it was too valuable to fall into the wrong hands. \n\nDespite her efforts to protect the knowledge contained within the Archives, however,  Jocasta Nu herself fell victim to the tragedy of Order 66. When Darth Vader and a squad of clone assassins marched into the Archives and demanded that she unlock the Temple's signal beacon, Jocasta Nu refused, knowing that the authority to do so lay only with the Jedi Council. In response, Vader used the Force to lift Jocasta Nu off the ground and impale her with his lightsaber, killing her instantly. It was a tragic end for a Jedi who had devoted her life to the pursuit of knowledge and the uncovering of truth, and her death served as a stark reminder of the dangers that lay ahead for the Jedi Order.\n\n# Section 4\nIn the aftermath of her death, Nu's loyal librarians attempted to stop Anakin Skywalker and the invading Sith from accessing the archives and destroying all of the knowledge stored there. Unfortunately, they were all killed in the fighting, and the Sith were able to ransack the archives, taking whatever they pleased. It was a great tragedy that much of the knowledge and history that Nu had worked so hard to preserve was lost forever. Her lifeless body was eventually discovered by Grand Master Yoda and Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had infiltrated the occupied temple. Her name was checked off against the archives records of all active Jedi, and her body was gathered up along with the other fallen Jedi and burned on a pyre at the temple entrance.\n\nDespite the loss of the archives and many of the Jedi, Nu's legacy continued to live on.

When the Clone Wars prevailed, Nema had one of her most special patients: Grandmaster Yoda. He was treated by her because he claimed to hear the voice of Qui-Gon Jinn in his head, who was assassinated by Darth Maul. The Jedi Council was very worried about Yoda because they didn't think it was possible to talk to the dead at that time. Master Ki-Adi-Mundi feared that it was a trick of the Sith to deceive the Grand Master and make him vulnerable. Rig Nema examined Yoda several times to find out what was wrong with him, but he was in good health. The only thing she noticed was that one part of his brain was more active than others, but this was said to be due to his old age. Mundi spoke to Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi that Yoda's mind might have been taken over by the Sith Lord Count Dooku, who had been trained by the Grand Master. When Nema heard of this, she suggested a withdrawal ritual to help Yoda get answers. However, the ritual was very dangerous because Yoda would have to be put into a tank in which the oxygen would be gradually withdrawn, which would bring him close to death. In this way, he could enter a state of meditation. When they decided to perform the ritual, Yoda again heard Qui-Gon's voice telling him to travel to Dagobah to complete what he could not. However, he should not tell anyone about his journey. Shortly thereafter, Yoda's vital signs dropped rapidly, and Kenobi ordered Nema to stop the ritual. Yoda was convinced that he had spoken to the dead, which prompted Windu to ask Nema for her opinion as a doctor. She declared his physical condition good, but worried about his spiritual one. When Yoda was back in the infirmary, he asked the doctor for a private conversation with Anakin Skywalker. When Nema had left the room, Yoda explained to Anakin that he had to get out of here to go on a mission. When Nema and Windu returned, they only saw Yoda flying away with R2-D2 in his starfighter.# Section 1\nRig Nema was a Halaisi with golden eyes and yellow skin. She was very good at her job, checking her patients several times to be sure, monitoring all vital signs at all times, and reporting to any relatives or friends. She did not shy away from more dangerous procedures like the withdrawal ritual as long as it would help her patients. She used this ritual on Master Yoda, but had to stop it on Kenobi's orders because his vital signs changed dramatically. Nema did this reluctantly as she had mentioned the risks and said it would not be easy, but she obeyed.\n\n","meta":{"index":81,"author":"xTribrid","name":"Rig Nema","release_year":2021}},"Yoda":{"content":"# Introduction\nYoda, one of the most legendary Jedi known throughout galactic history, being a force sensitive male of an unknown species.

Zaalbar was considered a madclaw, which in Wookie culture, was a title for dishonor that he received for the attack on his brother Chuundar. Zaalbar was also a Wookie of a few words, and chose not to speak unless he needed to. He preferred to let his street-smart Twi’lek companion, Mission Vao, do the talking. He considered Mission to be his only friend and was very protective over her. Zaalbar struggled with certain aspects of his life and culture and struggled with explaining it to others as he chose to keep his past life a secret. He also had a very low opinion of himself, since being cast out from his home world and tribe. Because of this, he felt pain when speaking about himself to others. Zaalbar went on many adventures with his companion, Mission, in the lower city of Taris. When Zaalbar was captured by Gamorrean slavers, Mission showed up with the former Sith Lord, Darth Revan, and rescued him. Zaalbar then offered a life debt to Revan and stuck to it ever since.# Section 1\nWhen Revan, along with Zaalbar and his companions, was tasked with finding the Star Maps, one of them happened to be located on the planet of Kashyyyk. Upon Zaalbar’s return to the planet, many of the Wookie natives were displeased to see a madclaw walking amongst them. Zaalbar’s tribe was suffering from being taxed and run by the Czerka Corporation. After some time, Revan and Zaalbar would soon discover that Chuundar, Zaalbar’s Wookie brother, had overthrown Freyyr’s spot as Chieftain and banished him to the Shadowlands, the ground level of the deep dangerous forests of Kashyyyk.

After this, he was appointed to the planet of Anaxes. However, during his time as a cadet, he was not well known for his academics, but instead for his aggressive and ruthless politics he came to adopt. The politics he adopted quickly gained him the favor of Emperor Palpatine due to him fitting the type of officers the Emperor wanted to fill the ranks with. This in turn allowed him to quickly rise through the ranks. As an Imperial officer he was known to use aggressive force to resolve any issue and any one who stood in his way or his goals.# Section 1\nHe started his officer career under Captain Jaim Helaw on the Strike-class cruiser Ion Storm. This is where Captain Helaw acted as his mentor and allowed him to receive a promotion to First Lieutenant, but after a while he went to the capital planet of Coruscant to work for a brief period. However, this brief period would allow him to make important contacts that would help him quickly rise past Captain Helaw in rank.

The father was a clone commando, RC-1136 known as Darman. Due to Venku’s mother being a Jedi, Etain was fearful of telling anyone about her pregnancy and eventual birth of Venku on the planet of Mandalore, so that he may be raised by his  grandfather, Mandalore Kal Skirata. The clan of Kal, would refer to Venku as Kad as that is what his father Darman said he would have named a child before he even knew that Venku was his. He would not be raised by his mother or father, with his mother dying during Order 66 even though she had left the Jedi Order, she tried to intervene when seeing clones and Jedi fighting, leading to her death from a lightsaber. Venku’s father would remain alive, Order 66 hadn’t changed Darman’s love for both Venku and Etain. He worked within the Empire, secretly looking for ways to keep his son safe from the Imperials, due to his Force sensitivity, which caused him to be highly in danger at all times. Venku would be raised in the culture of Mandalore.# Section 1\nBefore Venku had been born, Kal Skirata had seeked out Ko Sai, who was the Kaminoan responsible for the clones accelerated growth. Clones were made to grow quickly into adults, becoming one in just a few years, so they’d be ready for battle quickly.  He bargained with Ko Sai and managed to gain a few sequences of the growth genes after allowing Ko Sai to study Venku’s genome. Ko Sai would eventually take their own life but this had allowed many of the Skirata including Venku to have a normal growth span, letting them experience proper life. When Venku was just a newborn before Order 66 he did get to spend time with his mother and father, his mother would stop by whenever her duties as Jedi General were over and eventually after a year of Venku’s birth, Darman would be told of his fatherhood. Venku became a very emotionless child at a young age, he was able to sense his mother’s death. His father had the ability to possibly escape Coruscant during Order 66, and flee to Mandalore to begin life as a father. However, he stayed to help an injured clone commando, a fellow Skirata known as Niner, which caused his capture, and an immediate reassignment to Imperial ranks. Darman never got to fill the duties of his fatherhood. As Venku was raised he would adapt his name as Kad given to him by his father. Working as a farmer until eventually growing up and forming a political faction which seeked the regrowth of the Mandalorians, he’d be known to many as Kad’ika and became fairly known.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring his later years, around the time of 40 ABY, his existence had become known by the likes of the current Madalore, Boba Fett, who had been informed of Venku’s political views and was even interested in knowing if Venku was in pursuit of the Mandalore title. However Venku himself was actually a big supporter of Boba having the title, Boba’s second hand Goran Beviin took quite a liking to Venku’s views and used them to advise Boba when it came to leading the Mandalorians, believing in unity between the many clans when time came and to also to make Mandalore generally a better place. Boba Fett was asked to take in Venku's advice when Fett struck a deal for a blood sample of a Skirata member to help cure his accelerated ageing. Venku would come into contact with Boba Fett who was technically his uncle, handing him the previously mentioned Skirata’s bone marrow in order to help Fett bypass his ageing problem, doing so because Fett had actually begun to follow his advice and make changes on Mandalore. Venku would also assist Fett a little bit more, finding them a translator, that being Bardan Skirata for Fett’s granddaughter Mirta’s pendant, which as a result helped Boba Fett discover more information about his dead wife which, he highly appreciated from Venku.\n\n# Section 3\nVenku and Bardan Skirata had established a good relationship. When Jaina Solo arrived on Mandalore, looking to be taught how to fight like a Mandalorian by Boba Fett, she met the two, Bardan would reveal himself to have been a former Jedi Knight, Venku would be told about his sensitivity to the Force and of who his mother and father truly were and, how valuable Venku would be to the Empire if they found him. With the possibility of Venku being used to create a new clone army if he was to be captured, Fett was also not aware, due to his nature he could have quickly turned Venku in for a huge reward. Once Venku knew of his existence more, he proceeded to aid Jaina in increasing her talent in Mandalorian combat. Eventually she would use these skills to take on her brother, Darth Caedus. Jaina and Venku would spar in lightsaber combat, Venku using both his mothers sabers. These spars would greatly help Venku understand himself more and Jaina to become more skilled in the ways of Mandalorian combat, which she used to eventually take on her brother.\n\n","meta":{"index":220,"author":"Its_Classy","name":"Venku Skirata","release_year":2021}},"Soleil Agra":{"content":"# Introduction\nSoleil Agra was a Nautolan Jedi High Councilor who served during the High Republic.

Concerned about the clone trooper’s loyalty to the Empire, Rampart believed recruited soldiers would be far more valuable to the Empire than the clones. During his visit to Kamino, Rampart presented the first Elite Squad he had created to Governor Wilhuff Tarkin, after the first successful mission of the Elite Squad led by Crosshair, Tarkin left the project in Ramparts hands with slight doubts due to losing one trooper already.# Section 1\nDuring the celebration of the end of the Clone Wars, Admiral Rampart accompanied by Senator Orn Free Taa, Cham Syndulla and his wife were being angrily shouted at by the Twi’leks after the Empire didn’t end the occupation on Ryloth like the Republic had promised. Later during the evening, Rampart was informed by Crosshair of a supply run to smuggle weapons on Ryloth by Twi’lek resistance fighters, including Hera Syndulla, having attached a homing beacon to their shuttle. Their ship was eventually shot down by Crosshair and the crew were locked up in an HCVw A9 turbo tank accompanied by Senator Orn Free Taa, Admiral Rampart and Captain Howzer.

Cham was then arrested for an attempted assassination of Senator Orn Free Taa and was taken to the Capitol building in Ryloth’s capital city in Lessu. Shortly after Admiral Rampart accompanied by Captain Howzer confronted Cham, who was in a holding cell. Later Rampart informed Twi’lek citizens how Cham and the rest of the traitors had been arrested and that Taa is making a full recovery, he also ordered Howzer to find Hera who managed to escape during the ambush. With the help of Clone Force 99, Hera came up with a plan to rescue her parents.\nThey began the rescue by infiltrating the Imperial refinery and preventing its cannons from shooting the Marauder by disabling them, before starting to attack the refinery. During this, Hunter and Echo sneaked into the Capitol and rescued Cham Syndulla and the rest from their holding cells. While all the Imperial forces were sent to defend the refinery, Crosshair\nknew something was off and ordered a few squads to block the main gate of the Capitol and be ready to shoot anyone that tried to escape. Cham, Hunter, and the rest would have fallen into Crosshair's trap but were warned of what was waiting on the other side of the door by Howzer. Taking another way out of the building, they managed to escape Ryloth. Howzer, however, stayed behind, since he couldn’t abandon his own squad. Once Rampart arrived at the completely destroyed refinery, he was very disappointed and furious.

Since he was a Celegian, Ooroo had to use a life-support chamber that supplied him with the gas cyanogen. Cyanogen is toxic to other life forms such as humans but essential to Ooroo and the Celegian species in their homeworld of Celegia, it would be fatal to Ooroo if he were to inhale oxygen as it was toxic for their species. This restriction inside the chamber did not interfere with his lightsaber combat or communication. Many of Ooroo’s students had left the planet after their training except for a very well-known Jedi by the name of Odan-Urr, who preferred to study and learn from the Praxeum library instead of exploring the galaxy even well after his graduation to Knight.

His main specialty was combat when he was a Jedi. The Barash Vow was something that Kirak took, which restricted him from doing anything that was related to the Jedi Order. Because Kirak was not an official Jedi during the time of the Jedi Purge and Order 66, he was not terminated. In the future, he wielded a green lightsaber and faced the once-Jedi Knight, Darth Vader.# Section 1\nBecause Kirak had a major specialty in combat during the time in the Jedi Order, he was able to put up a fight against Vader. He was almost able to defeat Vader, by pushing him off a cliff. However, the Sith Lord was able to repair the damage he had taken, by repairing his suit with the parts from Kirak's droid, Arex. The two shared one last fight at a city, however, the city's security personnel responded to this by opening fire at both of the men during their fight. Having their fight interrupted, the furious Sith Lord pushed their attackers down a cliff, however, to his surprise, Kirak tried to use the Force to save them Vader was absolutely surprised when Kirak saved them both from falling off the cliff and being executed when they dropped to the bottom. Because Vader knew how compassionate Kirak was, he created a massive force flood in the city, to distract Kirak and get him to save them. The Sith Lord used the Force to grab the once Jedi Mater's lightsaber. Kirak offered his life in return for the city, and the security's safety. After ignoring his pleading, Vader broke Kirak's neck with the Force and threw him into the forming lake, where the city and people he tried to save lied.\n\n# Section 2\nKarik was a master at lightsaber combat when he was still inside of the Jedi Order as a Jedi Master. Since he took the Barash Vow, Kirak was to keep his abilities in the Force outside the activities of the Jedi Order, and had to rely on his training droid, Arex, when it came to practising. Whenever a Jedi died, he was able to feel their presence receding. Kirak wore trousers with a buckled black belt and trousers. His lightsaber contained a green kyber crystal, and his hilt was curved, similarly to that of Count Dooku. Once Kirak was defeated, Vader bled his kyber crystal, causing it to turn red.

Even though he couldn’t become a Jedi he still found other ways to support the Jedi; He ended up becoming a republic soldier and would very quickly rise the ranks during his life with the republic.# Section 1\nTheron would eventually become a field agent for the Republic and would rise the ranks very quickly. During his time as a field agent, he was sent on a mission to spy on the Empire who were rumored to be working on a superweapon called the Ascendant Spear. This led to the Sith finding out about his agent's existence, capturing them in the process. This led to them finally confirming that they are indeed working on a superweapon that could be a major threat to the Galaxy if they ended up finding a way to escape.

Later, Lha-Mi and other Bendu monks brought Force-Sensitive organisations together on Tython. This contributed to the formation of the Je'daii Order, which sought to utilise the Balance in the Force to rid the galaxy of chaos and evil. Lha-Mi became one of the nine founding Temple Masters of the Je'daii Order, overseeing Stav Kesh, the Temple of Martial Arts. To help him with this duty, he had an assistant by the name of Je'daii Master Tave.

During Anakin’s youth, he served under a mechanic lord named Watto. As a child, Anakin served him in many ways, such as repairing ships and other forms of machinery to please Watto’s customers. Because of this lifestyle, Anakin grew up to resent and hate the life he was delved in, as well as life on Tatooine in general. Eventually, Anakin was discovered by Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi Master who dedicated himself to making sure Anakin was trained in the ways of the Force. When Qui-Gon Jinn requested to train Anakin, the Jedi High Council declined his request due to Anakin being too old to be trained. However, Qui-Gon was convinced, as mentioned in Jedi Philosophy, that Anakin was the Chosen One. Then and there, he decided to take matters into his own hands. Since his ship missed the parts it needed to enter hyperspace, Anakin took part in the classic Boonta Eve Podracing event, which allowed him to grant Qui-Gon enough money to buy new parts. Little did Anakin know that winning this would also grant him freedom due to a deal made between Qui-Gon and Watto. Shortly after this, Qui-Gon Jinn lost his life at the hands of Darth Maul. This meant that Anakin would be trained by Obi-Wan Kenobi instead.# Section 1\nDuring Anakin’s time serving as a Jedi, he participated in and was also a huge part of the Clone Wars. He also participated in many adventures by the side of Obi-Wan Kenobi, but as the Separatist Crisis escalated and threatened the Republic, Anakin was reunited with Amidala and was assigned to protect her in 22 BBY. Despite being caught up in the Battle of Geonosis and the Clone Wars, both Anakin and Amidala grew very close to each other during their assignment. Anakin also soon received a cybernetic arm after losing his real one during a battle with Count Dooku. Days after this battle, Anakin and Amidala were secretly married to each other despite the restrictions from the Jedi Order on any form of romantic attachment. The Clone Wars continued to rage for a few ongoing years, and with this, Anakin was granted the rank of Jedi Knight. He was even known as the “Hero With No Fear” to the public for his multiple efforts of heroism and acts of bravery during the Clone Wars. After receiving his rank, Anakin soon oversaw the teachings of the Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano.\n\n# Section 2\nIn 19 BBY, Skywalker learned the real identity of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. He was Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord who orchestrated the entire Clone Wars while remaining elusive with the goal of ruling the galaxy. Upon learning this, Anakin reported this finding to Jedi Master Mace Windu. Master Windu took swift action to this and gathered his skilled Jedi fighters to confront the Supreme Chancellor. After a brutal fight between Palpatine and Windu, Anakin managed to save the life of Palpatine at the last minute by making Mace Windu vulnerable to Palpatine’s deadly lightning attack. After this, Palpatine managed to manipulate Anakin into thinking that the Jedi were traitors with a plot to overthrow the Republic. His fear of losing Amidala to childbirth caused Anakin to stray and believe Palpatine, resulting in him, along with the 501st Legion and the rest of the Clone Army, annihilating the Jedi Order under the command of Palpatine, led by Anakin Skywalker himself. This operation was called “Order 66”.

He was a member of a clone force known as Clone Force 99, also nicknamed “The Bad Batch”. This force was made up of clones that were unique due to genetic mutations. Wrecker’s genetic mutation was that he was physically much larger and stronger than an average clone trooper. However, often Wrecker would solely rely on his brute strength to solve problems rather than think things through, unlike other members of this Clone Force such as Tech and Hunter. The team was perfectly balanced through the variety of skills from each member, such as skill, intellect, strength and more.# Section 1\nWrecker, like all clones, was created on the planet Kamino to serve under the Grand Army of the Republic. They were created using the genetic template of Jango Fett, yet during the cloning process, there was an error that resulted in some clones straying away from this template. Wrecker was one of these clones that developed in size and strength far differently from the other clones. However, the Republic did see potential and an advantage in this situation, so they chose to collect and create a new clone squad composed of these individuals. The squad would include Wrecker and three other clones known as Tech, Hunter and Crosshair. Clone Force 99 would get its name from Clone 99, who gave his life to protect his home world Kamino, during an assault from Separatist forces.\n\n# Section 2\nClone Force 99 was deployed on numerous dangerous missions and was known to never fail. Towards the end of the Clone Wars, the team started to build up their reputation while also gaining another member known as Echo, a former member of Anakin Skywalker's squad. The squad was deployed on one last mission under the current Galactic Republic; they were sent to reinforce Jedi Master Depa Billaba’s clone squad and Padawan Caleb Dume, later known as Kanan Jarrus. As the tide of battle had turned in favour of the republic with Clone Force 99’s arrival, it wasn’t long until the clone force was thrown off guard. When Order 66 was activated, the clones began to gun down Jedi Master Depa Billaba, Caleb Dume began to run while being pursued by the clones. The Bad Batch squad chased the Padawan to try and figure out what was happening, while the other clones intended to kill him. Clone Force 99 did not have the intention of killing the Jedi or carrying out Order 66 due to their unique mutations, which interfered with their ability to follow orders without question. Crosshair was the only member of the clone force that was significantly affected by the order and had the intention of killing the young Jedi. While Crosshair would display some resistance, he was still subject to the order that caused him to leave Clone Force 99 when they attempted to leave Kamino against the newly formed Empire’s orders.\n\n# Section 3\nWrecker’s strength allowed him to achieve feats that an average clone simply would not. He was able to lift a LAAT gunship off a wounded soldier trapped underneath, he could destroy battle droids with his bare hands, and had a passion for using explosives. Wrecker was an excitable loud character and would act rather clumsy. While Wrecker did have many strengths, he also possessed some weaknesses. He did not use his intellect, often relying on brute strength rather than analysing the situation, and he was also  afraid of extreme heights. \nWrecker was a lovable member of the Bad Batch squad and cared greatly about his comrades. His relationship with the latest member of the squad, Omega, was deeply admirable. He was protective, playful and very comforting for the young girl, doing his best to make her feel part of the team.

After Jabba's death, Gorga inherited his uncle's criminal empire and expanded it further, surpassing even Jabba's achievements.# Section 1\nGorga was born on the Hutt homeworld of Nal Hutta, the child of an unknown sibling of Jabba Desilijic Tiure. He became the leader of the Desilijic clan alongside Jabba and earned a position on the influential Hutt Ruling Council. Despite being Jabba's nephew, Gorga's voice carried some weight on council matters, although not as much as his uncle's.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring the Clone Wars, the Hutt Ruling Council enlisted the services of the bounty hunter Cad Bane to track down Ziro the Hutt, who possessed sensitive information about Hutt activities. Gorga served on the council alongside Jabba and other Hutts. On one occasion, Gorga unwittingly encountered Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was undercover as a Zygerrian guard, during a visit to the slave markets on Zygerria. Later, Gorga appeared at the Bilbousa Bazaar, unknowingly passing by Obi-Wan again, this time disguised as the bounty hunter Rako Hardeen.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring his time on Tatooine, Gorga became enamored with a Hutt named Anachro, the daughter of his enemy, Orko the H'uun. Seeking to win her favor, Gorga hired the renowned bounty hunter Boba Fett to eliminate Bar-Kooda, a pirate kingpin harassing Orko's freighters. Gorga's plan succeeded, and he celebrated his impending marriage to Anachro by consuming Bar-Kooda's corpse. However, their honeymoon was disrupted when Anachro was kidnapped by slavers on Skeebo.

Although complications arose, including accusations of murder and a clash with Ry-Kooda, Gorga managed to reunite with Anachro.\n\n# Section 4\nDespite incurring a significant debt due to Boba Fett's services, Gorga's business acumen enabled him to amass a substantial fortune. He owned casinos, restaurants, and cargo haulers, which contributed to his wealth and influence. Gorga was also involved in a black market operation, trading precious ulikuo gemstones from Kip with a silent partner. While he believed his wife, Anachro, was unaware of this venture, she was, in fact, aware and ambitious. Gorga even had a palace on Tatooine that resembled his late uncle's.\nFollowing Jabba's demise, Gorga sought to inherit his uncle's treasure ship, the Spirit of Jabba, along with its valuable contents. However, he faced obstacles as other individuals, Gizman and Spiker, reached the vessel first and engaged in a confrontation.

However, unlike his fellow masters, Zez-Kai Ell did not blame him for it because he understood the reason his apprentice followed to fight.# Section 1\nAfter the Mandalorian war ended, he was one of the five masters who summoned and banished Meetra Surik from the order as she was the only Jedi who came for the trials of the Jedis who had gone to war with Revan. Despite her banishment, Zez-Kai Ell was disappointed with his fellow master's decision as he had thought that they had given away a perfect opportunity, which was to understand why many of their fellow members have left the order and sought the problem within their teachings.\n\nZez-Kai Ell remained on the Jedi High Council until the Jedi Civil war ended when the First Jedi Purge was shortly about to begin.

Because he was a clone, he dubbed himself \"Fives.\" Fives started his training as a clone cadet on Kamino during the early stages of the war between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Along with his friends in Domino Squad, he acquired the rank of trooper. He served as a recently trained soldier at a Republic outpost on the Rishi Moon when the outpost came under Separatist attack. Fives joined the 501st Legion after being selected as one of the two survivors.

Although the squad suffered numerous deaths throughout the mission, including the loss of Piell and the presumed dead Echo, Fives was one of the survivors that Jedi General Plo Koon saved. During the Battle of Umbara, later in the conflict, Fives participated with the 501st. He was a significant contributor to the campaign's capture of the Umbaran airbase and destruction of the Separatist supply ship. The Besalisk Jedi Master Pong Krell, their General, had betrayed the Republic by tricking his clone soldiers into engaging in combat, as the clones eventually learned. Fives joined in their efforts to apprehend the deceased Jedi as a result.\n\n# Section 2\nFives saw the execution of Tiplar, a Jedi General, by CT-5385 \"Tup\" while attempting to take Ringo Vinda from the Separatists. The pre-emptive execution of Clone Protocol 66 set off a series of events that allowed Fives to learn about an inhibitor chip conspiracy, a scheme to obliterate the Jedi Order, and to some extent, the involvement of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. Clone Commander CC-1010 \"Fox\" and a group of Coruscant Guard shock troopers attacked Fives when he tried to warn Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" after being accused by Palpatine of being a failed assassin. Fives was slain by Fox and died in Rex's arms after he drew his weapon on Fox, fearing that no one would listen to the information he had acquired regarding the inhibitor chips.\n\n# Section 3\nEven though Fives was slain before he could reveal the plot behind the inhibitor chips, his activities impacted how Order 66 was carried out.

He then compelled Dooku to kidnap him and place him in cryo-cycle hibernation, preventing him from future involvement in The Clone Wars and Order 66. Fives' knowledge of the plot allowed Ahsoka Tano to save Rex and take out his inhibitor chip when the 501st carried out Order 66 against her.

In 3952 BBY, Atris called a Conclave in an attempt to draw out the Sith who had targeted the Order, by having the entire Order gather on the planet of Katarr, home to Miraluka species who were strongly Force sensitive, only to have the majority of the Order consumed by Darth Nihilus, a Sith Lord with the power to devour planets and beings strong in the Force. By 3951 BBY, Atris had constructed an academy hidden in the farming world of Telos IV, hiding many of the Order's important relics. During this time, she met with Jedi Exile Meetra Surik who was attempting to hunt down the Sith, yet Atris offered minimal assistance. Atris was eventually corrupted by the Sith Lord, Darth Traya, falling to the Dark Side before being defeated by Surik, redeemed and exiled from the reformed Order.# Section 1\nAtris rose to prominence when she advocated for the following of the teachings of Master Simikarty, an ancient Jedi who taught that a Master should only have a single Padawan, and that an age limit should be implemented to restrict those who could become Jedi. When the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders attacked the Outer Rim, Atris joined other members of the Council including Jedi Masters Vrook Lamar, Zez-Kai Ell, Kavar and Lonna Vash in calling for Jedi, primarily Revan and Malak from entering the conflict. Atris’ friend and hero, Surik left to join Revan’s conflict, deeply wounding her and making Atris bitter and vindictive. When the war ended, the Council placed Surik on trial, with Atris demanding a punishment harsher then exile, whilst also confiscating Surik’s lightsaber.\n\n# Section 2\nFollowing the end of the Jedi Civil War, after the death of Malak at the hands of a redeemed Revan, Atris summoned the surviving Jedi Order to the planet of Katarr to discuss the Order’s future. However, Atris attempted to lure the Sith out of hiding by using the assembled Jedi as bait, but was unprepared for Nihilus’ immense power. Casualties on Katarr included the Jedi Masters Zhar Lestin, Dorak and Vandar Tokare, as well as the entire population of Miraluka with the exception of Visas Marr. Following this, Atris planned to rebuild the Jedi Order on the planet of Telos IV, taking several Jedi and Sith holocrons as well as training an elite group of Echani handmaidens to aid her in defending and training new Jedi. However, Atris would be corrupted by the holocrons she had stored, slowly transforming into a Dark Jedi. Atris would later meet again with Surik, who had ended her exile and was beginning to reunite surviving Jedi to combat the Sith threat. Atris had instructed one of her handmaidens to steal Surik’s ship, the Ebon Hawk, and had also stolen Surik’s droid, T3-M4, resulting in Surik travelling to Telos IV to reclaim the ship. Following the deaths of Jedi Masters Vrook Lamar, Zez-Kai Ell and Kavar at the hands of Darth Traya, Surik returned to Telos IV to confront Atris, culminating in a duel that Surik ultimately won. Atris was held prisoner within her sanctuary on Telos until she was sentenced by the reformed Jedi Council, composed of Surik’s former companions she had trained as Jedi.

He was trained as a Jedi and quickly gained high standing in the Order. When the Empire recaptured Korriban and began the Great Galactic War, Sedoru was one of the first few Jedi to lead counterattacks. Warren fought in dozens of battles across the galaxy and scored several early victories against the Sith. However, he was severely injured in one of the battles, causing his connection to the Force to weaken, and when the war ended in 3653, Sedoru devoted himself to peace. This included giving up his Jedi Knight rank and becoming a Padawan to the Kel Dor Jedi Master Tol Braga. Braga recruited his padawan, the Hero of Tython, as well as his padawan, Kira Carsen, to go on a mission to capture the Emperor and redeem him. He sent Sedoru to Balmorra to obtain a cloaking device. This cloaking device contained technology that was also used to cloak the Emperor's fortress. However, since the device was located in the former Balmorran weapons factory, now an Imperial fortress, they needed the help of the Resistance. The hero managed to retrieve the cloaking device, but had to give some important data from the Empire about their cloaked weapons to resistance fighters. Returning to Tython to begin the mission, the team was contacted by the Jedi Council who said that a former team member named Jomar Chul had a vision of the hero turning to the dark side. Chul and Jaric Kaedan were not sure about the mission after this vision and were afraid that it could become reality, but Grandmaster Satele Shan and Master Bela Kiwiiks showed utmost confidence in the hero. Arriving on Dromund Kaas to infiltrate the Emperor's fortress, they were already expected and the Emperor used his power to lead the team to the dark side. With no control over his actions, Warren Sedoru, aided by a host of Sith, later attacked the Republic flagship Valiant to kill Admiral Dabrin. The goal of all this was to preserve the Republic codes. When Warren demanded them, he engaged in a lightsaber duel with a Jedi who was on board, which the Jedi Knight won.

He spoke Shyriiwook, which was a language of the Wookiees, which includes loud growls and muttering.

In time, Chewbacca met his wife named Mallatobuck, but he did not know of the Wookiee’s feelings regarding him. This was because Malla hid her true feelings towards him as she was a shy Wookiee and told herself to not show any respect when Chewbacca saved her from the Trandoshan slavers. Time went by until Chewbacca’s cousin Jowdrll was friends with Malla, she helped Chewbacca and Malla create a bond between each other. Their soon-to-be relationship hit a brick when a Wookiee named Tojjevvuk began to fight for Malla’s love. Chewbacca was forced to duel Tojjevvuk for Mallatobuck’s affection, though Tojjevvuk cheated in the duel as he used his claws which was not allowed for a Wookiee.

Lord Corvax possessed the capacity to both halt time and teleport as a result of his circumstances. This helped him greatly in his search for the Star. During the Imperial Era, he aided Darth Vader in his attempt to resurrect Padmé Amidala. He actually only did this to snatch the Bright Star away from Vader, as he had tracked it to his possession.

This Jedi was a member of the Quermian species from the planet Quermia. The Quermian species possessed vastly unique physical features. They had two brains, long arms and very long necks. They were often known to be a peaceful yet intellectual species. Yarael Poof was a powerful Jedi Master who excelled in the teaching aspects of the order and had a massive influence on the future generation of Jedi Knights to follow him. He also excelled at and had a natural gift in Jedi mind control, which he developed and perfected during his time while being a Jedi. He was a very proficient force user, yet a skilled diplomat, and duelist. He was a Jedi Consular, yet he wielded a lightsaber powered by a yellow crystal, which he would then change to a blue crystal.# Section 1\nYarael Poof was believed to have joined the Jedi Order similarly to its other members. Upon his birth, the doctors would discover the baby to be force sensitive, sending this information to the Jedi Order on Coruscant, who would soon dispatch recruiters to collect the child and bring them back to Coruscant. As time passed, Yarael Poof would quickly reach the rank of Initiate, was selected by a master and go on to pass his trials, and was knighted as a Jedi Knight. It was here he would go on to study the role of a Jedi Consular and advance his skills with the force.  He was very powerful in the force with abilities such as telekinesis, but specialised in force mind control. This is the ability to manipulate the minds of the weak-willed through persuasive language, hallucinations and more. His skills were soon recognised by the Jedi High Council and he was offered a position at their side. Yarael Poof would continue being a highly respected Instructor within the Jedi Academy of the order. He would instruct the next generation of Knights and pass on his knowledge of the force to many other Jedi.\n\n# Section 2\nShortly after the events of the Phantom Menace, the council of the Jedi order assembled to face an immediate threat to the Galactic Republic. A dangerous Annoo-Dat, known as Ashaar Khorda, had plotted to strike a blow to the senate by attacking one of the Republic’s key worlds. However, the council learned that this dangerous criminal had come into possession of an artefact, capable of destroying a planet if used correctly. Jedi High Councillors were positioned on a variety of Republic planets to intercept this coming threat. Yarael Poof volunteered to oversee Coruscant and ensure its safety. The Jedi Master would leave the Temple and begin to travel around the planet, allowing the force to guide him to anywhere he needed to be. Eventually, the Jedi would be guided to Coruscant’s central power generator, as it was here that Yarael could feel a great disturbance in the force and found Khorda present with the dangerous artefact. Yarael would then find himself working alongside two Bounty Hunters, Jango Fett and Zam Wessel who had also made their way to this location on a mission to track down and eliminate Khorda. The three of them would quickly defeat the Khorda’s followers but Khorda would manage to catch the Jedi by surprise. He would stab Yarael with a vibroblade directly into his heart before the bounty hunters could kill this terrorist. As the device was set up and preparing to release its full energy and decimate the planet, Yarael would reach out with the force and use the last of his strength to manipulate and deactivate the device, dying immediately after.\n\nThe Jedi Master would be celebrated for saving the billions of lives that were present on Coruscant at his funeral, which was attended by the Jedi High Council along with his students.

Later, Sugi spotted an enemy scout up on a nearby ridge; she sent Embo to take care of him. He got close to the enemy’s speeder before they arrived and destroyed it with a shot from his bowcaster. They had multiple encounters but in the end, Embo was the victor. Skywalker praised Embo for how he handled taking down the enemy. With the scout having been taken out, the group knew that the pirate’s leader, Ohnaka, would not wait much longer to attack.\n\n# Section 2\nTheir predictions were right and there were soon dozens upon dozens of pirates on speeders travelling towards the town.

Eventually, Jorgan would achieve the rank of Lieutenant in the Republic Military and be assigned to Ord Mantell, leaving the Deadeyes in the capable hands of his former executive officer Torve.\n\n# Section 2\nTransferring to Ord Mantell was an intelligent career move on Jorgan’s behalf. Among Jorgan’s new subordinates was Felix Iresso, with who Jorgan would more often than not clash on policy. Sometime in 3643 BBY, a shuttle carrying a ZR-57 orbital strike bomb was taken down by the Mantellian Separatist Movement, a force bent on achieving Ord Mantell’s independence from the Republic. The Mantellian Separatist Movement would then steal the bomb, which was capable of destroying entire islands. This caused the Republic to send in a Special Forces Division known as Havoc Squad, which was led by Harron Tavus. Among this squad was a new recruit and an unnamed Sergeant. Jorgan and the Sergeant would work together in finding the location of the said bomb, along with executing three of the Separatist’s leaders. During this time, the bomb had been moved, and Commander Tavus had ordered Havoc Squad to retrieve it, except for the rookie Sergeant. When all communications with Havoc had been cut out, Jorgan ordered the Sergeant to follow his squad and track down the ZR-57. This led to the disarmament of the bomb and the defection of the other members of the Havoc Squad to the Empire. Following this, Jorgan would be blamed and demoted as a scapegoat. The Sergeant would be promoted to the rank of Lieutenant and placed in charge of the Havoc Squad.\n\n# Section 3\nThe newly reformed Havoc Squad was tasked with hunting down the old members, who had defected to the Sith Empire. Havoc Squad would disrupt and ruin the traitors’ plans on Taris, Nar Shaddaa, Tatooine, and Alderaan, eventually defeating Tavus himself. Afterward, when the Cold War got hot, Havoc Squad was tasked with tracking down and destroying the Imperial superweapon known as the “Gauntlet.” They would then fight in the Battle of Corellia, where Havoc Squad reclaimed the Bastion, a Republic stronghold on the planet, and captured the Imperial General Arkos Rakton. Each member of Havoc Squad, Aric Jorgan included, was awarded the Gold Crescent for this action.\n\n# Section 4\nWhile deployed with Havoc Squad, Jorgan would receive information that his former squad, the Deadeyes, had been captured by the Sith Empire and forced into slave labor. With the approval of his Sergeant, he pursued his former squad’s tracks with interference from Republic Strategic Information Service agent Zane. In time, Jorgan would find all of his former squadmates, finding the last few on Hoth after two had died from the cold. Jorgan would also learn that Senior Agent Zane was intentionally planting hundreds of Republic soldiers into POW camps in the hopes that one of them would lead him to the mythical station Dusk 9, which was never found.\n\n# Section 5\nFour years after the Battle of Corellia, the galaxy was attacked by the Eternal Empire of Zakuul. Early in this conquest, the commander of the Havoc Squad was declared MIA. Most of Havoc’s members went their way with Jorgan being the only member to remain in active service. Due to this, Jorgan was promoted to the rank of Major and given full command over Havoc Squad. During this time, Jorgan would become disenthralled with the Republic due to the way it was run by the then Supreme Chancellor Saresh and its inaction against the Eternal Throne. Jorgan would later take Havoc Squad to Zakuul, the capital of the Eternal Empire, on an unsanctioned mission to plant wiretaps on various listening outposts. While on Zakuul, Jorgan would meet the Alliance Commander and would work with them, with the Alliance being a conglomerate of people both from the Republic and the Empire, Jedi and Sith as well, attempting to take down the Eternal Empire. After the success of this mission, Jorgan would return later to disable the GEMINI frequency, with the mission being a near-total failure, Havoc suffering near destruction. Afterward, Jorgan would fully commit to the Alliance’s cause. It was unknown what he had done afterward, when he died, how he died, or where he died.\n\n","meta":{"index":193,"author":"dereklo","name":"Aric Jorgan","release_year":2021}},"Eeth Koth":{"content":"# Introduction\nEeth Koth was a Zabrak Jedi Master born in the violent slums on the planet Nar Shadda, who was found to be Force-sensitive at the age of four. He also served on the Jedi High Council around the final years of the Galactic Republic. He was well known for his discipline, as well as most Iridonian Zabarak, and allowed him to tolerate all kinds of both physical and mental suffering. This allowed him to survive the harsh elements and environments of Nar Shaddaa, and was even deemed to be too young for Jedi training at the age of four. Harnessing natural abilities and being exceptionally strong in the Force, Eeth Koth was granted Jedi training due to his capabilities, and was brought to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Koth succeeded in many things, as well as becoming a member of the Jedi High Council, and serving as a Jedi General in the Battle of Geonosis, as a part of the Geonosis strike team, which consisted of over two-hundred and twelve Jedi. Eeth Koth was presumed to be dead after a deadly LAAT gunship crash, which he was in along with Tarados Gon. Eeth would then return to the Temple, and return to his duties. In efforts to confront the General of the Separatist Droid Army, Grievous, Eeth Koth led a strike team during the Battle of Korriban, leading to Grievous’s capture in the Outer Rim.# Section 1\nEeth Koth was a devout member of the Jedi Order and had very strong ties to other Masters within, but nothing beat the bond he had with his Padawan, Sharad Hett, who he took in and passed his abilities to. His bond also strengthened with Mace Windu after their success and completion of the Jedi ritual, the Concordance of Fealty, after the invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY. Eeth was also trained as a Jedi Guardian and harnessed very skilled abilities in tactical advantage and craft when wielding a lightsaber. Eeth’s lightsaber contained a green Kyber crystal, producing an emerald blade. Eeth's greatest strengths, including his capability of wielding the Force proficiently, lay in his ability where he can hone his mind, and use it as a disciplined weapon in emergencies. While being extremely skilled in duels, Eeth was capable of holding off and facing off against Grievous, while being forced on the defensive with his lightsaber, due to a forearm injury. Koth demonstrated proficiency as he unleashed a powerful Force ability, resulting in telekinetic blasts, which he used to subdue General Grievous temporarily. He was also known to use his double-bladed green lightsaber in duels and sparring bouts among his fellow Jedi.\n\n","meta":{"index":105,"author":"OceanPanik","name":"Eeth Koth","release_year":2020}},"Ziro the Hutt":{"content":"# Introduction\nZiro Desilijic Tiure was born on the planet Sleheyron. The exact location and date were unknown. His parents were Mama and Papa, and he had two brothers. They were Ebor the Hutt and the father of Jabba, Zorba Desilijic Tiure. Not long after becoming an adult, Ziro left the Hutt Space and went to Coruscant, where he established his club. That is where he gained his criminal nickname, Ziro the Hutt, and eventually became the Master of the Hutt Clan, controlling 7-star systems. Ziro was a 12 feet tall and 10 feet long Hutt male with purple skin color and yellow tattoos. He also had a son named Hiro.# Section 1\nDuring the Clone Wars, Ziro conspired with the Separatists to bring Jabba into conflict with the Republic and allow the Separatists to travel on his nephew’s hyperspace paths. His actions were motivated, as he later admitted, by threats from Count Dooku. His participation in the conspiracy was to kidnap Rotta and take him to the monastery on the Teth. However, this plan failed as the Jedi managed to rescue Jabba’s son. When Jabba was betrayed by Dooku, he severed contact with the Jedi and the Chancellor.\n\nTo resume negotiations, Senator Amidala went to Ziro’s headquarters to ask him to talk with his nephew and convince him to join the Republic. To cover up his conspiracy, Ziro refused to speak any further. Ziro captured Senator Amidala and tried to execute her, but she was rescued by a clone unit under Commander Fox. Then they arrested Ziro for treason against the Republic. In order to save himself, Ziro spoke with Jabba about the Separatist Conspiracy and made Jabba open his territory to the Republic.\n\nZiro spent many months in prison, but as a valuable figure, Dooku organized his breakout. The operation was conducted by bounty hunter Cad Bane.\n\n# Section 2\nZiro was imprisoned by the Council of Five Families after arriving at Nal Hutta. He was freed by Sy Snootles, who pretended to be Hutt’s mistress. He took her to his father’s grave. To get to the crypt, you had to know the password, which Ziro knew. After entering the crypt, Sy, who was working for Gardulla and the other Hutts, killed him.

He was born on the planet of Irmenu and became the heir to the title known as ‘Count of Gesl’. However, Vau was kicked out of his homeworld, Irmenu, due to the fact he had an affair with a known princess of a neighbouring place. Due to the fact, Vau was kicked out of his hometown, he eventually would become a Mandalorian soon afterward. He would be eventually recruited by Jango Fett and joined the rank of Cuy’val Dar and would help in training the Clone Army.# Section 1\nWalon Vau believed that the clones he trained for battle should become Mandalorian when they eventually get older. He did not treat his clones like Kal Skirata did, he treated them with strict discipline which sometimes included violence due to this being the mandalorian way. Sometimes he would create fire exercises, fights against one another or even melee matches to prepare them to be tougher than everyone else. One of the clones known as Atin, decided to fight against Vau, however, Atin lost and for a month was put inside a bacta tank. The only way he believed he had brought them up right was by putting them through true pain, teaching them what it's like, and being ready for it when it comes to them in an actual battle. \n\nVau and someone named Skirata often and majourily disagreed with each other's training techniques due to the outcome of Vau’s and Atin’s fight, which put him inside a bacta tank for a month. Due to the battle that occurred between Atin and Vau, Skirata and Vau had one, almost ending in Vau being murdered by Skirata. Even if it did not look like Vau cared for his clones, he did, you can see this when Sev, also known as RC-1207 went missing, Vau dedicated himself to trying to find that lost clone.\n\n# Section 2\nWalon Vau’s techniques were proven very efficient and effective during the Clone Wars. Vau had lost three members of his clone group, however, his enemy Skirata had already lost fourteen members. Once his contract ended when he was a member of Cuy’val Dar, he decided to go back to being a normal citizen. Kal Skirata surprisingly recruited Walon Vau to help him in destroying the Confederacy of Independent Systems. This mission put him in close contact with the clone he swore on finding, Atin. Due to the fact of Atin’s and Vau’s history, Atin swore that he was going to murder Vau one day, but did not as he wanted to keep the mission going safely and securely. \n\nJedi Knight Etain Tur-Mukan and Walon Vau at the end of the mission decided to work together to stop the terrorist leader, known as Perrive. Vau showed off all of his superior sniper skills by executing Perrive in one single shot of his gun.\n\n# Section 3\nWalon Vau’s former clone, Atin, swore to get his revenge again once he realised the mission was a success and completed. He one day found Vau and fought him, however, neither of them won due to the fact a Jedi General known as Bardan Jusik separated them both before either one of them murdered the other. Vau and Atin’s argument seemed to calm down and they resolved their problem on very, very loose terms.\n\n# Section 4\nWalon Vau eventually joined a squad known as Delta Squad that was located on the planet Mygeeto. He had the Delta Squad help him to break into the bank known as Dressian Kiolsh Merchant Bank, where he stole his family inheritance from his family vault. Then, Vau fell inside of a pit almost freezing to death when trying to escape, however, Skirata and Ordo rescued the almost dead-man. He gave everything to Skirata to help him in the search for a way to stop the clown’s ageing. \n\nLater on, Vau decided to join Ordo and Skirata on the planet of Mandalore. When this was happening, a man named Null-10 decided with Vau that when Vau died, someone named Jaing would take care of someone named Mird. \n\nVau was asked by a man named Zey to keep an open eye on Skirata as he was being currently suspected of treason. However, Vau betrayed Zey and told Skirata about what he was being suspected of but promised Skirata that this will not be told to anyone or even go anywhere. \n\nOnce Order 66 and the battle of Coruscant have finished Vau and Skirata helped each other escape taking some of the clones that had joined the clan named Clan Skirata to a secret location on Mandalore. Vau decided to majourily help Skirata with his work which was to stop the clone ageing acceleration.\n\n# Section 5\nWalon Vau decided to try and find his lost clone, Sev on Kashyyyk however he failed and was unable to find Sev. Due to the fact, he failed his rescue mission, he went back to the secret location [Kyrimorut] that was on Mandalore and returned to the Clan Skirata.

Darach held the rank of Jedi Battlemaster but due to his extreme philosophy against all forms of the Dark Side, received a relatively inglorious posting to the garrison monitoring the ancient Sith world of Korriban. On this assignment, Darach and Shan encountered the famed smuggler Nico Okarr who tried to purchase stolen Sith artifacts from scavengers in the Korriban ruins. As Darach and Shan returned to the orbital station, a large contingent of the Resurgent Sith Empire emerged from hyperspace, jamming the station’s communications to prevent any warning of their return reaching the Republic.# Section 1\nDarach, Shan and Okarr were joined by Corporal Jace Malcom, a Republic Trooper aboard the station, who aided the party in repelling Sith forces. Upon reaching the hanger and attempting to flee, Darach was confronted by Vindican and Malgus, two Sith who had boarded the station. After dueling the duo, Darach ordered Shan, Okarr and Malcom to flee, taking Shan’s dualsaber to aid in his battle. Darach defeated Vindican, but due to a range of factors was killed by Malgus moments later. His sacrifice allowed Okarr’s ship to escape the hanger, and Shan ultimately warned the Republic of this new threat, marking the beginning of the Great Galactic War.\n\n# Section 2\nDarach was a Zabrak who demonstrated immense mastery of both lightsaber combat and the Force, being capable of wielding three blades simultaneously against two opponents.

During her partnership with the Empire, she assassinated Republic Senator Keenig, fought alongside the Imperial forces on Alderaan, attacked a Republic political envoy, and infiltrated the Jedi Temple, where she disabled the defense grid, allowing the Sith armada to attack Coruscant.# Section 1\nAs a young Mandalorian warrior, Vizla earned a living by taking high-profile jobs for sums of money, without caring about employer intentions. At the start of the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, an alliance was formed between the Empire and the Mandalorian warrior clans, which was strong under the reign of Mand’alor the Vindicated. After she assassinated Keenig, her skill was noticed by the Sith Lord Darth Malgus, and she began a partnership with the Sith Empire. The Empire would utilize her skill and efficiency in major campaigns, including the attack on Alderaan. Imperial forces led by Darth Malgus invaded the peaceful world but were met by Republic special forces and Jedi Knights. Jedi Grand Master Satale Shan faced Malgus, consequently defeating him, and leaving him under a pile of rubble. Malgus escaped, believed to have been saved by Vizla.\n\n# Section 2\nTwenty-eight years into the Great Galactic War, in 3653 BBY, the Sith Empire contacted the Galactic Republic asking for the negotiations of a peaceful resolution. As both sides met on Alderaan to create a peace agreement, Shae Vizla was sent by the Empire to Coruscant, the galactic capital, where she would infiltrate the Jedi Temple and shut down the planet’s defense grid, once again working with Malgus. She entered the Temple via a high window, whilst a captured Republic shuttle carrying Sith warriors crashed through the Temple entrance. With the main forces distracted, Vizla moved through the Temple, eliminating Temple Security forces, and made her way to the defense mainframe. After disabling it, the Sith fleet of Darth Angral began laying waste to Coruscant, and Vizla used her jetpack to join the Imperial forces in the lower levels. At the end of the battle, the Sith were victorious over the Jedi.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Sacking of Coruscant led to the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Coruscant by the Republic, beginning the decade-long Cold War. As a mercenary, Vizla climbed to the top of her profession, eventually surpassing Mand’alor the Vindicated in her list of victories. After her years of success, she started taking fewer contracts, focussing on her duties as leader of Clan Vizla. By the time of the new Galactic War, her clan had withdrawn from galactic events and settled on the remote planet of Rishi. They built a base on Tracyn Island, where the Mandalorians were free to train. Although Vizla avoided the war and distanced herself from the other warriors, the locals of Rishi knew of their presence and nicknamed her “Torch.” They had helped the Nova Blades pirates in their relationship with the people of Raider’s Cove, and allied with the Revanites when they arrived in 3642 BBY, but withdrew from the partnership when they found out about the Revanites’ intentions of manipulating the ongoing war between the Empire and the Republic.\n\n# Section 4\nBy the year of 3637 BBY, the Nova Blades and the Revanites had built a large and powerful fleet. After learning about the involvement of “Torch” from the files of the Nova Blades captain, Dael Margok, an associate of Theron Shan and Lana Beniko, who were working against the Revanites, travelled to Tracyn Island to get more information but their shuttle was shot down on arrival. After watching the intruder reach the island, Vizla sent Mandalorians and dangerous fauna to defeat them. The intruder defeated Vizla’s forces and went on to duel her personally. Vizla lost, and finding the intruder’s victory honourable, gave over information about the Revanites. This information would save the Republic and Imperial fleets, who were fighting in a Revanite trap above Rishi. This led to the formation of the Yavin Coalition between the Republic and the Empire against the Revanites, and Vizla would join the Coalition forces against Revan.\n\n# Section 5\nAfter the defeat of Revan, Darth Marr led the Coalition in pursuit of the revived soul of the former Sith Emperor Vitiate, resulting in the discovery of the Eternal Empire of Zakuul and its plans to seize control of the galaxy. The Mandalorians fought back, but Mand’alor the Vindicated was killed in battle by Zakuul elite Skytroopers. After the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire signed treaties with the Eternal Empire, the Eternal Fleet, and Star Fortresses were used to blockade Core Worlds. Mandalorian clans were either trapped in their worlds or scattered across the galaxy. Having reached the status of a legend, Vizla was chosen as the new leader, and named “Mand’alor the Avenger”. She would lead the Mandalorians in a number of victories alongside the Eternal Alliance, including a siege of a weapons factory on Darvannis, providing them with more weapons to use against the Eternal Empire. After the war had ended in 3627 BBY, piracy was at its peak, and the Mandalorians started to work on securing supply lines. In 3626 BBY, the Mandalorian flagship Spirit of Vengeance II was attacked by the Hidden Chain, an organization of combined clans including Clan Varad, the Dar’manda, and the Ash’ad. With Vizla’s trusted advisor Jekiah Ordo on board, along with the Mand’alor, the Commander of the Eternal Alliance, and Jekiah’s brother Rass Ordo, rushed to defend the ship from the attackers. The Mand’alor went to challenge the enemy’s leader, Field Marshal Heta Kol but ended up defending against reinforcements whilst the Alliance Commander and Rass Ordo faced Kol. Kol was forced to escape, but not without her forces’ capture of Clan Cadera’s banner, an important symbol of the Mandalorians. Following the attack, the Mand’alor went to find Indigo, the leader of the Dar’manda, in the fueling station of the mined-out asteroid Mek-Sha, in pursuit of the Hidden Chain but Indigo denied having any knowledge of the matter.\n\n","meta":{"index":190,"author":"MonsterMash2070","name":"Mandalore the Avenger","release_year":2021}},"Naro":{"content":"# Introduction\nNaro was a male Selkath Je’daii Master who served the Order on Tython.

Biggs was assigned as a pilot for the assault against the Death Star in the hopes to destroy it, before it destroyed Yavin IV first. Both Biggs and Luke reunited and had a short conversation as they were preparing for battle. Once the Battle of Yavin began, Biggs fell under the callsign Red Three.

Corran Horn was descended from a great family of Corellian Jedis known as the Halcyon family which have served their homeworld for many hundreds of years, but have passed since the Old Republic.# Section 1\nCorran Horn was not an ordinary Jedi. He did not have the power to use telekinesis, as he was born with a liability due to his bloodline to do so. However, because of this, he was in exchange for better proficiency with telepathic abilities such as mind tricks. Despite having the inability to use telekinesis he had a rare ability called Tutaminis, the ability to absorb energy. With that ability, he was able to convert energy from other sources to give him a momentary augmentation in his abilities.\n\n# Section 2\nCorran Horn would later have a seat on the reformed High Jedi council after the Yuuzhan Vong war ended.

Ahsoka would go on to become the Padawan of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker during the wars and would prove herself to be cocky, arrogant, and impulsive. Still, she would show herself as worthy, intelligent, observant, and skilled in combat and using the Force. Utilizing Form V, or Shein, she would prove capable of handling herself in many sticky situations against Sith and other hostiles she came across.# Section 1\nJedi Master Plo-Koon found Ahsoka at the young age of three while on a mission to her home planet. He would give her the option to go with him to Coruscant, where she would be trained in the Jedi ways, or to stay on Shili; Ahsoka would choose to go with the Jedi Master, even growing a close friendship and bond with him.\n\nAhsoka's strong Force sensitivity gave her the opportunity to live in the Palace of the Jedi. This home would provide comfort, wisdom, and friendships that would last a lifetime. During her time in the Jedi Academy, Ahsoka was placed in the Clawmouse Clan. This clan would be a group of Initiates within the Order that would progress through the Academy together, improving as one while helping each other to graduate. After Ahsoka's graduation, Jedi Grandmaster Yoda placed her under the supervision of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, with a personality similar to her own, being proficient in the Force despite his recklessness.\n\n# Section 2\nAlthough Anakin was Ahsoka's master, many others would mentor Ahsoka, providing insight and wisdom. One of these mentors would be Jedi Master Tera Sinube, a slow yet methodical Jedi Master. Master Sinube would be a great teacher to Ahsoka despite an antithetical attitude to Ahsoka. Sinube would teach Ahsoka the value of patience and alternative means to reach one's goal. \n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Ahsoka's impulsiveness and lack of awareness would cause her to lose her lightsaber. Too afraid to consult Anakin Skywalker on her failures, she instead turned to Master Sinube, who agreed to help reclaim her lightsaber and redeem herself. Ahsoka and Sinube's hunt led them to the underworld of Coruscant, a bottomless, dark pit of scavengers, murderers, and thieves. \n\nAhsoka and Sinube would eventually reclaim her once-lost lightsaber after learning lessons about patience and premeditation of one's actions. Sinube taught Ahsoka that taking your time and being patient will have advantages as you are more observant and cautious than you would be acting impulsive or recklessly.\n\n# Section 3\nWhile initially an impulsive and overly confident padawan, Ahsoka would grow to become humble, mature, observant, and wise. At times Ahsoka would even teach her master Anakin Skywalker the perks of patience. She would often create nicknames for others, some degrading, some attempts at humor. At first, her relationship with her master Anakin Skywalker would begin informally, and Ahsoka would refer to her master as \"Skyguy,\" a name that would not last long. \n\nAfter their bond grew and their relationship grew more formal, Ahsoka would begin calling Anakin \"Master,\" as most Padawans were inclined to do. In response to Ahsoka's original nickname, Anakin would call her \"Snips\" due to her aggressive and erratic personality.\n\nUtilizing Shein, or Form 5, Ahsoka would be considerably talented for her age. Deemed initially \"rough\" by Anakin, she would only improve with combat training. Throughout her time as a Padawan, Ahsoka would face up against many hostiles. Some hostiles include Asajj Ventress, General Grievous, Darth Maul, Cad Bane, and many others.\n\nAlong with her physical prowess, she also possessed remarkable skill with the Force. Her connection to the Force allowed her to leap extremely high distances and pull down larger objects than normally possible for Jedi; Ahsoka also possessed a strong Force Sense. This can be exemplified in situations such as when Jedi Master Plo-Koon was stranded in space and was presumed dead by other Jedi. However, Ahsoka could sense Plo, leading to his rescue.\n\n# Section 4\nLike many Padawans during the Clone War Era, Ahsoka would never become a Knight. However, unlike many Padawans, it would not be due to the enactment of Order 66. During a mission on the planet Cato Neimoidia, there would be an explosion within the Jedi Temple. \n\nAhsoka and her Master, Anakin Skywalker, would be sent to investigate the attack and find whoever was responsible. Ahsoka and Anakin eventually apprehended the suspect, Letta Turmond, discovering that she owned the nano-droids used in the explosion.\n\nAfter Letta’s imprisonment, Ahsoka would visit her in prison, where Letta would go on to inform Ahsoka that the droids were given to her by a fellow Jedi. However, before Letta could go on to reveal \nthe name of said Jedi, she was murdered by a cloaked figure. The figure would then run off, leaving Ahsoka with Letta; the clones would soon arrive at the cell with the immediate belief that Ahsoka had killed Letta. Ahsoka was arrested after being the only viable suspect at the time of the crime.\n\nAfter escaping her cell by using the Force to pick up a keycard left outside her cell, she was on the run. She successfully avoided patrols of clones until she came across a large group of clones that had all been attacked by someone using her lightsaber. As she picked up her lightsaber, clone Commander Fox would stumble across her and automatically assume her guilty. He would then sound the alarms while Ahsoka would flee.\n\nCommander Fox, as well as clone Captain Rex and Anakin Skywalker, would also give chase. Ahsoka would eventually flee the prison compound, narrowly escaping many close encounters with clone troopers. Forced into laying low, Ahsoka would contact Barris Offee, who insisted she would help by investigating the issue further.\n\n# Section 5\nLiving in the dark underworld of Coruscant, Ahsoka would come across many individuals that she would have previously considered dangerous. One of these individuals was a former Sith Apprentice, now turned Bounty Hunter, Asajj Ventress. Ventress had decided to help Ahsoka because Ahsoka had previously helped to clear Ventress’ name. \n\nTo capture the escaped Padawan, the Jedi High Council sent Anakin Skywalker, Plo Koon, and a squad of clone troopers. As they fled from the pursuing clones and Jedi, Tano utilized a public holo-terminal to contact Barriss Offee. When she described the warehouse where Turmond obtained the nano-droids to Tano, Ventress agreed to accompany Tano there. Before they could leave, a clone squad under Commander Wolffe confronted Tano and Ventress and demanded they surrender. Tano and Ventress succeeded in disarming the clones so they could flee. They came upon the warehouse and decided to part ways, with Ventress giving Tano her lightsaber. \n\nAfter the two had separated, Ventress was attacked by a cloaked Dark Jedi. The figure would defeat Ventress in battle and go on to steal both her lightsabers and clothes. With this new disguise, the Dark Jedi would hunt down Ahsoka and attack her. Ahsoka entered the battle confused and distraught as she believed that one of the few allies she had left was now attacking her; regardless, Ahsoka still defended herself.\n\nThe cloaked figure would draw out the fight within the warehouse. Eventually, the Dark Jedi would ignite barrels of explosive gas. This explosion would knock Ahsoka back and alert the Coruscant Security Force, who was again in pursuit. Now knocked out, Ahsoka would be left helpless as Commander Wolffe and the surrounding troopers finally caught up to her. The clone troopers would find Ahsoka lying surrounded by crates of Nano-Droids, which had further proved her guilt for the crime.\n\n# Section 6\nAhsoka was arrested for the bombing of the Jedi Temple and was due to be trialed under the eyes of the Jedi High Council; however, due to the severity of her supposed actions, Ahsoka would be expelled from the Jedi Order and trialed under the eyes of the Galactic Republic instead. In her defense stood Senator Padme Amidala, with Wilhuff Tarkin representing the prosecutors.\n\nThe trial was not going well; all evidence provided had pointed directly toward Ahsoka. It was clear to Ahsoka and many in attendance that whether or not she was guilty, she would be trialed as such. However, before the verdict was announced, her former master, Anakin Skywalker, had burst into the trial with new profound evidence. Anakin had proven Ahsoka's innocence by discovering the true culprit, Barriss Offee.\n\n# Section 7\nConfused and shocked once more that an ally had turned against her, Ahsoka was both relieved and sad to hear this. Considering her new innocent verdict, the High Council offered to reinstate her in the Order as a Padawan. Ahsoka declined this offer because she felt her trust had been broken or perhaps never there. She believed she could not continue to live and support an Order that did not trust her.\n\nAs she left the Temple on Coruscant, Ahsoka was approached by her former Master, Anakin. He would try his very best to convince Ahsoka to rejoin the Order, and she instead refused and began a new journey.\n\n","meta":{"index":187,"author":"JowsDemici","name":"Ahsoka Tano","release_year":2021}},"ARC-77 \"Fordo\"":{"content":"# Introduction\nARC-77, codenamed “Fordo,” was an Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commando who served as Captain within the Grand Army of the Republic.

In his short reign over one of the fiefdoms (large area of galactic space) he conquered much of the Tion Cluster. This all occurred before the founding of the Republic and thus was outside of their jurisdiction entirely. He inherited a vast wealth from his father, and used this to fuel his war efforts.\n\nHe met an unfortunate and unexpected demise when he was captured at the Third Battle of Vontor by Kossak Inijic Ar’durv, a self-proclaimed leader of the Hutts. Xim died later simply by rotting away in Hutt jails. However, the mystery of where he kept his great fortunes is a legend that many still look for throughout the galaxy.# Section 1\nBorn on Argai, and raised by an incredibly powerful pirate, it was only natural that he’d enter politics and later become the leader of a criminal empire. Xim was a vicious boy, murdering many of Cron’s nobility called the Cronese Sweeps in a plight for power. \n\nThis earned him a reputation, which he further amplified by subjugating the Livien League, a cluster of various planets. The scale of this assault is legendary, and speaks volumes to the extent of this boy's power.\n\nInterestingly, Maslovar Tiatiov, the military ruler of Livien at the time, showed Xim various facilities, academies and bureaucracies which led to him being spared as Xim was impressed. Xim later learned from these academies, and applied their methods in his own armies and fleets using devastating technology such as war droids and beam-tubes.\n\nDuring Xim’s conquest, he came upon Queen Indrexu who was later written into Xim-related mythology. Xim - although it is debated - valued this woman very much, and titled an entire six province of his empire under her name.\n\nWithin (30) years, Xim had managed to inexplicably have an empire that consisted of thousands of worlds. This glory was threatened by the rise of a new empire known as the Hutts. Xim initially did not favour a war with them, but after they claimed the Xim and Tionese would be excellent slaves, he launched a military campaign against them.\n\n# Section 2\nThe war started promptly, with neither side gaining a footing. Xim’s armies looted Ko Vari which contained many of the Hutts resources, but their fleet was pushed back with many flagships being lost in the black holes that surround Xo’s Eye. Strategically, this was a failure for Xim.\n\nKossak the Hutt realised as the war dragged on that the Tionese were much more capable of fighting a long war of attrition and thus desperately taunted Xim into a battle of ritual combat at Vontor. Xim, having his pride hurt, accepted and his fleet was defeated by the Hutts at the First Battle of Vontor. The Second Battle of Vontor ended much the same, except his ground forces this time were absolutely massacred. Furthermore, the Hutts, being excellent at pirating, were looting and cutting into the supply lines of Xim’s empire, eating away their resources. This ultimately weakened Xim’s military might.\n\n# Section 3\nUltimately, at the third Battle of Vontor, XIm’s already weakened armies had to face an insurmountable army of Hutt, who had also gathered numerous allies, namely: Klatooinian, Nikto, Weequay and Vodran. Furthermore, it is rumoured that there were defectors and cowardly traitors amongst Xim’s empire who eroded the might of their army. With this said, Xim’s army was annihilated. Xim was captured, and his eyes were cut away. \n\nThe Hutts, a truly vile species, paraded Xim throughout their cities as a trophy, and eventually he died in a Varl dungeon. It is rumoured that he was actually stabbed in the back by one of his own men at Vontor, but it is uncertain.\n\n# Section 4\nThe Queen of Ranroon, Xim’s famous treasure ship that held his vast wealth supposedly escaped to Dellalt where it is still guarded by an army of war droids and a brotherhood known as the “Survivors''. These individuals are descendants from the original captains and pilots of the Ranroon treasure ship. Xim’s empire scattered and fragmented, but still survives partially through the criminal organisation GenoHaradan.\n\nXim’s treasure has inspired many adventurers, but was actually discovered by Han Solo and S.V. Skynx who concluded that it’s technology was worthless.\n\nXim’s reign and the study of it is now known as Ximology, and has inspired books, holoplays and literary collaborations.\n\n","meta":{"index":27,"author":"Souleth","name":"Xim the Despot","release_year":2020}},"Wilhuff Tarkin":{"content":"# Introduction\nWilhuff Tarkin is a human male born on the Outer Rim Territories in the planet Eriadu around 59 BBY.

They were able to achieve what Guardians did through combat through words and mediation. However, Master Pina exhibited traits that are not typical of a Consular. \n\nMaster Pina had a great taste for battle, and enjoyed fighting on the battlefield, both traits that are very uncommon amongst the Consulars. He was very proficient in combat, wielding two Force-imbued katanas created in the forges of Vur Tepe. The blades emitted a soft green glow and were set with emeralds, giving him the alias of \"The Green Blade\". Unfortunately, these blades would disappear following his demise. Despite his craving for battle, Pina still believed that Society needed Order and structure to function properly.# Section 1\nPina eventually achieved the rank of Master, and soon after Grand Master, due to his exceptional combat prowess and wisdom.

The hunt occurred on the planet Saleucami on 21 BBY. Jesse, along with fellow clones Kix and Hardcase, followed the hunt under the command of Captain Rex. The clones were looking for escape pods that crashed along with Grievous’s starship. To search quicker, the clones used BARC speeders. While looking for escape pods, two Commando Droids had injured Rex. Jesse, Hardcase, and Kix took Captain Rex to the closest homestead so he had time to recover. Once at the homestead, a female Twi’lek named Suu greeted the clones by pointing a rifle at them. Jesse and Kix explained to Suu that they needed somewhere to let Captain Rex recover.

Home to the Great Jedi Library, built and overseen by the ancient Jedi Master Odan Urr. Freedon Nadd at a young age would start his Jedi training; having grown up like many of his peers hearing of extraordinary deeds done by Jedi Knights through their command of the force, and those akin. Nadd ached to stand among the Jedi Knights. He wanted nothing more than to become a Jedi Knight. The eagerness, and desire to excel showed in Nadd’s progress. In what seemed like no time he had forged a deep understanding of the force, and had crafted his own lightsaber. His lightsaber blade was short, and shined with a bronze hue, as if accentuating the bright fire that burned within Nadd’s soul. It did not take long for the Masters to take notice of Nadd’s progress. They were impressed by not only his skill, but his openness to accept universal harmony. Many of the Masters on Ossus took part in Nadd’s training, even going so far as to have one-on-one training with Odan Urr. The Jedi didn’t doubt Nadd’s abilities. Many speculated he was to become a Jedi far sooner than his classmates. There was one final test he had to do before he became a Jedi Knight. The test of humility.# Section 1\nFreedan Nadd’s test wouldn’t be one of body, but one of spirit; to see how he coped with failure, and whether or not he could stay true to the ideals of Jedi selflessness. When the day came for Jedi to become Knights and be inducted into the order. Nadd believed his promotion was imminent, finally he could stand among the Jedi Knights. Unfortunately to his elation the Master’s completely passed over him during the ceremony. The young man felt as if his universe had crashed around him, as if he had been gouged through the chest. He was outraged. The thoughts of vengeance slowly made their presence known within his mind, still confused as to what the Masters wanted of him; Nadd sought out one of his masters for advice on the matter. Matta Tremayane; one of the finest lightsaber instructors of her time, often spending hours on the outskirts of the Ossus city practicing her various lightsaber techniques. Nadd upon arriving upon the elderly woman was mesmerized at her saber-work. Her transitions, and moves were flawless and precise. It was as if the techniques were as natural to her as breathing.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter some time of waiting Nadd approached the woman, furious that she had neglected to acknowledge his presence. After a rather angrily charged conversation the two engaged in a rigorous duel, though Nadd made a feeble attempt to stop his blade though undoubtedly failed, and with that he had struck down his Master. Nadd acknowledged his failure, and berated himself for it. Though he thought Matta was ignorant, and had brought the strike upon herself and he felt no pity for the woman. In a fit of rage Nadd left Ossus, determined to become the most powerful Sith Sorcerer the galaxy had ever seen, and to make the Masters pay for not granting his Knighthood, as Nadd thought they were inferior to him. Nadd then fled to Ashuss Ree, an ancient Sith system. Nadd upon arriving on the planet would find an ancient artifact in the ruins of a deserted temple. The holocron of King Adaeus, from within he learned of the red-skinned ancient Sith species; where he also learned of Naga Sadao who he would eventually be apprenticed to.\n\n# Section 3\nNadd upon landing on the planet of Yavin IV was set upon by a group of Massassi warriors which he rather easily dispatched before making his way into the tomb of Naga Sadao, those left lead Nadd into the depths of the temple and to Naga Sadao’s preserved body within the tomb to be awakened when one was worthy of his teachings, and power. Nadd would awaken Sadao from his tomb before asking the ancient Sith to take him on as his apprentice. Sadao impressed with the young man’s fortitude, and expertise agreed, taking Nadd on as his apprentice. Sadao would spend years training Nadd, bringing him to his full potential as a Sith Sorcerer. Nadd upon reaching his full potential challenged Sadao, and with that he struck the ancient Sith down, destroying his body and forcing his frail spirit back into the depths of the inner-workings of the temple. Freedan after collecting a trove of ancient Sith artifacts once more took to the stars before making his way shortly to Anderaan, a world strong in the force, and harsh; the perfect place for him to start a new Sith Empire. Nadd using the knowledge he had attained both from the holocron, and Sadao’s teachings would with ease overthrow the Monarchs, before crowning himself KIng; crafting a crown from Anderaanian iron, and turned Anderaanian culture into one steeped in Sith lore, and magic.\n\n# Section 4\nThe people worshipped the dark-side as the one, and only power in the galaxy, though as the years went on and Nadd’s power grew his body started to grotesquely deform, and strain under his immense dark-side power; his skin becoming pale, his jaw slack, and his eyes transforming into blinding white spheres. Nadd assisted the Anderaanians in the development of modern technology, both to repel the beasts, and to euthanize those who didn’t accept his teachings. Along with this Nadd discovered a nearly indestructible crustacean species named the Obelisk; which far in the future Darth Bane would utilize after collecting sith artifacts. Nadd ruled over Anderaan for nearly a century, though soon word of his exploits, and tyranny reached the Jedi Order who sought to free Anderaan from his rule. A Jedi strike team was sent to Anderaan, and after a pitched battle Freedan Nadd and his forces were defeated. Nadd being so strong in the dark-side refused to die, isi spirit refuting to leave the physical plane, and with that he stayed.\n\n# Section 5\nThe spirit kept a watchful eye on the Anderaanians; influencing the people for many more generations as well as overseeing their practice. As Nadd’s descendants continued his work of destroying the beast riders and studying Sith alchemy in the works was a plan for Nadd to resurrect himself, teaching his descendants well he hoped to find a student to pass down his teachings too, and to bind his spirit to a physical body. To ensure that Amaan or Amaanoa would make a worthy body they competed, though as years passed their power was not sufficient enough to carry such a task. Nadd began to fear that he would never find a suitable apprentice. Resolving to end the conflict Amaanoa would be overthrown, the Jedi, and Amaanoa’s daughter would overthrow the woman. One Jedi in particular; Ulek Keldroma interested Nadd especially so. Nadd ordered Amaan to capture Ulek’s master. A powerful Jedi named Arka Jeif. A task Amaan was more than happy to perform. As Ulek and his Jedi ally struggled to hold off Amaan and his forces all the while desperate to save their master Nadd watched his plans slowly unfurl. As expected the battle on Anderaan had garnered the attention of not only the Jedi, but force adepts wanting to learn the ways of the Sith. Two of these adepts were the cousins Aleema, and Sal kito, who personally met with Amaan in order to help them decipher a Sith tome.\n\n# Section 6\nNadd resolved to make them the future of his word, secretly gifting them a horde of Sith artifacts and assisting in their escape. Ulek then overrunning Amaan caused Nadd to kill Amaan, then he receded back into the temple waiting to be awakened once more. He knew that what he had set in motion would lead to the destruction of the Jedi. Following the battle the Jedi attempted to remove Nadd’s influence from Anderaan; moving his remains onto the far-side of Duxaan, and encasing them in Mandalorian Iron. Freedan continued to haunt the caves of Anderaan, and visit the cousins to assist with their dark-side training, the pair quickly becoming Sith sorcerers, and founding a Sith worshipping cult called the craft. The two and their cult conquered systems and warred with the Jedi Order. In the ensuing madness Nadd sought to put the final phase of his plan into motion. Nadd came across a young Jedi who had an affinity in the force, and a fascination for Sith Alchemy, and Lore. His name was Exar Kuun. Nadd then instructed Kuun to make his way to Korriban; the ancient birthplace of the Sith. Nadd would guide Exar to a nearby cave, making sure he was able to commit wholly to the dark-side.\n\n# Section 7\nIf Kuun was willing to embrace the dark-side to save his life he was worthy of becoming his apprentice. Nadd nearly killed Kun, caving in the cave around him, though Kun’s master attempted to interfere. Nadd in retaliation struck out at Baas would banish his presence, leaving him and Kun alone. Kun then gave in, losing all resolve and giving in to the dark-side. Though the process caused him such pain his screams echoed across the stars. Nadd then lead Kun to the other tombs, hoping for the other Sith to judge him worthy of becoming the next dark-lord. Kun would make his way onto Yavin IV, the Massassi bringing him into the temple in order to revive himself. The Massassi prepared the ritual, preparing the ritual. Kun won the Massassi over, Nadd appearing over Kun before preparing to get his body back, he was overjoyed. Nadd’s time had come after centuries, and countless failures. Finally he would have his revenge against the Jedi. Though not to plan Nadd died a second death, wailing in agony as his spirit faded away into obscurity.\n\n","meta":{"index":20,"author":"Alegorri","name":"Freedan Nadd","release_year":2020}},"Marlo the Hutt":{"content":"# Introduction\nMarlo was a member of the Hutt species and was born on Nah Hutta during 997 BBY.

However, during the rise of the Empire, the years of isolation and survival on the wicked planet of Dathomir would stray Malicos from the light into the dark abyss the planet emits. Leaving him to be buried along with Dathomir’s history.# Section 1\nTaron Malicos was a Force sensitive human male, he had gray hair, blue eyes, and fair white skin. In the Republic Era he was known as a logical and great General, leading his army of clones through many great battles. It was during the rise of the Empire when his personality took a more aggressive turn. His ideals changed to idolizing power as the only way to live, stating that either strength in oneself or death were his only options, after being trapped on Dathomir. His appearance had even changed, the former Jedi would acquire multiple scars across his body from the Nightbrothers.\n\n# Section 2\nIn 19 BBY when Order 66 was enacted, Malicos was betrayed and attacked by his fellow clones in a similar way as other Jedi, by surprise and shock. Malicos had to make a quick decision and kill his own men and escape on his ship, crash-landing on Dathomir and being left stranded. Dathomir’s fauna and dark presence drove the Jedi to the dark side, as he felt that the power it gave was his only savior from the sinister planet. It was later that the Nightbrothers had found Malicos, they took Malicos to their current leader Viscus. Viscus and Malicos would engage each other in a duel that would leave Viscus dead and the fallen Jedi the victor, thus making Malicos the new leader of the Nightbrothers. Many Nightbrothers would challenge him for dominance of the clan, but all would fall to his strength in the Force. For his strength was the only thing they would fear and respect.\n\n# Section 3\nNow five years after the fall of the Order, the former Jedi Malicos used his experience as a tactician to not only lead the Nightbrothers, but to manipulate the last remaining Nightsister. He knew that Dathomirian Nightsister Merrin was in pain over the loss of her sisters, and used that pain to persuade her into teaching him the magick art. Malicos stated that it was the Jedi who conducted the Battle of Dathomir that wiped out the sister, even though it was known to be done by the Confederacy of Independent System to many except the naive Nightsister. He promised her revenge for the Jedi’s genocide of her Sisters if she taught him magick. Now that Malicos had both clans in his hand, he decided that expanding his group would be ideal. Malicos saw the young Padawan Cal Kestis touchdown on Dathomir, feeling his presence in the Force, he decided to disguise himself as a traveler and met the Padawan on the bridge leading to a dark temple. He told him he was just a wanderer that did not dare go into that temple, for it was filled with sinister energy that would corrupt all. Kestis would ignore his warning and enter anyway. Once Cal exited the temple, Malicos asked him how his experience was facing the dark energy. However, Cal ignored the question and questioned Malicos’s identity, since he was still a stranger to Cal Kestis. He then revealed himself as Taron Malicos, a Jedi General who had to fight on the cursed planet of Dathomir by tapping into the dark side. He told Kestis that he too can become powerful as well with the dark side's power if he joins him, if he joins his family as he was alone in dark times. Malicos’s persuasion was then interrupted by Nightsister Merrin, who had now seen through Malicos and his lies and deceitful nature. Malicos rebuttals, stating that Merrin let her power control her and she was possessed by it. Kestis took this diversion to escape from the conflict.\n\n# Section 4\nOnce Kestis returned to the Dathomir, he came back into contact with Merrin and told her the truth about not just Malicos but who really caused the death of her Nightsisters. Merrin told the Padawan that Malicos promised revenge if she taught him the magick arts, but now seeing that it was all a lie and meaningless. They then decided to make a pact to defeat the fallen Jedi once and for all. Cal Kestis met Malicos in the sinister temple, the dark side trying one last attempt to persuade the stubborn Jedi who did not yield to his manipulation. The duel starts, Malicos igniting both of his sabers and charging at the Padawan with intent to kill. The duel would be drawn out and vicious, as the fallen Jedi strength in the Force gave him an advantage. Malicos sent barrages of rock and boulders at the Padawan during the duel. When it seemed that a boulder from the wall formation of the temple would finish Kestis, Merrin used her magick to protect the Padawan and assault Malicos. Malicos deflected the attacks but he was distracted long enough. Merrin told Kestis to get up and face him again while she disappeared from the fight. Now with his second wind and Merrin supporting with an energy blast from a safe distance, Kestis attacked Malicos with all he had. Until Merrin found an opening to Malicos defense and grabbed him, she then did the brutal act of literally burying the Jedi alive under the tomb grounds. This would leave the Nightsister and Jedi duo victorious, and a horrendous end for the fallen Jedi, Taron Malicos.\n\n","meta":{"index":176,"author":"CoolDre1738","name":"Taron Malicos","release_year":2021}},"Ardinondu Daeruun":{"content":"# Introduction\nArdinondu Dipolus Daeruun was a Krex male hailing from the planet Rokirex, and was a general in the Republic military forces among many high ranking officers.

When the Republic got reorganised into the Empire, Yularen entered the intelligence business, acting as the leader of a task group charged with rooting out insurrection inside the government in the newly formed Imperial Security Bureau. By 0 BBY, he had advanced to the rank of colonel in the Bureau and was serving as the leader of the ISB contingent and a member of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's staff on the first Death Star.

Trench was thought to have gone down with his ship, but he later re-appeared in the Clone Wars to taunt the Republic.\n\n# Section 3\nBecause leaks in Republic law-enforcement organisations regularly tipped off his targets, Yularen's stint with the Kwymar fleet left him preoccupied with discovering corruption and safeguarding security.

Palpatine appointed him to an anti-corruption team within the Office of the Supreme Chancellor, which investigated both government corruption and individuals' affiliations to the rising Separatist movement.

He was deployed to a massive task force led by Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker a year into the conflict. Palpatine warned Yularen about Skywalker's unconventionality when appointing him to Skywalker's fleet, but maintained that it was the \"greatest praise.\" Yularen would often not agree with Skywalker’s reckless tactics but eventually learned to respect him.\n\n# Section 5\nDuring his time as a Republic officer, he fought numeral battles, including the battles of Christophsis, Teth, Kiros, Bothawui, the liberation of the Zygerrian servants, the destruction of the Malevolance, the battle of Kamino, the Liberation of Ryloth, the assault on Geonosis and many more. Yularen became a very successful Admiral. Once the Republic got re-organised into the Empire, Wullf rejoined the Intelligence business. During the early years of the Empire, Yularen led his own special task group, which was tasked with high-level missions, frequently involving an Imperial senator or other significant figures. One of these tasks was to look into the names of the signatories of the Petition of 2000, a document delivered to Palpatine by Senator Padmé Amidala on behalf of the Delegation of 2000, a vociferous group of senators opposed to Palpatine's growing power.\n\n# Section 6\nYularen had risen to the rank of colonel in the ISB at the commencement of the Rebellion and had earned a reputation as an excellent leader with unwavering personal loyalty to Palpatine. As a member of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's command staff, he was assigned to the nearly-completed Death Star I battle station, and due to the presence of ambitious high-ranking officers like Tarkin and Admiral Conan Antonio Motti, he was there to ensure that the station's personnel remained absolutely loyal to the Emperor. Yularen and other members of the Death Star's command staff, including Tarkin, Motti, and General Tagge, met in a conference room in 0 BBY to discuss the Empire's current status. For the majority of the discussion, the colonel stayed mute, calmly observing Motti and Tagge argue about the threat the Rebel Alliance posed to the Empire's forces. Yularen remained stoic even when Tarkin arrived with the news that the Emperor had disbanded the Imperial Senate. He sat calmly as Darth Vader, who was once Yularen's Jedi commander Anakin Skywalker, choked Motti for his disbelief in the Force's powers.\n\n# Section 7\nRight after the meeting, the Death Star got infiltrated by a group of rebels. They freed Princess Leia out of the detention levels and got out safely with the sacrifice of Obi-Wan Kenobi. The Empire was able to put a tracking device on their ship, which allowed them to track the rebels to Yavin 4, where their base was located. Once they arrived there to try and blow the moon up, the Rebels launched an attack on the station, which was successful. The station blew up and with that Wullf Yularen came to an end.\n\n","meta":{"index":168,"author":"DeBraamster","name":"Wullf Yularen","release_year":2021}},"Calleh":{"content":"# Introduction\nCalleh was a Force-sensitive Selkath, having black eyes with blue and grey skin similar to the oceans of Kamino.

Mace Windu served throughout many wars and was an overseer of the war effort as well as an advisor to the supreme chancellor Sheev Palpatine.\n\n# Section 2\nThroughout the war Mace Windu became suspicious of the chancellor's motives and his near dictating power over the Galactic Senate.

Since then, Val has fought alongside his master's apprentice, Ortan Cela, and companion, Veshikk Urk, devouring a great many Jedi in Yn and the Battle of Chabosh. Because of the great amount of conquest Hord produced, Val feasted all the more, creating a bond between the two. Centuries later, however, the story of Khem Val was no more than a mere legend. Tulak Hord abandoned him in the tomb of Naga Sadow on Korriban, where he trapped him in a stasis field guarded by such powerful energy that not even the strongest Sith could free him. Thousands of years later, at Zash's request, he was freed by a Sith acolyte. When he learned that Tulak Hord was dead, he raged and tried to kill the acolyte, but to no avail. So now he had to serve the acolyte, who later became known as Darth Nox, the heir of Aloysius Kallig. As the acolyte's power grew, Darth Zash called back her apprentice.# Section 1\nArriving, Zash told her that she would soon die, and therefore planned to take the body of her student. As Zash completed the ritual and was about to transfer her spirit into her apprentice's body, Khem Val attacked her to save his ruler, and so with slipped the spirit of Zash into Val and had to share the body from now on. The spirit of Aloysius Kallig saw this as a betrayal of Tulak Hord, and promised to expel Khem from his body one day. Zash planned to take the bones of Tulak Hord and use the energy in them, which was the same energy Khem had trapped Val in, to expel Val from his body. Kallig told Khem about Zash's plan; she tried to replicate the ritual with a Rakata spirit prison and capture Khem Val. When the ritual began, Val proved too powerful, and eventually, Zash was the one who was pulled into the box. Through the time of the Eternal Empire, Khem had earned the respect of Ak'ghal Usar, for his service to Tulak Hord.\n\n# Section 2\nKhem Val saw Kallig as not capable of carrying on the legacy of Tulak Hord and planned to devour him. But in time he began to respect his master and changed his mind. Val went from being a servant to a devoted enforcer of Kallig. Since Khem Val was a Dashade, he believed in honor and willingly served his masters. This belief formed a strong bond, forcing Zash to serve Kallig in the body of Khem Val. Khem felt honored when he was allowed to announce his master's ascension to Sith Lord and a Darth. Val was trained as an elite assassin to be a killing machine, the embodiment of death and destruction. He enjoys killing force users, plus he is quite powerful, cunning and, ruthless, which allows him to assassinate even the strongest. He is also often given to bragging, as over the victories of Yn and the Battle of Chabosh, where he killed thousands of Jedi.

Arcann trained alongside his twin brother Thexan since childhood, later fighting together in skirmishes against the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire. Following the death of his father, Arcann reigned over the Eternal Empire and dominated the galaxy for five years. His eventual downfall was brought by the formation of a resistance movement against Zakuul.# Section 2\nDuring their childhood, Arcann and his brother frequently swapped clothes to confuse their servants and irritated personnel for their own amusement. The twin princes were inseparable, regularly playing with each other, sparring and occasionally running away to live in Zakuul’s Endless Swamp for a month. They were trained from a young age to become warriors, joining the Knights of Zakuul to gain their fathers’s respect. Senya Tirall, a former Knight and member of Valkorion's elite guard, often oversaw the training of her two children. As a prince, Arcann wanted nothing more than to be shown love and affection by his father, but Valkorion’s carelessness led to Arcann’s growing animosity. His mother Senya loved the twins above all else, though neither Arcann nor his siblings returned her affection. When Valkorion confined their sister Vaylin on Nathema, Senya set out to leave Valkorion in order to take her children. Arcann and his siblings laughed off their mother, labelling her as weak.\n\n# Section 3\nIn 3636 BBY, the twin princes led several brief raids on the border worlds controlled by the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire. During the attack on Korriban, Arcann was severely wounded by an explosion which scarred the left half of his face and severed his left arm, requiring cybernetics to be fitted. Following the twins’ return to the Eternal Throne, Arcann demonstrated his resentment in an attempt to murder Valkorion for his indifference. Thexan swiftly intervened, only to be struck down by Arcann in a fit of blind rage. Arcann cradled Thexan in his arms, deeply regretting the death of his closest companion.\n\n# Section 4\nIn the same year, the Outlander was brought as a prisoner before the Eternal Throne. As Valkorion offered to share his power with them, Arcann used it as an opportunity to attempt an assassination on his father a second time. The assassination attempt was successful, though Arcann pinned the murder of the Immortal Emperor on the Outlander. Arcann sensed Valkorion’s essence had clung onto the Outlander and condemned them to be frozen in carbonite. He ascended to the Eternal Throne and appointed his sister Vaylin as the High Justice, immediately declaring an open war with the rest of the galaxy. The ensuing conflict crippled the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire within a year, allowing Arcann to thrust heavy sanctions upon the galactic powers, as well as forcing them to pay tribute to Zakuul.\n\n# Section 5\nDuring Arcann’s time as a prince, the leader of the Scions of Zakuul, Heskal, foreshadowed a great catastrophe. Arcann detested the Scions for their fanaticism surrounding their Force visions and ordered their complete eradication after assuming the Eternal Throne. Four years after the fall of the Core Worlds, the Outlander was breached from carbonite freezing by the Sith Intelligence Minister Lana Beniko and assisted by Zakuulan defector Koth Vortena, which infuriated the Eternal Emperor. The fugitives acquired the ancient Gravestone, a warship that rivalled the Eternal Fleet. The Outlander established the Alliance against Zakuul on Odessen and was henceforth known as the Alliance Commander. After discovering the Alliance headquarters on Odessen, Arcann launched an invasion which resulted in a space battle near the planet. Subsequently, Arcann was defeated by the Alliance Commander and the Gravestone destroyed the fleet attacking Odessen. In Arcann’s absence, Vaylin usurped the Eternal Throne and declared herself the Eternal Empress. Arcann’s failure against the Alliance confirmed Heskel’s prophecy regarding the decline of the Eternal Empire.\n\n# Section 6\nFollowing Vaylin’s demise, Valkorion’s spirit attempted to possess the Alliance Commander. As Valkorion battled the Alliance Commander in their own mindscape, the essence of Arcann materialized to assist the obliteration of Valkorion’s spirit, whom he viewed as the true enemy for manipulating him. Approximately a year later, it was revealed that the Sith entity Tenebrae, who used Valkorion as a host for centuries, had reemerged. In the mindscape of Satele Shan, the faces of Tenebrae were confronted by all the people that he had manipulated or murdered over centuries. Arcann and his family were present at the standoff to join in the entity’s permanent destruction. Upon meeting his brother, Thexan offered him forgiveness for his past wrongdoings. Arcann’s final battle alongside Revan, Meetra Surik and the Alliance Commander saw the last remnant of Tenebrae annihilated.\n\n","meta":{"index":197,"author":"SciFalded","name":"Arcann","release_year":2021}},"Jake Fenn":{"content":"# Introduction\nJake Fenn was a male Je’daii Temple Master serving the Je’daii Order on Tython during the Infinite Empire’s reign.

Xizor, known for his lavish tastes and money, was most well known for having a huge palace built in the middle of the bustling and expensive city of Coruscant. He was a master manipulator and ambitious schemer who was always looking to enhance his authority and influence across the galaxy.# Section 1\nXizor's ascension within the Black Sun began long before the Clone Wars. He was already a powerful member of the criminal organization when the war broke out, and he carefully waited out the galaxy-wide struggle. Once the conflicts ended and Palpatine imposed a new Order, Xizor rapidly became close to the newly-proclaimed Emperor.\n\nJust months after the declaration, Xizor was one of the top candidates to join the Black Sun as a Vigo. He faced considerable competition from Kaird, a Nediji assassin, for the position. They battled for underlord Dal Perhi's favor by performing missions for the organization and constructing traps to disrupt each other's objectives. Xizor's collaboration with Perhi successfully restructured the Black Sun and healed the faction in the aftermath of the Bota catastrophe. The competition heated up when Kaird set Xizor up to buy a stolen hypergem from a Metellos leader. Xizor, however, had set up Kaird to come up with the idea and when Xizor bought the hypergem, he took it to Underlord Perhi as a symbol of his loyalty and to turn Kaird in.\n\n# Section 2\nXizor was given one final job to complete for Perhi, believing he had all but secured the post of Vigo: find and rescue the droid 10-4TO. The robot was being pursued by both the Galactic Empire and a fledgling resistance movement known as the Whiplash, and Perhi desired control of it as a negotiating chip to ensure that the government did not interfere with his organization's criminal operations. Nevertheless, obtaining the droid was not Perhi's goal for the trip; rather, he was preparing Xizor for assassination by Kaird, who constituted less of a danger to the Underlord's control.\n\nAfter a brief confrontation with Jedi Knight Jax Pavan and his band of allies, who were seeking the droid, Xizor grabbed Kaird and went into the Manufacturing District with the help of 10-4TO. Xizor stated to Kaird that he intended to kill Underlord Perhi and replace him with a human replica droid to control Perhi and eventually ascend to the title of Underlord. He intended to brainwash the assassin into murdering Perhi, but his plans were thwarted when he discovered that his team of scientists had been slain by wild droids.\n\nThe Falleen were then escorted to the remainder of Jax Pavan's party, which had pursued Xizor halfway across Coruscant in pursuit of 10-4TO. Xizor was able to escape the Factory District with the help of the robot, but only after a violent battle with Kaird's faithful troops. Xizor and his squad then returned to his palace to continue planning his takeover of the Black Sun organization. Xizor's feud with Kaird, on the other hand, was far from done. Kaird managed to escape Xizor's clutches and seek vengeance. He hired bounty hunter Boba Fett to assassinate Xizor, but the Falleen outmaneuver Fett and capture him. Xizor then used Fett as leverage to pull Kaird into a trap, ultimately killing him.\n\n# Section 3\nXizor's win over Kaird solidified his status as the Black Sun's leader, but it also made him a target of the Galactic Empire. Palpatine considered Xizor as a possible adversary and his criminal empire as a danger to his  power. This culminated in a battle between Xizor and the Emperor, which ultimately led to Xizor's demise. Darth Vader contacted Xizor in 3 ABY and requested a meeting on Coruscant. Xizor saw the meeting as an opportunity to bargain with the Sith Lord and obtain the Emperor's favor. Vader, on the other hand, had other ideas.\n\nVader had uncovered Xizor's participation in the Black Sun's operations on Mustafar, as well as his romantic interest in Princess Leia Organa. Vader saw an opportunity to destroy a rival as well as a potential threat to his relationship with the Emperor, as well as capture the Rebel Alliance commanders with whom Xizor had been cooperating. Vader challenged Xizor to a lightsaber duel during the meeting. Xizor, although a master of unarmed fighting, was no match for Vader's mastery of the Force and the lightsaber, and he was quickly vanquished. Vader then took advantage of the situation to frame Xizor for an assassination attempt on the Emperor, and Xizor was later murdered by the Imperial fleet.\n\n# Section 4\nXizor's time in the galaxy was brief, but he made a lasting impression. Among the galaxy's people, Xizor is largely regarded as one of the most intriguing and complicated enemies. His cunning, charm, and ferocity have made him an unforgettable adversary. Xizor's power and influence are well-known as the leader of the legendary criminal organization Black Sun, and his activities have had a lasting impact on countless lives across the galaxy.

Anor was born around 6 ABY and was dispatched as an agent and a saboteur, to prepare for an extra-galactic invasion. Anor wasn't directly at the heat of the war, he worked behind the scenes and would scout battlefields prior to the battle, ensuring that nothing would disrupt Yuuzhan Vongs in battle and ultimately securing the battlefield for an easier victory. Anor even managed to manipulate the Imperial Ruling council which led to the council's dowfal. His manipulative tactics helped cause a lot of discord in the galaxy.# Section 1\nAround 25 ABY, Anor was ranked Executor and made connection with the Intendant caste's Praetorite Vong, as they aided Anor in being an initial force for the Invasion, Anor failed against the elite forces of the New Republic despite Anor's determination to succeed and his will to win. At the same time of his failed attempt, his destabilization work was starting to uproar a full scale war amongst the planets Osarian and Rhommamool. Anor would also go out of his way to help the Peace Brigade organization, a group critical of the New Empire's reaction to the Yuuzhan Vong invasion and would later go and help the Yuuzhan Vongs, but they would later switch sides and aid the warrior caste slightly. Anor wasn't too bothered about this as he had planned to assassinate members of the New Jedi Order with the help of another Yuuzhan Vong, but unfortunately for him their plan failed in the Bilbringi system. A year later Anor tried to make an alliance with the Hutt species and Yuuzhan Vong species, with this alliance Anor would hope that the species Hutt would be able to convince the New Republic that the next strike of the Yuuzhan Vong would be in Corellia instead in the shipyard in the Fondor System, the New Republic believed this and Anor was able to achieve a victory against the Republic due to a ambushed attack.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter the battle at Fondor, Anor would assist in the invasion of a heavily polluted planet called Duro, he later had plans to sabotage the defensive system in the Yag Dhul systems although his plans failed due to Jedi involvement. In the year 27ABY, Anor was sent alongside Vergere to stop a Jedi Strike team from killing off the queen of the Jedi-hunting voxyn on the world Jacen Solo. Anor failed to protect the queen as the Jedi team managed to assassinate the queen, alongside letting Solo escape from the Yuuzhan custody; this act belittled Anor's reputation in the eyes of his superiors.\n\n# Section 3\nDesperate to provide a victory for the Yuuzhan Vong's Anor was baited into following a trial consisting of false info made by New Republic operatives and was led by Warmaster Tsavong Lah into a massive battle in the Treskov system. Warmaster perished against the forces present there. Anor fled into the underworld of the system where the Warmaster would perish. Anor chose to lead the Shamed Ones, a group for the Yuuzhan Vong's hiding in the underworld of the system who believed in the Jeedai Heresy.

Despite his promotion to a perfect Anor would become disillusioned with Jamaane's rule as he once more took up the role of a Prophet to lead the heretics against the Supreme Overlord as the Jedi and Galactic Alliance made an attempt to retake Coruscant. Anor's legacy failed however when he was captured by the Jedi, while the Yuuzhan Vong would surrender after the death of Jamaane.

She served in many prominent positions such as being a political figure during the descent of the Galactic Republic, being one of the founders of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and has been the first Chief of State for the New Republic. She met with Senators Padme Amidala and Bail Organa when the Galactic Empire decided to replace the Republic. She signed the Correllian Treaty in 2 BBY alongside her fellow Jedi Masters. They did this to bring restoration to the Republic.# Section 1\nShe was born in 48 BBY into a wealthy family in Chandrila. Her mother was the reigning governor of the planet and her father was an arbiter-general for the Republic. When she turned nineteen, she was elected to represent the Bormea sector in the Galactic Senate, serving as the youngest senator; soon after, Leia Organa became the next youngest senator. Mothma was a major proponent of the rights of local systems. Right before the Clone Wars, she became a member of the Loyalist Committee alongside Organa, Amidala, and Senator Onaconda Farr. She started a movement to cease the production of clone troopers. In efforts to try and stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume. Farr was murdered after Amidala’s speech for the cause. Mothma then resumed working with the Senate while her associates investigated the recent crime. By the end of the Clone Wars, she served as a member of the Loyalist Committee and signed the Petition of 2000. This petition made a request that Chancellor Palpatine should reduce his power. The petition was presented to the Chancellor by The Delegation of 2000, but the Dark Lord made no promises.\n\n# Section 2\nIn 19 BBY, she attended the funeral for Senator Amidala on Naboo. She and the Queen of Naboo did not believe that Amidala was murdered during the Rebellion. For several months after the formation of the Galactic Empire, she urged Senator Organa to speak out against Emperor Palpatine alongside her. However, she renounced her claims after witnessing the Empire’s subjugation of Kashyyyk, in fear that her people might face the same fate.\n\n# Section 3\nMothma’s views brought her under investigation by ISB, COMPNOR, and even the Emperor himself. This prevented her from carrying out any more effective plans to undermine the Imperial rule. She continued to use her senatorial privilege and political contacts to try and strike up a change. She frequently met with the others on Coruscant and introduced ways to grant relief from Imperial policies. Over time, she tutored Bail’s daughter, Leia Organa, in political and diplomatic affairs, thus preparing her to succeed her father as the representative of Alderaan within the Imperial Senate.\n\n# Section 4\nPalpatine finally lost patience with Mothma’s opposition. She escaped arrest in 3 BBY with the help of Bail Organa, who had placed a guard with her while she went on to lead an underground Rebellion. She became the face of the Rebellion and signed proclamations such as the Declaration of Rebellion and A Call to Reason. A historic moment was over the horizon with the signing of the Corellian Treaty, which formalized relations between Corellia, Alderaan, and Chandrila resistance forces. Moments later, Darth Vader arrived with his stormtroopers, arresting Mothma and everyone else with her. Marek was Vader’s secret apprentice and led the Senators into Vader’s trap. The Rebellion seemed to be doomed before it even began. Vader attempted to kill Marek, but to his dismay, Marek escaped and later became a Jedi. He traveled to the Death Star construction site where he defeated Vader and held off Palpatine so Mothma and the Rebels could escape. The Rebel leaders met on Kashyyyk and later found the Marek family crest, which led Leia Organa to suggest honoring Marek by using it as a symbol for the Rebel Alliance.\n\n# Section 5\nIn the early days of the Rebellion, Mothma took on leadership roles for multiple missions, including the acquisition of the X-wing starfighter for the Alliance and locating the plans for the first Death Star. The Destruction of Alderaan brought with it the death of Bail Organa, which led to an imbalance within the Rebellion’s leadership. Without Organa present to make a rebuttal, Garm Bel Iblis claimed that Mon Mothma was assuming dictatorial powers over the Alliance. Using this to set herself up in the place of Palpatine. Iblis left the Rebellion, which formed a rift between its members that had a hard time healing until 9 ABY and the Thrawn campaign. Mothma was committed to democracy and made her position as Chief of State subject to a vote by the Alliance every two years. During her time in the Rebellion, she was never challenged.\n\n# Section 6\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, she oversaw the award ceremony for pilot Keyan Farlander. She presented him with the Star of Alderaan in recognition of his actions during the battle. Two months later, Mothma reflected on things with Leia Organa. Organa was tasked with a secret mission involving being a double agent and finding a new base for the Alliance. Not long after, Han Solo was assigned to meet one of Mothma’s acquaintances but said acquaintance ratted out Solo to Imperial Security and was killed in the process. Mothma met up with Organa to discuss the operation that she was given. Organa asked her for clearance codes so she could leak information. She also reported that there was an issue with Prithi, one of the pilots for Stealth Squadron. Mothma was present on the bridge of the flagship when the flight launched, preventing a Mon Calamari commander from allowing an unauthorized departure. \"The Commander asked if her orders were to the Rebellion and replied with \"Every breath I take is in rebellion to the Empire.\"\n\n# Section 7\nMothma briefed forces over the happenings of the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY.  She was uncomfortable with the plans and felt that the Alliance would be tarnished by killing others. However, she kept her demeanor and led the Rebel forces to victory on Endor, thus destroying the second Death Star and ending Palpatine’s reign. After the battle, the Alliance returned to a transitional government known as the Alliance of Free Planets. Mothma built diplomatic and military coalitions to fight what remained of the Empire.\n\n# Section 8\nAs the Alliance slowly transitioned into the New Republic, Mothma became the Chief of State within the New Republic. She led the Republic for eleven years, holding together the many factions that sat underneath its leadership. Mothma’s charisma and leadership proved essential as they wiped out foe after foe, time after time. The next major issue was the Krytos virus, a biological weapon that was left behind by the Imperials that affected non-humans. Researchers came to the conclusion that the bioweapon was only curable by large quantities of bacta. The fallout from this virus tested the newly formed government.\n\n# Section 9\nDuring the hunt for Warlord Zsinj, an aide attacked Malan then quickly headed towards Mothma. She quickly fled down the stairs and accidentally fell and hurt herself badly. Before Tolokai could harm her, Malan surprised him and tumbled down the stairs taking them both down. Mothma had always put the Republic before everything else. She even advocated for Leia Organa to accept Prince Isolder’s hand in marriage to strengthen the Republic. In 8 ABY, the wedding of Leia Organa and Han Solo took place. Shortly after, a painting containing a key for the Rebellion’s spy network resurfaced on Tatooine. She sent her most trusted to retrieve the painting.\n\n# Section 10\nShe supported Luke Skywalker while he strived to revive the Jedi Order. She arranged for him to be given the Rebel base on Yavin IV’s moon. In 12 ABY, she contacted Kyle Katarn and Jan Ors to investigate the remnants of an Imperial base on Kejim. They returned to her office and presented Mothma the Artusian crystal. She then sent them to Artus Prime to do a bit more investigating. Unlike her years in the Alliance, she did not stay hidden. During a diplomatic visit to Coruscant, she ran into Ambassador Furgan from Carida. When he threw what appeared to be a drink into her face as a send-off gesture, the drink turned out to be filled with nanomachines that slowly affected Mothma over time. She soon decided to resign from her position as Chief of State as her condition got worse. Then guiding the council to appoint Leia Organa to take her place.\n\n# Section 11\nMothma was nearly killed, but at the last minute, she was saved by Cilghal, who used the Force to cleanse her body. She was up and moving around within a few weeks, which Leia never thought she would see after she caught the virus. Leia soon tried to convince Mothma to become Chief of State again, but Mothma refused to take the position. Despite the help from the Jedi, her condition never fully recovered. In 17 ABY, she became the acting Chief of State while Leia Organa went to find her brother. In 18 ABY, Mothma asked Skywalker to help Lando Calrissian find a wife. She later suggested that Luke and Lando travel to Bakura to find Gariel Captison. In 19 ABY, she appeared at the signing of the Bastion Accords and was a guest of honor at Luke Skywalker’s wedding. Her condition continued to worsen, and shortly before the Yuuzhan Vong War, she died in her sleep.

These records consisted of the Infinite Empire, Tython, and the Force Wars. His discoveries proved vital to the Order within the following decades. As he continued down his journey as a historian, he forged his own green-bladed saber.\n\tGnost-Dural became a Jedi Knight four years after the beginning of his journal. During his Knighting ceremony, he swore to defend the Galactic Republic and uphold the Jedi Code. He swore to these things since he felt as though it was his duty to both the Order and the Force. Sadly, on the same day he became a Knight, news broke on Coruscant of a bloody assault. History remembers this as the first appearance of the resurgent Sith Empire. This was the first time they were seen since the Great Hyperspace War, nearly two millennia before this event. \n\tGnost-Dural later became a Jedi Master and overseer of the Jedi Archives. He was then tasked by the Jedi High Council to create a new timeline following the creation of the Treaty of Coruscant. During this time his research unearthed multiple factors about the war previously unknown to the Jedi. It then served as a basis for a new Jedi Library. In 3640 BBY, Gnost-Dural was sent to find and destroy the Ascendant Spear, with help of Theron Shan, an intelligence agent. The duo managed to sneak into the facility and Dural was able to buy Shan some time to sabotage the station. Dural was confronted by Darth Karrid, his former Padawan turned to the Dark Side Kana Terrid, and they dueled. Dural killed her apprentices, but Darth Karrid managed to capture Dural in the process. He was then interrogated by her, but Dural was able to trick Karrid into going to Duros. On Duros she fell in the ensuing battle.\n\tIn 3628 BBY it was discovered by the Sith Empire that Jedi Master Gnost-Dural was alive. Gnost-Dural was hiding in a secret Jedi Colony on Ossus, even though Gnost-Dural was long thought to be dead. Sith Emperor Vowrawn soon ordered an invasion of Ossus. Under the command of Darth Malora and Darth Malgus, this invasion began the Third Galactic War. After being discovered by the Imperial Army, Gnost-Dural, Doctor Kimble, and Nadia Grell began evacuating the planet. While evacuating they greatly accepted the assistance of the Commander of the Eternal Alliance. When Commander Arn Peralun and Aryn Leneer returned from the old Jedi Enclave on Dantooine, where they did an investigation on the location of Darth Malgus, Gnost-Dural had a meeting with those he considered most important to the Order. They discussed their next moves and how to begin rebuilding their numbers. Master Gnost-Dural chose certain to attend the meeting, as well as the Dantooine mission party. These Jedi included Sal-Deron, Tau Idair, and Vinyor Tesh.\n\n","meta":{"index":60,"author":"Shad0wSeer","name":"Gnost-Dural","release_year":2020}},"Arren Kae":{"content":"# Introduction\nArren Kae was a female Jedi Master of unknown species that has been known for her part in training the once Jedi and later Dark Lord of the Sith, Revan.

Members of D-Squad were R2-D2, QT-KT, U9-C4, M5-BZ, and WAC-47.# Section 1\nD-Squad was given a top-secret mission. Their goal was to abduct a decoding module from a vault inside a Separatist ship. While their landing on the ship did not go as planned because WAC-47 allowed the ship to be taken into a Separatist tractor beam, the droids were able to evade the Separatist security system as U9-C4 was able to cause a power outage. When they were trying to enter the vault, M5-BZ accidentally inserted into the power outlet which decommissioned the droid for a time. The droids were able to get to the module that they required. Unfortunately, the droid commander, Aut-O, engaged the republic droids with that his own. Luckily, the republic droids were able to escape the life-threatening situation.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter their escape, they repaired the droid, M5-BZ. The ship they piloted was damaged in hyperspace, so they were forced to land. The group landed on the planet of Abafar. Abafar was a rather barren planet with little life on it. The droids wandered aimlessly trying to find civilization while some of them were going insane. They got split up as a result of different opinions.  The squad was luckily able to reconvene at Pons Ora.\n\n# Section 3\nGascon and WAC-47 stopped by a mysterious restaurant to eat. Colonel Gascon noticed something off about the clone-like appearance of the dishwasher present. The rest of the D-Squad scouted the perimeter and found Separatist forces on the planet. The group needed to escape the planet, and Colonel Gaston desired Gregor to accompany them. Gascon presented evidence showing that Gregor was a clone, and he convinced him so. Gregor wanted to join them, so he resisted his tyrannical boss and accompanied the group. They would then go on to attack Separatist forces to board a transport ship. Gregor sacrificed himself so that the rest of them were able to escape. To their knowledge, he was deceased.\n\n# Section 4\nWith their transport ship, the group would board what they thought to be a Jedi ship. To their surprise, the ship was not filled with real republic personnel. There were tons of holograms as there were fake people on board the ship. It was being piloted and manned by Separatist droids. Once discovered, D-Squad rushed to warn the republic, but they had little success. They then attempted to board their transport ship to leave, and R2-D2 sacrificed himself while detonating the rhidonium bomb on the Separatist Venator.\n\n# Section 5\nThe space station and every ship around it shook as the detonation went off. After saving an important strategic meeting, Gascon called the space station. He informed Jedi Guardian Anakin Skywalker of the death of his astromech. Skywalker sent out a scavenging team to find the missing droid. Luckily, he was alive.

This man had sworn to take avenge on what happened to the Jedi Order, and he swore to do this by dethroning the Sith, who currently ran the Galactic Empire. Some times, Barr used the force he had to control his followers, and sometimes to assassinate people, such as the Imperial ambassador, also known as Mon Calamari.# Section 1\nFerren Barr originally began his training as a Padawan learner around the time of the end of the Galactic Republic. He duelled late Anakin Skywalker many times. He also participated in the Clone Wars, alongside the Grand Army of the Republic. He had many brothers and sisters, who were murdered by Clone Troopers on the Coruscant Temple and across the whole galaxy. When the Sith eventually returned to power and controlled the Galaxy, this led Barr to return into hiding.\n\n# Section 2\nBarr was set on finding out the ways the Sith regained control of the universe. He soon gained the knowledge of what Order 66 was, and the roles that Count Dooku and the clone army once played during the Jedi Order. Not only that, Barr found out  knowledge of what happened to Skywalker and how he helped with the destruction and murders on the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. He hacked into software within the Temple and witnessed with his own eyes the murders that were occurring at the time. He was disgusted also by the fact that other Jedi also fell to the dark side and became ‘Sith Inquisitors’. He kept his knowledge within a R1-series astromech droid, which he called ‘Endee’. Barr recruited acolytes to help him out; these acolytes hated the Empire and felt sincere to the Jedi Order. Barr mainly used the acolytes due to their immense force powers that they had.\n\n# Section 3\nBarr and his new followers journeyed to a planet named Mon Cala to serve as Jedi Advisors. They served as Jedi Advisors to King-Lee Char. During Barr’s and his followers’ time there, he pleaded to the people of Mon Cala to try to spread hope and openly decline the ways of the Galactic Empire. The Empire heard of this news, so they dispatched an Ambassador known as Telvar to Mon Cala to, try and de-escalate what Barr was doing. Barr sabotaged Telvar’s vehicle. Due to this assassination, the Empire had to invade the planet of Mon Cala, even though Lee Char declined any involvement with the people of Mon Cala and the assassination of the Sith Ambassador. Emperor Palpatine ordered Vader to track down the Jedi Advisors that belonged to King-Lee Char and kill them, along with the help of the Sith Inquisitors. \n\n\nBarr used the footage that he had located of Anakin Skywalker assassinating the Jedi on the planet of Coruscant; he used this to educate the acolytes on what the rise and the fall of Anakin Skywalker was. At first, the acolytes had an idea to avenge the Jedi Order and take down Darth Vader; however, Barr told them to calm down and not go that far due to it not being the proper Jedi way. He had a plan that would kill the Sith, avenge the Jedi and bring order back to the galaxy.\n\n# Section 4\nBarr was made aware by King-Lee Char that he had given Barr’s and his followers’ locations to the Inquisitors due to him going through very distressing torture. Barr and his followers evacuated the chamber where they were and began flying; they ended up being stopped by an Imperial Submarine, which held Vader and the Inquisitors inside of it. Two of the acolytes during the invasion of the ship were murdered. Two other acolytes decided to stay and try to hold off Vader and the Inquisitors, while Barr and the other remaining acolytes left and continued with the task that they had to complete, which was to escape Mon Cala. A squad of purge troopers and Inquisitors stopped Barr and his followers in the city. One of the acolytes was cut in half. Barr realised that the Purge troopers were the last generation of clones before they fully stopped creating clones, and notified the Purge Troopers that technically, the Inquisitors were still Jedi, and due to this, the Purge Troopers had to continue following Order 66 and went to kill the once Jedis, the Inquisitors. Barr and another acolyte used this as a distraction, and escaped more inside the city, while the Troopers and Inquisitors fought against each other.\n\n# Section 5\nBarr knew the remaining apprentice with him was strong with the Force, so he taught them the arts of the Jedi ways knowing that he would unfortunately not be able to complete the training. Due to this, he ordered the remaining acolyte, known as Verla, to go find Grandmaster Yoda, Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, or even Quinlan Vos. Now that Barr left his follower, he decided to go confront Vader. Vader located Barr as he swept through the city and began a duel together. Vader accused Barr of assassinating the Ambassador, which Barr fully agreed to. Now that Lee Char knew of what Barr did, he stopped his forces and surrendered to the Galactic Empire. Barr had originally had the intent to defeat Vader; however he was unsuccessful and was finally defeated and slain by the Dark Lord. He knew his actions and the knowledge he gained would finally lead to the destruction of the Sith.

His species, the Neti, were tree-like in appearance and nature. His body held the ability to shape and manipulate itself, which he used very rarely other than to maintain his humanoid appearance. He shared with his species an extremely long lifespan, as Bnar would demonstrate, living for thousands of years within the Order. Bnar would be born as a seedling on the Neti homeworld of Ryyk, however very quickly was orphaned and lost on the planet Myrkr. The rest of his youth was spent inhabiting this planet, until many years later the Jedi Order approached and recruited him after detecting his Force-sensitivity# Section 1\nAchievements within the Order:\nBnar would quickly navigate through his training, and eventually became a Jedi Master. During his time in the Order he dedicated his time and effort into expanding his own and the Order’s own knowledge, becoming a revered Jedi Scholar who famously would study about the Dark side of the Force. He did this by completely severing himself from the topic of his own studies, making him one of the very few Jedi who could study the Dark side of the Force without falling to the Dark side itself. His extensive knowledge of the Dark side of the Force would indirectly assist the Order in the elimination of practitioners of the Dark. \n\nThroughout his time in the Order he built a relationship with another long-lived individual - Jedi Knight Odan-Urr. Odan-Urr would participate in the Great Hyperspace War of 5000BBY, upon its conclusion he would return to Ossus and the Order, and built the Great Jedi Library. Bnar and Odan-Urr would often be seen interacting with one another in their studies, and often instructed Younglings together. Odan-Urr was anointed Head Library, and Bnar would assist and act as his understudy.\n\n# Section 2\nBnar was incessantly encouraged to construct his own holocron with the purpose of holding his knowledge of Jedi lore, as well as his discoveries from studying the Dark side of the Force. At 1,000 years he would eventually create the holocron, take precautions to ensure that its contents would only be seen by the Jedi. He installed a holographic mimicry inside of the Holocron to serve as its gatekeeper. The relic was passed down throughout the generations of the Jedi Order, ending up in the hands of and teaching several Jedi crucial information.\n\nBnar, at some point in his career, agreed to take a young woman named Shaela Nuur as his student and apprentice. Nuur would excel in her training, similarly to her master previously, and would impress Bnar with her ability to grow, learn and progress. Bnar found her extravagant and deserving, so upon her constructing her own Lightsaber, he gifted her his rare brown-coloured lightsaber crystal - known as Bnar’s Sacrifice. Nuur would eventually graduate from her training and begin her own journey within the Order, and Bnar would be left student-less for the remainder of his career.\n\n# Section 3\nOod Bnar’s Demise:\nBnar eventually met his demise in 10 ABY, before this however he had been involved in a hostile interaction with Exar Kun, rendering him immobile. He had used his tree-like abilities to shape his body to be significantly larger in order to protect a plethora of artifacts that Kun was aiming to retrieve. Ossus was also soon to be targeted by a shockwave that would have devastated the planet. Bnar would ultimately survive this tragedy, however the planet suffered significantly as radiation plagued the surface of Ossus and Bnar would enter a century-long hibernation on Ossus. The Jedi were unable to reconstruct their libraries and temples on the planet any longer. Even though the planet held more Jedi survivors, no one would find Bnar in his current state until 10 ABY.\n\n# Section 4\nAfter centuries of its existence, the holocron Bnar had constructed had found its way in the possession of Luke Skywalker, who was being directed to Ossus by the holocron.

Skywalker had unfortunately been followed by two members of Palpatine’s Dark Side Elite, and a vast number of Empire troops. Conflict would ensue, and the significant presence of Force-sensitivity - specifically from the Jedi - would awaken Bnar from his hibernation. Bnar would join the conflict, defending the Jedi and the Ysanna tribe members, however would be eliminated alongside the darksiders. The Jedi Master was unable to leave behind much more knowledge to the Jedi than the holocron, however upon his death he appeared to leave a small seedling behind in his place - Ood Bnar’s descendent.

Tiin rarely spoke and kept to himself as a student to the revered Jedi Master Omo Bouri. Despite never desiring to be a Padawan, Tiin rose through the ranks of the Grand Army of the Republic to become a Jedi General during the Clone Wars.# Section 1\nSaesee Tiin was born on the moon of Iktotch and was taught to fly when he was very young. He seemed to be a natural pilot. The little kid was turned up to the Jedi Order for instruction at the academy on Coruscant after scouts from the Order recognized him as a Force-sensitive. Tiin, who was raised in the Jedi Temple, found it humiliating when his innate telepathic powers were mocked by his peers. While some thought his skills offered him an unfair edge at the academy, Tiin saw them as a disadvantage because he had yet to learn to control them. Tiin would concede, however, that his powers offered him an advantage during lightsaber combat training because his opponents' thoughts unknowingly disclosed their strategy. Tiin was despised by his peers because of his unusual powers, and he became exceedingly reclusive. Tiin attracted the attention of Master Omo Bouri, the Wol Cabasshite Jedi Councilor, as he learnt to zero in on certain thoughts. Tiin accepted Bouri's offer of apprenticeship after graduating from the academy and became a Padawan. Master Bouri was a one-of-a-kind communicator, as he used phonemic energy pulses with syntactic contours in a magnetic field he controlled with his mouth. Because Bouri's brain had gone so far, Tiin was confronted with something entirely new: a brain he couldn't comprehend. Intrigued, he spent all of his time trying to figure out who his master was and how he could use the Force to boost his telepathy to new heights. Tiin learnt the notion of entire dedication to the Order from Bouri, who taught him how to control his own mind and filter through thoughts from all over the galaxy. Tiin became a full Jedi Knight after years of traveling with his teacher and passing the Trials of Knighthood. Tiin declined to speak at Master Bouri's funeral when he was lost on an ill-fated assignment, and he went into seclusion for a long time. Tiin chose the path of the Jedi Guardians, developing his talents as a Jedi Starfighter Corps ace pilot\n\n# Section 2\nDespite Jedi Mace Windu's encouragement, Saesee Tiin declined to accept a Padawan of his own, despite the value of his own teacher in his life. Instead, Tiin turned within, looking for methods to use the Force to communicate with his deceased Master. It's unclear whether Tiin actually did so, but he put a lot of effort into it during his time as a Knight. Saesee Tiin was eventually appointed to Master by the High Council after a remarkable career. The Council invited Tiin to join the Council as a long-term member after much discussion.\n\n# Section 3\nTiin remained a Jedi Master and an accomplished pilot for the Jedi Order. Many Jedi owe their lives to his ability to fly. Tiin took on the title of Jedi General within the ranks of the Grand Army of the Republic once the Clone Wars began. Tiin, who was heavily involved with the Order's starfighter fleet, praised Jedi Skywalker's work, saying that the fleet's continual updates were a vast advance over the initial models. Tiin was one of the first to get an Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor, encouraging the High Council to adopt the boy's changes across the entire Starfighter Corps. Tiin was pushed into a low-altitude ejection during an early fight while piloting his personal spaceship, the Sharp Spiral, and incurred multiple non-life threatening injuries, including the fracturing of one of his cranial horns. When the war reached Tiin's homeworld, Iktotch, Tiin rapidly recovered from his wounds and led Master Windu into battle. Tiin chose a brutal approach to beating the prototype B3 extreme battle droid over Windu's methodical attacks in routing the Separatist Droid Army that had taken root there. Despite their opposing tactics, the two Masters were able to work together and defeat the planet's CIS troops. At the conflict, Tiin took part in a number of notable missions, including directing a bombing run during the Battle of Gwori, an assignment over Diado, and the fights of Lola Sayu, Umbara, and Boz Pity.\n\n# Section 4\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Tiin's friendship with Master Windu grew stronger. Tiin and Windu were joined by Masters Kit Fisto and Agen Kolar on an undercover mission to infiltrate the Crimson Nova's base known as the Rig. The Council dispatched the squad to investigate the gang's participation in a recent spate of Jedi assassinations and the issue of bounties on other Jedi. Tiin boarded the Rig as a smuggler and joined Windu in the cantina as his colleagues wreaked havoc on the jail level. The dockhands transferred his cargo into the Rig's storage facilities without informing him, as he had expected; Tiin had foreseen this and had loaded the crates with detonite, causing it to detonate and cause even more confusion aboard the space station when the hangars were demolished. The four masters encountered the Crimson Nova's leader, Mika, in the station's command deck, where he was joined by his compatriots. The Masters enlisted the help of the bounty hunters who were guarding the Cathar woman since she refused to submit. Tiin and Kolar took the control room and uncovered the bounty hunter giving the Jedi rewards while Windu and Fisto headed after Mika. The Jedi followed their lead on Kh'aris Fenn to Ryloth, where they discovered the Twi'lek had been killed by Quinlan Vos. Tiin was disgusted by the incident, and he regretted his support for Vos, as it was clear that Vos had sunk into darkness.\n\n# Section 5\nMaster Tiin was a Jedi first and a General second while serving the Republic heroically. Being a member of the Jedi Order's High Council entailed a slew of duties, including listening to intelligence briefings and dictating Republic force movements. Master Tiin was tasked early in the conflict with preventing the transfer of the Rendili Dreadnaught fleet to the Confederacy. Tiin controlled the Republic fleet alongside Master Koon and Jedi Skywalker, as Koon spoke with fleet commander Jace Dallin aboard the Mersel Kebir. Master Tiin's orders were plain when Lieutenant Mellor Yago of Rendili's Independent Provisional Government detained Koon and Dallin as traitors: destroy the Rendili fleet if it refused to join the Republic's Army. The appearance of Master Kenobi and the rogue Jedi Quinlan Vos disrupted the strategy debate, while Skywalker proposed an option. Tiin summoned his lightsaber and commanded that Vos be imprisoned before boarding his starfighter. With the Separatist armada joining the battle, Tiin attacked the enemy fleet while his fellow Jedi launched an unconventional rescue effort that saw the Rendili fleet saved and Master Koon rescued. Tiin returned to his flagship after the Separatists were defeated to deal with Vos. Tiin sat on the Council of Reconciliation as they tried Master Vos for his crimes after deciding to take him to Coruscant. While Tiin postponed his judgment to Master Oppo Rancisis, the Council voted in Vos' favor, allowing him to stay in the Order.\n\n# Section 6\nAs the war progressed, more and more Jedi perished in the battle. Tiin attended the funerals of Masters Halsey, the six Jedi slain in the bombing of the Jedi Temple, and the mock funeral for Master Kenobi before he went on an undercover mission as a member of the High Council. During Ahsoka Tano's trial, Tiin pointed out that Tano had been found in possession of nano-droids that had been utilized in the attack, claiming that there was too much evidence against her in the bombing of the Temple.\n\n# Section 7\nTiin was stationed on Coruscant during the closing days of the war, when Chancellor Palpatine announced the relocation of the Coruscant Defense Fleet to the Outer Rim Territories. Tiin sat in calm observation of the events as his other Masters discussed the repercussions of the move with Senator Bail Organa. Days later, blasterfire exploded in the sky of Coruscant as the Separatists launched a surprise attack on the capital. Tiin piloted a squadron of ARC-170 starfighters into the orbital battle between the Republic's Open Circle Fleet and the Confederacy's navy, which was led by the feared droid General Grievous. He landed in the dying Star Destroyer and led its stranded Jet troopers to capture an enemy cruiser, the Prosperous, when a Providence-class carrier/destroyer crashed with the Impavid during a hyperspace departure. Tiin leapt out of the lower rear hanger with his clone troops, wearing a customized space suit, and landed on the assaulting Confederate cruiser. Tiin punched a hole in the ship's landing bay floor, allowing him and his forces to penetrate the ship's interior, eliminate the ship's minor personnel, and take control.\n\n# Section 8\nTiin returned to the Temple after the battle to help coordinate the rest of the war. However, it wasn't long before Master Kenobi reported Grievous' death on Utapau; this, together with Dooku's recent death, convinced the Council that Palpatine's reign had come to an end. Tiin traveled to the Chancellor's office with Masters Windu, Fisto, and Kolar in a bid to persuade Palpatine to renounce his emergency powers quietly. Jedi Skywalker contacted the Masters before they left the Temple and informed them that Palpatine was the mysterious Darth Sidious. The Masters went to the office to arrest Palpatine, knowing what they had to do. Fisto spoke briefly with Tiin before the Masters proceeded to the Chancellor's office, noting that he would feel much more at ease if Masters Kenobi, Plo Koon, and Yoda had been present. Tiin chastised Fisto for this, claiming that they were capable of subduing Palpatine and that they were sufficient for the job.\n\n# Section 10\nWindu informed Palpatine that he was being held under arrest when the Masters entered the office. The Sith Lord charged the Jedi of treason and ignited his own lightsaber moments after the Masters lit theirs. Palpatine stabbed Kolar before he could defend himself as he sprang at the four Jedi. Tiin spotted his opportunity when Kolar fell and attempted to strike Palpatine from behind, but was sliced in the waist when Palpatine turned to face him. Jedi Master Saesee Tiin's life came to an end at this point.\n\n","meta":{"index":91,"author":"DeBraammster","name":"Saesee Tiin","release_year":2021}},"Asajj Ventress":{"content":"# Introduction\nAsajj Ventress was a female Zabrak who was born on the planet of Dathomir. She was a part of the Nightsisters clan. There was a bounty hunter named Hal'Sted who stole Ventress from her biological mother and her clan mother who is named Talzin. The bounty hunter decided to raise Ventress on the planet of Rattatak. One day, her master was killed, so she went out looking for a new one and found one that was a Jedi Master in the Jedi Order, their name was Ky Narec. Narec was very impressed and was happy with the abilities that Ventress could possess. They both worked together marvelously and kept the Order and everything going well on Rattatak.# Section 1\nOne day, Narrec was murdered and Ventress was revengeful and hated that this occurred and greatly missed her once Jedi Master. All of this hate and anger brought and led her to the Dark Side. Within the next few years, she found Count Dooku and became his new Sith Apprentice and a helper in leading the Clone Army during the Clone Wars era. One day, Dooku tried to assassinate and kill Ventress to prove his allegiance and honor to his Sith Master, Darth Sidious.\n\n# Section 2\nVentress felt very betrayed and disgusted about what her former Sith Master Dooku tried to do, so she decided to return to her cult and her mother Talzin. She returned to Dathomir, and her mother Talzin, wanted to aid her in getting her revenge on her former Sith Master Dooku. She used Savage Opress as a puppet in her game to aid in destroying Count Dooku. Ventress’ mission sadly failed her mission since Opress broke out of her control and came too. Due to this, she returned to Dathomir.\n\n# Section 3\nDue to the fact Ventress tried to assassinate Dooku, he sent General Grievous to Dathomir to destroy it. It was the Nightsisters and  Asajj Ventress versus the Clone Army and General Grievous. Unexpectedly, the Nightsisters and Asajj lost and ended up needing to escape as General Grievous and his clone army fully destroyed their base and lots of the locations around them on Dathomir.\n\n# Section 4\nAsajj Ventress left Dathomir and decided to become a bounty hunter. She started this new life by first traveling to Tatooine. She decided to fully walk to Mos Eisley. In the cantina, there was a bounty hunter named Oked, and he decided to try his best to take advantage of Ventress, for which he failed so she killed them. There were more bounty hunters there named Bossk and Latts Razzi, they both realized they would not be able to complete their mission on their own so they decided to recruit Ventress to get help from her during the mission.\n\n# Section 5\nAsajj Ventress one day appeared on Coruscant still as a bounty hunter but disguised her voice in a mask she was wearing along with her two dual-bladed lightsabers. She was excited about hearing about Ahsoka Tano’s bounty that she, unfortunately, had after being set up by Bariss Offee. She had dropped the bounty after making a pact with Tano to help her clear her name. She was helping Tano escape without killing any of the clone troopers. A hooded unknown person knocked her out and took her lightsabers and that was all from there, she was impersonated by the hooded and unknown person.\n\n# Section 6\nAsajj Ventress was interrogated by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker after finding out that Tano’s trial would occur. She revealed to Skywalker that she was the one who was helping Ahsoka Tano and that the only other person that Ahsoka Tano had talked to was Barriss Offee, which made Ventress and Skywalker realize the situation that happened and what they were in.\n\n# Section 7\nAsajj Ventress months later received a new lightsaber from the Black Market and decided to continue working within the Bounty Hunter field. She came in contact with a Jedi Master who was named Quinlan Vos who wanted Ventress’ help in assassinating and killing Count Dooku. Ventress, during the mission, introduced Vos to the night’s culture and decided to help train him a bit. During the mission, Dooku kidnapped Vos and took him captive as a hostage. Due to this, Ventress hired a couple of bounty hunters, as well as Boba Fett. Vos decided to join the dark side and became Dooku’s Sith Apprentice to become very close to Sidious and Dooku. Ventress and Vos decided to continue to pursue Dooku and brought him to a Separatist base on the planet Christophis. Many Republic forces bombarded and went to the location of the Separatist base. Dooku forces lightning in Vou, however, Ventress becomes in love with Vou and jumps in front of him to stop him from being hurt. Ventress was dying and Vou was allowed back to the Jedi. Obi-Wan Kenobi buried Ventress on the planet of Dathomir where her body lay to rot for the rest of Dathomir’s lifespan.\n\n","meta":{"index":21,"author":"lazerfuls","name":"Asajj Ventress","release_year":2020}},"Mandalore the Lesser":{"content":"# Introduction\nMandalore the Lesser was a Human who lived and fought during the Cold War and Great Galactic War serving as the head of the warrior clans.

Imperials managed to rig his Gladiator matches which inherently granted him more power and infamy, eventually earning him the title of Mandalore.# Section 1\nUsing his new found position of power, he directed fellow Mandalorians towards the Hydian Way to block it for the Sith - as an act of passion and loyalty. Although it crippled Republic forces, the Hydian Way Blockade only lasted for a year after being destroyed by smugglers. This loss proved devastating for the Mandalorians.

Var Suthra’s projects had been infiltrated by the Sith Lord Tarnis, who having posed as a Republic scientist had stolen many of the schematics and given them to the Sith Empire.

The Jedi Consular found Nadia, a strong force-sensitive, who was treated like an outsider due to how rare it was for a Sarkhai to have the Force. Her father then knew how much raw power Nadia held comparing her to the Jedi. With his death, she was taken into the Order to be nurtured as a Jedi, upon her father's will.

She should be considered as a role model to all Jedi who read this article, whether you’re interested in her powerful connection to the Force or her heroic dedication to her people.\n\nShoaneb Culu was a female Miraluka, who closely resembled the human species but had a higher likelihood of being force sensitive and were essentially blind. She had embarked on a journey from Alpheridies, her homeworld, to find a Jedi willing to train her. This was unusual, as she was not sought out by the Jedi as it usually occurs. Culu’s goal was noble, she aimed to create a Jedi academy on Alpheridies so that her people did not have to travel so far if they wished to become Jedi.\n\nHer goal was completed when finding a Jedi Master named Vodo-Siosk Baas on Ossus. The Miraluka quickly completed her training and was so talented that she was chosen to act as reinforcements for Qel-Droma on Onderon.# Section 1\nFurthermore, her feats during the Naddist Revolt classified her as a worthy Jedi. She also learned to ride war beasts, a rare skill. Even more notably, the Jedi was part of the 10,000 Jedi strong assembly conducted on Deneba to address the growing concerns of the dark side. The Jedi fought bravely against the Krath during the Great Sith War and at this point in her journey had a very similar road to that of Anakin Skywalker.\n\nShe had mastered the S-100 Stinger-class starfighter and wasa brilliant pilot utilising these skills in many space conflicts. Her brethren called her Jedi-Three. Sadly, her demise came painfully as Kemplex IX against a Krath sorceress Aleema Keto who destroyed a star in the Cron Drift. The debris laid waste to Shoaneb Culu, Jedi Qrrrl Toq and Dace Diath.\n\n# Section 2\nDespite her parents frowning upon the Jedi Order, she embarked on her quest aiming to create a Jedi Praxeum on Alpheridies at some point. Her quest was noble, as the journey was truly far for any Miraluka making it a dangerous one by anyone's standards.\n\nBeing used to the safe confines of her homeworld, anything beyond it was completely new to her. The unknown was much harder to traverse over than she had anticipated and she struggled biologically due to her surroundings being solely made of the Force. She was blind, like most of her species and thus she used the vibrations given off by different objects to maneuver around. This became very difficult as the environments became more and more unfamiliar. It however, taught her to be able to sense her surroundings in seconds after having trained it for so long during a tiring journey.\n\n# Section 3\nShoaneb’s journey lasted a year ending at the great Library of Ossus which the Force had attracted her to. There she discovered Master Vodo-Siosk Baas who took some convincing before he agreed to take her on.\n\nShoaneb was steadfast, intelligent and curious allowing her to easily navigate the many Jedi texts and becoming a thorough academic. Unfortunately, she often rained hundreds of questions down on Vodo who misinterpreted this curiosity as a lust for power. This misunderstanding was cleared up when Culu expressed her noble desire for her homeworld to which Master Baas relieved, taught her all he knew.\n\nThis academic talent was coupled with hardship however, as despite being ahead of her peers academically, she fell behind when it came to Force technique. For months, her training stagnated and Culu began to fear that her dream was just that, a dream.\n\nThese concerns gave Culu depression but after a few private seminars with Master Baas she developed a better, more positive perception and understanding of the Force. She decided not to dwell on these careless concerns, and despite having trouble with constructing her lightsaber and other areas, Culu pushed on relentlessly.\n\n# Section 4\nShoaneb’s perseverance and calm allowed her to pursue more practice in her Force training eventually leading to the Freedon Nadd Uprising that she chose to participate in. Baas did not believe she was ready (Another similarity with Anakin Skywalker) Instead of becoming frustrated, she calmly stated that Baas was right in his concern but she did not seek glory, only that the Force had attracted her to this planet. Culu could not deny this feeling, as it had always been right. Baas, knowing he had misjudged his apprentice, allowed her to go.\n\nThe mission began with Culu joining the assembly of Qrrrl Toq, Dace Diath, Kith Karrk and Nomi Sunrider, an incredibly effective taskforce.\n\n# Section 5\nThe task force was sent to aid Qel-Droma, who had victoriously beaten Queen Amanoa and other sith spirits. Qel-Droma and his task force had however been ambushed by a new Sith cult called the Naddists during a burial ceremony. This left the task force in ruins, with Master Aca Jeth being subjected to torture, and the others including Qel-Droma scattered across the battlefield.\n\nCulu’s task force of (5) Jedi arrived in the city of Iziz, believing Qel-Droma to be there, but later discovering he was actually held captive in Oron Kira’s fortress. The (5) Jedi had to obliterate an army of Dark Side Adepts using Force shields and other techniques as they were heavily outnumbered. They successfully won, and defeated King Ommin allowing Qel-Droma and his comrades to be freed.\n\nThe Sith’s remains including the Queen and others were sealed on the moon of Dxun in an interring ceremony that would prevent their spirits from wreaking havoc. Culu had shown immense talent in dueling during the battles fought on this planet, and began speeding ahead of her peers in terms of the Force, and dueling ability. She was a prodigy.\n\n# Section 6\nJedi Knight Culu and her companions were given some rest before being sent into a devastating conflict. The Tetan Royals, who had learned Sith magic from King Ommin, named Aleema and Sata lKeto and orchestrated a coup in the Empress Teta system. Their power had begun spreading across that sector, and thus this “Krath Cult” posed a threat to the Republic. \n\nThe Republic, after being informed of the danger by Shoaneb Culu, released an armada of Jedi and Republic fleets to engage the Teta system. The battle was heroic and ferocious but the Tetan Royals created illusions that made their Krath forces use suicide bombing against the Republic fleet. The Republic alongside many Jedi were absolutely obliterated. Culu managed to survive the attack on Koros Major, but was among very few.\nThis devastating defeat allowed the Krath to continue to invade Republic space. Thus, in response, the 10,000 Jedi assembly was organised on Deneba. A momentous collection of Masters and Knights alike were informed by Qel-Droma of a plan to infiltrate the Krath and destroy the cult internally.\n\nShoaneb, accompanied by many oher Jedi, argued against this plan. Whilst this debate occurred, once again, the Krath ambushed the Jedi with a massive army of war droids. Although the Jedi won, it wasn’t without cost. Master Jeth had been killed and Qel-Droma used this death as justification to accept the infiltration plan.\n\n# Section 7\nQel-Droma was amongst the volunteers who executed the plan, and he became a Sith high rank very quickly. However, after having no contact with him for months, the famous Nomi Sunrider was sent to find him. She was unsuccessful, and thus Jedi leaders decided to forcefully take him back. They unleashed an army of warships, Jedi and starfighters upon the Krath on Cinnagar. Their assault was successful and Jedi-Three presented her uncanny flight abilities, destroying many anti-aircraft guns. Despite this victory, Qel-Droma, when found and confronted, refused to join back with the Jedi.\n\n# Section 8\nThe Jedi in this failure retreated back to Ossus to discuss their next move. While this occurred, newly proclaimed Sith Lord Qel-Droma led a devastating attack on the Republic capital in Coruscant. Culu and Dace Diath had to fight their once inspiring friend face-to-face. They managed to defeat the Krath, and Qel-Droma was ironically betrayed by his own SIth and abandoned to fight Nomi Sunrider, Master Baas, Culu and others. \n\nTheir immense combined power imprisoned Qel-Droma, but this was short-lived as his Sith Master Exar Kun recaptured him later. In this conflict, Master Vodo-Siosk Baas was also sadly killed.\n\nQel-Droma seeking revenge for the betrayal led an assault on Kemplex IX against Keto, the commanding Sith at the time. Keto was unaware this assault was intended for him, since he was part of the invading fleet. Qel-Droma knew the assault on Kemplex IX would make a supernova explode, hoping it would kill Keto.\n\nThe Jedi were made aware of this plot, and the surviving trio of the task force, Culu, Dace Diath, and Qrrrl Toq volunteered to respond to the distress signals.\n\n# Section 9\nThe Jedi forces were being eroded as the war dragged on. Exar Kun’s forces had caused immense casualties. During a gathering on Ossus, Master Thon expressed that the Kemplex IX distress signals were not to be dealt with since he believed it to be a luring tactic or something else altogether.\n\nThe Sith only needed Ossus, they had nothing in the Kemplex IX sector. However, the task force had already begun investigating the Kemplex IX armada led by Keto. Culu sensed a great disturbance and before she could react, Keto’s fleet fired on the Cron Cluster cores which activated a supernova that incinerated her, and her famous trio comrades instantly.\n\nA great, and powerful hero, ended in a horrible demise. She failed to achieve her hopes of creating a Jedi Academy on her homeworld but left a legacy of footprints too large to ever be filled by anyone else.\n\n# Section 10\nShoaneb Culu had prominent brown hair, fair skin and was a generally curious individual. She became very knowledgeable and focused intensely on her training across the board. She was kind, dedicated and loving towards the people of her homeworld.\n\nShe grew depressed as her training fell behind her peers, but eventually Culu overcame the weaknesses and learned to trust the Force. From the beginning, she knew Qel-Droma’s mission was a terrible idea, but it did not stop him.\n\nShoaneb Culu had no eyes, but relied exclusively on the Force. She rose through the Jedi ranks becoming a prodigy in dueling as a Jedi Knight. Her Force abilities were uncanny and all of these factors helped her in her battles on Onderon and the SIth War.\n\nCulu was gifted in aerial and space combat, specialising with the S-100 Stinger-Class making her formidable on Koros Major.\n\nOverall, she was a brilliant and talented woman who might’ve been one of the greatest Jedi who had ever lived had she not met an unfortunate demise so young.\n\n","meta":{"index":32,"author":"Souleth","name":"Shoaneb Culu","release_year":2020}},"Mandalore the Binder":{"content":"# Introduction\nMost of what was known about Mandalore the Binder has been lost to history.

He led a movement in defiance of the Jedi Council’s wishes. Changing his name to Revan. Revan had picked up a fallen mandalorians mask and took it as his own, and promised to not take it off until the mandalorians were defeated. Now, Revan joining the Republic’s military, he was appointed as supreme commander.# Section 1\nNow that Revan had defeated the Mandalorian leader, Mandalore the Ultimate at the battle of malachor 5 at 3960 BBY, Revan and his also former Jedi friend, Alek, now known as Malak followed the trail of a mysterious Sith Influence on the mandalorian wars to the unknown regions. There the two had discovered a reconstituted Sith Empire. The two would turn to the dark side of the force by the Sith Emperor Vitiate. They were sent back to the republic as advanced imperial agents. The two new dark lords of the Sith, Darth Revan and Darth Malak broke from the Emperor's control. They both established their own Sith Empire using the Star Forge. The star forge was a ginormous automated shipyard that would create the most powerful army of all time.\n\n# Section 2\nThe two would use the darkside of the force along with the power of the star forge to create ships, droids, and weapons. This now led to the Jedi Civil war. Revan, now betrayed by Malak, was captured by the Jedi Knight Bastila Shan. She would form force bonds with Revan, wiping his mind. Revan, now his mind wiped, was now given the identity of a Republic Soldier by the Jedi Council. Revan was now stationed aboard a republic warship. Revan who recently helped rescue Shan, was taken to the Jedi Enclave and trained as a Jedi Padawan. Revan had been sent on a mission to locate the star maps. These artifacts would lead the way to the star forge. There were five star maps each located on different planets throughout the galaxy. Unfortunately on one of their missions, Revan and his crew were captured by none other than Malak. Revan’s true identity as the dark lord of the Sith was exposed. The crew escaped, yet unfortunately Bastila Shan was captured and turned to the dark side.\n\n# Section 3\nRevan and his crew eventually found all the star maps, and entered the star forge without Shan. They were forced to fight droids and dark side users. During this a fight broke out outside of the forge between the Republic and Sith Empire. While the fight was going on Revan found Bastila and turned her back to the lightside and soon after defeated Darth Malak. A bit of time after, Revan married Bastila but unfortunately his memories forced him to leave his wife and unborn child. He left them to search for answers in the unknown regions. He was then captured by the sith, and imprisoned for three years until a former lieutenant of his rescued him. Trying to kill the emperor after their escape, the lieutenant was killed and he was imprisoned for three hundred years.\n\n# Section 4\nLater on, the republic forces would work to help him escape from the emperor. Revan later took control over the foundry and attempted to construct a new army of droids to defeat the empire. Unfortunately he died as he was killed by an imperial strike team. Although as much as he tried to become one with the force, the amount of torture he experienced with the emperor forced him to embrace the dark side and become Revan Reborn. Revan taking control of the order of revan tried to make an end to the empire and kill the emperor once and for all, but the Jedi Order along with the Empire joined forces to stop him. After this Revan was able to finally die truly becoming one with the force.\n\n","meta":{"index":17,"author":"AxisMorningstar","name":"Revan","release_year":2020}},"Janice Nall":{"content":"# Introduction\nJanice Nall was the proprietor of Droids by Janice, a droid shop and workshop located on Taris prior to the planet’s near destruction following Darth Malak’s orbital fleet bombardment.

He was always drawn to the Force and had a strong sense of justice, which led him to become a leader in the local resistance movement against the Empire. His son Kyle was unaware of his actions, as he had left Sulon for Imperial training.\n\n# Section 2\nTo protect the Sulonese who protested against the Empire, Morgan arranged for their exodus to the forgotten planet of Ruusan. During this expedition, he discovered a powerful Force nexus known as the Valley of the Jedi. He went on to share this discovery with Jedi Master Qu Rahn, as he felt the knowledge of the Valley would be better suited in a Jedi’s hands. This revelation had a profound impact on Kyle’s path to becoming a Jedi Knight in the future.\n\nAfter returning to Sulon, Morgan played a key role in organizing the local resistance during the early stages of the Galactic Civil War. He was a leader in the fight against the Empire's subjugation of the planet. Morgan organized the local resistance on Sulon during the early stages of the Galactic Civil War and used his knowledge of Sulon’s resources to organize a successful resistance, which slowed down Imperial progress and protected the population.

The force-sensitive male had dark blond hair and blue eyes and a light skin tone. He was born on the planet of Lavisar, known for its rocky terrain which was ideal for mining. Cin Drallig was trained by Jedi Master Yoda which later on awarded Cin Drallig the title of best Jedi Swordmaster of his time. Cin Drallig would eventually die and become one with the Force at the hands of Darth Vader in 19 BBY during Operation: Knightfall when Order 66, an order branding member of the Jedi Order as rebels of the republic who were to be killed on site, was given.\n\nSection 2: Personality and Traits\n\nCin Drallig displayed a tremendous calmness of mind and spirit. He was characterized as patient, focused, directed, and delineated the members of the Jedi Order in their most refined form. He was a man who had given himself completely to the ways of the Force. In spite of his reputation as a great warrior, he also had a great heart. His humbleness of character led him to dedicate his life to training countless students in the art of the lightsaber. He led by example and instilled a sense of the Order’s truths and values. Where numerous masters failed, Drallig was insightful enough to see the potential of his revolting Padawan Serra Keto and led her to make her potential her reality.\n\nOn his Great Holocron recording, Cin Drallig revealed some of his personal views on the subject of lightsaber combat. Even though Darth Maul and Aurra Sing used Form II, Drallig refused to dismiss the form from his teachings, even though other instructors regarded it as impractical. He was very cautious with Form V, remaining neutral, and made sure whenever it was taught, the learner would know to only use it when truly trying to preserve peace within the Order. He admitted Form VI being the primary form of the Jedi Order didn’t make it worthy to be the most taught; however, did call it most pragmatic. Master Cin Drallig discouraged the teaching of cho mok, cutting off the opponent’s limb unless the student knew enough of the person’s physiology, so they didn’t mistakenly slaughter. Nevertheless, Cin Drallig didn’t leave out that a Jedi should not hesitate in using any form to kill a Sith Lord, and wouldn’t even be frowned upon from using sai tok, a technique to cut the opponent in half. He went further on to say, a Jedi’s intention shouldn’t be to bring desolation to the Sith, but to conquer the danger the Sith would produce.\n\nSection 3: Powers and Abilities\n\nCin Drallig’s lightsaber abilities were taught by none other than Master Yoda himself. Known for his outstanding talents at dueling, Drallig became a phenomenal swordsman, and gained the rank Battlemaster of the Order, due to his unprecedented finesse in lightsaber combat.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Master Cin Drallig was late in age; however, this did not stop him from being one of the top Jedi swordsmen, others describing his skill level as “unparalleled.” Cin Drallig’s skill was so great that even General Grievous’s programmed lightsabers would be no match for the Battlemaster.  Drallig had created his own unique style of lightsaber combat. His style consisted of summoning the Force to amplify his speed and relying on irregular and unforeseeable maneuvers.\n\n Cin Drallig mastered all seven lightsaber forms of combat and his great knowledge of each form was so unprecedented he was considered the most copious lightsaber instructor in the Jedi Temple, second to only Master Yoda himself. He trained thousands of successful students in each of the forms while displaying an exemplary understanding of each concept and was able to make thorough observations on each form’s strengths and weaknesses.  Cin Drallig was one of few to master the form Juyo; however, he rarely put it into practice due to its aggressiveness and its user’s potential exposure to the Dark Side. When Anakin Skywalker was a Padawan,  Cin Drallig never let him study Form VII even though Anakin lamented not studying it.\n\nAs the Jedi Temple’s strongest swordsman during Order 66, Cin Drallig was still able to kill an abundance of Clones that attacked him and the Sith Lord Darth Vader made it a mission himself to personally battle him. Cin Drallig fought exceptionally well, almost defeating the Sith Lord. Darth Vader the juvenile and fully primed Sith Lord had immense difficulty killing him than he did with the other Jedi during his clearance of the Jedi Temple. When Darth Vader killed Cin Drallig he had snuffed the Jedi Temple’s final hope.\n\nOn top of his mastery of swordsmanship, Cin Drallig was also very powerful and successful in his use of the Force. During his fight with Sith Lord Darth Vader, he displayed mastery with his use of the Force. He was very skilled in using Force speed, making him very capable of moving quickly enough to barely be visible to the human eye, overwhelming his opponents. He also was proficient in using the protection bubble, using it against Darth Vader to protect his Padawan while the Padawan would fight, and at times protect his pupil. With the protection bubble, he even was able to use it as an offensive tactic, encasing Vader within the protection bubble and inflicting damage to him with Force energy. The protection bubble was so powerful, Darth Vader wasn’t able to puncture the shield and had to wait until the bubble disappeared to continue fighting. He was also able to heal himself with the Force. He used this to restore his Padawan’s stamina while he encased them in the protection bubble and to himself while dueling Darth Vader. Cin Drallig also exhibited telekinetic proficiency, where he repelled a Force Push from his opponent, Sith Lord Darth Vader, and threw him through a window with a single Force Push. He also would hover and fling chunks of the ground onto Darth Vader.\n\nCin Drallig was also a very competent leader who was able to lead the security force of the Jedi Temple throughout the Clone Wars. Cin Drallig’s leadership abilities were displayed by how he led the surviving Jedi when Operation: Knightfall started to battle the Clones, even though he was eventually subdued.\n\nSection 4: Origins and Advancements\n\nIn Cin Drallig’s early years, he was trained as a Padawan by Jedi High Council member Grand Master Yoda. Cin Drallig was eventually named the Jedi Order’s greatest swordsman. During the Clone Wars, Cin Drallig ascended to the rank of Jedi Master and commanded the Jedi Temple Guard. During his time as a master, Cin Drallig taught younglings lightsaber combat in order to pass his skills onto the new generations of Jedi, such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. In the year 31 BBY, a clip of one of Master Drallig’s classes on the seven lightsaber combat forms was recorded on the Great Holocron.\n\nLater on, Cin Drallig was introduced to his controversial and demanding Padawan Serra Keto. Serra had almost gotten expelled from the Order more than once, due to her non-compliant ways, and all of her Jedi Masters were infuriated. Cin Drallig took Serra to help her find her balance; he furthered her understanding of the Force and lightsaber skills. His tutelage inspired them to have a very powerful bond of loyalty for each other. Even though her disobedience never truly disappeared, Cin Drallig helped her become a better person, causing her to become Cin Drallig’s most accomplished apprentice.\n\nNo sooner than 31 BBY, Cin Drallig was promoted from Jedi Master to Battlemaster, which made him the lead lightsaber combat instructor within the Jedi Temple. Cin Drallig was tasked with overseeing all of the academy’s instruction and electing new instructors. There was only one Battlemaster appointed at a time, with the exception of the Order’s satellite academies which received a corresponding head instructor, but head instructors were also appointed by the Battlemaster of the Jedi Order on the planet Coruscant.\n\nSection 5: Clone Wars\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, a galaxy-spanning event, Cin Drallig was in charge of guarding the Jedi Temple. As head of security, Cin Drallig spent most of his days patrolling the Jedi Temple’s corridors and pathways. This position also made him responsible for the Jedi Temple Guard and their administration. As the Clone Wars progressed, Cin Drallig was deeply concerned with the progressive antagonism towards the Jedi from Republic citizens.\n\nDeployed in Coruscant, Drallig made a home for himself inside the Jedi Temple. Even though he laboriously watched the Jedi Temple, some security breakthroughs still occurred. For instance, Bounty Hunter Cad Bane was able to stealthily steal a Jedi Holocron from a restricted vault and escape.\n\nIn 20 BBY, a couple of years after the war started, the Jedi Temple hangar was the location of an unexpected terrorist bombing, costing numerous lives. A plethora of protestors, which were all family and friends of the victims, gathered at the stairs to the Temple to disapprove of the Jedi’s involvement in the war. Circumscribed by two Jedi Temple Guards,  Cin Drallig stood before the crowd while Anakin Skywalker revealed a hologram of a suspect, Jackar Bowmani. While Skywalker revealed the Holocron, Bowmani’s wife Letta Turmond witnessed the Holocron; meanwhile, Cin Drallig was astounded by young Skywalker’s determination in solving the case but was more alarmed about how vulnerable the Jedi Order had become, and how the image of the Jedi’s bounteous protection had become much too weak. It was later discovered that Bowmani’s wife was responsible for the terrorist bombing, a woman who fed nano-droids to her husband in order to stage the bombing of the Temple hanger.\n\nEven though Cin Drallig was head of security, he still found time to teach lightsaber combat. The Clone Wars also placed an urgency on Youngling’s combat training, a higher priority than other skills. In 19 BBY, after the death of Jedi Mierme Unill, his padawan Zett Jukassa was handed to Cin Drallig while he awaited reassignment. Under Drallig’s tutelage, the young Padawan swiftly became a capable swordsman at the age of ten.\n\nSection 6: Order 66\n\nIn 19 BBY, when Order 66 was initiated, and Anakin Skywalker had now turned into his alter ego Darth Vader, Cin Drallig’s abilities pinpointed him as an essential target for elimination by the Sith Lord himself. Even though Jedi Masters Shaak Ti and Jurrok administered the Jedi Temple’s fortification that night, Cin Drallig still played a major role. While Cin Drallig was in the process of giving lightsaber lessons to Padawans Bene and Whie Malreaux, Darth Vader began his barbarous rampage. Cin Drallig was deep within the Jedi Temple, and prepared for Vader’s coming, and directed Jedi Olana Chion in the Temple’s defense.\n\nAlongside Serra Keto, Cin Drallig engaged the clones and was initially triumphant as he managed to pierce the occupying forces’ upper-level defenses. When Vader realized Cin Drallig was succeeding, Vader began to hunt for his former teacher. Entering Drallig’s zone, he found deceased clones and signs of battle everywhere. Before Cin Drallig could react, Serra Keto tried to take on Vader by herself but was slain.\n\nAs Drallig entered the room, he witnessed his former Padawan fall to Darth Vader. Engaging the Sith Lord in the Temple training hall with his two students, Bene and Whie Malreaux, who were unfit to defeat the Sith Lord. Vader was able to out-battle both Padawans, choking Bene with one hand and fighting Drallig with the other.\n\nCin Drallig, Jedi Battlemaster himself, was proved unfit to defeat fully primed Sith Lord Darth Vader. Shortly after the death of the two Padawans, Cin Drallig went into a short one-on-one exchange with Vader until he was cut down from head to toe. All Cin Drallig was able to do was look in shock as he fell to the ground and, not long after, expired. The encounter was recorded by Jedi Temple security camera TR4-121.\n\nLater on, Cin Drallig’s body was found by Grand Master Yoda and Master Obi-Wan Kenobi who returned to the Jedi Temple to resound the emergency beacon and warn all Jedi to flee into exile. The uncovering of Cin Drallig’s body caused Kenobi great heartache, considering the Battlemaster a great friend. Shortly after, the surviving Jedi watched the security camera recording of the legendary Battlemaster’s final duel.\n\nWith most of the Order almost being destroyed in one night, the newly-founded Galactic Empire needed to conceal the truths for the execution of the Republic’s peacekeepers. Under the ruling of Emperor Palpatine, Sate Pestage, right-hand man to Palpatine, assembled official reasons for each Jedi’s death. Within incident report #890-I, filed by Commander CC-1119, was Master Cin Drallig’s death certificate, while Pestage claimed to the public that the Battlemaster had been “killed in combat against Imperial agents.”\n\nSection 7: Legacy\n\nCin Drallig’s legacy was handed down by Jedi who survived to train others, which included Master Kenobi’s training of Luke Skywalker.\n\nWhile learning how to cope with his life-sustaining armor, Vader would often reflect on the moments that brought him to become a Sith. One of the clearest memories were Master Cin Drallig, his prior lightsaber instructor, and his final encounter with the Battlemaster, the night of Order 66.\n\nMaster Cin Drallig’s recorded training of the seven forms, recorded in 31 BBY, was uncovered in the Great Holocron by the New Jedi Order, along with other recordings of the Battlemaster.","meta":{"index":108,"author":"Misscripto","name":"Cin Drallig","release_year":2021}},"Anakin Solo":{"content":"# Introduction\nAnakin Solo was a Human Jedi Knight from the New Jedi Order who was born to Leia Organa Solo and Han Solo in 10 BBY, on the planet of Nespis VIII. He was born a year and half after his siblings who were twins, Jacen and Jaina. He was named after his grandfather, Anakin Skywalker, who was also known as Darth Vader. At first, Anakin was about to be named Han Solo Jr. after his father, however his mother, Leia made the decision to name him after her father, Anakin Skywalker. She made this decision since she wanted to justify her father’s name, and she also thought it would help her overcome her unease of Darth Vader by looking at her   son, to look at what her father could’ve been.# Section 1\nAs a youngster, Anakin was afraid of falling into the dark side and becoming a Sith himself. He was born during a time of great unreliability. The New Republic was overlooked with the revitalization of Imperial factions under control of the reborn Lord of the Sith and Galactic Emperor Palpatine. One day, Palpatine touched Anakin while he was in the womb of Leia. The Emperor also tried to control the body of the fetal child, making an effort to encourage his spirit into a more powerful guise. However, Han Solo shot the Emperor and killed him before he could complete his mission. Even though this occurred, the dark spirit of the Emperor went towards Anakin. However, the Jedi Knight known as Empatojayos Brand protected him and sacrificed his life so Anakin could continue his own life.\n\n# Section 2\nIn the first years of his life, Anakin lived on the isolated planet Anoth which his uncle, Luke Skywalker, and the flag officer of the New Republic, Gial Ackbar, had reinforced to protect the Solo children. In the planet of Anoth, as his parents were busy, Anakin was taken care of by nanny droids and his mother’s close friend, Winter Celchu. His parents were allowed to visit every few months. At the start, his siblings,  Jaina and Jacen, stayed with him on the planet Anoth. However, once they reached two years old, they went to live with their parents on Coruscant. Later on, in 11ABY, an Imperial strike team led by the ambassador of the planet Carida, Furgan invaded the planet Anoth and tried to kidnap Anakin. Winter managed to kill nearly most of the invaders by unlocking the base’s defenses, attacking the Imperial forces on her own. Soon, Leia and Gial Ackbar, who'd been notified of Furgan’s plans, came and managed to rescue Anakin from the Ambassador’s attacks. After the kidnapping attempt, he went to live with his parents and siblings on Coruscant.\n\n# Section 3\nSince now the Solo children are staying on Coruscant and since the children’s parents are busy, Leia became overburdened in trying to stick to both her motherly and political duties, thus resulting in her deciding to enlist the droid C-3PO, a protocol droid, to care for them. C-3PO helped in taking care of the twins and Anakin, and proved to be very useful as it met the elements of a parent, whereas it uploaded information concerning the process of bringing up a child and met the challenge of commencing enthusiasm. As Chewbacca was a very close friend of Han, he also helped C-3PO raise the Solo children after he returned from Kessel along with Han.\n\n# Section 4\nA few years went by in 14 ABY. During the Empire Reborn movement, Anakin and the twins were kidnapped by Lord Hethrir who was the Imperial Procurator of Justice. He wanted to take the upper hand of their Force powers. During Anakin’s imprisonment, he became fond of Tigris who was his nursemaid and  also Lord Hethrir’s son. Hethrir gave the now Force-Strong Anakin to a being named Waru in trade for Waru’s aid. In time, Anakin’s parents along with Luke Skywalker, managed to rescue the children.\n\n# Section 5\nWhen he turned the age of eleven, he took part in the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 where he became quick friends with Tahiri Veila. Along with her, they went on many exciting adventures, including the release of the imprisoned Massassi children. Anakin was one of the most crucial figures in the Yuuzhan Vong War, where he participated in various major battles and evolved useful tactics opposed to the Yuuzhan Vong. In consequence of his mission to save Tahiri and to assist Vua Rapuung forcing Mezhan Kwaad to speak the honest truth, the Jeedai heresy - a dissident movement which helped end the Yuuzhan Vong War - rapidly expanded among the Shamed Ones. Later on, Anakin led the Myrkr strike team to conclude the lash of the non-sentient, Jedi-killing Voxyn, where then he sacrificed his life to end the menaces in 27 ABY.\n\n","meta":{"index":124,"author":"vJesko","name":"Anakin Solo","release_year":2021}},"Jewl'a Nightbringer":{"content":"# Introduction\nJewl’a Nightbringer was a female Zabrak and bounty hunter born during the Great Galactic War with her prime during the succeeding Cold War.

Jew’la Nightbringer was born in the underworld of Coruscant and lived a life of poverty and violence with constant riots and looting due to the Mandalorian blockade of the Hydian Way. To survive she was required to depend on her ruthless and natural born fighting nature. She spent years developing and tuning her skills as a ruthless hunter on Coruscant, and when she had saved enough credits to get off world, stretched her hunts off of the Republic capital world causing her reputation to spread.

Dyas was the Jedi who originally paid the Kaminoans with the request for an army of Clones to be made for the Galactic Republic. \n\n Dyas was formerly a Jedi High Council member, until he informed the Council of his premonitions that a strong and dangerous enemy was rising and that for the Republic to overcome and win the imminent war, they would need to commission an army to assist the Jedi in their efforts to maintain peace in the Galaxy.\nDyas’ foresight was dismissed by the Council, and the idea of commissioning an army and breaking the peace in the Galaxy led to his dismissal from the High Council.# Section 1\nDespite this setback, he continued his plan unbeknownst to the Jedi. He went to the planet of Kamino, getting into contact with the Kaminoans. Upon meeting the scientists, he presented himself as a messenger on behalf of the Jedi Council and Galactic Senate and informed the cloners that the Republic was in need of an Army of Clones. \nHowever, Sifo-Dyas’ dream would soon be completely hijacked by the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious and his apprentice Darth Tyranus.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Jedi Master was soon shot down in his shuttle, on the planet of Oba Diah, and did not survive the crash. Due to the death of the Jedi, the two Sith Lord’s went to Kamino themselves in an attempt to take over the project that was started by Sifo-Dyas. \nIt was from Darth Sidious and Darth Tyranus that the large amount of funding to start off the Clone Army came, and it was also them who hired the Mandalorian Bounty Hunter Jango Fett to become the Clone template. An inhibitor chip placed into the Clone’s mind (originally an idea of Dyas to prevent them being controlled by Jedi or Sith) was altered to make the Clones fiercely loyal to Darth Sidious. This inhibitor chip is also what led to the massacre known as the Jedi Purge, or Order 66.\n\n# Section 3\nHad Dyas survived the crosshairs of the Sith, it is very likely that the Jedi Purge would never have happened like it did. The Sith were not great enough in numbers to take on the ever-growing Jedi Order and so it was the production of the Clone Army that led to the unfortunate rise of the First Galactic Empire.\n\n","meta":{"index":26,"author":"Immodyas","name":"Sifo-Dyas","release_year":2021}},"Satele Shan":{"content":"# Introduction\nSatele Shan was a Force-sensitive human female born on the planet Brentaal IV in 3,699BBY.

Ajunta Pall’s story is one of great controversy and tells a tale of perhaps the worst mistake the Jedi Order ever made, which resulted in the indirect creation of the Sith Order and subsequently began a series of conflicts still ongoing to this day in galactic history.# Section 1\nAjunta Pall began as all young Jedi do, starting his life in the Jedi Academy, eventually being dubbed a Jedi Knight and later rising to the rank of Jedi Master. Ajunta Pall was not a particularly exceptional Jedi but would have an expressed interest in studying alchemy. He, along with numerous fellow Jedi, would dedicate their time to the studying of alchemy and conducted many experiments in an effort to progress their knowledge of the Force. Unfortunately for Master Pall, he would come upon the ability to create life, something deemed unnatural by the Jedi Order. Ajunta Pall had no malicious intent when discovering this but the Jedi Council saw it as too great a risk and decided to ban Ajunta Pall and his followers from furthering their studies under threat of expulsion from the Jedi Order. Outraged by the lack of trust placed in them and what was essentially an insult to Ajunta Pall and his followers, the Jedi Master took the exaggerated action of declaring war on the Jedi Order with his followers. This began a conflict known as the ‘’Hundred-Year Darkness’’. Ajunta Pall and his followers would use their knowledge of creating life and infuse it with the dark side of the Force to create an army of creatures and followers capable enough of attacking the Jedi Order and the Republic.\n\n# Section 2\nFortunately for the Jedi Order, they were able to beat back Ajunta Pall’s army, capturing the ex-Jedi Master and his followers and exiling them to the far reaches of the Outer Rim. While travelling the Outer Rim in search of a world suitable enough to live on, the Dark Jedi discovered Korriban, the ancient homeworld of the Sith species. While scouting the world of Korriban the Dark Jedi would discover the Sith species, while not a particularly intelligent species they had developed methods of employing the dark side of the Force that Ajunta Pall and the Jedi Order had not previously known about. Ajunta Pall and his Dark Jedi followers were quick to become the authority on the world, utilizing their mastery of the Force and alchemy, the Sith and their Kissai Priests believed the Dark Jedi to be the embodiment of their many Gods and began to worship Ajunta Pall and his followers, labelling Ajunta Pall specifically as a Dark Lord, cementing him as the first Dark Lord of the Sith. Ajunta Pall would establish the first Sith Empire and conquer the neighbouring worlds of Korriban.\n\n# Section 3\nAjunta Pall and his followers would establish many of the traditions of the Sith that would exist for thousands of years, including the authoring of the Sith code, the creation of the Sith tradition known as the Kaggath and the Sith Academy, which would see particularly Force-sensitive individuals adopted into the newly found Sith Order to train them as fully-fledged Sith, in a somewhat similar manner to the Jedi Academy. It was known that Ajunta Pall fought other Sith Lords during his reign and his Sith Empire was no stranger to civil war and infighting. Sith Lords at the time sought to gain the knowledge and power of each other and the tradition of political deception and infighting can be credited to Ajunta Pall’s Sith Empire. The death of Ajunta Pall would take place but how or when is unknown. It is theorised that Ajunta Pall was killed by a rival Sith Lord, as it is known Ajunta Pall’s Sith Empire would fall to infighting and betrayal. He would be buried on Korriban within a personalised tomb, it would be the first tomb within the Valley of the Dark Lords, a place in which many notable Sith would be buried in later years.\n\n# Section 4\nThe legacy of Ajunta Pall and the mistakes of the Jedi Order would never be lost to the galaxy. Ajunta Pall’s spirit would live on for another few millennia within his tomb and during his time as a spirit he would grow to be regretful of his actions and the creation of the Sith Empire. In hindsight he knew he was wrong and sought redemption, redemption that was eventually granted when Revan laid his spirit to eternal rest. Ajunta Pall’s teachings and the teachings of his followers would sow the foundations of the Sith Order for thousands of years, particularly the creation of the Sith code. Ajunta Pall would forever be credited as the first Dark Lord of the Sith, a truly impressive title.\n\n","meta":{"index":99,"author":"seko1111","name":"Ajunta Pall","release_year":2021}},"Cal Kestis":{"content":"# Introduction\nCal Kestis was a Force-Sensitive male human, taken under the Jedi Order during the last years of The Galactic Republic.

They managed to make it into an escape pod, but unfortunately Master Jaro Tapal was executed during the last moments, but his padawan Cal Kestis had managed to escape. Cal Kestis was traumatised with this event, seeing his master die in-front of him.\n\n# Section 2\nEven after his padawan Anakin Skywalker became a Jedi Knight, the two continued to fight alongside for several battles. Kenobi’s charms and calm demeanor as well as the quiet threat of his abilities with a lightsaber earned him the nickname of “The Negotiator”. During the war, the once thought deceased Darth Maul, had resurfaced with his brother Savage Opress and aimed to create a criminal empire whilst plotting revenge against his arch-nemesis, Kenobi. The two clashed blades many times on occasion across the Galaxy. Furthermore, Kenobi was devastated when Maul slew the Jedi’s past love interest, Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore, in cold blood, however remained strong in the conflict. Nearing the end of the war, Anakin saved his life in a battle over Coruscant, which led to Obi-Wan killing General Grievous on Utapau, however he was betrayed by Commander Cody, following Order 66.\n\n# Section 3\nCal Kestis would go into hiding prior to the Great Jedi Purge, which almost made The Jedi go extinct. Kestis arrived on Bracca and joined a Scrapper guild to make a living, until one day Kestis would use The Force to save his friend’s life at risk while working. Kestis’ action would grab the attention of The Imperial Inquisitors, a group of Dark Side Users serving under the Galactic Empire which aimed to eliminate every surviving Jedi. Kestis would flee the area after a duel with The Second Sister of the Inquisitors, he would then be saved by Cere Junda, a former Jedi Knight who was determined to rebuild The Jedi Order.\n\n# Section 4\nCere Junda revealed herself to be a former Jedi Knight to Kestis, she told Kestis of how she intended to rebuild The Jedi Order, and this could only be achieved if they had got access to a Jedi Holocron located at Bogano which contained the locations of every force-sensitive child across the galaxy. Cal Kestis would join Cere Junda on her mission, as they believed it was the only way that The Empire could be defeated. Cal Kestis would encounter a droid mamed BD-1 on Bogano who would help him in his quest for the search of The Jedi holocron and a holo recording left by Eno Cordova to guide him to the holocron, he revealed in order to reach the holocron, kestis had to find the tombs of three Zeffo Sages, it would later be found that Cordova was Cere Junda’s Jedi master.\n\n# Section 5\nCal Kestis wouldn’t find much to work on, the information they were currently holding on were the Zeffo homeworld, their species and a tomb on planet Dathomir. On Zeffo, Kestis would find a clue, that Cordova had a contact on Kashyyyk, known as Wookie Chieftain Tarruf. Kestis would travel to Kashyyyk, where he would encounter a conflict between The Empire and a group of rebels attempting to free Kashyyyk from The Empire’s enslavement.\n\n# Section 6\nCal Kestis would manage to recover The Astrium and unlock the vault holding the holocron, but they were ambushed by Trilla Sundari or The Second Sister. She would steal the holocron and escape with it to Planet Nur, where the Inquisitor headquarters are located.\nCal Kestis would assault the Inquisitor headquarters and defeat Trilla and retrieve the holocron. Trilla’s former master, would try to convince Trilla to join her in her quest to rebuild The Jedi Order and redeem herself from the Dark Side. But Darth Vader would shortly intervene and eliminate Trilla for her failure. Cal and Junda would try to escape from Vader and flee the planet, but they would face immense difficulty in doing so, as far as Cal getting stabbed in the chest. They would barely make it out of the headquarters, but now with the holocron in their possession, they realised that searching and gathering the force-sensitive children together would only make it easier for the Empire to eliminate the children or even turn them to the Dark Side. So, Cal would destroy the holocron, leaving The Force to decide the children’s fates.\n\n","meta":{"index":62,"author":"EternalKharus","name":"Cal Kestis","release_year":2021}},"CC-1010 \"Fox\"":{"content":"# Introduction\nCC-1010, also known as Fox, was a clone trooper who served as the Clone Commander of the Coruscant Guard in the Clone Wars.

They decided to be no more than friends after that. Kriss would achieve the rank of Master while Elzar was still a Knight, despite his determination for such a high and respected title. In 232 BBY, Mann was assigned to be a part of the Jedi contingent to the ceremony of the Starlight Beacon, a powerful station-like building created for the purpose of Lina Soh’s amazing work. Though chaos would occur, when a Byne Guild worker would carry cargo over to the Outer Rim through a hyperlane. It was torn from hyperspace itself and the debris would emerge and threaten star systems. This would later be called the Great Disaster afterwards.

Born on the planet of Glee Anselm based within the Sabilon region, he was taken in and trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order. Throughout his training, he learned the ways of Form I: Shii-Cho with a green-lightsaber. After becoming a Jedi Knight, he then worked his way to becoming a Jedi Consular held inside the Council of Reconciliation. In terms of his unique abilities, he was most known thanks to his Nautolan blood to sense emotion through the chemistry in one's body. He was also known to be insanely advantaged when fighting in water where his lightsaber had been customized to work inside of water via it containing two crystals.# Section 1\nHis time in the role of Jedi Consular led to Kit Fisto landing an important role alongside Jedi Master Luminara Unduli as Jedi Advisors of the Supreme Chancellor around 22BBY.  Not only did he gain this role but at the time he would have now been a member of the Jedi High Council. With his valuable skills required, Kit Fisto took part in the First Battle of Geonosis 22 BBY, where during this he would be quickly promoted to Jedi General near the end alongside many other Jedi Masters.\n\n# Section 2\nAs part of the Geonosis Strike Team, containing 212 Jedi, Kit Fisto was one of the estimated 30 to have survived, having shown great ability, leadership, and confidence in battle. He was even seen with a massive now iconic smile after causing a B2 Battle Droid to fall on top of another battle droid that had the head of a Protocol Droid, showing his ability to appreciate and enjoy the little things even in such a dire situation. He showed fantastic adeptness in being an army leader, as once the clones of the Grand Army of the Republic arrived he quickly assumed leadership of some and rallied them into the proper beginning of the Clone Wars.\n\n# Section 3\nThroughout his time as Jedi General, Kit Fisto took part in many different operations and battles for the Grand Republic, often leading SCUBA clone troopers. One of his most noticeable missions is his role in the Battle of Mon Calamari. Assigned by Grand Master Yoda himself, Kit Fisto’s fantastic abilities in the huge amount of water that takes up most of the planet was why he was vital to this particular battle. Fought in 22 BBY, the conflict stemmed from a rivalry between the races of the Quarrens and the Calamarians who both inhabited the planet of Dac. The Quarrens had taken sides with the Separatists looking to gain main domain over the world, while Calamarians had reached out to the Grand Republic for assistance, once the Quarrens had reported to have attacked, Kit Fisto and his forces were immediately deployed out to Dac. The Quarrens were equipped with droid sub-fighters and much other weaponry focused on underwater warfare, with their most deadly weapon being that of the crab cannon, powerful enough to destroy assault ships of the Republic even out in space. Kit Fisto led his SCUBA troopers alongside support from the Calamarian warriors while often riding a keelkana underwater.\nFisto had an ability which could use the Force to create strong bubbles, which could damage the crab cannon and lead to the destruction. Fisto caused the cannon to sink further into the ocean, after he dispatched the Quarrens' fire power, he began a series of raids on their output, which stole important information. Alongside capturing their leaders. By the end, he discovered the Quarrens had allied themselves to the Moappa who were aiding the Quarrens via telepathic communication. After putting the Moappa to an end, Fisto helped the Mon Calamari learn how to approach a diplomatic solution. The racial conflict had come close to an end thanks to Fisto’s efforts, however by the time of 21 BBY, due to more Separatists schemes. Many Quarrens continued to work with the Separatists, they organised and executed a major assassination of the Mon Calamari’, Yos Kolina. The peace between the two races was short-lived in this event.  The Battle of Mon Cala came soon after which Fisto would again be involved in, however with far more help as the conflict was far larger.\n\n# Section 4\nAnother highly notable event during Kit Fisto’s time in the Clone Wars was the hunt for a traitor in Tipoca City on the planet of Kamino, only a few months after the conclusion of the Battle of Geonosis. Joined alongside Jedi Master Aayla Secura, the two were assigned a mission in Kamino, the home planet of the clone army to oversee the army’s training. However, during their stay and visit they discovered multiple dead bodies of clones and proceeded to investigate by speaking to many Kaminoans in the cloning facility, considering it was only Kaminoans who worked in the facility it was a quick realization for Fisto that it was a Kaminoan traitor. From inspecting the clones as well, they were able to analyse them and found them to have been injected with a nano-virus. The two concluded that it was the work of the separatists and began to trace down the traitor, as they got closer and closer to finding the traitor they found themselves under siege and ambushed by a squadron of super battle droids. \nCaught heavily off guard, Secura ended up falling into Kamino’s vast and terrifying ocean which Fisto quickly jumped into, to give her aid, he dived down and was able to begin helping her get back up to the surface, providing her with oxygen as they made their way back up. As the two reached safe land again Secura was grabbed by the Kaminoan Kuma Nai, the traitor. Kuma Nai tried to take Master Secura hostage, pointing an injector of the nano-virus at her, looking to try and demand a ship off the planet, however, Master Secura quickly broke free and injected the Kaminoan with the virus, bringing them to their demise. Without this discovery and solution from the two Jedi Masters, it may have been very possible that the Grand Republic could have lost their ability to produce clones which would have heavily impacted the war against them.\n\n# Section 5\nThe mission to Ord Cestus can be considered Kit Fisto’s biggest mission besides his partaking in many battles. The Jedi Master was appointed the mission to destroy the current production of JK-13 droids, droids known to be ‘Jedi Killers’. Both Kit Fisto and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, assisted by 4 clone commandos, an Alpha 98 ARC trooper and many recruits were teamed up to go to the planet of Ord Cestus and complete this mission. The production of the drones themselves was not completely controlled by the Separatists but instead, they had hired the government of the planet to produce them, the Jedi looked to try and sway the government to sign for the Republic instead. Kit Fisto and his strike force worked to create better soldiers by  training many recruits. As a plan B measure, they had planned to overtake the government if needed and had also recruited a resistance group known as the Desert Wind. Kenobi looked to go and persuade the five main controlling families of the government to sign the contract. Fisto would take up the role of pretending to work under Darth Tyranus, once Jedi Master Count Dooku. Kit Fisto altered his look and used a light whip as his weapon, assisted by the Desert Wind and the Alpha 98 trooper would purposely capture and then be defeated by Kenobi to win the families trust. However, an actual turned-Jedi working under Tyranus, Asajj Ventress would expose the strike forces’ fake altercations with one another just before they could get the families to sign a contract. Kit Fisto and Kenobi would instead have to take the more aggressive route, with their troops and Desert Wind, they besieged the production factories assisted by their troops and an acclamator-class assault ship. During the siege the two Jedi go to meet up with a X’Ting gangster who had provided the strike force with weaponry, however, this meeting turned into an ambush by Ventress. Kit Fisto and Kenobi had to fight multiple young X’Ting fighters unarmed. Fisto was able to eventually get away and then confront Ventress, however during their duel, Fisto was unable to contain a defence when fighting Ventress’s aggressive two lightsaber style, not only that but she had learned how he fights while watching him fight the X’Ting. He later came close to death, but was able to fall into a river from a dock. He soon sensed Kenobi was in danger while duelling Ventress, he used the Force to split the dock which made both Ventress and Kenobi fall into the river, leading to Fisto passing out. His action allowed Kenobi to meet Ventress in a stalemate as they both were not effective underwater, they were unable to use their sabers unlike Fisto. Before Fisto could reawaken and take advantage of the water, Ventress used black ink to shroud the water and escape. From there the Desert Wind was able to pressure the five families into signing the contract and with that, Kit Fisto and Obi-Wan had completed the mission.\n\n# Section 6\nKit Fisto alone was a big factor in the first conclusion of the Mon Calamari and Quarren conflict, having won the Battle of Mon Calamari and helped to produce peace talks between the two races. However, with the Separatists and Quarren’s planned Assassination of the Mon Calamari King Yos Kolina being a success, the peace talks quickly crumbled and the conflict restarted after Senator Padme Amidala was unable to solve and ease the tension. She and her Jedi escort Anakin Skywalker called to Grand Master Yoda and his Deputy Mace Windu for possible reinforcements for the soon to be civil war, the two decided once again that Kit Fisto would be the best Jedi for the job, he arrived assisted by his SCUBA troops, as well as Commander Monnk and Anakin Skywalker’s Padawan Ahsoka Tano. The Quarren eventually began their attack on Mon Cala, now fully backed by the Separatists and its droid army. Fisto, as demonstrated many times, took charge of the water and swiftly helped in dispatching Quarren and droid forces alike. Fisto then assisted in combating the secret weapon of the Separatists for this conflict, the Hydroid Medusas, powerful, large robotic jellyfish inspired weapons. Fisto and the rest of the forces tried to concentrate all firepower on the robots however were then suddenly attacked on their other side by the Separatist droids. As the Mon Calamari and Republic forces felt overwhelmed and had the need to retreat, Fisto bravely fought off many to give them space before eventually retreating himself. The forces retreated to an underwater cave and lost communication with the rest of the Republic forces up on the surface. Desperate to get back up to the surface, Fisto volunteered to create a distraction so they could do so. Despite his efforts however the ship the forces had planned to use to escape backup had been destroyed and eventually the forces split into two, with Kit Fisto taking charge of one, alongside Ahsoka, the eventual new Mon Calamari King Lee-Char, Commander Monnk and, the remaining clones with him, with Senator Padme, Anakin and Captain Ackbar going into the second group. The two groups spread out with Fisto deciding to settle in a cave and set up an outlook. Eventually, after seeing his people captured, Lee Char tried to gain the droid army’s attention to show his people he was still living, however, was fired upon by an AQ Series Battle Droid which Kit Fisto quickly fended off. Suddenly with Gungan warriors arriving to reinforce the Republic, Kit Fisto and his group began a full attack on the droid forces, when the Commander of the droid forces Riff Tamson tried to attack Lee-Char, Ahsoka was able to fend him off until Fisto took over the fight for her, he had his saber knocked off him but was able to continually fend Riff off with hand to hand combat. Looking for his group to quickly get away, Separatist reinforcements began arriving, Fisto was captured but the others were spared the time to get away thanks to his efforts. As a prisoner,  he met back up with Anakin and Padme who had also been captured. Fisto and the others were tortured with eels which Fisto handled with relative ease, seemingly barely phased. Eventually with Mon Calamari and Quarren forces finally having teamed up after seeing the cruelty of the Separatists they were able to drive the droid army away, which Kit Fisto and the rest helped do so after being freed. Fisto within this very overwhelming battle played a crucial role in so many moments, with multiple displays of sacrifice and selflessness.

After joining the Almas Jedi Academy and progressing through the order she followed the Guardian path and successfully underwent her Jedi Knight trials.\n\nThe female Jedi Guardian has an interesting history, and made friends with a Jawa Consular named Akial. Her history has been documented to her, and the Consular’s involvement in the Dorumaa incident.# Section 1\nNOTABLE HISTORY\nKrin D’bis was a gifted individual in terms of combat training and thus was naturally led towards the Guardian path. She passed her Knight trials in the heat of the Clone Wars, which ultimately was a premonition to the incident she’d be involved in on Dorumaa, the moon of Almas.\n\nD’bis, due to her talent and calm stature was chosen to represent, alongside Akial, the Academy on Dorumaa. A massive celebration took place, but this was orchestrated by the Metatheran Cartel, an organization that engaged in both legal and illegal pursuits. They often conflicted with the ‘trade federation’ during these pursuits.\n\nThe celebration was conducted to show appreciation towards a squadron of individuals who had prevented a virus from engulfing the Caarite homeworld. They had saved millions and thus it was warranted.\n\nThe Consular Akial was chosen alongside the Guardian to provide an all-rounded approach to the representation. The Academy believed the (2) would be good for eachother, the Consular for negotiation and the Guardian for practical defence.\n\n# Section 2\nThe (2) Jedi also capitalised on the opportunity of the celebration and attempted to recruit new students into the Academy. They also spoke philosophically about a Sith cult called the Believers and what threat they posed. Characteristically, Krin D’bis sought to destroy them whilst the Consular stated that they should be strategically observed first, then hunted down systematically. The Metatheran Cartel’s illegal activities were also discussed. This included their involvement in the destruction of the ch’hala tree grove. Due to this, D’bis argued that despite the celebration, the hosts should not be responded to with a lowered guard.\n\n# Section 3\nPERSONALITY & TRAITS\nWith the records available, it is clear that D’bis reflected her combat ability in her speech. This meant that she was both ferocious, and impulsive. Despite this though, she acted patiently and responded to situations appropriately. There is nothing particularly unique, but she was a good Jedi that embodied the principles necessary to be one.\n\n# Section 4\nCONCLUSION\nSouleth’s author note: Krin D’bis isn’t nearly as well-known as Plo-Koon and yet her story can be found in most of our lives. Not all Jedi are heroes that will be written in stone, most of us are and will be found in the shadows. There’s nothing wrong with that, to serve and to do what is expected is a heroic duty.

Finally, Katarn would see himself as a part of the Jedi High Council in the New Jedi Order.\n\t\tBorn on Sulon 23 BBY, his father created a droid that Katarn thought of as a brother. He grew to be able to understand the language droids speak. He lost his mother at a young age and shortly after that enrolled into an Imperial Academy. He came across many people during his time as a stormtrooper, such as Jan Ors an agent for the Rebellion. Both came across each other and both were on opposite sides but he spared her life along with many others. On his last mission, he got the news that his father died in a suspected rebel raid on his homeworld. Little did he know that his father supported the Rebellion. Because of the fact that his father was killed by rebels, he grew hateful towards the Rebellion.\n\n# Section 2\nFurther, while on a pleasure cruise he stumbled across Jan Ors and Lando Calrissian. It was while on this where Ors showed him footage of her droid captured during the battle of where his father died. Jan Ors explained to Kyle how imperials staged the attack.

He then joined the Rebellion, his first mission was to get the first plans of the death star operation name Skyhook. \n\t\tAs the Empire fell, he joined Luke Skywalker’s New Jedi Order. As a Jedi Knight, he fought Jerec and his dark Jedi. Shortly after, Luke Skywalker offered to train Katarn, Katarn denied due to his great fear of the dark side. Luke Skywalker again offered him a second offer to train him on the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin4, Kyle accepted thinking it would help him control his dark side. Unfortunately, when 2 academy students fell to the dark side, he feared that he may fall too.

At the age of fifty years old, he was still considered to be an infant and was sought out by Moff Gideon, who hired a Mandalorian bounty hunter, Din Djarin, to retrieve him. However, Djarin refused to leave Grogu with the Imperials and aided in his rescue. After hiding out, Djarin decided to travel to Nevarro to fend off some of the Imperials, to help keep Grogu safe.

This brought forth Djarin’s new mission to bring Grogu back safely to the Jedi.\n\n# Section 2\nBoth Djarin and Grogu traveled across the galaxy searching for the remaining Jedi.

Fett had successfully boarded the ship allowing Djarin to find Grogu within the brig of the ship. The Moff let Djarin approach since it appeared that he had all the resources he needed from the young child.

These visitors would also find themselves purchasing all kinds of artistic Bardottan pieces within the marketplaces such as tapestries and Bardottan silk. The well-maintained peace of the planet would also be due to the stern procedures on trading and the consequences if one were to commit heinous crimes.

They stumbled across the burial ground of Terrak Morrhage, an ancient Sith Lord who centuries prior had created a plague that corrupted Jedi, turning them to the Dark Side and placing them under his control. Morrhage’s spirit began to corrupt members of the expedition, before they managed to escape at the expense of Tark, who was stranded and left behind.# Section 1\nBy 3643 BBY with the Cold War occurring across the Galaxy, the Padawans had all reached the rank of Jedi Master, being notable in their own right. However, Tark, who had been corrupted by Morrhage’s spirit and had assumed the name Lord Vivicar began to inflict the original plague upon his former allies, with the plague beginning to spread to other Jedi. Par’s former padawan, a Jedi Consular who was to become the 3rd Barsen’thor (Warden of the Order) became aware of the plague, and set out to learn an ancient shielding technique that had been created with the first outbreak of Morrhage’s plague. The Jedi Consular learnt the shielding technique after securing several ancient Jedi Holocrons, known as the Noetikons, and began to travel the galaxy, shielding the Masters from Vivicar’s control.\n\n# Section 2\nEventually, the Consular confronted Vivicar upon his flagship, discovering his origin as Tark and using the shielding technique upon him.

Since the drochs are able to avoid detection while inside a host, the cause of the diseases usually remains unknown. Over time they would grow and gain intelligence with each host they were able to kill. Larger drochs could absorb the life force of a host through smaller ones, meaning they did not have to directly take a host.# Section 1\nAn outbreak of the Death Seed lasted for seven centuries and was proven to be virtually unstoppable. Details of the pandemic were still very scarce, but it was known that huge groups of populations from dozens of worlds were killed before the plague finally died out. Supreme Chancellor Anwis Eddicus played a large role during the outbreak. In 702 BBY, the Grissmath Dynasty opened up a penal colony on Nam Chorios in the Meridian sector. Which was later swarmed with drochs in the hopes that an outbreak of the Death Seed would take out the prisoners. However, the sunlight bounced off of the sentient Spook Crystals on the planet, which weakened the electrochemical bonds that the drochs relied on. Smaller drochs were killed on the spot while the larger ones lived but were unable to harm their hosts and eventually got absorbed into the host’s blood.\n\n# Section 2\nIn 13 ABY, Seti Ashgad worked with a genetically modified droch called Dzym. They initiated a second pandemic with the hopes that they could weaken the New Republic forces. This enabled Moff Getelles to overtake the Meridian sector. Dzym was able to control the other drochs, giving him the ability to coordinate the plague by both infecting and curing victims. For the plague to work they needed to expose it to living tissue, so they infected synthdroids to carry the disease off the planet of Nam Chorios. Once they did so, they infected personnel at New Republic facilities across the sector.\n\n# Section 3\nLeia Organa was taken hostage by Ashgad when her ship’s whole crew died to the Death Seed. While being held there she was infected with the disease, which gave Ashgad time to make her ship jump into hyperspace. Later on, she was cured of the disease by Dzym and was known to be the first person to recover from the Death Seed. Soon after, the plague quickly spread across New Republic bases and eventually across three-quarters of the sector. One of the many locations that were affected was the base on Nim Drovis, the orbital base at Durren. All efforts that the New Republic made to quell the plague seemed to be futile.

The virus had a zombie-like effect on infected individuals, and also had special effects on certain races.# Section 1\nThe initial creator of the virus, Darth Drear, intended to create an elixir that would grant him immortality. However, his experiments failed, and he died after becoming infected with the virus. Over one thousand years following this initial creation, another Sith Lord, Darth Scabrous attempted to recreate the virus for immortality but failed like his predecessor, and his entire academy, once headed by Darth Drear, the Odacer-Faustin Sith academy fell to the virus, which infected all Sith acolytes and masters. \n\nEventually, knowledge of this virus became known to Darth Vader, a few millennia after Scabrous’ venture into the virus. However, rather than attempting to create something that would grant him immortality, Vader commissioned a team from the Imperial Biological Weapons Division to recreate the virus and use it as a bioweapon. This operation was furtive, and the virus was successfully recreated, this time under the codename Blackwing. While this virus was being prepared for field use, however, an accident took place amongst the vessel it was being carried on, the Vector, and unleashed the virus once again, causing it to spread among the crew, almost all of whom became infected. The infected took control of the Vector and forced another vessel, the Barge, this time carrying prisoners, to board the Vector and become infected.\n\n# Section 2\nThe virus, which was activated by a force-sensitive black orchid, was created through Force Alchemy, as mentioned earlier. Because of this, it still possessed some form of consciousness and manipulated the infected to do its bidding. As mentioned earlier, individuals affected by the virus became zombie-like. The virus took effect in 2 stages. Firstly, the virus would kill the infected through horrible symptoms that would always kill them, and then would take control of the cadavers and use them for its bidding. The zombie hosts would be used by the virus to spread the pathogen even further. This virus was very hard to treat and cure, because of how quickly it transferred and how well it was able to kill affected peoples. However, there was an anti-virus that could cure the virus and stop its spread, though as mentioned, it was extremely hard to treat. Throughout the bodies of the infected, a liquid would also spread. It is surmised that this liquid was related to an entity known as Mnggal-Mnggal, who was a sentient being that took the form of a gray ooze. This connection is largely thought to be there because of similarities in the anatomy of both the liquid and Mnggal.\n\nThe main power of the virus did not come from its quick killing, but rather its transmission rate. The transmission was extremely effective between populations, with the virus having a near 100% transmission rate within controlled testing environments. Another characteristic of the virus was that it possessed a high potential to transmit itself between races, something that is nearly impossible for other viruses due to not being able to adapt to the varying immune systems each species had. Thus, the virus was able to infect a large host of species, some of whom even had special interactions with the virus.\n\nThe virus followed a certain pattern for infection. Usually, the patient 0 for the virus was the initial person who would synthesize the virus. That is, activate the virus through the black orchid mentioned earlier. After this, there were a number of ways the virus could transmit itself. The bite was the most potent form of infection. This method acted the quickest and had the most severe effects. However, the virus could also spread through contact with bodily fluids, or the gray ooze that came out of an infected individual. When weaponized, the virus also had a special property; It was able to transmit as an airborne virus. This variant of the virus was far more powerful than any other variant and could bypass biohazard gear and stormtrooper armor, which showed the sheer potency and effectiveness of the pathogen.\n\n# Section 3\nSymptoms of infected persons usually took place in two stages, as mentioned earlier.\n\n1. The first stage of infection was when the virus actually took its toll on the infected. However, the severity of it depended on how it was transmitted, and the species it was transmitted to. However, symptoms usually started when the host’s skin became discolored and sullen. After this, the virus would attack the body and impair vision and breathing. Victims past this stage would then experience hallucinations. Some of these were based on personal aspects of the victim’s life, while others were seemingly random visuals that usually involved some sort of symbolism. The virus could act extremely quickly, or extremely slowly, depending on the method of transmission. The virus also had certain interactions with species, an example of which being the wookies, who became extremely aggravated when infected with the virus.\n\n2. After the virus had taken its toll on the living host, the cadaver would reanimate as a result of the virus forcefully restarting muscle synapses in the brain. The result would be a zombie-like creature that existed merely to further the virus’ control and transmit it to other individuals. The zombies looked sullen and discolored, similar to their pre-reanimation state. Physical abnormalities of the zombies also caused them to have a gait that was not normal, and instead of running, they staggered towards prey, which was, most of the time, humans. Zombies had a sort of hive mind, and due to them not being alive, they could survive almost any sort of physical torture. This also caused them to have almost no regard for their own bodies, and infected in this stage would often accidentally harm themselves in searching and consuming prey. The undead also were able to learn, and while they started off as primitive beings, they quickly became able to handle whatever was required of them to spread the virus further. This was largely due to the sentience of the virus and its dominant nature in an infected cadaver.\n\nThe virus was fairly easy to diagnose once symptoms emerged, through blood tests. However, symptoms would arise fairly quickly in most cases, meaning that the virus usually did not require a diagnosis. The virus could also be self-diagnosed if a person began experiencing the hallucinations indicative of the virus. Once diagnosed, the virus was extremely hard to cure. However, this was possible due to an anti-virus vaccine derived from certain people who possessed immunity to the airborne, weaponized version of the virus due to a genetic abnormality. This vaccine still had its downsides, however, because certain species would experience different effects from it, notably the wookies, who would have symptoms emerge if injected with the anti-virus. However, more primitive forms of cures did work, for example, the infected limb could be amputated, and wookies could remove the mucus that would build in their throats with a syringe. These methods all only worked when the individual was still in the first stage of the virus. As for the people in the second stage, the only option was to get rid of them completely. This worked through various means, such as flamethrowers or being chopped up with lightsabers. Complete vaporization also worked on victims in this stage.\n\nHowever, the virus still could be used for immortality, though the method was extremely difficult to successfully complete. The Sith pursuing immortality would have to complete a dark ritual. The ritual required the Sith to first become infected with the virus, then take a Jedi with a high midi-chlorian count.

Thala-sirens could be easily recognised by their height, up to 5 metres tall, and their characteristic fins. A typical thala-siren's skin was grey and pink.

The name itself was used to describe a group of skills which heavily relied on energy absorption, deflection and shielding. After being discovered, Tutaminis quickly became one of the most commonly taught skills in the Jedi Order due to its wide variety of possible uses, and its defensive potential.# Section 1\nThe basic Tutaminis abilities focused on absorbing the energy of the hostile attacks, and conditionally deflecting them back to their source. Many advanced users of Tutaminis were also able to convert the gathered energy and use it to empower their own, various Force-based attacks. This way, many Jedi in history were able to single-handedly turn the tides of the battle, as they used their enemies’ energetic strikes against them. Another common usage of Tutaminis would emphasise a safe diffusion of energy into the harmless atmosphere. A few talented and experienced masters could also utilise Tutaminis to defend themselves from lightsaber strikes with their bare hands. Many telekinetic shielding techniques, such as the Force Barrier, or their offensive variants: Force Burst, Force Repulse and even Force Judgement, which used the Force energy as its primary power source, would be expanded thanks to the continuous research and development of Tutaminis.\n\n# Section 2\nEven though Tutaminis was widely known amongst both the Jedi and the Sith, only the truly talented individuals who had spent years training could master this skill. Many branches of Tutaminis have been explored by only a handful of Force users, making it almost impossible to define its full potential. \nA majority of famous Jedi during the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War, such as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Shaak Ti, Galen Marek, Nejaa Halcyon, Plo Koon and Yoda, were able to deflect blaster bolts and heat with their hands, to then use the absorbed energy against their enemies. Furthermore, Plo Koon himself was known to have created and mastered the art of Force Judgement, a technique which allowed him to blast his enemies with golden lightning, a less lethal version of the Sith Force Lightning. Besides Plo Koon, Yoda also possessed the power necessary to absorb a fully trained Sith’s lightning strikes, and even deflect them back, which made him one of the strongest duelists in the galaxy. It is worth mentioning that not only the modern Jedi used that skill in battle - one of the unique talents related to Tutaminis was displayed during the Battle of Alderaan, during which a young Jedi named Satele Shan blocked Darth Malgus’ lightsaber thrust and struck him down with a powerful Force Burst, allowing her troops to regroup and gain an advantage over the Sith Empire. \nDarth Revan, his apprentice Malak, and the Sith Emperor Vitiate were also able to efficiently manipulate Force Lightning, with Vitiate achieving a definite mastery of this skill under the name of Valkorion. Interestingly enough, Darth Vader was capable of deflecting blaster energy as well, despite his cybernetic suit designs that made him vulnerable to Force Lightning. Many speculations arose, that the Dark Lord utilised a special fabric on his gloves to increase their absorption potential. Even though many famous warriors would use Tutaminis in battle, only a small percentage of all Force users were able to truly learn it. This art would undoubtedly impact the way of waging wars, and to this day is considered one of the most crucial Force techniques to ever be created.\n\n","meta":{"index":45,"author":"abc_5329","name":"Tutaminis","release_year":2021}},"Disturbance in the Force":{"content":"# Introduction\nA disturbance in the Force was an unusual and uneasy sense that Force users develop when something feels erroneous.

The Jedi believes that the universe is never cold and directionless. The Force gives them purpose and shares their gifts with others. It expresses itself into two aspects: the Living and the Unifying Force.\n\nThe Living Force is the life energy that surrounds all living beings. When a being dies, a Jedi senses their loss as their life energy dissolves. All techniques and abilities that are used originated from the Living Force.\n\nThe Unifying Force manifests the cosmic energy that unifies all the stars and galaxies together. Communicating with this aspect of the Force allows the user to temporarily see the past or the future. It is believed that the Unifying Force relied on the user’s understanding and is neither connected to the light or the dark side of the Force.\n\nThe Force is also divided into two sides: the light and the dark. The light side of the Force is connected with peace and serenity while the dark side manifested fear and anger.\n\n# Section 2\nKnowledge, the center pillar, is considered the most important pillar out of the three.

A Jedi shall further improve their understanding of the ways of the Force, together with their connection to it. It is what keeps the Jedi filled with curiosity, seeking information. The Archives serve as the central hub of knowledge for the Jedi Order as it contains a ton of information. Jedi Masters also record information through the use of the Jedi Holocron, mostly containing their lessons about the ways of the Force.\n\n# Section 4\nSelf-Discipline is defined as controlling themselves from emotions and distractions and does not seek to control others. This includes all the responsibilities and awareness of a Jedi. This Pillar primarily aims to restrain the Jedi from their emotions.\n\nA great expression of self-discipline is through meditation. It connects the Jedi’s mind and spirit with the will of the Force as the Force revitalizes their body and enhances their mind. Meditation is separated into three parts: Rising Meditation, Empty Meditation, and the Moving Meditation.\n\nThe Rising Meditation enhances the connection to the Force to an extent that a Jedi may find themselves levitating. This allows them to communicate with the Unifying Force.\n\nThe Empty Meditation prevents a Jedi from negative emotions and refrains them from attachments.\n\nThe Moving Meditation enhances focus and decreases distraction which allows a Jedi to complete their task excellently.\n\n","meta":{"index":8,"author":"kurtnicolo","name":"The Three Pillars","release_year":2020}},"Force Forms":{"content":"# Introduction\nForce forms were the four battle mediations that only the most focused and skilled mindset Jedi could use. Force forms were the alternative to lightsaber combat and enhanced other’s combat skills. Jedi Consulars tended to use Force forms to enhance their connection and abilities to use the Force. Force forms made Jedi more powerful and they were able to go beyond what most combatants could, it enhanced their combat skills. There have only been four forms known by the time of the First Jedi Purge.# Section 1\nThe first form (Force Channel) was the only form that did not require one to take the Consular path. It was common amongst the Jedi to learn this meditative stance and it barely improved one’s connection to the Force whilst having no vulnerabilities.\n\n# Section 2\nThe second form is known as Force Potency. This form was used solely for offense, it boosted a Jedi’s ability to use the Force for an attack. However, it was powerful and could be used against powerful opponents, but it left the Jedi exhausted. This form worked well for Dark Side users because offense stems from anger and hatred, which the Dark Side excelled in. However, it was ok for a pure Jedi to use this form to end battles that were getting too out of hand.\n\n# Section 3\nThe third form was Force Affinity. This form was widely accepted within the Jedi Order and was more commonly used by Jedi. However, it required the user to be focused on the Force. The user must overcome the distractions for them to relax in their connection to the Force even in fights that were the most deadly. It gave the user a peaceful state of mind. This form allowed Jedi near to boost their stamina and wear out their opponents quicker as long as no harm came to the user. It allowed Jedi to recover their lost strength and defend themselves easily against tired opponents.\n\n# Section 4\nThe fourth and final form was Force Mastery. It did not require a master of the Force, but someone who act like one. However, those who had stronger connections to the Force tended to use this ability better. It could enhance Jedi’s physical abilities and weaken their opponent’s defenses. It caused the users to weaken and were more prone to attacks. It was almost a mind trick, it sometimes led people to believe that the user was extremely powerful with the Force when they might not be. However, it did require the user to have some strong connection to the Force to utilize this form.\n\n# Section 5\n\n\n# Section 6\n\n\n","meta":{"index":35,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Force Forms","release_year":2023}},"Force Oneness":{"content":"# Introduction\nForce Oneness was commonly achieved through death, when a Force-user became one with the Force. However, it was possible to accomplish Oneness with the Force whilst still being alive. Even very skilled Force-users rarely corresponded with a living manifestation of both the Light and Dark Side of the Force. Whilst trying to achieve Force Oneness, it was likely one could succumb to the temptations of the Dark side, and after this, the individual became tools of the Force with a state of calmness. Very few Dark and Light side users alike achieved this; a few notable examples are Barriss Offee and Luke Skywalker accomplished it naturally more than once.","meta":{"index":44,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Force Oneness","release_year":2021}},"Noetikons":{"content":"# Introduction\nINTRODUCTION\n“It is more like a virtual intelligence than a holographic recording. Master Tharis Developed it.” - Vandar Tokare\n\nThese specialised holocrons were used to categorically and systematically search through the Jedi Temple Archives whenever it was desired of them. They are essentially magnifying glasses to those prying for knowledge in the vast catacombs of information collected by the Jedi. It’s technicalities were designed by Tharis Orne, but physically implemented by Arca Jeth.# Section 1\nHISTORY\nThese holocrons were special in various ways but ultimately they had the distinct characteristics of wisdom, knowledge and personality embodied in them. This stemmed from and was inspired by (3) of the greatest Jedi Master’s in the Order. Their names have been lost to history.\n\n(3) notable Noetikons exist titled the Noetikon of Science, Noetikon of Light and the Noetikon of Secrets each of which pertained to their respective departments.\n\nThese were protected within the Coruscant Temple’s archives and could be accessed from almost anywhere. However, a single mind could not process all it’s information and thus it was best only to tamper with it in search of singular questions.\n\nThe Sacking of Coruscant (referred to in the Ven Zallow case study) led to the Noetikons being seized by scavengers. These constituted the Gand, Black Sun and the Justicars who spread the relics across the Coruscant underworld.\n\nFortunately, a Jedi Consular, in the hopes of curing her Master Yuon Par of a disease, aimed to find these Noetikons who would most likely contain the knowledge to a cure.\n\nAfter much difficulty, she discovered the wisdom necessary to cure her Master. Consequently however, the terminal was destroyed by the Sith.\n\n# Section 2\nJedi Masters under the Barsen’thor, many years later, also sought the Noetikons in hopes of finding information to defeat the Children of the Emperor. With the consultation of all three, they learned from the Rakata history that Belsavis contained a sleeping army the Esh-kha (both referenced in their respective case studies, refer for more info) that could be used.\n\n# Section 3\nCONCLUSION\nThe Noetikons were escorted back to Tython following their concluded use however, once again after an assault by the Sith Empire, they found their way back to Coruscant. These powerful tools will soon be recreated within the temple on Ossus.

It permitted someone who was Force-sensitive to use the Force to persuade others that they were cut off from the Force itself. As a result, it helped to both lower an enemy's resistance to the use of the Force and to neutralize a wide variety of Force powers, including but not limited to; Force speed, Force valor, Force barrier, Force immunity, Force fury, Inspire, energy resistance, and even battle meditation.# Section 1\nThe Old Sith Wars used the term \"Force breach\" to describe this technique's advanced proficiency.

Vergence was focused on places and objects, or very rarely people. It was somewhere in the galaxy where the Force flowed the most freely. Those who were capable of using its power could harness a powerful source of concentrated energy. Vergences could be easily manipulated by powerful Force-users. There, Jedi tried to find evidence of how the Vergence was created, but none of the estimates seemed accurate. Vergences could vary in size and could be as big as an entire planet, along with this, Vergences could appear anywhere. The Vergence was never affected by the laws of time and space, for they could appear outside it. Vergences tended to show up in any places that previously had a strong presence, such as places where power Force-users gathered or places where tragic events once occurred. Vergences could expand or shrink at any time and could appear for a mere second or possibly millennials. Some Vergences were more powerful than others, they could give those in their presence special visions or strengthen certain abilities. Due to their strength in the Force, most Jedi and Sith built temples on top of or close to the Vergences. It could also be used as a powerful talisman for focusing on objects. It was very rare for a Vergence to center around an individual, both Orders never figured out how this was achievable.# Section 1\nThere were many identified Force nexuses across the galaxy founded by the Jedi Order. The great temple on Coruscant itself was built on top of a Force nexus, which contained very powerful nexus energy, located on the mountain known as the Sacred Spire. It was still contaminated with the Force nexus after it was abandoned during the Yuuzhan Vong War. Many other temples were built within  proximity of Force nexuses, like the temple on Ilum. Some nexuses occurred after a series of different events.\n\n# Section 2\nWhen an object is left next to a Force nexus for certain periods, it gets imbued with Force abilities and can become powerful artifacts, such as the ability to boost the user’s awareness and give them faster reflexes and reaction time. Even those who were not Force-sensitive could use these artifacts. Some objects that were infected with the Light Side of the Force were that powerful they could purify someone, and artifacts with the Dark Side embedded within could corrupt someone. The Force-sensitive planet, Spintir, had a Vergence within the Caves of Light and Shadow, it was an ancient cave that experienced a stalemate between the Light and Dark Sides of the Force. The cave even corrupted a pack of Icewolves who were inhabitants there. When this was discovered, the cave sealed itself with a band of Force-sensitive beings. Vergences could even be people like Meetra Surik and Anakin Skywalker was a Vergence in the eyes of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn.\n\n","meta":{"index":40,"author":"jinqxd","name":"Vergence","release_year":2021}},"Alter Abilities":{"content":"# Introduction\nAlter Abilities encompass all Force abilities that are used to impact the surrounding area.

To achieve being one with the Force, the Force-sensitive needed to achieve the power to do so. It had also been used by the Sith, such as Darth Bane who created an apparition of himself, although it looked more solid than how a normal Force ghost usually would look. A Force ghost was able to communicate with a person, visibly or invisibly. Such apparitions also make their own choice whether they wanted to look clear or hazy. This led to Force ghosts being able to communicate in multiple ways as well as appear in multiple ways.# Section 1\nA Force spirit or a Force ghost was able to bind themselves to any living being to teach them and guide them. Such examples were shown by Qui-Gon Jinn, Master Yoda, Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Master Luke Skywalker, and Leia Organa (Also a Skywalker). A Sith may also be able to achieve the power to become a Force ghost but that has, until now, been impossible as the Sith have only wanted to be immortal, not knowing that they can become a Force ghost.\n\n# Section 2\nForce ghosts can become solid on their own will. They can touch a being or hold something. Although they can also freely pass through solid matter, whatever it may be. The first person to learn how to become a Force ghost was Qui-Gon Jinn, who was taught by a Shaman of the Whills, who showed him that immortality wasn’t possible but being a Force ghost was close to it.

A remarkable usage of this ability was by Cilghal, a Mon Calamari Jedi Master, who cured Mon Mothma of a molecular poison that was deemed incurable.# Section 1\nThe practice of this ability was frequent. Ki-Adi-Mundi used this Force power to fix a broken collar bone through the means of meditation. The power itself can often be applied by simply meditating to fix injuries, but sometimes it requires greater application such as another person using it on someone else.\n\n# Section 2\nIt was often believed that those attuned with the dark side of the Force could not use Cure. This belief was wrong, they could use this ability but it came at a cruel price. Dark side practitioners such as Darth Sion were able to focus all their pain and suffering to one area which would instantly heal that wound.\n\n# Section 3\nAnother modified version of Cure was a technique called Dark Transfer. This ability came from a man named Cade Skywalker. Skywalker was able to use his powers and bring back someone from the verge of death. The usage of this ability often resulted in intense emotional stress. Skywalker believed that due to the severe emotional stress, he’d need to tap into dark-sided energy to handle this power.

It is taught on a Youngling’s first day in the Academy and is from that point onward a defining factor in every action of each Jedi throughout their career. The Jedi Code is often summarised in Odan-Urr’s iteration, the version that all Jedi will memorise and often recite, but the Jedi Code itself is very expansive and detailed when broken down and studied. I hope this case study widens your view beyond what you may think you know of the Jedi Code.# Section 1\nThe Jedi Code stems from the Jedi Mantra, which in itself is a variation of the Je’daii Code, established when the Je’daii was an order of both light side and dark side practitioners. When the Je’daii Order reorganised into the Jedi Order it was deemed necessary that a new Code was established, and so the original Jedi Council put together the Jedi Mantra. The Jedi Mantra was designed with the same purpose as the Je’daii Code, to provide basic and fundamental guidelines for all Jedi to obey.\n\n# Section 2\nThe problem with the Jedi Mantra was that it was extremely vague. It could be argued that the Jedi Mantra was rushed in an effort to solidify the reorganisation of the Je’daii Order into the Jedi Order with no proper study or refinement having gone into the principles that would make a Jedi stand apart from the original Je’daii. It wasn’t until Jedi Master Odan-Urr came along in roughly 5000 BBY that this refinement would take place. Odan-Urr was a scholar and historian who decided upon achieving the rank of Master to study and refine the Jedi Mantra, going so far as to remake the Mantra into the Jedi Code we most commonly study today.\n\n# Section 3\nWhen Odan-Urr began his studies of the Jedi Code he also began putting together a series of texts and documents that would become known as the ‘’Teachings of Odan-Urr’’. These various teachings would become some of the most influential and studied educational documents in Jedi history. These documents were instrumental in reviving the Jedi Order numerous times after various purges and would even be used when Luke Skywalker recreated the Jedi Order in his own image roughly 2000 years later. Odan-Urr would make simple changes to the Jedi Code in a way that would expand upon the Jedi Mantra to provide a clearer set of guidelines for Jedi to follow.\n\n# Section 4\nWe can see here that with the simple addition of ‘’There is’’, it eliminates the vagueness of the original Jedi Mantra, providing a stricter set of guidelines that allows for less interpretation and guessing while also still keeping a sense of mystery. One of a Jedi’s greatest challenges is figuring out their own interpretation of the Jedi Code and the Force, however the Jedi Order cannot allow for these interpretations to be too wild or unconventional, so while the refined Jedi Code instills a sense of curiosity and does allow for interpretation, we can see clearly that it also becomes easier to understand.\n\n# Section 5\nTake the first line of each code as an example of how it has been refined. ‘’Emotion, yet peace’’. This implies that emotion can be involved in a Jedi’s lifestyle, that emotion can exist when a Jedi conducts their duties, and while Jedi cannot fully eliminate emotion, they are expected not to act upon emotion. Whereas the refined version, ‘’There is no emotion, there is peace’’ makes it clear that Jedi guidelines forbid acting upon or with emotion, and that a Jedi should act with a peaceful mindset. It is a simple change but one that caused much confusion and difficulty for the early Jedi Order.\n\n# Section 6\nThe Jedi Code we most commonly recite and look to for guidance is only a summary. Prior to Master Odan-Urr’s teachings there was little detailing the specific actions and expectations of the Jedi Code. Odan-Urr would expand upon this. Odan-Urr broke the Jedi Code into three separate categories. Self-discipline, responsibility and public service. These are not to be confused with the Three Pillars, as these specific categories are only the expanded and in-depth teachings of the Jedi Code.\n\n# Section 7\nIt would be ignorant to say that the Jedi Code is only the six lines that we recite, for the Jedi Code is long and expansive. During a Youngling’s training in the Jedi Academy they will be expected to study in great detail the individual parts that make up the Jedi Code, and throughout the rest of their long careers they will be expected to be a shining example of each aspect.\n\n# Section 8\nThe most fundamental aspect of a Jedi. In the same manner a soldier must keep their uniform clean and be able to parade neatly, a Jedi must act in a similar manner. They must adhere to their studies with unwavering self-motivation, they must keep themselves and their lightsabers in fit and working order and they must humble themselves when faced with their duties.\n\n# Section 9\nSelf-discipline is the only aspect of the Jedi Code that is shared with the Three Pillars, and for good reason. All Jedi will have self-discipline drilled into their lifestyle from the moment they step foot in the Academy until the moment they become one with the Force. From making their bed, keeping themselves fit, studying without supervision and keeping their lightsaber well maintained, all Jedi must tackle self-discipline and master it early in their careers.\n\n# Section 10\nThe Jedi Code breaks self-discipline down into nine separate categories that I will go through in this essay. Each of these categories are presented and taught as a challenge to young Jedi with the intention of encouraging Jedi to understand that every aspect of self-discipline must be studied, understood, overcome and then be put into practice throughout the Jedi’s career.\n\n# Section 11\nOn a galactic scale, Jedi are indeed rare and the training and dedication it takes to achieve the title can rarely be compared to any other position or duty within the galaxy. This however does not make a Jedi special. While many of the abilities a Jedi will come to learn and employ are unique, a Jedi must understand that this does not grant them special privileges or a right to be put above others. A Jedi’s life is that of servitude and dedication to helping others, it is our priority to place others above ourselves and ensure that the needs of those around us are seen to first.\n\n# Section 12\nMany young Jedi will struggle with this idea, believing that access to the force and the ability to a wield a lightsaber makes them unique, and in a way it does, but what truly makes them unique is their ability to use these skills in the service and defense of those less fortunate than themselves, not the other way around.\n\n# Section 13\nA Jedi must be confident. The tasks they face are often perilous and they will often be looked to as the authority on matters they may or may not be trained in. This however is not an excuse to be overconfident. Overconfidence can cause the Jedi and others to be hurt or hindered as a result of the Jedi’s ego. A Jedi should be the voice of reason in any situation, and when a Jedi fails to act in a reasonable and realistic manner, they have truly failed themselves and those around them.\n\n# Section 14\nJedi training is designed in such a way that encourages students to overcome obstacles on a consistent basis to ensure they feel ready to tackle a wide variety of situations, however, the most important aspect of this lesson is understanding that a Jedi can and will fail. These failures remind the Jedi that the force does not grant them unlimited power, but instead grants them the ability to understand the true limits of their power.\n\n# Section 15\nAs taught in the lesson of conquering overconfidence, a Jedi will fail. No Jedi is perfect and even the wisest and mightiest of Jedi have struggled greatly with failure. A Jedi should prepare for failure and even expect it on occasion, but they should never welcome it. Failure provides the best lessons but failure can also come with grave consequences and a Jedi that comes to tolerate failure without seeking improvement is just as dangerous to themselves and others as the Jedi that believes they cannot fail.\n\n# Section 16\nConquering defeatism is one of the hardest lessons of self-discipline, a young Jedi’s first experience with failure can often strike a large blow to their confidence, and even a Jedi who has spent decades mastering the force can suffer from doubt should failure come their way. It is important to understand that failure is a natural part of life, even for a Jedi. But failure should always provide a lesson in success for next time.\n\n# Section 17\nThroughout a Jedi’s career they will be presented with overwhelming situations or may be presented with a point of view that contradicts their own. It is important that a Jedi is understanding of those around them and appreciates that their approach to a situation may not always be the best. This part of the Jedi Code runs in tangent with the conquering of arrogance and overconfidence. A Jedi should not be so stuck in their own ways that they fail to adapt or understand that their goal may be accomplished through different means.\n\n# Section 18\nA Jedi should also understand that losing isn’t always so terrible, it is okay to admit defeat, consolidate and study their defeat and then return with a new approach to the situation. A young Jedi can often become stuck in a specific mindset, with a black and white view of most encounters and refuse to consider different possibilities or solutions, this is dangerous for a Jedi. A Jedi should always be open to change and accept that not everything can be done the way they want it.\n\n# Section 19\nRecklessness is the most common trait amongst many young Jedi and can often carry on into a Jedi’s Knighthood. Overcoming recklessness is uniquely difficult for a Jedi. By our very nature Jedi strive to deal with a situation in the quickest possible manner to prevent the worst possible outcome, however, as a result of this we can often become the cause of the worst possible outcome. Even if a situation requires speed, a Jedi should take as much time as they can to consider every outcome and review the situation in its entirety. What may seem like a safe path or a swift resolution may have unforeseen long or short term consequences.\n\n# Section 20\nRecklessness is often first shown when a Jedi gains access to a lightsaber, or even a training lightsaber. It is common and even understandable that a Jedi’s access to a weapon, accompanied with their abilities with the force can often make them feel safe enough to approach any situation head on. As a result a young Jedi will feel as if they have every situation under control, until they don’t. A problem that feels like it can only be solved with a lightsaber or the force can often be solved another way, even if that way is unclear at first.\n\n# Section 21\nThis aspect of the Jedi Code will often confuse a young Jedi. This does not mean that a Jedi should not be curious or pursue their studies, but that a Jedi should never use their position or abilities to gain access to information that is private or has no relevance to the Jedi. Information must be procured safely and responsibly and it is the duty of a Jedi to ensure their position does not interfere with this.\n\n# Section 22\nInformation should be sought to aid the Jedi’s task or to educate themselves and those around them, not to satisfy mere curiosity. Some information is best kept private and for a Jedi to abuse their powers to prod into the privacy of others is to abuse the trust the galaxy has given to them.\n\n# Section 23\nIt is an unfortunate reality of a Jedi’s life that they will inevitably encounter hostility and conflict. Throughout a Jedi’s career they will likely be attacked quite regularly and it is imperative that these attacks are never met with hatred or anger from the Jedi. Calmness and serenity will allow a Jedi to have a clearer picture of any dangerous situation. As a Jedi your primary concern when facing danger is the defense of those around you and yourself, as such you should only act offensively if there are no other options. Always try to be peaceful until the last possible second, never rush to conclude a situation simply because it is convenient or faster than taking your time.\n\n# Section 24\nYoung Jedi will struggle with aggression the most, it is easy to fall into the clutches of anger when first being introduced to combat but it is important to remember that combat should never be taken personally. Losing is a victory in itself and even a loss can be met with a smile and meditation. A wise Jedi will prevent conflict in any way they can, an even wiser Jedi will meditate on any conflict that did happen and find a way to prevent it for their next encounter.\n\n# Section 25\nThroughout a Jedi’s life they will meet all manner of people, including people they may form a bond with and even be attracted to. This is a normal part of a Jedi’s experience but it is always important to remember that being a Jedi comes first and foremost. Your duty as a Jedi is to the galaxy, not to one individual or groups of individuals. This does not mean a Jedi cannot have friends and form bonds with those they encounter, but it does mean that the Jedi’s objective and overall duties are the priority in their life.\n\n# Section 26\nJedi are often looked to for advice and to act as the authority on a wide variety of subjects and as such can be approached to take on additional responsibilities outside of the Jedi Order. While it is up to the Jedi if they wish to do such things, the Jedi should never place these responsibilities over those they have within the Order, regardless of how personally important these responsibilities may be to them.\n\n# Section 27\nIt is unbecoming of a Jedi to seek to possess items that do not aid them in their missions or represent who they are. As a result of a Jedi’s often hectic and chaotic lifestyle it is important that a Jedi only possesses items they can carry with them on a short notice. Most Jedi will live in a Temple or onboard transport they use for their missions, and as a result it is unlike a Jedi to own property. Even so, a Jedi will likely never possess enough credits to purchase expensive items beyond what they need for their missions.\n\n# Section 28\nA Jedi should be content with what they have, as what they have is usually much more than those they protect. To achieve a peaceful mindset a Jedi should never want nor seek, jealousy and desire are beneath a Jedi. This does not mean a Jedi cannot accept a reward if the giver is truly insistent, or during the less busy times of their lives, even use some of their earnings to invest in luxuries such as clothing and items that may make their day-to-day lives easier, but it should never be a Jedi’s priority.\n\n# Section 29\nWhether a Jedi likes it or not they are always responsible for something. Responsibility can range from being in charge of training a Padawan or Younglings to protecting and safeguarding the various citizens of the galaxy. The Jedi Order as an organisation is responsible for the protection of the galaxy, therefore responsibility is ingrained into the mindset of every Jedi.\n\n# Section 30\nAccountability for one’s actions is a difficult process to learn as almost always there will be an excuse for failure. Once an individual learns not to make excuses and to accept their responsibilities for what they are, they will become a much more reliable person.\n\n# Section 31\nA Jedi should always endeavour to be honest with themselves and others. A Jedi that cannot be trusted is a Jedi that cannot be relied upon. A Jedi is only permitted to lie or bend the truth should it serve to protect others or accomplish a necessary goal, but this should always be reflected upon afterwards and done so as little as possible. A Jedi should never lie to their Master or the Jedi Council, there is no bending of the truth that can justify this, as their Master and the Council will always be there to aid them, regardless of their task.\n\n# Section 32\nA Jedi that cannot fulfil their promises is a Jedi that has no place protecting others. A promise should never be made lightly and Younglings will come to understand this from the moment they begin their training. Should a promise be made and broken, a Jedi should seek to make amends for this transgression as swiftly as possible. A Jedi is a reliable individual and as soon as they have broken the trust placed in them, then there is reason to doubt that Jedi’s ability. It is always wise to consult with a Master or close associate prior to making a promise, regardless of how small.\n\n# Section 33\nOnce a Jedi is capable of taking a Padawan they should immediately understand that this is perhaps the most important thing they will ever do in life. A Padawan is under your care and tutelage and it is your duty to ensure their safety and well-being, both mentally and physically. A Padawan should never feel as if they cannot turn to their Master for any reason, nor should they feel that their Master doubts their abilities and does not have confidence in them.\n\n# Section 34\nPraise and encouragement should be given as much as possible to ensure a Padawan is consistently developing the right way and to prevent a hostile or potentially harmful relationship between the Master and Padawan. Should a Padawan ever need to be reprimanded or reminded of any wrong doings, then it should always be done privately, so as to not harm the Padawan’s mindset.\n\n# Section 35\nA Master should never have to apologize for their Padawan’s behaviour or doubt that their Padawan respects them. To this end, a Padawan should never place their Master in such a position. A Padawan should always show great respect for their Master, especially publicly and in the presence of others, only speak when properly addressed. A Master’s word during training is law and if a Padawan disagrees with their Master then they should disagree in a respectful and professional manner, and always privately.\n\n# Section 36\nThe Jedi Council is made up of the most experienced Jedi in the Order and as such should be afforded the respect of such a deserving position. While it is not unheard of for a Jedi to disagree with the Jedi Council, all disagreements should be done so respectfully, so as to avoid public hostilities or disrespect to the Masters that occupy the Council chairs. When acting on behalf of the Jedi Council a Jedi represents the highest authority of the Order and should always act as such, showing a degree of professionalism above and beyond that of their peers. Never put the Jedi Council in a position where they must justify or apologize for your actions.\n\n# Section 37\nIn the words of Master Odan-Urr; ‘’it takes many Jedi to undo the mistakes of one.’’ As a Jedi you represent the entirety of the Order and it is your personal responsibility to ensure you behave as such. Your actions, your behaviour and even your personal appearance can shift the opinions of individuals who may or may not have ever seen or met a Jedi, ensure that every time you represent the Jedi Order, you try to make the best impression possible.\n\n# Section 38\nJedi exist to ensure that peace and order exists throughout the galaxy and as such are expected to be a part of that peace and order themselves. May it be the laws of the Jedi Order or the laws put in place by foreign entities, always do your best to obey them and ensure those around you are doing the same. Breaking the law is unbecoming of a Jedi and only serves to harm the image of the Jedi Order and the individual Jedi.\n\n# Section 39\nLife is the most precious entity in the galaxy. Taking a life should never be done so lightly, and defending a life should always be a priority. To take a life only serves to strengthen the dark side and aid those who wish to create chaos, so if a Jedi must take a life, do so sparingly and with as much grace and consideration as possible. Should a life be taken, always meditate on why and make the best possible effort to refrain from doing so again.\n\n# Section 40\nAs a Jedi your duties are to the public, everything and anything you do should be to better the lives of those less fortunate than yourself. Everything from simple charity to defending the defenseless against attack are all actions taken in service to the public. A Jedi’s life is one of servitude and selflessness, as soon as a Jedi understands that they exist to better the lives of others, they will be truly ready to render aid to others.\n\n# Section 41\nHaving a lightsaber and the ability to wield the force does not make someone a Jedi. The ability to put others before yourself, to stand up and admit when something is wrong or unjust and then do something about it, that is what makes somebody a Jedi.\n\n# Section 42\nThe Jedi are sworn defenders of the Galactic Republic due to its desire to uphold democracy and protect its citizens against those who wish to cause harm. A Jedi should always strive to uphold the ideals of democracy, freedom, safety and peace. Even in the Republic’s darkest hours the Jedi should always be there to guide them towards the light.\n\n# Section 43\nEven if the Republic did not exist, the ideals it promotes are still fundamentally required for peace across the galaxy. As a result, in the absence of the Republic a Jedi should still aspire to ensure the galaxy is reminded of its values.\n\n# Section 44\nShould aid be required, regardless of who requests it, a Jedi should always be prepared to offer it. As the life of a Jedi is filled with servitude it is also a life filled with helping others. This can create difficulties when prioritizing aid or offering aid to harmful individuals, regardless of this, a Jedi should always aspire to help no matter who asks for it, so long as the help does not go on to serve an evil agenda.\n\n# Section 45\nSmall gestures of aid can have a significant result, never underestimate just how little or how much your assistance can mean to others. Always take the time to at the very least, offer assistance, even if it is denied.\n\n# Section 46\nUnfortunately there will always be those that seek to harm or take advantage of those less fortunate than themselves. That is where a Jedi strives. Where a Jedi goes peace should always follow. If you see an individual being exploited or attacked, always step in to prevent it. Raising your lightsaber should never be done so lightly, but you have it for a reason, if the situation calls for it, raise your lightsaber as a beacon of hope and safety for those that need it. More often than not you’ll find that your presence alone is enough to protect those that need it and change the lives of those around you.\n\n# Section 47\nNot every situation calls for a Jedi, and not every situation that calls for a Jedi requires them to be the solution to the problem. Sometimes a problem can be solved by others with your assistance. It is okay to take a step back and allow others to complete the job, even if you feel you could do it better. Unfortunately Jedi are not always welcome in certain situations, so always refrain from jumping in and trying to be the solution, as sometimes you may realize you could be the problem.\n\n# Section 48\nThe Jedi Code would undergo many changes during the latter stages of galactic history. Luke Skywalker would be the biggest proponent of this and make numerous changes to the Code during his tenure as Grand Master of the New Jedi Order. Luke Skywalker rebuilt the Jedi Order in a unique way, differing widely from the traditions of the older Jedi Orders. As such he made many edits to the Code and promoted the idea that Jedi study all of them so that they could develop a unique understanding of the galaxy and their duties.\n\n# Section 49\nWhile Odan-Urr’s iteration is considered the default, there is no harm in studying and even following the modern iterations. All Jedi should endeavour to study the unique iterations at least once, as they may have an answer to a question that Odan-Urr’s code did not provide.\n\n# Section 50\nAn iteration of the Jedi Code read at Mara Jade Skywalker’s funeral by Luke Skywalker.\n\nThere is no emotion; there is peace.\nThere is no ignorance; there is knowledge.\nThere is no passion; There is serenity.\nThere is no death; there is only the Force.\nA Jedi does not act for personal power or wealth but seeks knowledge and enlightenment.\nA Jedi never acts from hatred, anger, fear, or aggression but acts when calm and at peace with the Force.\nJedi are the guardians of peace in the galaxy.\nJedi use the powers to defend and to protect, never to attack others.\nJedi respect life, in any form.\nJedi serve others rather than ruling over them, for the good of the galaxy.\nJedi seek to improve themselves through knowledge and training.\n\n# Section 51\nWe can see quite clearly that this iteration of the Jedi Code is far more expansive, taking the majority of Odan-Urr’s original code and expanding upon it with many statements regarding the lifestyle of a Jedi. It is uncertain as to why Luke Skywalker decided to recite this unique iteration at his late wife’s funeral, but as he consistently meditated on the Jedi Code during times of difficulty and strife, perhaps he believed this was the most fitting iteration for the event.\n\n# Section 52\nIn this iteration Luke Skywalker chose to use multiple statements commonly made by members of the Jedi Order throughout galactic history. These lines are less vague than Odan-Urr’s code and serve much more as a statement as to the nature of a Jedi and how a Jedi should act. The lines come directly from the expanded teachings of Odan-Urr. It is possible Luke Skywalker felt these lines should have originally been included in Odan-Urr’s Jedi Code, though we can see Luke Skywalker left the line ‘’There is no chaos, there is harmony’’, out of this iteration. It is not entirely clear as to why he did this.\n\n# Section 53\nA variant of the Jedi Code recited in 32 BBY, unknown author. \n\nJedi are the guardians of peace in the galaxy.\nJedi use their powers to defend and protect, never to attack others.\nJedi respect all life, in any form.\nJedi serve others, rather than rule over them, for the good of the galaxy.\nJedi seek to improve themselves through knowledge and training.\n\n# Section 54\nThis variant of the Jedi Code also appears to be much more of a factual statement as to what a Jedi is, and less of a set of guidelines for a Jedi to meditate on. We do not know who wrote or recited this Code, but it would later be adopted by Luke Skywalker during his attempts to rebuild the Jedi Order after the fall of the Galactic Empire.\n\n# Section 55\nAn edited variant of the original iteration used by Luke Skywalker during his efforts to rebuild the Jedi Order. \n\nJedi are the guardians of peace in the galaxy.\nJedi use their powers to defend and to protect.\nJedi respect all life, in any form.\nJedi serve others rather than ruling over them, for the good of the galaxy.\nJedi seek to improve themselves through knowledge and training.\n\n# Section 56\nThis iteration is only slightly changed, with the line ‘’Jedi use their powers to defend and to protect.’’ being a shortened variant of its predecessor. Why Luke Skywalker decided to make this edit is unknown, and why Luke Skywalker decided to use this variant of the Jedi Code at all is also unknown. As the original variant was written in 32 BBY, we know that Luke Skywalker did not create it himself though deemed it important enough to the recreation of the Jedi Order to study it and include it when teaching the newest generation of Jedi Younglings.\n\n# Section 57\nA unique iteration of the Jedi Code, written and recited by Grand Master Luke Skywalker during his time training Jedi Younglings at the Jedi Praxeum, around 22 ABY.\n\nA Jedi's promise must be the most serious, the deepest of his or her life.\nA Jedi seeks not adventure or excitement, for a Jedi is passive, calm, and at peace.\nA Jedi knows that anger, fear, and aggression lead to the dark side.\nA Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.\nThere is no \"try,\" only \"do.\"\nBelieve and you succeed.\nAbove all else, know that control of the Force comes only from concentration and training.\n\n# Section 58\nThis iteration of the Jedi Code appears to be particularly directed towards Younglings. It provides some of the basic and fundamental lessons that Jedi Grand Master Yoda once taught to Luke Skywalker on Dagobah. Perhaps these are some of the lessons Luke Skywalker believed to be most helpful to him, and as such he may have believed they could be useful to the new generation of Jedi. The Code goes over some of the more serious requirements of Jedi life while also trying to instill a sense of confidence and self-belief in the reader, hence why I believe it is particularly directed towards Younglings, and even contains a version of Grand Master Yoda’s famous line that he once told to Younglings on Coruscant and later Luke Skywalker; ‘’There is no ‘try’, only ’do'.\"\n\n# Section 59\nThe final line, ‘’Above all else, know that control of the Force comes only from concentration and training.’’ is a very basic lesson that a Jedi Knight, Master or even Padawan is unlikely to forget or be unaware of, which further adds to my belief that this Code is primarily used for new arrivals to the Jedi Order.\n\n# Section 60\n\n\n# Section 61\nAfter understanding this case study I hope you realize that the Jedi Code is much more than a set of vague guidelines, but instead a comprehensive set of teachings that touch every aspect of a Jedi’s life. Every Jedi reading this should aspire to represent every aspect of the Jedi Code on a daily basis and even at their darkest and lowest point, look to the Code for guidance, as it will always be able to offer something.\n\n# Section 62\nThe Jedi Code and its various iterations have been meditated upon for thousands of years and even the wisest of Jedi look to it on a daily basis for guidance, despite its many iterations and variations, the Jedi Code always maintains a fundamental basis; work hard, help others, act rationally and always walk the path of least conflict.\n\n","meta":{"index":17,"author":"seko1111","name":"The Jedi Code","release_year":2021}},"Precognition":{"content":"# Introduction\nPrecognition, commonly known as Foresight, was an ability that allowed the user to peek into the future and witness upcoming events.

They could not see color, but they could identify organic beings, even dead, and their alignment with the Force based on their characteristic auras. Most objects appeared translucent to the Miralukans, allowing them to see through the objects, including walls and doors.

Although it had its limitations, individuals could stay in this trance for many days without the need of assistance.# Section 1\nAs mentioned above, Hibernation Trance was capable of masking someone’s lifesigns, appearing dead to most. Anyone using this trance only needed to consume 1/10th of the air a normal sentient would need to survive. The amount of time someone could survive in this trance depended on both the environment and resources available. While Hibernation Trance lowers someone’s breathing by 9/10ths, it does little to change the need for liquids and nutrients to survive. Naturally, locations with more moisture in the air would allow someone using this trance to survive longer, and the opposite would apply in more arid environments.\n\n# Section 2\nAs one would expect, Hibernation Trance would be used in cases where one would wish to feign death or survive for an extended period of time. Many Jedi used this ability to survive close encounters with death or to covertly infiltrate important locations. Individuals such as Cade Skywalker used this ability to survive catastrophic events, in Cade’s case the Massacre of Ossus, where many Jedi of the Legacy Era fell during a last-stand against the newly risen Sith. Others such as Kreia, K’Kruhk, Ikrit, Bela Kiwiiks, and many others have used this technique to feign death or survive for an extended duration of time in the hopes of rescue.\n\n","meta":{"index":24,"author":"RynnKaedon","name":"Hibernation Trance","release_year":2021}},"Force Psychosis":{"content":"# Introduction\nA mass outbreak of a newly discovered disease started spreading shortly after the Second Galactic War. However, this disease was not considered normal; this was a mental disease. Force psychosis affected younger Jedi causing a constant deterioration of one's mental psyche. Victims of Force psychosis would often become paranoid, believing that everyone who did not personally know them was a threat.# Section 1\nWith this mass outbreak, the Jedi Order took many of the initial Jedi to study. Many of these Jedi inflicted with Force psychosis would show signs of advanced Force abilities that other Jedi had never seen before. These abilities were often incredibly powerful and difficult to perform. One of these Jedi, Bazel Warv, had shown the ability to change the density of matter. Powerful Jedi Knights such as Jacen Solo had never seen the Force used this way and could only imagine possessing such an ability.\n\nAlong with these Jedi, others had been inflicted with Force psychosis. It was known to affect every Force-sensitive, and because of this, some Force-sensitives had contracted the disease and lived with it for many years. These Force-sensitives would be called Mind Walkers. Having traveled to a realm of the Force called beyond shadows, their once paranoia was now a strong belief that nothing else in the universe existed except the Force. They had become consumed by the Force; it was all they knew and all they thought real.\n\n# Section 2\nLuke Skywalker and his son Ben Solo would eventually locate what they believed to be the source of the Force psychosis. However, they could not defeat this pure dark side entity by themself. Given that Sith was also Force-sensitive, they thought it wise to call a truce with the Sith and ally for the time being. Luke and the Sith would travel to the Maw, home to the dark side entity named Abeloth.\n\nThis truce would not last, as the Sith would eventually turn on the Jedi and attempt to force Abeloth to do their bidding; despite this, Luke would still defeat Abeloth and stop the disease. After this victory, every Force-sensitive diseased would suddenly find themselves completely cured as if it never happened. Both the Sith and Jedi would stay after their victory to inspect and study Abeloth; during this time, they would realize that the entity had survived and escaped.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Pool of Knowledge was a Force nexus located on Maw within the Force realm; this Pool was said to provide Force visions to those who would bathe in it. Knowing this, Sith High Lord Sarasu Taalon stepped foot into the Pool of Knowledge. However, instead of witnessing visions, the Sith High Lord would begin transforming into an entity reminiscent of Abeloth. To end this quickly, Sith Apprentice Vestara Khai would kill him. Unfortunately for them, this would not kill Abeloth, and the entity could flee again.\n\nSince the Knights were no longer under the effects of Force psychosis, Luke concluded that they did not need to kill Abeloth but rather keep her in a constant state of weakness. This, unfortunately, would be proven wrong, as after Jedi Knights Valin and Jysella Horn's rescue from carbonite, they would once again fall sick to this disease.\n\n\n\nLuke would again engage in another battle with Abeloth, freeing Valin and Jysella from their psychosis. However, as Abeloth regained her strength, she was able to influence the Sith to abandon their tribe and join her.\n\n# Section 4\n\n\n# Section 5\n\n\n# Section 6\n\n\n","meta":{"index":1,"author":"JowsDemici","name":"Force Psychosis","release_year":2023}},"Healing Ritual":{"content":"# Introduction\nUsed by the Voss species, this powerful Force ritual allowed healers in particular to ingest the strengths of those around them to heal patients.

The anti-Force was so powerful that when Waru was stranded in his universe, the only way for him to get back was to destroy the Force that held him as a prisoner.

Despite this, it was very similar to the Force Lightning of the Dark Side, except that Jedi drew their power from determined justice and mostly just stunned their opponents instead of killing them.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Dark or Sith variant of this ability is known as Force Lightning. Another known variant is the Force ability 'Kinetite'.\n\n# Section 3\nIn the Jedi Order, this ability was uncommon and classified as a forbidden Force ability, as it closely resembled the Force Lightning of the Dark Side. However, there were Jedi like Plo Koon who studied this technique. When Plo Koon went on a mission in which a criminal named Dreed Pommel kidnapped and threatened a young girl after killing her entire family, he shot a hand of lightning at his head until he eventually passed out. Plo Koon then reported to the Jedi Council, describing himself as calm and emotion-free during the incident. The council told him to think about whether it was right to use the Force ability, which Plo Koon said it was.

In comparison to its darker counterpart, this side of the force encompassed devotion to the Force. The light side was aligned with honesty, compassion, selflessness, self-knowledge and enlightenment, healing, benevolence, mercy, and self-sacrifice.# Section 1\nFollowers of the light side cast out Kreia because she advocated for the person rather than their beliefs about the Force. She saw any sort of submission to the Force as betraying oneself, so she criticized those who followed the light side for letting themselves die under the so-called protection of the Force. The main advocates for the light side were the Jedi who attempted to destroy their enemies, the Sith. As advocates for the dark side, the Sith were seen as those who used their emotions to guide them. Which took over any wielder and allowed them to achieve unnatural power, as well as having accessibility to immortality more quickly.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Jedi fought for balance amongst all wielders of the Force in hopes that there would be peace. With experience, the light side of the Force opened up many doors for anyone considered to be Force-sensitive. While the Jedi sought out balance and peace, the Sith used their connection with the Force to take over the galaxy. To achieve harmony with the Force, its practitioners would often meditate to clear their minds of emotion. Thus ridding themselves of any negative emotions such as aggression, anger, and hatred. Since Ashla was another name for the Force in itself, it was thought to reference that the light side was the normal nature of the Force.\n\n# Section 3\nIn contrast to the dark side, the light side was known to be harder to learn and adapt to. An example would be with combat since dark side powers were aggressive and easily fueled with anger and/or hatred. This allowed dark side users to progress and grow much faster than light side users. However, the light siders ended up being more powerful than the dark siders. Light side Force abilities were all defensive, passive, and/or utility-focused. Although there were a few light side abilities that allowed one to increase their strength or incapacitate an enemy… only a few of them were actually destructive.\n\n","meta":{"index":27,"author":"ElysiaLValkyrie","name":"Light Side of the Force","release_year":2021}},"Black Current of the Force":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Force is balanced; it is equal.

There was another section of the Force, the White Flare of the Force, which was the opposite of the Black Current and was also balanced. The Black Current could defy gravity and cause anything to anchor itself against gravity. It had the ability to conceal the appearances and emotions of beings either entirely or partially. It could trick the minds of sentient and humanoid beings with the Force. And by connecting a mind to the Black Current, it could manipulate the memory and intent of the being to the user’s choice.

Through Living Force, it was made possible for the phenomenon of Force Ghosts. During the Clone Wars, Qui-Gon-Jinn explained how he was able to appear in front of Yoda as a Force Ghost. He was able to do this because the Living Force directly fed into the Cosmic Force through the midi-chlorians.# Section 1\nIn 18 BBY, Darth Vader was consumed by the power of the Cosmic Force when he poured bota into the chest plate of his armor. Some time passed and Jedi Jax Pavan was introduced to Chan Dash by his friend Den Dhur. During this encounter, he felt a surge of Force power running through him. Because of this, he was able to experience a metaphysical vision of the entire galactic whirlpool and felt some sort of connection to it. After the experience, he realized that the Force had granted him a gift, which was a connection to the great unifying force that many Jedi Masters referred to as the Cosmic Force.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring a meeting with some officers aboard the first Death Star in 0 BBY, Vader came to the conclusion that the Cosmic Force’s capabilities outweighed even that of the Death Star. He came to this conclusion after Admiral Conan Antonio Motti claimed that the Death Star was indestructible, thus implying that they could use it for defense.

Users of this ability were able to create defensive spheres around their bodies. It was described as a shimmering blue ball of energy. This so-called ball of energy could protect the user from a diverse range of attacks such as laser blasts, lightsabers, and vacuums. The sphere was also able to inflict small amounts of damage upon the enemy. However, protection bubbles could also be used offensively. It was possible that if surrounding an enemy, the attacker would then become victim to their own attack. Due to the amount of concentration needed to sustain the bubble, the user would need to temporarily immobilize themselves to form it and possibly even sustain it.# Section 1\nDarth Bane and his former trainer, Kas’im, had been dueling on Lehon after Bane left the Brotherhood of Darkness. Because of his leave from the brotherhood, Kas’im was sent to kill him. Bane was able to overpower Kas’im until he switched to using Jar’Kai. He lost his ground but was able to get himself up and out of the Temple of Ancients. Once he got out of the temple he let out a massive shockwave in hopes that he would hit Kas’im in the process. However, Kas’im used a protection bubble to avoid the shockwave, but his attempts were futile as the temple came crashing down which resulted in his death. Some time passed and Jedi Master Worror used a protection bubble to subdue Darth Bane during the final moments of their duel on Tython. Which trapped both him and Bane within the confines of the bubble. He did this in an attempt to protect Johun Othone from Bane’s Force lightning. The lightning was not able to penetrate the bubble but ended up killing Worror and electrocuting Darth Bane.\n\n# Section 2\nMother Talzin, who was a Dathomirian Nightsister, utilized a version of the protection bubble during the Battle of Dathomir. The shield deflected blaster fire from enemy battle droids and was used alongside Force lightning. Later on, Cin Drallig used the protection bubble to protect himself while he healed during his duel with Darth Vader. Tash Arranda also used this power as she was holding back opposing forces on Enzeen. Some time passed and she used the bubble to protect herself from Spore. However, she was untrained so her bubble only lasted a few seconds before it would collapse. \n\nSith Lord Azard was skilled in using this technique, and he showed that when he protected himself from an explosion and fall after his duel with the Imperial Knight Treis Sinde. Sinde had also used a protection bubble when he assisted Mon Calamari refugees on Dac.

Users were shielded from dark side powers and could completely sever opponents from the dark side thanks to the ability to bathe them in light side energies. This ability was used by Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa Solo, and the unborn Anakin Solo to remove the revived Emperor Palpatine from the dark side, forcing the Force storm he had summoned to spin out of control and consume him.# Section 1\nA group of willing Force users could manifest the strength of the light side through the use of the Force ability known as \"Force harmony,\" which is found in the families Control, Sense, and Alter. Once activated, it bathed the users in light-side illumination and served as a defense against dark-side powers. Even though the person who started the technique felt slightly strained, the power could be maintained almost indefinitely. The users would be bonded together by the Force in all its ferocity for the duration that the ability was in use. They would receive a complete understanding of the Force as the light side's energies flowed through them in waves.\n\n# Section 2\nOnly as many other Force users as their Force energy would allow the initiator to connect to the chain. The power could not eliminate the dark side, but it could divert its users' attention, make it more difficult for them to carry out their tasks, and in some cases, completely cut them off from the dark side. By enveloping the users of dark side powers in waves of light side energy, Force harmony could also stop them from using those powers. Force storm and other naturally difficult-to-control powers were particularly vulnerable to this interference.\n\n# Section 3\nThe chain's users' proximity to one another, their Force power, and their blood affinity were all variables that could influence how strong this ability was. The initiator needed to be skilled in telepathy and life sense to begin the Force harmony. A group of Force users in a Force harmony chain could use the transfer of light-side Force energy to relatively strong Derriphans, creatures of the dark side, to defeat them.\n\n# Section 4\nLuke Skywalker was converted to the dark side by Emperor Palpatine after his resurrection as a clone in the year 10 ABY, and he later served as his apprentice. Leia Organa Solo, Skywalker's identical sister, went to Palpatine's flagship, the Eclipse, and brought her brother back to the good side.\n\n# Section 5\nWhen Palpatine summoned a Force storm at Pinnacle Base that was so destructive it destroyed the New Republic fleet, Skywalker, and Organa Solo combined their Force energies to envelop Palpatine in a wave of light side energy. The twins easily cut Palpatine off from the dark side, causing him to lose control of his storm, helped by their closeness as twins and the power of Organa Solo's unborn third child. Palpatine and the Eclipse were both destroyed by the storm, but not before Skywalker and Organa Solo managed to escape the doomed ship unharmed.\n\n# Section 6\nForce harmony could be started by Old Jedi Order Jedi Knights and Masters like Ood Bnar, Arca Jeth, Thon, Vima-Da-Boda, Taj Junak, and Yoda. The ancient Sith Lord Freedon Nadd, a master of both Jedi and Sith skills, could also perform Force harmony. Also known to have the ability were top-tier members of the Emperor's Shadow Guard under the command of Inquisitor Valin Draco.\n\n# Section 7\nThe Tedryn Holocron was the source of Leia Organa Solo's initial knowledge of the skill. Bodo Baas, the holocron's gatekeeper, informed her of a prophecy about Skywalker and Organa Solo defeating Palpatine that was told to him by his Master almost a thousand years ago. Facing Palpatine on the Eclipse, Organa Solo grasped the significance of the prophecy and fused her Force energy with Skywalkers. He joined his sister after realizing that the only effective defense against Palpatine's dark side energies was pure light.

However, a trained Force-sensitive could defend themselves against this technique by using Force sight. Even so, if a Jedi was able to blind an unexpecting enemy before they used Force sight, the blind could still be effective.

The major techniques of Alter were telekinesis (Force push and pull), affect mind (controlling weak-minded individuals), and Alter Environment (manipulation of natural phenomena like lightning and whirlwinds).","meta":{"index":71,"author":"Galaxy_Magma","name":"Force Alter","release_year":2021}},"Psychometry":{"content":"# Introduction\nAlso known as telemetry, postcognition, and tai vordrax, psychometry is a mental Force power of extracting traces of information and the events that surround an object via physical contact with it. Doing so allows the user to view these events as if they were there, through the senses and the emotions that the object’s owner experienced at that time. This Force ability is easier to use on personal belongings that saw frequent use, though in turn objects that were only used once or used by several people are harder to use psychometry on, albeit not impossible. Psychometry is mainly useful for tracking as it serves no real purpose in combat, but it can sometimes fail to provide any information that can be deemed useful. However, the Sith could use this Force power on living things, to invasively “rip” memories away from others.# Section 1\nPsychometry can possibly taint its user if the object being analyzed has experienced actions tied to the Dark Side with strong negative emotions, including murder or other serious acts of violence. Because of this possibility, the Jedi Council strongly recommended that psychometry should never be used on corpses, no matter how they have died. The emotions that living beings feel before their deaths are so intense and powerful that trying to extract anything from these experiences can put a Jedi in great danger.\n\nDuring the Invasion of Naboo, the Jedi Council looked down upon superfluous usage of psychometry due to the possibility for the user to experience an intense amount of emotion, which can bring them dangerously closer to the Dark Side of the Force. Also, excessive usage can cause the user’s consciousness to become “trapped,” and in even rarer cases can cause the death of the user. However, these scenarios tend to be rare and occur only in extreme cases.\n\n# Section 2\nAround 1 of every 100 Kiffar, a race hailing from Kiffu that are similar to humans were able to use psychometry, with their Vos lineage having a substantial amount of these psychometrics. Most Kiffar who had access to this ability chose to become Kiffu Guardians. Jedi Master Quinlan Vos was a frequent user of psychometry and was known as the most skilled Kiffar psychometric during his lifetime.\n\nWhen he was a young man, Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker had psychometric abilities, but to an unrefined extent. However, upon visiting the Valley of the Spirits, his untrained psychometry picked up on the massacre that occurred at the location back during the Clone Wars. He was able to discern some of the scenes from this massacre as well as identify where Shmi Skywalker, his paternal grandmother, died. This experience disturbed Luke to the point that he called it “worse than a nightmare.” Years later, Luke Skywalker would use psychometry again, in a more helpful manner. When Han Solo kidnapped Leia Organa in an attempt to win her over romantically, Luke was able to track Han’s emotions like a hunter picking up an animal’s scent, which led him to Han Solo’s location: a casino where he had won the deed to the planet Dathomir in a game of sabacc against the Drackmaran warlord Omogg.\n\n","meta":{"index":26,"author":"JaccPrice","name":"Psychometry","release_year":2021}},"Force Speed":{"content":"# Introduction\nForce Speed was a common Force ability that allowed the user to enhance their physical speed and caused them to see events in slow motion. It also enabled users to dodge attacks more easily with faster and more exact counterattacks. In some cases, it even led to the ability to run on vertical surfaces for a while. If a Force-user was skilled enough, they could practically vanish from their previous position. However, Force Speed drained a force user’s energy and metabolism, which means it required a longer recovery period. Force Speed falls under the control aspect of the Force and was a skill taught to Jedi Initiates. Force Speed was known by a lot of different names, such as “Force run”, “Force dash”, and “Surge”.# Section 1\nForce Speed was widely used by both Jedi and Sith. It gave the user the ability to amplify their muscles and run at very high speeds. Notable users include Sith Lords Kaox Krul, and Darth Sidious, as well as Master Relin Druur. Druur had such control over his ability that he was able to sprint 100 meters in one second. Qui-Gon Jinn and his padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi employed Force Speed to escape from Trade Federation droidekas. During the Clone Wars, many Jedi employed Force Speed on the battlefield, most notably Mace Windu, who used it during the Battle of Dantooine.\n\n# Section 2\nJedi had the ability to enhance their combat abilities with the use of Force Speed. It increased the speed of their reflexes, blocks, and attacks. Grand Master Luke Skywalker was a proficient user of Force Speed, frequently employing it during lightsaber duels. He experienced the slow-motion effect while facing Guri, an assassin droid. It seemed as though time slowed down, which gave Luke the ability to dodge the droid's attacks without much effort.\n\n","meta":{"index":46,"author":"Galaxy_Magma","name":"Force Speed","release_year":2021}},"The Nature of Virtue":{"content":"# Introduction\nYour understanding of Jedi philosophy thus far has probably consisted of the Jedi Code, the three pillars from which the Jedi draw strength, and the laws of the order, all of which are taught in the academy. These are some elements of group structure and Jedi lore, but they do not address manners of behavior or the core values of our community. The Jedi Order has officially recognized a series of values that detail the intricacies of Jedi philosophy and how it applies to the Jedi Order as a ROBLOX community. They present a standard of behavior and a belief system that plants the seed to produce the absolute best Knights through our progression system. This study has been written to dive deeper into your understanding of the Mystics’ approach to Jedi philosophy.# Section 1\nOutlined as the most sincere elements of this philosophy are the Jedi Virtues. These virtues offer the Jedi a level of reasoning that leads them to concentrate their minds on what is within their control. This is one of the core attributes of the Jedi and one of the most important for progression: Self-Control. Discipline is one of the Three Pillars of the Jedi, and a significant majority of the practice of discipline lies in the efforts of self-control. A Jedi will face many trials and obstacles in their journey, but one thing they always maintain control of is their own mindfulness. In this state of mindfulness, for which we utilize meditation to assist us, a Jedi finds serenity in making reasonable decisions. A Jedi who sought to free themselves from all disturbances and pursue virtue has found mindfulness.\n\n\n\tTo find the aforementioned reason, one must be committed to the Jedi Order and the practices of meditation, which clear one’s mind. However, this understanding of oneself and this understanding of the environment must be in the present. To practice the ways of the Jedi, one must commit themselves to the Jedi Order. However, in lore, it is a lifelong endeavor that outlines one of the next core virtues: Commitment. A fool believes the last Jedi trials are at the rank of knight; the Jedi’s trials are never-ending. The difficulties arise at random; they evolve, and so must the Jedi. And it is this lifelong endeavor that brings on one of the other important virtues, Patience. A Jedi must not pursue the quickest path to knighthood, the quickest path to success, or the quickest path to victory. It is through patience and the Force that the Jedi transcend.\n\n# Section 2\nIntertwined with the living Force lie some of the most important Jedi virtues that Jedi Masters pursue to amplify their connection with the Force. Beginning at a young age, Jedi are taught one of the most simple yet challenging virtues to adhere to: inner Peace. Developing inner peace takes practice and hours upon hours of meditation every day. Acting on your emotions will spark the darkness inside you. It throws the Jedi's soul into chaos, making them vulnerable to the dark side of the Force. Outbursts of emotion must be withheld, as they are taboos for the virtues. These outbursts breathe life into the temptation to act out in fear and anger, thus suffering.\n\nFinding inner peace helps the Jedi find reason and logic to act on what’s important: the here and now. It allows the Jedi to make good judgments, which in turn helps Wisdom, arguably the most important virtue, establish itself in the Jedi. It is the combination of one’s experience, virtuous behavior, ability to build a general sense of knowledge, and ability to make good decisions that make up the building blocks of Wisdom. However, all these things have no meaning unless they are applied to the day-to-day life of a Jedi. Before wisdom is even considered the pursuit of a Jedi, they must adhere to the associated virtue of Passivity. A Jedi’s soul must be steady, orderly, and completely virtuous; it mustn’t be influenced by the concerns of others. In defending our values and those who cannot defend themselves, the Jedi may make the first strike. This wouldn’t be the vice of aggression, but it would be active defense, as long as the strike is made out of compassion for others and not hatred. There are very few emotions to act on, but one of them would be compassion.\n\n# Section 3\nOur audience must be vast, so to reach the maximum number of people, it is important we practice the virtue of Benevolence. As Jedi, we represent the Jedi Order in its wholeness, and in doing so, we must practice compassion for those throughout the community and amongst ourselves. Kindness is an action as much as it is an aspect of our emotions. Acts of kindness present our intentions clearly, allowing proper representation of the Jedi Order. The importance of this virtue is equivalent to its practice within the Jedi Order. Joy is a similar virtue but pertains to employing humor to establish a certain camaraderie among fellow Jedi and help them relate to one another. Witty humor is an element to assist in teaching younglings, used by the wisest Jedi masters as they understand children respond well to a certain lightheartedness amongst the seriousness of Jedi religious practitioners.\n\n\n\tTo be fully virtuous, you must continuously make choices day-to-day honorific to these virtues, but it cannot be expected immediately of all Jedi. You must be open to bettering yourself, recognizing any choices you make that go against these virtues, and learning from your mistakes. It is the ongoing trial of knighthood. It is in practicing these virtues that the lifelong trial of a Jedi begins. However, sometimes individuals fall into the temptation of their emotions and commit serious taboos known as vices. Those who purposefully go against these virtues, defying the Jedi Code with intent, would be immoral and could be considered outright vicious, committing vices repeatedly and on purpose. This would describe a dark Jedi, a Jedi significantly corrupted by dark side tendencies. That is when they must be reminded of the Jedi virtues and where they’ve gone wrong.\n\n# Section 4\nIn essence, an act of virtue is an act of love for oneself and the values of the Jedi. To love oneself means one can put mindfulness on the world around them rather than concern themselves with their own interests and ambitions. This \"love\" is not the attachment and selfish kind of love, but unconditional love to the people they protect—to their civilization, their community, and their order. These values are essential to attunement with the Force, and they provide the foundation of thought for the Jedi Order.\n\n","meta":{"index":47,"author":"SlateStatic","name":"The Nature of Virtue","release_year":2021}},"Altus sopor":{"content":"# Introduction\nAltus sopor is an old school name for one's ability to boost their focus in wielding the Force.

The developments of these skills would continue throughout a Jedi’s life and served as the foundation for later abilities.","meta":{"index":68,"author":"Galaxy_Magma","name":"Force Control Abilities","release_year":2021}},"Living Force":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Living Force is a fundamental energy that permeated the galaxy and powered all life. This force worked in tandem with the Cosmic Force to create the Force, which was a field of energy that kept the galaxy together. This was the duality and unity of forces that maintained harmony between fundamental aspects of life, and the Living Force was a symbiotic aspect of the Force that fed off of the Cosmic Force. The Cosmic Force connected itself to the Living Force through midi-chlorians, which were organelles within cells that fed off the life forms they lived in, and granted them the ability to connect with the Force, and in some cases even manipulate it advantageously. Once an organism died, it would be turned to the Cosmic Force, completing the cycle of the Force.# Section 1\nEach being also possessed its own life-essence, but certain people who were sensitive to the Force interpreted the field differently than anyone else, or other Force-sensitives. While certain life forms such as the Jedi utilized their gift from the midi-chlorians to aid others, the Sith pursued personal power and often rebelled against the natural order of the Force in favor of creating imbalance for their own power. Anakin Skywalker was an important figure in the Force as well, due to him being born as the Chosen One or the prophesied being who would bring balance to the Force. Anakin did this by killing Darth Sidious while under his rule as Darth Vader, after he had been misinformed and manipulated by the Sith. This action brought balance to the Force after a time when there had been little balance.\n\n# Section 2\nAll beings were given at least some amount of Midi-Chlorians in every cell in their body, which lived within the host symbiotically. These formed the foundation of all life in the galaxy and allowed beings to perceive an interconnected tapestry of life after death, which fell into a tunnel that led into the Cosmic Force. Thus after death, a being’s energy was transferred from the Living Force to the Cosmic Force, continuing the cycle of life and death. However, if a being fully learned to accept oneself with all flaws, and become emotionless, content, and humble, as well as rejecting the dark side of the Force while knowing it is still a part of them, they could transfer their consciousness into the real world as part of the Living Force, thus granting them immortality, usually as a Force Ghost.\n\n","meta":{"index":28,"author":"WhoopeyNight","name":"Living Force","release_year":2021}},"The Jedi Mantra":{"content":"# Introduction\nEmotion, yet peace.

It usually looks like green energy that comes out of the hands of the users who use it and have the power. A difference between the force and magick is, that the force is used by the Jedi to bring peace and freedom to the galaxy, however, magick was a manipulative ability that stemmed from selfishness.\n\n# Section 2\nThe most famous person who used this power was named Mother Talzin, who was a Nightsister. She was able to heal people, such as Asajj Ventress. She was so powerful she could transform Savage Opress into a monster, making him have huge strength agility, and skill. She was able to use voodoo along with her magick and it allowed her to torture anyone and send messages to them. \n\nThere was another really powerful person who could use magick, they were referred to as ‘Old Daka’ She was able to resurrect people from the dead, it may not bring them to their normal selves but she brought them back as zombies.\n\n# Section 3\nMagick was used to create invisibility potions, create shields, create illusions, and be able to create teleportation.

He felt a sense of euphoria from the Force that he had never felt before. Thus allowing him to see into the most secret part of the Citizens’ Resistance leader's heart. Skywalker soon discovered that he could not just manipulate objects, but beings as well. He told Joylin that he had let Romin’s dictator, Teda escape. However, to Skywalker’s surprise, Joylin had her own plans to help Teda escape. She had planned to help him leave the planet with the galactic criminal Jenna Zan Arbor alongside him. Skywalker then raced to the landing platform to prevent their escape. Some time passed and Jedi Master Mace Windu congratulated him for alerting them of this new information.\n\n# Section 2\nMaster Windu assigned Skywalker a new mission at the Senate Building. While they were there Windu noticed Skywalker’s connection with the Force that had gone beyond objects and towards the inner workings of beings. Skywalker’s Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, realized this as well and wondered about Windu’s recognition of it. Since he had only been on Romin with them for a short time during the end of their mission. Later on, Skywalker witnessed Palpatine’s impressive political maneuvering of beings at his will. He suddenly realized that Palpatine had done what he did back on Romin. The strong surge of power made Skywalker come to the realization that the Force could allow him to see into motivations and consequences, including the Supreme Chancellors. Palpatine was not a Jedi, but he somehow was able to think steps ahead of his opponents while perceiving motivations and outcomes.\n\n# Section 3\nIn 23 BBY, during a mission on Korriban, Skywalker faced the reality that feelings of jealousy and needing to win could cloud one’s heart and mind. Which would effectively numb and possibly nullify the Force-sensitives’ capacity to use Force empathy. It was Force empathy that allowed him to locate his mother Shmi on Tatooine. However, the whole journey was filled with pain as he sensed the agony that his mother was feeling. He soon arrived at a Tusken camp where she had been tortured to death.\n\n# Section 4\nMaster Yoda showed signs of Force empathy during the First Battle of Geonosis when he was able to sense the tension between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. The argument between them was because of Padme Amidala’s unfortunate fall from a LAAT gunship. Soon after Master Yoda decided to intervene in hopes of lessening the tension.

These disciplines appeared superficially different, but their underlying principles were the same.\n\n# Section 2\nTo enhance their inherent Force abilities, practitioners of totem magic occasionally used Force artifacts.

The Nightsisters honored these two siblings as the Twin Deities, but the Father was also adored in various religions.# Section 1\nMore than a million years before the Clone Wars, the Celestials lived in the galaxy, beings capable of massively reshaping space. Thuruht, the oldest of the Killik hives, states that \"the Ones are what the Celestials become.\" According to Thuruht, the Ones coalesced out of a geyser on an unknown tropical planet. The Ones initially lived in peace and harmony in their home near the site of the geyser. However, the Son and Daughter eventually disobeyed the Father's orders not to drink from the Font of Power or bathe in the Pool of Knowledge, respectively. This resulted in the siblings channeling the essence of the dark and light sides of the Force, leading to them fighting each other for millennia while the Father kept the balance.\n\n# Section 2\nA few thousand years ago, a young woman arrived on the planet by unknown means and became the Servant to The Ones. She eventually became the Mother, managing to persuade the Son to use his destructive nature for a constructive purpose. However, as she grew old and was no longer able to keep the peace between the siblings, the Ones resumed their fighting. As a result, the Mother snuck a drink from the Font and bathed in the Pool, transforming into Abeloth, the Bringer of Chaos. She attacked both the Son and Daughter, forcing them to bow down to her. The Father eventually saved his children and left the planet, stranding Abeloth behind.\n\nThe Daughter and Son later enlisted the help of the Killiks, joining their hive mind and lending them their power in the Force. Together, they created Centerpoint Station, Sinkhole Station, and other devices to imprison Abeloth. The Father moved his family to Mortis to keep the Force in balance, but Abeloth managed to escape periodically for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Ones encountered Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who were brought to Mortis by the Father to verify if Skywalker was the foretold Chosen One. After successfully doing so, the Son used the opportunity and attempted to kill his father with the Dagger of Mortis, the only device capable of slaying the Ones. The Daughter, however, sacrificed herself to save her father, causing the balance of the Force to come undone.

It was most often used to move objects. The user then had to track the object in the Force field, imagine what exactly he wanted to do, and then summon the Force to do it. For this to work, the user had to be confident in himself and his abilities, not feel any doubts and not let anything distract him. Beginner users of the Force usually had to close their eyes to establish the necessary bond with the Force to perform this technique, but as they trained and gained experience, they did not have to do so. Moreover, telekinesis was also able to absorb attacks of any kind. The power of a given Force user was usually determined on the basis of his telekinetic skills - the stronger he was, the larger the object he could carry and use telekinesis in a more advanced manner.# Section 1\nThey were few ways to use telekinesis, some of them were as follows:\n\nMoving an object\nTelekinetic abilities, the power to use, required commitment, by extending their feelings through the power to take over the object spiritually. By exerting one’s willpower on him, one could move him at will.\n\nForce Pull and Push\nTelekinetic abilities to use the power that could have caused the material body to approach. The more someone was trained to use this ability, he was able to move heavier and heavier objects. In combat, this ability could be used to snatch a weapon from an opponent’s hand, throw him from a balcony, or pull him to hit him at close range. On the other hand he could use the Force to push the opponent against something or an object towards him.\n\nForce injuring\nThis ability allowed the user to press the opponent’s organs or body telekinetically. If he did not resist, it was possible to crush the victim’s heart or respiratory tract, numb them and inflict significant organ damage. This would have caused the victim unbelievable pain and suffering and even killed him. \n\nForce Strangling\nIt is one of the abilities commonly used by the Dark Jedi and the Sith to clamp the victim’s larynx, thereby disrupting the air supply to the lungs.

It was what gave Sith, Jedi, Dark Jedi, Grey Jedi, and many other Force-sensitives strength and built their belief system. Sometimes, the Force was viewed as a deity and was believed to have an intelligent mind of its own. The Force had many forms, there was the Cosmic Force, the Living Force, the Physical Force, and the Unifying Force. All of these were different views of the Force and contained different morals behind its use. These forms bind life itself together and could flow through beings differently. The Living Force was the Force that flow through living things, the Cosmic Force was life after death, the Physical Force was what surrounded all physical matter, and the Unifying Force dealt with space and time. \n\nThe Force in general was abstract and could be manifested by those strong with it but the Force was divided. The Force could withdraw energy from the user’s emotions. There were two main areas of the Force, however. There was the Light Side and the Dark Side. The Light Side was studied and used within the Jedi Order whilst the Dark Side was used by the Sith. Each had its own unique abilities and could be dangerous, especially the Dark Side of the Force. Both needed each other for balance. The Force did not support one side, it was neutral and balanced. Although, many Sith believed that the Dark Side was more powerful than the Light, however the temptation of the Dark Side was where this belief stemmed from, both sides were equally as powerful depending on the user. However, not everyone could use the Force, only those who were deemed Force-sensitive could. Sometimes, the Force flowed through beings who had a high count of midi-chlorians, a microorganism within the blood, stronger and made them more sensitive. However, a few Force-sensitives could tap into the Force and use its abilities for stamina, agility, skill and to shape the world around them. It was referred to as Force aura. The Force dates back to roughly 36,453 BBY, where scholars and scientists all gathered on Tython, a planet powerful in the Light Side of the Force, and discovered the Force from mysterious knowledge, and research about the topic.# Section 1\nThe Light Side of the Force was the Force used for good intentions, such as healing, good morals, and benevolence. The Light Side of the Force was studied mainly within the Jedi Order and gave the Jedi strength and discipline. It was a powerful philosophy and shaped many different beings. Those who followed the Light Side desired a peaceful and harmonious galaxy where people acted out of logic and wisdom rather than anger and fear. Most people who followed the Light Side would often meditate so they could prevent themselves from succumbing to the treachery of the Dark Side. Meditation often cleared the minds and would rid any negative emotions that led to the Dark Side, such as fear and hatred. It was often recommended or rather assumed that those who studied and followed the Light Side would have to rid all emotions including love and passion so that if a loved one was ever in peril and it came between saving them or a larger group of people, the Light Side would always save as many people as possible. This was seen differently by different Light Side users and some could control their passion and emotions so they could use them to harness the Force. However, the Jedi Order generally forbids any and all emotions of a Jedi so it wouldn’t get in the way of their main goals, creating a peaceful and harmonious society. They acted selfless and followed the sacred Jedi Code on behalf of the will of the Force. The Dark Side of the Force was forbidden in the Jedi Order, there were immensely rare times where a Jedi could use the Dark Side and there were very few abilities that were allowed.\n\n The traditional Jedi tried to eliminate the Sith to bring “balance” to the Force and restoring it for the Dark Side was corrupt and the only way to rid the Dark Side was to rid the Sith. The Jedi denied the temptations of the Dark Side as well, they only had positive emotions like courage and empathy. The Jedi tried to refrain from having passions and romantic relationships for they believed it could lead to fear and anger, which was how Anakin Skywalker succumbed to the Dark Side. Even the Sith frowned upon romance because it would get in the way of their true goal; galactic domination. For over twenty-five thousand years the Jedi tried to keep the same philosophy and policies within the Order, but after the Great Jedi Purge and the downfall of the Galactic Empire, Luke Skywalker’s New Jedi Order disregarded most of the old Jedi ways and allowed marriage within the Order along with the use of the Dark Side from time to time. However, they were also mindful and were taught to control these emotions in case of an improbable emergency.\n\n# Section 2\nFollowers of the Dark Side were usually Dark Jedi or Sith. The Dark Side required one to unleash their anger, fear, selfishness, hatred, and passion to enhance their abilities. Unlike the Light Side, the Dark Side was tempting and its users were self-motivated, they usually desired power and domination. Their philosophy was to kill any and all opponents, even if they were on the same side. If they viewed something as a threat, they would destroy it. The Dark Side was viewed as an extremely addictive ability and could drive people insane. The Sith strived to learn and use the Dark Side. They were the main followers. They didn’t approve of weakness and they believed that only the strong survived, so they desired strength and power. However, a lot of Sith also desired eternal life and went on deadly conquests to find a cure for mortality. Although the Sith were selfish, throughout history they were seen working together and serving under the Dark Lord of the Sith. The Sith desired the destruction of the Jedi as much as the Jedi desired the destruction of the Sith. They went into countless wars with the Republic and the Jedi to ascert their dominance. \n\nThe Sith would kill other Sith for power and rank status. An ancient Sith ritual known as the Kaggath was a competition between two Sith and their allies that involved battling each other for one’s rank. An example of this was the Kaggath of Ludo Kressh and Naga Sadow, powerful Dark Lords of the Sith who desired to lead the Sith Order. The Sith Order eventually died out and the last surviving Sith, Darth Bane, started a new legacy where there could only be two Sith a Master to embody the power and an Apprentice to embrace it. The Sith used the Force for their own will, they used it for power and greed. Though they were strong with the Force, they lacked teamwork and were destroyed because of it. Some Sith were more skilled in the Force than others and managed to survive, such as Darth Bane.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Jedi and Sith weren’t the only people who believed in the Force. There were many tribes and religions who embraced the Force and had different views of it, many of them also made sacrifices and had traditions put in place. A lot of these followers had some unique relationship with the Force, like the Baran Do, who were Force-sensitive Kel Dors that embraced the Force. The legendary Jedi Master Plo Koon lived amongst the Baran Do before joining the Jedi. People known as the Aing-Tii had a special and different view on the Force, they believed the Force could manifest itself to help a being unlock their full potential. The Aing-Tii did not believe in the Light or Dark Side, there was no good, nor evil among them. The Aing-Tii viewed the Force as a much larger entity and they viewed themselves as small compared to the Force. Another belief, which was developed during the time of the Old Republic, was the Paradox. The Paradox was a belief founded by the heroes of their factions; Darth Marr and Grand Master Satele Shan. When the two went into exile, they developed a different view of the Force and believed that the Force had its own will along with other possessive traits but required one to command it. The Celestials known as the Ones were a belief amongst the Killik people and were balanced, with the daughter representing the Light, the son as the Dark, and the Father as the center. The Ones were all killed during the Clone Wars without the Killiks people knowing of it.\n\n# Section 4\nForce-users use their emotions, willpower, and thoughts when they are utilizing the Force. They act out on thoughts and manifest many kinds of Force abilities. Force-users could enhance their physical powers as well and use mind abilities such as telekinesis and telepathy. These physical enhancements could also allow Force-users to defy gravity and weight, allowing them to achieve unnatural speed and perform drastic flips. This gave most Force-users unique acrobatic abilities. Their health, stamina, and endurance were also naturally enhanced and could last longer than normal beings. Some more Force abilities stem from one’s will. A person who has a weak mind and a weak will could succumb to Force mind tricks. Some Force-users could foresee the future and predict their opponent’s next moves in combat if they were strong enough. Strong Force-users could also absorb the Force and use it for the world around them or transfer their consciousness into another body allowing them to live longer. These were mostly used by Dark Side acolytes. More unnatural absorbing abilities consisted of draining the Force of a single life form or an entire planet, as Darth Nihilus and the Jedi Exile had done. These were generally performed by wounds in the Force. The Force was very important in a Jedi’s usage of the lightsaber since it could heighten their reactions and prevent them from suffering potential injuries. The Force also came into play when constructing a lightsaber or in combat where Jedi could deflect incoming blaster bolts. Force-users also needed to rest otherwise their Force powers would weaken. Emotions were also vital when using the Force since they could allow users to perform special abilities based on their emotions. However, if a Light Side-user relied on hatred or a Dark Side-user relied on peace, it could weaken their Force powers. This was how most Jedi transitioned to the Sith and vice versa.\n\n","meta":{"index":60,"author":"jinqxd","name":"The Force","release_year":2021}},"Pelekotan":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Korunnai people of Harrun Kal used the word Pelekotan to describe the Force. The Korunnai people were relatively Force-sensitive and, in their language, Pelekotan translated to “Jungle Mind”. Pelekotan was the spiritual power and focus of the Korunnai people and was the equivalent of the Light Side for the Jedi. The history of how the term Pelekotan originated is unknown, however, in Korunnai history there is an important figure named the Lor Pelek. Lor Pelek were people who held great power and were hazardous, they were also shamans who embodied the Pelekotan. The shamans tended to be great warriors and were skilled in the arts of healing.\n\n The great Jedi Master Mace Windu encountered a Lor Pelek and noted that the shaman possessed unseen abilities that he developed through living in the jungle. One of the most shocking abilities Windu saw was that the shaman could remove brain and nerve parasites and unite them with the Force. The Pelekotan was the Korunnai people’s main source of survival, and they used it to survive on their harsh planet to preserve the history of their tribes and herds. Just like the Force, Pelekotan was said to be a mystical and abstract ability that roamed the darkness of their environment, it was believed that it stemmed from the jungles. Surviving the perils of the jungle would sometimes require a brawl with those who use it.

Other meditation chambers were used amongst Sith like Visas Marr and Count Dooku, who used these chambers to gain power and in Visas Marr’s case, compassion. Dooku had one aboard his ship as well and had a secret trap door in that room. Former Jedi Master Atris had a meditation chamber of her own, however, she used it to store her collection of Sith Holocrons. During the Clone Wars, Darth Sidious had a mediation chamber on the planet Coruscant, where he hid it from the entire galaxy. The most commonly known one is Darth Vader’s. Darth Vader had several meditation chambers that were unique, it could allow him to breathe without his body suit. They had mechanical claws that could remove his suit and the oxygen was special since it allowed him to breathe without the mask. In his chambers was also a holoprojector, which he used to contact Darth Sidious. He used his chambers often, but also when his wife, Padme Amidala, died.

Force Sever was an ability capable of severing one’s connection to the Force permanently. To a Force-sensitive, there is no greater punishment other than death that can be bestowed upon them, to have themselves cut off from the Force.# Section 1\nThe ability commonly referred to as Force Sever has been described as similar to having one of your senses removed, such as your sight, taste, touch, or smell. An accurate description, as often Jedi and other Force-sensitives use their connection to the Force commonly. The Force was ingrained into the lifestyle of a Jedi or any Force-sensitive, and many do not realize how often they rely on it. To have one’s connection to the Force so completely and utterly broken would uproot any Force Sensitive’s perception of life and the world around them.\n\n# Section 2\nForce Sever was among some of the strongest Force techniques that Jedi could use; however, it was used sparingly. This technique was rarely used, even when exiling someone from the Jedi Order. Many Jedi understood the severity of such a punishment, and few wished to ever inflict it upon others and most definitely not upon themselves. In extreme circumstances, where the greatest of threats – not only to the Jedi but to the Force itself – would be used to cut one’s connection to the Force. There have been a few extraordinary cases of its use, such as when the Jedi Exile unintentionally used Force Sever to cut herself from the Force due to the pain she felt after the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator at Malachor V.

The degree of the connection solely relies on the Force-sensitivity of both users, the stronger they are in the Force, the stronger the connection will be.# Section 1\nCommonly seen within the relationship of a Jedi Master and a Padawan, Force Bond often occurs between them, even through great distances. More powerful bonds occur between relatives. It was also believed that near-death occasions cause bonds.

Some might argue that it is a more refined version of the Force push, the technique that pushes anything an individual is facing away, that many Jedi know.

While it could influence both Force-sensitives and non-sensitives, the meditation focused mainly on coordinating and improving the Force-sensitives of either side of the Force.# Section 1\nDue to there being fewer Force-sensitive entities than non-sensitives in battles, there was less of a demand for the Force Meld. Because of this, Force meld was believed to be easier to master since the number of practitioners within the New Jedi Order was almost half of the practitioners from the old order. Anakin Skywalker redeveloped the technique for the New Jedi Order during the Yuuzhan Vong War. This allowed Jedi fighting in the war to act as a single entity. With the coordination of Jacen Solo, Force meld would play an important role during the Mission to Myrkr, helping boost the efficiency of the Myrkr strike team. Jaina Solo fine-tuned Force meld as a starfighter tactic that was used in her Twin Suns Squadron. Not long after, Madurrin used the technique as an inter-squadron coordination tactic.\n\n# Section 2\nProlonged use of the technique caused users to have strange behavior such as finishing others’ sentences and thoughts, due to the Meld allowing them to see into the minds of others. Obi-Wan Kenobi had given a warning that it required a Master of great power and connection with the Force to create a single entity state without destroying the minds of everyone involved. One of the biggest drawbacks of Force meld was one of the major elements that led to the Dark Nest Crisis. The enhanced power of Force meld worked two ways, one being where the entity could influence a large number of minds. However, with more power, there would be a great disruption in the Force and could overwhelm the participants. If the pain was caused by the minds of those being touched, it would bring disastrous effects to everyone involved. Which could be to a degree that would cause those involved to lose control of their minds and become ignorant to any outside threats. The majority of the light side users could prevent participants from slipping to the dark side, but if the participants were divided in thoughts the meld could become a liability rather than an asset.\n\n","meta":{"index":30,"author":"ElysiaLValkyrie","name":"Force Meld","release_year":2021}},"Curato salva":{"content":"# Introduction\nCurato salva is a way to refer to a multiple group of Force abilities that focus on self-healing.

It was the homeworld of a race closely related to humans known as the Sephi. Up until the Clone Wars, the planet was a member of the Galactic Republic and was represented in the Galactic Senate. Around 21 BBY, the Sephi ended up betraying the Republic and joined the rebellion made by the Confederacy of Independent Systems.# Section 1\nDuring the Clone Wars, Thustra was ruled by King Alaric and represented in the Galactic Senate by his nephew Navi. The Sephi lost patience with the Galactic Republic and aimed to join the rebellion. These actions prompted Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to send Republic forces to Thustra. By doing so, Palpatine believed that a small show of force would convince the Sephi to stay loyal to the Republic. The mission was led by Jedi Generals Tyffix and Tyr, alongside their padawans Cal and Pix. However, their squad was attacked overnight by suicide bombers. The attack left many casualties including Tyffix and Tyr, which left their padawans in charge.\n\n# Section 2\nMeanwhile, on Coruscant, Palpatine and Master Yoda discussed their fears of what would happen if Thustra were to part ways with the Republic. Yoda had been a long-time friend of Alaric and hoped that their friendship would be enough to encourage him to stay with the Republic. When they arrived in Thustra, Cal and Master Yoda went to talk with the king while Pix and Commander Clutch were tasked with staying put no matter the circumstances. Yoda and Alaric discussed multiple matters regarding the well-being of the Republic and what has started to deter the king away. The king came to the final conclusion that the Republic was currently full of itself regarding personal gain. Thus giving him the need to do what is right for Thustra and fall back from the Republic. Because of this, Yoda and Cal were taken as prisoners to prevent further conflict.\n\n# Section 3\nSenator Navi and his aide Moje had been called back to Thustra by the king, as he had a hunch that Navi had strayed the wrong way and betrayed his people. His fears were right and Navi did not want Thustra to secede from the Republic. Navi made a plan that would ensure that the Republic was going to be able to overtake the planet. Moje was sent to speak to Cal and convinced the young Jedi to escape before he would be executed. Meanwhile, Navi left to meet with Pix and Clutch and told them that Yoda and Cal had already been executed. He did this in hopes that they would start up a strike against the Sephi forces. Cal attempted to escape while Pix and the clone troopers attacked the Sephi military, which gave off the appearance that the Republic was trying to kill Alaric and take over the planet. Because of this, the palace guards attacked Cal and he ended up being killed in battle.\n\n# Section 4\nYoda went to confront Alaric in the castle’s greenhouse as the capital of Thustra continued to fall. However, Alaric had a trick up his sleeve and pulled out a blaster from under his robes. He then told Yoda that his death would only empower his people to avenge his death from the Republic scum that stole him from them. Yoda tried to convince the king otherwise, but he refused and shot a blaster shot at Yoda. The Jedi Master was able to deflect the bolt into the king’s chest, which ended up killing him. Before the king died he begged Yoda to remember their friendship as it was in the past, and not how it had become. Navi was later arrested for his part in the events that went down and Moje was placed on a wanted list.

The Western Reaches area lies in between these two, while the Imperial Space consists of the worlds that have been under the control of the Galactic Empire, and many of its successor organisations, such as Thrawn’s Empire.# Section 1\nThanks to being situated between the galaxy’s Core Worlds and the poorer but richer, undiscovered resources Outer Rim, this region would quickly be developed, with worlds such as Sullust, Mustafar, Tibrin, or Eriadu serving as potential resource banks.

As other, more minor facilities across the planet were destroyed by smaller armies, Tann took the bulk of her force and all of her stolen Decimators to eliminate the stronghold.\n           General Drakas had very poor odds to begin with: the Sarapin stronghold had only recently been retrofitted for war and garrisoned, and the Republic was not expecting a strike so far into the heart of the Core. He had no starfighters for air support at all, and chose not to use the few remaining troopships on the base for that purpose. He had little time to muster his army and prepare a hasty defense when Tann began a full frontal attack.\n           But Drakas was not only outnumbered, but outgunned as well. The powerful turbolasers on the experimental Decimator tanks melted through the Republic’s defenses, allowing battle droids to pour in and overwhelm the defenders. Tann personally led the assault on the power generators, and killed Jor Drakas in a duel, the Jedi General’s last-ditch attempt to salvage the battle. Tann then had the Decimators fire on the geothermal power generators, ending the battle.\n\n# Section 2\nOnly a few clones were able to escape aboard troopships, and many were shot down either by the orbiting fleet or by Tann’s Decimators. The battle was a major victory for the Confederacy: not only had Sarapin been captured, but the power generators for several key Core Worlds lay in ruins. Many blacked out as panic spread. The Core was no long believed to be safe.\n           The Decimators, as well, proved successful. Only one had been destroyed, victim of a concentrated turbolaser bombardment in the battle’s opening stages. The rest had proven deadly, and had quite literally melted the Republic’s defenses. Tann left to set up a new Decimator factory on Krant shortly afterwards, leaving Zian Finnis the commander of the garrison left in the ruins of the generator fortress.\n\n","meta":{"index":71,"author":"DemshyAlkion","name":"First Battle of Sarapin","release_year":2020}},"Unification Wars":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe ancient Unification Wars was a certain dispute that led several Core Worlds into formatting the Galactic Republic. The war began around 25,053 BBY, a while after the fall of the Infinite Empire. The Infinite Empire suppressed most of the galaxy. It was said that the Jedi Order fought and won the war, which led to their alliance with the Republic, which would last for several millennia, and they became peacekeepers of the Galaxy.# Section 1\nA millennium before the Unification Wars, an ancient group named the Rakatan Infinite Empire came together and was named the ‘Power Dictator in the Galaxy’. They dominated and ruled many over-sentient species. In later years, a plague took over their empire - the survivors were stripped of any connection with the Force and were unable to stop the slave uprising. Due to the fortunate collapse of the Empire, other powers began to develop, such as the Duros and the Corellians, who used the Rakatan super hyperdrives to explore the Galaxy.\n\n# Section 2\nBefore a new power that dominated the galaxy could be selected, the wars named the ‘Unification Wars’ began within the galaxy around 25,053 BBY. A famous warlord known as Zakrinand Minus nearly became the leader of the galaxy but did not come out successful. The Jedi Order also partook in this conflict and reigned successfully, which made them the new dominant power of the Galaxy.\n\n# Section 3\nOnce the war concluded, a few of the Core World planets came together to form the Galactic Republic. Most of the main planets within this unification would be Coruscant, Corellia, Alderaan, and Duro. The Jedi joined it and became Peacekeepers of the Galaxy. The Republic lasted for twenty-five thousand years until it finally fell.\n\n","meta":{"index":48,"author":"LAZ3XR","name":"Unification Wars","release_year":2023}},"Great Hyperspace Disaster":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Great Hyperspace Disaster, otherwise known as the Legacy Run disaster or the Evacuation of Hetzal Prime, was an incident that occurred 232 BBY, during the High Republic Era. It involved the Legacy Run spaceship, which stumbled upon a Nihil spacecraft while traversing a well-established hyperspace route. The captain of the ship, Casset, was then forced to take control of the ship and avoid the obstacle. She succeeded in that task, but the ship was torn apart as a result of the immense force applied to it. She and her crew managed to secure all the ship’s compartments before dying when the bridge was torn open with them inside. The passengers were saved, however.# Section 1\nThe Hetzal system placed in the Outer Rim was particularly endangered due to a great number of hyperspace anomalies. Debris was falling all over the system and causing much destruction. Eventually, a map was put together, displaying the amount of debris and its impact. This prompted a system-wide evacuation order. Chaos ensued, as there weren’t enough starships to transport all citizens to safety. Some of them chose to ignore the order, as they didn’t believe in the threat’s existence. The government later sent a distress signal, hoping the Republic would aid them in this crisis.\n\n# Section 2\nHetzal’s call for help was picked up by the Third Horizon, which quickly responded to the request and started heading toward the system. Over a hundred Jedi were involved in the rescue, led by Master Kriss. At first, the Jedi didn’t realize what the anomalies actually were and thus decided to destroy the threat. This changed when a Padawan sensed lifeforms inside one of the anomalies, and sent the information to Kriss through the Force. A total of 10 such anomalies were detected, and rescuing those trapped inside became one of the team’s primary goals. Even though the Republic succeeded in protecting the Hetzal system, they weren’t able to eliminate all the debris. Due to this, a series of Emergences began, as the leftover pieces would exit hyperspace at random points and fall on the surrounding land.\n\n","meta":{"index":47,"author":"Difen511_JR","name":"Great Hyperspace Disaster","release_year":2023}},"Great Jedi Purge":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Great Jedi Purge was the second mass extermination of Jedi, as a result of Order 66. Clone Protocol 66 was one of 150 Contingency Orders for the Grand Army of the Republic, created by Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas in case of armed forces who were to oppose the Republic. These Orders would be issued by the Supreme Chancellor, or commanding authority, in times of crisis and had to be obeyed by Clones or else they would face military degradation and execution. Order 66 acted to exterminate Jedi officers, declared to be acting in opposition to the Republic, and reverted all command to the Supreme Chancellor. The Order had several intricacies that allowed for the immediate extermination of Jedi at the will of the Chancellor without the need for discussion or authentication, features that many of the other Contingencies Orders didn't have. Furthermore, Order 66 was programmed within biochips in the brains of Clones to ensure it was carried out and there was no room for doubt.# Section 1\nA year before the event of Order 66, there was a sign of biochips being used - this knowledge previously being kept secret to only a handful. CT-5385 (Tup) of the 501st Legion experienced headaches, which ultimately led to him killing Jedi Master Tiplar, the General he was working under at the Battle of Ringo Vinda. Upon returning to a command post, Tup was questioned by CT-7567 (Rex) but didn't even know what happened himself. Suddenly, Tup attacked Jedi Master Tiplee, who was able to restrain the trooper to the wall. Worried that it may be a contagious virus, the Clone was sent to Kamino to allow for further examination. Darth Sidious had Tup abducted by Separatist forces during his transport to Kamino to prevent the spread of the biochip conspiracy, but CT-5555 (Fives), Rex and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker successfully rescued him.\n\n# Section 2\nAt Kamino, Fives was desperate to save his friend, and with the assistance of a medical droid, was able to uncover a biochip implanted in Tup's brain that had malfunctioned. Thinking that removing the chip would stop his friend's suffering, Fives had the medical droid operate to retrieve it; unfortunately, due to Tup's already unhealthy state, he died during the operation. Fives learned from the medical droid with orders to have his memory wiped so he escaped the facility to present his findings to Jedi Master Shaak Ti. Receiving the news, Ti ordered the chips and Fives to be brought to Coruscant to explain the case to Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, not knowing he was Darth Sidious. Palpatine demanded a private conversation with Fives, which allowed him to claim an \"assassination attempt\". The Jedi High Council learnt of Fives' alleged attack and launched an investigation, which led to an encounter Fives had with Rex and Skywalker. The agitated Clone tried to explain the situation, but appearing hostile, was shot by CC-1010 (Fox) of the Coruscant Guard, ordered by the Supreme Chancellor to deal with the situation, ending the conspiracy.\n\n# Section 3\nIn 19 BBY, Skywalker had news that Palpatine may be a Sith Lord after a conversation with the Chancellor, so warned Jedi Master Mace Windu. In response, Windu and Jedi Masters Agen Kolar, Kit Fisto and Saesee Tiin approached the office of the Chancellor, trying to arrest him. Upon being confronted by the four Jedi Masters, Sidious was able to slay three of them with ease, leaving Windu who duelled against him. Putting up a fight, Windu was capable enough to disarm and even disfigure Sidious but was incapacitated by Skywalker in an act of temptation, allowing the Sith Lord to eliminate the Jedi Master through a blast of Force Lightning. In conflict with dark emotions, Skywalker became Sidious' apprentice under a new name - Darth Vader. Darth Sidious issued Order 66 to all Clone Commanders, leading to the Great Jedi Purge.\n\n# Section 4\nWhen Order 66 was received, Clones all across the galaxy acted to bring down all Jedi with brutal force:\nAbove the Battle of Boz Pity, Jedi Master Plo Koon was shot down by CT-55/11-9009 (Jag) with an ARC-170 starfighter squadron during clean up operations.\nOn Saleucami, Jedi Master Stass Allie was struck by blaster fire from CC-8826 (Neyo) of the 91st Mobile Reconnaissance Corps on BARC speeders during clean up operations. Jedi Master Aayla Secura was gunned down by CC-5052 (Bly) with the 327th Star Corps during preparation to engage Separatist droids. Feeling her death through the Force, Jedi Master Darrus Jeht alerted himself of the danger of the Order, but the situation eventually led to his ships jumping through one of the many time vortexes in the Cularin system, leading to his disappearance.\nOn Mygeeto, Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi was executed by CC-1138 (Bacara) with the 21st Nova Corps and a unit of the 501st Legion in an advance for one of the planet's massive cities.\nOn Ilum, the units of the 481st Legion were sent to secure the planet, killing survivors in the process.\n\n# Section 5\nA few managed to escape the initial onslaught, fleeing out of Clones' sights and going into hiding, while some also abandoning the ways of the Jedi:\nOn Kashyyyk, Grand Master Yoda evaded a sneak attack conducted by CC-1004 (Gre) and escaped. Jedi Master Quintlan Vos was fired at by an A6 Juggernaut and was presumed dead, but managed to escape off the planet with his son Korto Vos 8 months later with Jedi Masters T'ra Saa and Tholme.\nOn Utapau, Master Obi-Wan Kenobi was fired upon by an AT-TE, ordered by CC-2224 (Cody), while he was on a Dragonmount, but managed to escape the planet.\nSome Masters died protecting their Padawans:\nOn their way to assist the assault on Mygeeto, Jedi Master Jaro Tapal was shot as he tried giving way for his Padawan Cal Krestis to escape his Venator-class Star Destroyer by escape pod.\nOn Kaller, Jedi Master Depa Billaba died surrounded by the Clones that were with her while her Padawan Caleb Dume escaped as a fugitive.\n\n# Section 6\nAt the same time, Darth Sidious dispatched his new apprentice Lord Vader, and CC-1119 (Appo) with the 501st Legion, to march upon the Jedi Temple on Coruscant silently, with the intent to eliminate the Jedi. This commenced Operation: Knightfall and the siege upon the Temple. Gate Master Jurokk greeted Skywalker, unknowing he had fallen to the dark side, and the first to be killed by Vader's hand, marking the beginning of the end for those in the Temple. Within minutes, a large portion of the Jedi Order was executed, even though there were several Jedi and the Temple Security Force. Vader made it his task to change the signal of the Jedi Beacon that was informing Jedi outposts across the galaxy in an attempt to lure surviving Jedi back to the Temple, so took a group of Clones with him to the library. Sensing this, Chief Librarian Jocasta Nu managed to leave the library unseen. The message was sent out that the war had finally concluded, drawing those who hadn't yet been exterminated by the Clones to the Temple, only to be slaughtered by the troopers that were not letting any Jedi leave or enter the temple. Clone assassins were left at the beacon to guard it with their lives.\n\n# Section 8\nTrying to destroy the remaining Jedi, Vader hunted the fleeing masters and younglings, with only a handful being able to escape. A notable event happened when Vader made his way to the High Council Tower, where he was met with a clan of Younglings. Sors Bandeam was amongst them and asked Vader what they were going to do. In response, Vader executed him and the remaining Jedi in the temple. At this point, the temple was burning and Senator Bail Organa landed at a nearby platform to see what caused the fire. He saw the death of a young Padawan whilst being fired at, and quickly fled the premises. Sidious arrived at the Temple to applaud him for his deeds.\n\n# Section 9\nThe flames of the temple alerted the Senate Emergency response to declare martial law on Coruscant and stated that anyone who tried to enter the Temple must be doing so against the Senate's will. The Coruscant Security Force was sent along with the 501st to track down all fleeing Jedi. The news that the Jedi had betrayed the Republic was constantly sent across the HoloNet. Palpatine was able to justify Order 66 on the basis that an \"assassination\" attempt by Jedi had occurred, and the allegation that the Jedi Order started the Clone Wars by commissioning the creation of the Clone army without the agreement of the Senate in an act to cripple the Republic. He used misleading recordings of conversations with Windu as evidence for the assassination attempt, convincing the Senate to reform the Republic into the Galactic Empire.\n\n# Section 10\nTo prevent further death, Kenobi and Yoda cautiously entered the Temple to switch the signal to one that warned Jedi to stay clear of the Temple and hide. This is where the pair discovered that a lightsaber user was behind the killings, and they met and defeated the clones guarding the comms room. On their way out, Kenobi sought the security recording to see who had done all of this, only to see Skywalker's slaughter of Battlemaster Cin Drallig and his padawan and his anointment to Sith Lord. Despite the change in signal, several Jedi still made their way back to the Temple, meeting their demise. Shortly after, there was a duel between Yoda and Sidious in the Senate Chamber, while Kenobi went to Mustafar to confront Vader. Both Jedi Masters later went into self-imposed exiles on Dagobah and Tatooine respectively. The duel on Mustafar was a defeat for Vader; joined by CC-4477 (Thire) and Coruscant shock troopers, Sidious brought Vader to the Grand Medical Facility, where he was saved through cybernetics.\n\n# Section 11\nOver the next 19 years, several groups were designated to completely remove the Jedi from the galaxy:\nVader personally dealt with many groups of Jedi with the 501st, now called Vader's Fist, utilising Clone Commando units that would assist and escort him in his hunt for the last remaining Jedi. \nThe Inquisitorius was a branch of the Imperial Intelligence Service set up by Sidious to help in the hunt for Jedi. Inquisitors would be selected from fallen Jedi who had been corrupted or tortured to the dark side. The Grand Inquisitor, who was formerly a Jedi Temple Guard, trained the fallen as Inquisitors. One example was Jedi Padawan Trilla Suduri, who was caught due to her master, Jedi Knight Cere Junda, revealing her location. After the torture and the betrayal, Suduri gave into the pain, becoming the Second Sister of the Inquisitorius. Other examples were the Seventh Sister, Ninth Sister (formerly Jedi Masana Tide), the Fifth Brother, the Sixth Brother (formerly Jedi Bil Van) and the Eighth Brother. Learning of this program from Sidious, Vader eventually led it.\n\n# Section 12\nOne crucial mission the Inquisitorius was instructed to undergo, was the mission to locate and bring back Jocasta Nu alive - her knowledge and access to the vaults could be key for the Empire's future. One such artefact that they tried to gain access to was the Kyber memory crystal, a list of all known Force-sensitives. Even though the list was recovered and Nu accepted her death by lightsaber, Vader destroyed the list to prevent Sidious from choosing new Sith apprentices - the possibility of a new apprentice was a threat to Vader's position in power.\nThe Inquisitorius was also in charge of Purge Stormtroopers, trained formidable death squads containing Imperial soldiers and the last generation of Clones from Kamino. Naturally, they were programmed to obey Order 66 and execute Jedi immediately.\nSidious established the Shadow Guard, a unit within his Royal Guard, consisting of former Sun Guard and Jedi Knights trained by Vader, tasked to follow orders from the Emperor himself, to protect him or eliminate suspected Force-sensitives. A few Shadow Guards would accompany Inquisitors or Stormtroopers as well.\n\n# Section 13\nSidious also took steps to secure his power as Emperor:\nThe Jedi Temple on Coruscant had been built on an ancient Sith Shrine in the hopes of neutralising its effect. After the siege of the temple, it was converted into the Imperial Palace. Sidious later looked to siphon the dark energies of the shrine.\nAdditionally, Sidious created the Emperor's Eyes, Hands, Reach and Voice. The Eye was responsible for seeing into the future using the Force. The Hands was responsible for carrying out covert missions to eliminate certain politically powerful people in secret. The Reach and Voice were responsible for ensuring that the Emperor's wishes were kept throughout the galaxy. These elements helped stabilise the Empire further for Sidious' own goals, helping turn people to favour it through the use of propaganda and destroying Jedi history.\n\n# Section 14\nThere were many events to diminish the Jedi presence in the galaxy:\nAfter the Coruscant Temple had fallen, Vader moved his interests to the planet Kashyyyk, where a joint Jedi-Wookie force was maintaining resistance against the invading Empire. Crushing the resistance and taking in an orphan as his secret apprentice, the Sith Lord moved on to demolish the Jedi Conclave that had gathered on Kessel a month later. Months following the raid on Coruscant, a resistance group called Whiplash was made and assisted those who fled the Temple off-world. The surviving Jedi went into hiding, joined resistance groups or relinquished their lightsabers for civilian life. In 18 BBY, Vader's Fist gained control of Naboo, whose Queen Apailana decided to sever all ties with the Empire. These were examples of events that showed the proficiency of the dark lord's stormtroopers. The Purge was eventually considered over when the Emperor decided there was only a very small amount of Jedi left in the galaxy to be a threat, by 1 BBY.\n\n","meta":{"index":52,"author":"AnimatedEcrux","name":"Great Jedi Purge","release_year":2021}},"Jedi Civil War":{"content":"# Introduction\nAt the close of the Mandalorian Wars, the Jedi Revan and Malak mysteriously disappeared into the Unknown Regions, supposedly pursuing the last remnants of the Mandalorian fleet. Unknown to the Order or the High Council, the two Jedi had traced clues to the planet Dromund Kaas where they discovered that the Sith Empire lived on in secret and was ruled by the mysterious and incredibly powerful Sith Emperor. Unable to stop him, the Emperor reprogrammed the Jedi and sent them back to the Republic as the Sith Lords Darth Revan and Darth Malak. Returning to the Republic with their loyal followers in tow, the newly christened Sith Lords began to wage a second war, preying on a Republic already weakened by the Mandalorians and taking full advantage of the immense number of Jedi who were still willing to follow the pair. This Jedi Civil War pitted masters against students, fathers against sons, and friends against best friends, making it one of the most emotionally powerful wars in galactic history. While the early stages of the war were indecisive, it soon became apparent that Revan's Sith armada was growing at a steady rate, and in a short time, the Republic was overwhelmed with the seemingly limitless forces of the enemy. World after world fell to Revan's vast fleets and masterful strategies.# Section 1\nDetermined not to make the same mistakes they had in the Mandalorian Wars, the High Council devised a plan to eliminate the enemy at its source: Revan. During one fateful battle a small Jedi strike team led by Bastila Shan, a young Jedi Padawan with the remarkable gift of battle meditation, infiltrated Darth Revan's command ship to capture the Dark Lord. During the confrontation, Darth Malak, who was stationed aboard a different ship, realized that Revan could be easily defeated and that he could then assume the title of Dark Lord of the Sith, fired upon his own master's vessel in the hope of killing both Revan and the Jedi fighting him. The Jedi managed to escape with Revan's body, but Malak had achieved a crucial victory, for he was now the Dark Lord of the Sith and commander of the entire Sith armada. Malak continued to wage war against the Republic, relying exclusively on brute force as opposed to subtle strategies. Following the Sith tradition, he took an apprentice of his own: former Jedi Darth Bandon. As the situation for the Republic and the Jedi became more desperate, they began to rely more and more on the battle meditation of Bastila Shan to gain an advantage over the ever-growing Sith Empire.\n\n# Section 2\nConsequently, Darth Malak began to target Jedi Shan specifically, hoping to crush the Republic's last chance of standing against his armies. During one battle in orbit above the world of Taris, Jedi Shan's vessel, the Endar Spire, was crippled beyond recovery, and the young Jedi was forced to evacuate to the planet below. As fate would have it, two other survivors eventually caught up with Jedi Shan on Taris: Carth Onasi, a decorated soldier and war hero of the Republic, and another lowly officer who Shan recently had transferred to her command. The key to the rest of the war, however, lay in the identity of this single, seemingly insignificant foot soldier. Onasi and Shan continued to gain more companions, managed to escape the destruction of Taris, and fled to Dantooine's secret Jedi Enclave, where their third companion was inducted into the Order and they discovered the existence of the Star Forge. The Jedi Council commissioned their small band to seek out Star Maps from various planets in order to discover the location of the Star Forge, which they believed was the key to Malak's power. During their quest, the group encountered and defeated many Sith minions, including Darth Bandon.\n\n# Section 3\nThe biggest interruption to their mission was the groups capture by one of the Sith fleet's command ships. After a frantic escape attempt, Onasi, Shan, and the new Jedi Padawan encountered Darth Malak himself. This confrontation revealed a startling truth: that Darth Revan had not been killed, but had instead been rendered comatose by Malak's attack and saved by the Jedi, specifically Shan. The Jedi Council had inserted over his destroyed mind a new identity, that of a lowly officer who was now a Jedi Padawan. Darth Revan had been traveling with Shan and Onasi the entire time. Upon escaping Malak and realizing his true identity, Revan was determined to complete his mission and destroy his old apprentice. Eventually, he and his companions discovered the location of the Star Forge and launched an attack in collaboration with the Republic against it. Revan managed to infiltrate the giant factory, which was the source of the Sith's limitless armada and defeated his old apprentice Malak once and for all. Despite the victory over Malak and the apparent defeat of the Sith, the High Council and the Order, in general, kept Revan and his wife, Bastila Shan, at a distance. Regarded as outsiders, Revan and Shan remained outside of the walls of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant while an increasingly strained relationship with the Order wore on them.\n\n# Section 4\nRevan, suffering from crippling Force visions, eventually left for the Unknown Regions in search of answers.\n\n","meta":{"index":17,"author":"","name":"Jedi Civil War","release_year":0}},"Yuuzhan Vong War":{"content":"# Introduction\nDuring the time of relative peace up to 25 ABY, the new Jedi Order seemed to be well and truly established as a force in the galaxy once more. The Order now numbered at least 100 Jedi, possibly more, with many Jedi Masters actively training new Padawans. During this time Luke Skywalker sought permission from the New Republic to re-establish the Jedi Council. However, with the onset of the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Jedi were to face a foe that would rock their Order to its very foundations. Significant public opinion was turned against the Jedi by the invaders with Jedi hunted around the galaxy. However, the Jedi did receive aid from unexpected sources, such as from many Priapulin who signed up as Jedi Auxiliaries to support the Order as the famous Charza Kwinn had decades earlier. During this time, cracks appeared within the Jedi Order over what approach to take to the invaders. Spearheading the more aggressive faction was Kyp Durron, while Luke Skywalker led a more defensive position. Some of this conflict was resolved with the establishment of a Masters' Council, seeking to create a unified response for all Jedi. The Jedi eventually played a vital role in the resolution of the war, but the cost was severe. The number of Jedi was halved and their mindset became far more severe.# Section 1\nFollowing the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Jedi academy was moved to Ossus, while the High Council relocated to a newly-constructed Jedi Temple on Coruscant. During the Dark Nest Crisis, they numbered over 200 Jedi. By the end of the Swarm War, Luke Skywalker officially claimed the title Grand Master of the Jedi Order.\n\n","meta":{"index":28,"author":"","name":"Yuuzhan Vong War","release_year":0}},"First Jedi Purge":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe First Jedi Purge was conducted at the end of the Jedi Civil War from 3954 BBY to 3951 BBY, being led by the Sith Triumvirate, a group of 3 Sith Lords (Darth Traya, Darth Nihilus, and Darth Sion) that commanded the remainder of Revan’s Sith Empire.\n\nThroughout the Purge, the Jedi Order fell apart, with most of the Order’s members being defeated, and those who did survive being hunted down and slaughtered. The Jedi Temples were abandoned, with all remaining Jedi fleeing for their lives. Many well-known Jedi Masters were defeated in the purge, including Master Dorak and Master Kavar.# Section 1\nWith the Jedi Order suffering through The Great Sith War, The Mandalorian Wars, and the Jedi Civil War, less than one-hundred members still lived and served for the Order, making it extremely difficult for them to rebuild, especially since a tremendous amount of Jedi Knowledge stored in libraries and holocrons had been destroyed, lost or stolen during the wars, meaning there were few Jedi knowledgeable enough to teach future generations.\n\nEven before the Purge, both the Jedi Order and Galactic Republic were at the edge of corruption after the wars. The Jedi began questioning their teachings and wondering why so many of them had fallen to the dark side in recent times,  as well as feeling anger and resentment towards the citizens of the Republic, who had begun fearing them.\n\n# Section 2\nDespite Darth Malak being defeated along with the Star Forge and the Sith Empire, Revan’s Sith assassins still lived on, now serving the Sith Triumvirate at the Trayus Sith Academy on Malachor V. Using the Jedi’s current stage of weakness as an advantage, the Triumvirate planned a war on the Jedi, aiming for the Order to be completely exterminated. \nThroughout this time, many Jedi gatherings started vanishing, which left a disturbance in the Force that was felt by members of the Council. At first, they suspected they were being haunted, but after this continued, Jedi Master Atris requested the presence of the most powerful of the remaining Jedi Masters at a secret conclave on Katarr in order to discuss this new threat.\nHowever, in Atris’s attempt to lure the enemies out of the shadows, information was leaked as to the conclaves' location, which led Darth Nihilus to the location on Katarr. The Lord of Hunger then completely annihilated almost every living thing on the planet using Force Drain, with the exception of Visas Marr, whom Nihilus took on as an apprentice and trained her in the ways of the dark side of the Force. The Jedi that were not at the conclave at the time of Nihilus’s deadly attack all went into exile. One of the Jedi Masters that went into exile, Vrook Lamar, stated that “it is unlike any war we have fought before—we have yet to even meet our attackers in battle. Somehow our enemy is targeting us through the Force, striking, then retreating to the shadows. The gathering of any Jedi seems to attract them like a beacon.”\n\n# Section 3\nBy the final year of the Purge, there were only a few survivors. Known as the Jedi Exile, Meetra Surik, who had been cast out of the Jedi Order for following Revan to battle, was one of these few survivors. The Republic Admiral Carth Onasi ordered a ship “The Harbinger '' to pick up Surik from the Outer Rim where she had been living, whilst on their way to Onderon. Soon after, while The Harbinger set course for Telos IV, Onasi’s home planet, the crew received a distress signal from a nearby ship and was ordered to assist the stranded vessel. Once The Harbinger arrived at the site, the captain discovered two ships, the Ebon Hawk and a Sith Warship. Both were adrift, seemingly deserted. A boarding crew entered both the Ebon Hawk and the warship after The Harbinger had attached to them. Matching how it looked, the Sith warship seemed to be completely abandoned, but with an eerie feeling about it. Then, a shocking discovery on this ship was the body of Darth Sion, assumed to be dead. The boarding crew brought Sion’s corpse aboard their ship, and even though he was assumed dead, many mysterious things kept happening, such as crew members suddenly dying. \n\nThings only got worse for the crew of The Harbinger, as Darth Sion awoke, and his Sith assassins that secretly boarded the ship started murdering the Republic Officers that were aboard. Despite it taking barely any time for The Harbinger to be completely under Sith control, in the fraction of time that the Sith were distracted, the Ebon Hawk docked with The Harbinger, taking Meetra Surik aboard, and then jumping to hyperspace.\n\n# Section 4\nWhen Surik awoke from being unconscious, she found herself in a mining facility on Peragus II, along with an older woman, who later revealed herself as Jedi Master Kreia. Together, Surik and Kreia guided their way out of the lifeless facility, only to be discovered yet again by Darth Sion, who had followed them to the planet aboard The Harbinger. The two Jedi boarded the Ebon Hawk, and attempted to make an escape to Telos IV, however after being pursued by the Sith in The Harbinger, an explosion caused by the ignition of fuel around an asteroid field both deterred the Ebon Hawk and completely destroyed the planet. Both the Ebon Hawk and the Harbinger survived the explosion, however, and were able to make an escape.\n\nAfter arriving on Telos, the crew of the Ebon Hawk were captured by Jedi Master Atris, who controlled the aqueduct system they were in. On release, the droid aboard the Ebon Hawk, T3-M4 revealed that they had been able to download the Jedi Master’s database and navigational charts, including the location of the remaining Jedi Masters who had gone into exile after Nihilus’s attack on Katarr. Atris, as the crew knew, was on Telos. Jedi Master Kavarr was on Onderon, Master Vrook Lamar on Dantooine, Master Ell on Nar Shaddaa, and Master Vash on the Sith planet of Korriban.\n\n# Section 5\nSurik, Kreia, and T3 traveled to each of these planets to reunite the Jedi Masters to fight the Sith, and to re-address her banishment from the Order.\n\nFirst, Surik traveled to Dantooine in search of Jedi Master Vrook Lamar, and on arrival, she found out that Lamar had been detained by mercenaries. Surik searched for Lamar and eventually found him. Surik also assisted the new government Khoonda in defeating the mercenaries, before taking the Jedi Master to the Jedi Enclave on the planet.\n\nNext stop for Surik was Nar Shaddaa, in search of Jedi Master Zez-Kai Ell. Straight after arriving on the planet, Surik had bounty hunters chasing after her and was eventually captured. However, another bounty hunter called Mira assisted Surik in her escape, and the Jedi was forced to temporarily leave the planet. \n\nUpon Surik's re-arrival on the planet, she located the Jedi Master, and after having her questions answered and being taught a lightsaber form, Surik took the Master to Dantooine to wait with Master Vrook.\n\nSurik then arrived on Onderon to look for Jedi Master Kavarr. After befriending the Mandalorians and assisting in a Civil War, Surik eventually got Master Kavarr on Dantooine, whilst she went out in search of the final remaining Jedi Master.\n\nAs soon as Surik touched down on the surface of Korriban, she was informed that the Jedi Master she was looking for had been murdered just moments ago, by the Sith Lord Darth Sion. While on the planet, Surik also encountered the Sith Lord. During their duel, Surik slashed Sion many times, however the Lord of Pain utilized his hatred, being able to heal himself. Eventually, Kreia telepathically communicated with Surik, informing her this was a battle she could not win, so Surik fled the battle and returned to Dantooine and the Jedi Masters that awaited her arrival.\n\nHowever, after the Jedi gathered together to reconsider the Exile’s banishment, they came to the decision to renew the banishment, and they froze her still in order to strip the Jedi of her powers. Before they could do that however, Kreia revealed herself to be Darth Traya, the leader of the Sith Triumvirate, and she drained both the Force and the life out of the Jedi Masters. Traya then fled, leaving Surik depleted on the planet, surrounded by 3 dead Jedi Masters.\n\n# Section 6\nSurik then traveled to Telos in search of Traya. Surik again encountered Jedi Master Atris, who had been corrupted by the dark side of the Force. After Surik defeated her and convinced her to let go of her pain, Atris informed her of Traya’s location, Malachor V. Atris then labeled herself as an ex-Jedi, and once again went into exile.\n\nBefore Surik could leave Telos, the Lord of Hunger Darth Nihilus appeared in his ship The Ravager. Surik allied with the Mandalorians Canderous Ordo, and they engaged him. Nihilus attempted to drain Surik of her Force energy but failed, and tired himself out. However, Surik and Nihilus then engaged each other in battle, with Nihilus looking too strong for the Exile. Nihilus then stunned Surik, allowing for a final, deadly blow to the Exile. However, to Nihilus’s surprise, his apprentice, Visas Marr, offered her life in exchange for Surik’s. This stalled Nihilus just long enough for Surik to recover. Marr then disrupted her link with her Master, which weakened Nihilus enough, so that he could be defeated.\n\nSurik was then able to travel to Malachor V, in order to defeat the Sith. While entering the Trayus Academy, Surik battled past many Sith Warriors and assassins, eventually coming face to face with Darth Sion. After a lengthy and complex duel, Surik persuaded Sion to let go of his hatred, as Traya was just using him. Sion eventually obliged, letting go of his anger, resulting in his death from multiple injuries.\n\nMaking her way to the Trayus Core, Surik stood before Darth Trayus, the only remaining Lord of the Triumvirate. After a harsh battle, the Exile defeated Traya, but spared her life. Traya however, who refused to give up, attacked Surik again, and was again defeated. Traya was redeemed from the dark side, and told Surik where she could find Revan, right before she gave herself to the Force.\n\n# Section 7\nThe Jedi Order began to rebuild, with Marr, Surik, and many other Jedi survivors scattered throughout the galaxy leading the way.\n\n","meta":{"index":8,"author":"iPadiPodiPhoneiMacX","name":"First Jedi Purge","release_year":2023}},"Duel in the Senate (3996 BBY)":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Brotherhood of the sith, led by Dark Lord Exar Kun, wanted to use the next battle to decisively end the jedi.

During the battle, Qel-Droma was imprisoned in a wall of light side energy, later it was determined that punishment would be for Qel-Droma’s execution. Mandalore wanted to rescue the Krath warlord, and he wanted Exar Kun’s assistance to do it.\n\n However, the Dark Lord has warned Qel-Droma about a strike against the galactic capital and getting himself apprehended only validated Kun’s prior notion. Nonetheless, he agreed to assist as Qel-Droma was still a vital factor in their cause.# Section 1\nDuring the Great Sith War in the year 3996 BBY, there was a duel that took place in the Senate Hall of the Galactic Republic, the duel consisted between Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas and his former apprentice Exar Kun. The duel would commence on Coruscant, in the hall’s grand convocation chamber. Exar Kun would be now known from here on out as the Dark Lord of the Sith. Exar Kun marched with Mandalore as well as Sith Massassi warriors and busted through the doors of the Galactic Senate hall.

Few could have guessed, however, that a much larger conflict would soon engulf the galaxy. From within the Order's ranks Jedi Master Phanius, one of the Order's brightest members, became entranced with the forbidden knowledge of the Sith and, defying the High Council, absconded into deep space with a Sith Holocron stolen from the Jedi Archives. Phanius took up the long-vacant title of Dark Lord of the Sith as well as a new name and identity: Darth Ruin. In the ensuing years, Ruin gathered together a large number of dark side followers and surviving Sith clans and founded the New Sith Empire. With this army Ruin planned to bring the Republic, and the Jedi who served it, to their knees. Beginning what would be a thousand-year war, Ruin's empire quickly became fractured, tearing down the Republic and the Jedi Order while ravaging itself from the inside out. The Order was plagued by ineffectual leadership throughout the conflict, constantly held back by a politically-minded High Council.# Section 1\nTo counter the poor management of Order, several Jedi left Coruscant to establish baronies and kingdoms on the Rim, protecting their subjects while demanding fealty and military service. These so-called Jedi Lords established a loose confederation under the guidance of a Jedi Grand Council made up of the most powerful Lords, waging wars against the Sith Empire and killing any Sith minions who intruded on Jedi space. In 1010 BBY, the High Council raised their protege Skere Kaan to the rank of Master, dispatching him into the galaxy to cripple the Sith Empire; the High Council did this despite their knowledge of Kaan's extremist views and his belief that the Order and the Republic were responsible for the state of the galaxy. Taking with him a group of like-minded Jedi, Kaan declared himself Dark Lord and organized a Brotherhood of Darkness, issuing a warning to all surviving Sith: join the Brotherhood and bend the knee or die. Holding true to his promise of death to all who did not join the Brotherhood, the High Council sent their congratulations to Kaan for his swift work of the worst of the Sith Lords. Kaan openly mocked the Order and the thanks, declaring war on them and promising to burn their Temple to the ground.\n\n# Section 2\nFurious at the Council ineptitude, Lord Hoth rallied the banners of those loyal to him and raised a great host called the Army of Light. Gaining the support of the last Grand Council of the Jedi and every last lord, Hoth harried the Brotherhood along its flank until the Army of Light had enough practice at warfare to strike at the Brotherhood's heart. Meeting the Brotherhood in open combat during a series of campaigns at the planet Ruusan, the conflict ground on for seven fierce battles costing many lives on both sides. At the conclusion of the seventh battle, Lord Kaan? Near defeat and driven insane by the power of the dark side? Unleashed the horrors of the thought bomb in a cave system, engulfing every single Force-user on the world. The New Sith Wars were over. The Jedi Order had survived once again despite the deaths of nearly every member of the Army of Light on Ruusan, and the Sith were presumed wiped out to the last individual. One, however, had survived: Darth Bane.

It was this Emperor who had corrupted Revan and Malak, the same Emperor who would imprison Revan for a second time after his return to Dromuund Kaas following the Jedi Civil War. In 3681 BBY the Sith Empire came out of hiding and attacked the Republic and the Jedi, taking both by complete surprise. Unknown to the Republic, the Sith had already infiltrated several planetary governments, the Republic and the Order itself, allowing it several victories. As Jedi and Republic forces fought back, the Mandalorians, under the leadership of Mandalore the Lesser, entered the conflict on the side of the Empire. The war would eventually last 28 standard years.# Section 1\nIn 3653 BBY with peace talks commencing on Alderaan, the Sith launched a surprise attack on Coruscant, devastating the planet, killing the Chancellor and nearly destroying the Jedi Temple. With Coruscant in their hands, the Sith presented the Republic with the Treaty of Coruscant.

Din’s new apprentice was given an objective to disable a shield generator that belonged to the Flesh Raiders, with the shield generator now disabled, a team of Jedi could move in to attack the Flesh Raiders command base.\n\nDin’s Padawan was contacted by Bengel Morr shortly after he disabled the field generator, and he was warned about how Bengel planned to attack the Jedi Order.

With this news, Ranna Tao’Ven was now the leader of the Pilgrims. Before Ranna could discuss Orgus’s whereabouts, a young villager has rushed in to warn about another attack by the Flesh Raiders. This attack led to the enemy leaving toxin mines that would poison the village, as well as the crops and fields. Ranna would then seek the help of the apprentice, because of the belief that the Force could protect the Jedi long enough to take out the mines.\n\nThe Padawan agreed and with that being said, the Padawan would start to focus on his breathing, and connecting with the Force. The Padawan was able to stop the poisonous effects left by the mines, however, many Flesh Raiders buried themselves underground to catch the Jedi by surprise and hopefully stop the Padawan from continuing.

Once they infiltrated the Calamries’s planet they took over a farium mining facility and caused multiple disruptions where they would slow down or even halt the Calamari’s mining operations. Farium is a vital resource in the construction of starships, and with this major mine being shut down, this potentially put the Mon Calamari’s starship construction for the Rebel’s on halt. The Rebels were not too pleased about this and sent a skilled team of agents to go find and execute the infiltrators. The Agents were assaulted by a group of Quarren thugs; they all survived, but this attack was suspected to be caused by the Imperials.

It was sometimes referenced as the ‘Miracle of Yavin’ or even at times the ‘Battle of the Death Star’. During this event, the Rebel Alliance destroyed and blew up the Death Star, one of their many major victories within the galaxy.# Section 1\nThis historical event all started due to Jyn Erso during the Battle of Scarif. Erso was able to steal the very detailed plans that represented the Death Star, which was a big battle station the Imperials were currently creating. Leia Organa, a princess, somehow ended up with the Death Star plans, due to this, Darth Vader, the Dark Lord kidnapped Princess Organa and her crew, who were on the ship Tantive IV. Princess Organa was rescued by a once nobleman by the name of Obi-Wan Kenobi and a couple others who were called: Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and a Wookie by the name of Chewbacca. These members retreated to Yavin 4 with two droids R2-D2 and C-3PO with the stolen Death Star plans. There was a chancellor named Chancellor Mon Mothma and people evacuated her into a shuttle, due to General Dodonna referencing her as ‘the core of the rebellion’. Mothma made a plan to surrender to Emperor Palpatine. \n\nGeneral Dodonna created a plan and notified the rebel pilots of it and what would happen.

Anikin felt conflict and could not bring himself to kill him. Instead, Anikin would return to the Jedi Temple and report it to Mace Windu. After Mase Winu heard of this, he went to the Jedi High Council. The Jedi High Council was ashamed of themselves because their oath to protect was led by a Dark Lord for over a decade. Knowing this the Jedi High Council would plan to take back the peace. Mace Windu would take Jedi Masters Kit Fisto, Saesee Tiin, and Agen Kolar to confront Darth Sidious, They were the best fighters that the order had on Coruscant.

The deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader, as well as many other prominent Imperial officials, and the destruction of the Death Star II,  was a blow the Empire could not recover from.# Section 1\nWhen the Rebel Alliance learned that the Empire was building a second Death Star above Endor, they started planning an attack against this station. Their goal was to destroy this Death Star, just like they did to the first. Spies had also informed the Rebel leadership that not only were the Death Star's protection systems inadequate, but that the Emperor himself would be overseeing the superweapon's completion. The Alliance prepared an attack on the unfinished space station, seeing an opportunity to deal a debilitating blow to the Empire. One group of Rebels would fight on the surface of the moon in an attempt to destroy the Death Star's shield generator, while another would fight in space, assaulting the battle station in Endor's orbit once the Death Star's protective shield was removed. Palpatine had purposefully given false information to the Rebels, revealing that the Death Star was operational and ready for action. In addition, the Emperor had a fleet of Star Destroyers waiting to ambush the Rebels.\n\n# Section 2\nOnboard the seized shuttle, Tydirium, the Rebels took the Emperor's bait and sent a group to Endor. Solo piloted the shuttle to the moon's surface after using a stolen clearance code that the Executor cleared, despite it being old. After sensing Vader on the Executor, Luke began to have second thoughts about joining the mission; he feared Vader would sense his presence through the Force and jeopardize the entire operation. Vader had certainly discovered his son and had ordered the ship to pass before reporting to the Emperor. Solo’s team landed and the mission could proceed as planned.\n\n# Section 3\nAfter arriving on the planet, Solo's party made their way through the forest until they came across two Imperial scout warriors. Solo tried to sneak up on the soldiers, but his plan backfired when he stepped on a twig, revealing his location and forcing him to confront them openly. Two additional nearby Scout Troopers were alerted by the disturbance and escaped on speeder bikes to report to the main Imperial base. In pursuit, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa mounted the speeder bikes of the troops Solo had killed. Skywalker and Organa found themselves chasing the 2 Troopers and eventually caught up to them, preventing the Troopers from alerting the Base. Leia however, got separated from Luke and did not return to the rendezvous point in time. Skywalker, Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 started a search for her in the forest. The rest of the group continued with the mission objective.\n\n# Section 4\nThe group searching for Organa got caught by Ewoks and taken to their village. Organa herself, on the other hand, had been found by Wicket Wystri Warrick, a native Ewok, after she had been knocked unconscious by crashing her speeder bike. Wicket was originally wary of Organa, unsure if she was a friend or foe because she was human and the nearby stormtroopers had slain numerous Ewoks. She gained his trust after they were ambushed by Scout Troopers and fought together to defeat them. He then escorted her back to his village. After being kidnapped by the Ewoks and transported to Bright Tree Village, where they were to be sacrificed, she was reunited with Han, Luke, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2. If Skywalker hadn't persuaded the Ewoks to help them by levitating C-3PO on his god-throne, the Rebel heroes would have perished. The Rebels were anointed as formal members of the Ewok tribe after explaining their narrative. One of the Ewoks also indicated that he knew the quickest path to the Endor shield generator, prompting Han Solo to question C-3PO which way, as well as their need for their weapons and fresh food, immediately after the latter revealed this.\n\n# Section 5\nThat night, after inquiring about Leia Organa's real mother, Luke Skywalker disclosed to her that she was his sister and that Darth Vader was their father, shocking the Princess. Skywalker left the Ewok village with a twofold purpose: to hide his comrades from discovery and to surrender to Vader in an attempt to sway him away from the evil side, believing that Vader had sensed his presence and had come to the moon in search of him. The Rebels descended onto a secret entry to the Imperial bunker the next day, fully rendezvoused with each other and accompanied by an army of Ewok warriors. In an attempt to create a diversion, one of the Ewoks, Paploo, climbed aboard a nearby speeder bike and raced away into the forest, initially causing the Rebels some fear due to the high chance of being caught. After most of the Scout Troopers defending the entrance bolted in pursuit of the Ewok, Solo and the rest of the rebels snuck into the bunker, enticing the last trooper towards the waiting task force and forcing him to surrender, and began setting explosives after capturing the Imperials within. They were attacked by another force of Imperials commanded by Colonel Dyer and then Lieutenant Renz after the former was shoved beyond a railing to his death by General Solo, who led them out of the bunker where they were confronted by hundreds of stormtroopers and AT-STs. The Rebels and Ewoks swiftly took these Troopers out and blew the base up. The ground operation was a success.\n\n# Section 6\nThe Alliance Fleet enters hyperspace at the same time the commandos were caught by the Imperials and moved to attack the Death Star, which appeared to be unshielded. Sensors were not detecting the residue of an active or deactivated shield, which meant that the Empire was jamming the Alliance and the shield was likely still up. They backed up to avoid colliding with the shield, though some pilots failed to do so in time and collided with it. Once an Imperial fleet arrived, the Rebels quickly figured out it was a trap.\n\n# Section 7\nAs the Imperials released the TIEs into space, the battle began. The TIEs destroyed some of the smaller warships, and both fleets attacked from afar. TIE bombers eventually entered the fray, requiring multiple squadrons to fight them before they could reach the fleet. They next had to defend the medical frigate, which had been badly damaged by the TIE bombers and fighters earlier. The Star Destroyer fleet, on the other hand, did not attack the Rebels after being commanded to do so by the Emperor, who planned to surprise the Rebels by employing the fleet simply to prevent them from fleeing. The Emperor's previous \"surprise\" to his officers was soon revealed to be a demonstration of the battle station's operability: the Death Star II destroyed Liberty with its main superlaser. The Rebels were taken aback because they had assumed the Death Star's weaponry systems were not yet functioning. Calrissian convinced Ackbar out of retreat, reminding the admiral that this was their only chance to take out the Death Star II. Calrissian proposed to Admiral Gial Ackbar that the Rebel fleet attack the Imperial Navy at point-blank range, expecting that the Death Star would hold fire to prevent Imperial ships from being destroyed, and if it didn't succeed, they'd at least take a few Imperial ships with them. Soon, the two sides were fighting at ranges of only a few hundred metres, and the Death Star was forced to reduce its firing. This however did not prevent the Battle Station from taking out multiple Rebel ships.\n\n# Section 8\nAdmiral Ackbar ordered the fighter squadrons to attack the Death Star's main reactor after receiving information that the Rebel strike team on Endor had destroyed the shield generator. With many TIE Fighters and TIE Interceptors from Scythe Squadron and the 181st Imperial Fighter Wing in pursuit, General Calrissian took advantage of the new tactical situation that had occurred earlier and led all of the surviving fighters from Red and Gold Squadrons into the Death Star's superstructure. General Calrissian ordered the majority of the remaining fighters to split up and return to the surface in order to draw the attention of a few of the remaining fighters. In the end, this succeeded, as the Millennium Falcon and Antilles were pursued by only two TIE fighters. However, the Millennium Falcon suffered minor damage when Lando Calrissian accidentally scraped part of the Millennium Falcon against the overhead while navigating through the battle station, resulting in the rectenna of the ship being knocked clean off. After a long time of navigating through the inside of the Death Star, Antilles and General Calrissian made it to the Death Star's main reactor chamber. Antilles used proton torpedoes to hit the reactor core's power regulator, while Calrissian went after the core itself, rushing out of the core tube and narrowly escaping just as the core erupted behind them. The pursuing TIE interceptors, on the other hand, were unable to avoid the resultant firestorm and were destroyed while pursuing the Millennium Falcon near the exit. This resulted in the Death Star blowing up and the Rebellion winning this battle.\n\n# Section 9\nDuring the space and ground battle, Luke Skywalker was on the Death Star, after he got taken there by Vader. Luke’s attempt to turn Vader back to the light side had failed, and he was in Palpatine's room together with Vader and Palpatine. As Luke was watching his friends of the Rebel Alliance fall into Palpatine's trap as Palpatine tried to turn Luke to the dark side of the Force. Luke tried to assassinate Palpetine, he was however not successful in doing so, as Vader blocked his attempt. Luke then engaged in a duel with Vader, in which Vader tried to turn Luke to the dark side as well. Luke gave into the attempts, and charged at Vader, using the dark side to boost his physical powers. Vader was taken by surprise and was quickly beaten by Luke. Vader lost his footing and crashed against a railing on the side of the bridge as uke continued to strike him with ferocious power punches. After a few more blows, Luke used an undercut to push Vader's lightsaber away and brought his weapon down on Vader's wrist, severing Vader's weapon hand and knocking him to the ground. Sidious was smiling and declaring his joy with Luke's power as Luke held his defenseless father at bladepoint. Luke took his prosthetic hand from his lightsaber and glanced down at it as Palpatine prodded him to finish Vader and take his position at the Dark Lord's side. Luke recognized he was on the verge of replicating Vader's fate as he glanced from it to the severed stump of Vader's own mechanical hand, and took a long breath to calm himself. Luke declared that he would never succumb to the dark side, deactivating his lightsaber and tossing it aside, reaffirming his Jedi status.\n\n# Section 10\nPalpatine, being enraged that he had failed to turn Luke, declared that if Luke did not turn, he would die. Once he said that, he unleashed his Force Lightning towards Luke, who was unable to act against it. As Luke fell down to the floor, screaming of pain, he begged his father to help him. Vader did not give in. Palpatine stopped torturing Luke after a few more moments and told him that his time had come. He resumed his attack, preparing to ramp up the intensity of his lightning to fatal levels. However, unnoticed behind him, beneath the mantle of Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker, unable to bear the sight of his son screaming in pain, found himself in a similar position to that of twenty-three years ago, when he made the decision to save Sidious from Mace Windu, who had been killed by the Emperor, and this began to bring back all of Anakin's painful memories. The decisions he made back then had led him down this path, had led him to lose everything and everyone he ever loved. Those decisions led him to kill hundreds of Jedi, including his old Master and led him to lose his wife. But, as he realized, he didn’t have to lose his son. Anakin Skywalker started to fight Vader and at that very moment, Darth Vader was no more. Anakin Skywalker grabbed Palpatine, ending his attacks on Luke. Anakin threw Palpatine down the reactor shaft, ending the life of his old Master. The Sith Order was destroyed.\n\n# Section 11\nLuke got back up and helped his father get to a shuttle, as the station was being evacuated. Vader’s suit had been compromised by the Force Lightning Palpatine unleashed and Anakin realized he wasn’t going to make it. Luke laid Anakin down on the ship’s ramp and with his last wish, Vader asked Luke to remove his helmet, so he could see him with his own eyes. Shortly after this, he passed away. Luke took his body with him on the shuttle and departed from the station, which was about to blow up.\n\n# Section 12\nThe Empire had been defeated once more, with this devastating blow by the rebellion, it slowly started to fall apart. The remaining parts of the Empire were hunted down and destroyed. The victory in the battle of Endor was celebrated on Endor, together with the Ewoks. The people all around the galaxy were now free of the Empire’s reign. The new Republic and the Jedi Order started building and balance had been restored. The Battle of Endor was a major turning point in history and the galaxy was at peace once again.\n\n","meta":{"index":33,"author":"DeBraamster","name":"Battle of Endor","release_year":2021}},"Battle of Ilum":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Battle of Ilum was also known as Operation Dark Ice and occurred on the ice world of Ilum, where the war between the Galactic and the Sith Empire raged. During the war, a Sith, Darth Malgus, declared himself the new Sith Emperor and asked his fellow Sith to join him to create a “New Empire”; with this new power quickly occupying Ilum, the sides who were previously opposing each other, the Sith Empire and the Republic,  then joined forces to slay Malgus and end this new threat.# Section 1\nIn 3640 BBY, after the Sith Empire discovered Adegan crystals on Ilum, they sent Grand Moff Regus and the Dark Council Member Darth Arho with an Imperial force. They named this invasion “Operation Dark Ice”; in response to this invasion, the Republic sent their force, under Supreme Commander Rans and Jedi Master Jaric Kaedan.\n\n# Section 2\nIn the start, the Sith Empire had the advantage, after slaying Jedi Master Kaedan and Admiral Shai. In addition, they executed a surprise attack against Supreme Commander Rans and were able to capture him. With the deaths of Master Kaedan, Admiral Shai, and the capture of Supreme Commander Rans, the Republic was at loss and did not know what to do next; but an unexpected ally appeared, Darth Malgus. Shatterstorm, a codenamed mission during the war was led by Talz commandos but was intercepted by Operative Che'nash, a mercenary working for the Shrikaansi Reconnaissance Company. Her job was to infiltrate and get more information on the Talz mission. Later, Malgus revealed his secret of being in contact with Rans, the Supreme Commander, he provided deactivation codes and information on how to defeat Darth Arho; helping the Republic to free Supreme Commander Rans. With Darth Malgus's help, the Republic and Malgus were able to defeat Darth Arho in a ruined Ilum Temple.\n\n# Section 3\nAlthough Arho had died he was able to complete the mission “Operation Dark Ice”, extracting Adegan crystals. However, before the Empire could get the crystal shipment, Darth Malgus intercepted their transport and took away the Adegan crystals, transmitting his takeover to the galaxy whilst also announcing his New Empire. With his new wealth of Adegan crystals, both the Republic and the Sith Empire felt threatened, both of the groups gathered their war councils to discuss Darth Malgus’s proclamation because he could make stealth ships with the Adegan crystals he acquired. Making the first move in this new battle, Malgus sent his associate, the traitorous Darth Serevin to attack both the Republic and the Imperial forces that stayed on Ilum. Following the start of  Severin's attack, Cole Cantarus of the Corellian Security Force and General Hesker of the Imperial Guard both with their respective attack forces launched retaliation strikes against Serevin. In the end, both of the groups combined to defeat Serevin and find the coordinates of Malgus’ space station. Finding the space station, the combined forces attacked the station, and battle troops of all sorts including defecting Sith and Imperial soldiers, Trandoshan warriors, Mandalorian mercenaries, Anomid scientists, and extermination droids from the Foundry. As they attacked, Malgus activated the self-destruct sequence, incinerating the station itself plus the attacking fleets. Activating the self-destruct button, he leaped down the throne and started engaging the combined forces. Although he had significant fighting experience, he lost when his resolve faltered and he was thrown into a reactor shaft supposedly dying alongside his Empire.\n\n# Section 4\nAfter Malgus’ defeat, Ilum was in the hands of the Republic while the Empire was on the brink of extinction, even though they were able to get the Adegan crystals extracted. This was mostly due to infighting within the Sith but with the ending of the battle; two years later a world caught the eye of the Empire, Makeb, somewhere in between the Republic and Hutt Space.\n\n","meta":{"index":55,"author":"Vahndar","name":"Battle of Ilum","release_year":2021}},"Attack of Emperor Fel":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Galactic Empire saw the Yuuzhan Vong terraforming project as a failure. Around 127 ABY, The project was an effort to restore planets that had been damaged during the Yuuzhan Vong War. However, many things went wrong on the planets where the project took place, and because of this many mutations were occurring. The empire’s knowledge about the Yuuzhan Vong War was not forgotten, and this only made them angry. The empire would declare war on the Galactic Alliance, which supported the Ossus project for a new Jedi Order.\n\nUntil a year into the war, the Empire was performing poorly; it wasn’t until the Sith Order emerged and offered their assistance. Thanks to the help of the Sith, the tide started to turn. However, the sith would cause the Ossus project to fail as well as make an alliance offer to Grand Admiral Morlish Veed and Moff Nyna Calixte. Veed assumed that the sith were talking about him and his lover when they said that they would replace Emperor Fel with someone far stronger. Veed and his lover accepted because of this, as for the Moff Council was manipulated into accepting the sith’s deal.# Section 1\nUpon the surrender in 130 ABY, Darth Maladi met with Moff Calixte and Admiral Veed, and the time had come for the removal of Fel from his throne. The meeting was set into Fel’s schedule with the Moffs; however, Calixte had second thoughts and feared that the sith would name their leader, Darth Krayt, the new Emperor. Calixte warned Fel in secret, informing him that the sith intended to kill him. Fel decided to place a double on the throne during the meeting.\n\n# Section 2\nFel and the Moffs started the meeting ahead of schedule discussing the terms of the alliance’s surrender. Halfway through the conference, Darths Krayt, Maladi, Nihi, and Wyyrlok arrived. Fel’s decoy was curious, so he asked what reward the sith wanted for their assistance in war, Krayt responded with, “The Emperor’s life”, in which Fel’s Imperial Knight bodyguards moved to protect Fel’s double. They were no match for the sith and quickly disposed of. Mohrgan Fel and Fel’s other protectors were also killed quickly. Darth Krayt then killed Fel’s decoy and declared himself emperor. With the war now over, Krayt stated that he would put his grand vision into action. \n\nKrayt was quick to realize that the man he killed was not Fel, as he was skilled in the force and in lightsaber combat, where Fel’s double did little to nothing to defend himself. Krayt would send Maladi to visit Calixte, accusing her of informing Fel of the Imminent attack. Before leaving, Maladi would threaten Calixte, telling the Moff that she now served the Sith Lord. Krayt would proclaim that Fel is a fugitive from Imperial justice, and his agents began looking for him. For the next several years Fel and those who would remain loyal to him would launch hit and run attacks on the Krayt Empire.\n\n","meta":{"index":1,"author":"IanationMC","name":"Attack of Emperor Fel","release_year":2020}},"Battle of Kashyyyk (New Sith Wars)":{"content":"# Introduction\nKashyyyk was located in the Mid-Rim territories. As well as that, it was located on the Kashyyyyk system and the Mytaranor sector. Kashyyyk has a 26-hour rotation period and a 381 orbital period, and the planet Kashyyyk has three moons.\n\nThis significant battle was named the Battle of Kashyyyk during the New Sith Wars. This war had started due to a disagreement between the Galactic Republic and the Brotherhood of Darkness. Due to the fact that this disagreement happened, the Brotherhood of the Darkness wanted to take over the Wookie world, known as Kashyyyk.# Section 1\nTroops were entering the planet of Kashyyyk wave after wave, by the Sith. The Galactic Republic had major disadvantages in the number of troops; however, they were set on not allowing themselves to get rid of it. Once the Sith’s fleet first landed on the planet of Kashyyyk, the Galactic Republic decided to hide inside the Wroshyr forests along with all of their forces. The Sith troopers have never fought on treetops; due to this, they were not as good at fighting on them. The Galactic Republic soldiers and the Wookie guides used the kshyy vines to hide behind them as they were tall vines. Thousands of the Sith soldiers were being murdered and even died without being able to see the enemy. The Sith masters did not care, and they still sent more troops into the maelstrom.\n\n# Section 2\nThe second wave of reinforcements included a batch called the ‘Gloom Walkers.’ which was commanded by Lieutenant Ulabore. The Gloom Walkers were separated from the rest of the reinforcements and the main lines of the battle taking place and ended up being behind the enemy lines. There was a man named Dessel who was one of them. He was also force sensitive, so he was able to see the locations of the enemies even though he could not see them, due to this the Gloom Walkers were not falling for the Galactic Republic’s traps. It took three to four days and nights for the Gloom Walkers to return to the Sith’s forces. The Gloom Walker’s story became very famous in the Sith army, and most people remembered it. It took around two thousand units; however, the Sith finally won the battle and captured Kashyyyk.\n\n# Section 3\nOnce the planet of Kashyyyk fell to the Sith, the remaining Republic troops went to the world of Trandosha to escape from the Sith. Once the Sith found out about this, they sent twenty units and the Gloom Walkers in pursuit.

The casualties of this battle were nothing short of genocide and near extermination of the entire Cilare race.\nAll but one Cilare, Commander Arbeloa, leader of the Cilare armies, only survived after being taken onto a Yuuzhan Vong slave-ship named the “Tsam P’ah”.# Section 1\nWhile being held captive, he managed to submit a signal into space which was picked up by the two-man crew of a ship known as the Pythea, the crew of this ship was Chiss Panha, and her Wookiee friend Sarkkin.

He had known the story of what had happened between the Chiss and the Yuuzhan Vong and understood their military prowess and threat to the galaxy. The combatants from the Cilare were documented as only a few fierce warriors and only a handful of tanks, that were wiped out by the attack of Fire-Breathers held captive by the Yuuzhan Vong under the command of Commander Sha’kel.

The Great Hunt’s purpose was to send exceptionally powerful Jedi Knights out into the galaxy with the intention of exterminating Sith loyalists and their beastly creations. It was one of the few Jedi offences designed to carry out the complete extinction of numerous different species, though it can be argued it was done with a pure and justified purpose.# Section 1\nPart I: Origin of the Great Hunt\n\nDuring the era of the Old Republic and reign of the Brotherhood of Darkness, the Dark Lord of the Sith, Exar Kun reigned over his subordinate Sith followers and waged a war against the Galactic Republic. During this war Exar Kun and many of the Sith under his command, notably his Sith sorcerers and alchemists conducted experiments with forbidden knowledge gained from lost Sith holocrons and from a variety of Sith tombs on worlds such as Korriban and Yavin IV. \n\nThe experiments with the most devastating effects were undoubtedly those that produced the dark-side corrupted beasts that would serve a singular purpose; the consumption of force-sensitives. These beasts fuelled with dark side energy inhabited dozens of planets and actively sought out locations and populations ripe with force-sensitive energy with the purpose of consuming the blood of force-sensitive individuals. \n\nAs a result of the harm these creatures were causing, towards the end of the Great Sith War, the Jedi Council decided it was their responsibility and duty to seek out these creatures and eradicate them. Surprisingly this was the only order of genocide issued by the Jedi Council that was not met with any controversy or backlash, as the threat of these creatures and their intent was too harmful to ignore.\n\n# Section 2\nAnd as such, the Jedi Council dispatched a variety of talented Jedi Knights to complete this unique and exceptionally dangerous task; to hunt and kill the very creatures designed to hunt and kill them.\n\n# Section 3\nPart II: The Hunters\n\nThe Jedi Council was highly selective when making the decision of who to send after the various creatures plaguing the galaxy. The Jedi chosen had to be expert hunters and trackers, as well as maintain a mastery of the force and lightsaber in order to be a match for what they would soon face. There were at least a dozen Jedi chosen for this task, but only four are noted in galactic records. \n\nThe group put together had no distinct leader, all known members being of the position of Jedi Knight, but three we know of notably had a force-bond that allowed them to compliment each other’s abilities and helped them against the allure of the dark side, to an extent. \n\n\nDuron Qel-Droma\n\nThe first notable member of the Great Hunt retinue is Duron Qel-Droma. Duron Qel-Droma stemmed from the Qel-Droma family, a notably force-sensitive family who had strong ties to the Jedi Order and unfortunately for young Duron, the Sith as well. Duron Qel-Droma was uniquely strong in his ability to influence the minds of other people and creatures, he employed this consistently during the Great Hunt and would often choose not to utilize his lightsaber, even when facing the great and terrible beasts of his hunts.\n\n# Section 4\nShaela Nuur\n\nThe second notable member of the Great Hunt retinue is Shaela Nuur. Once said to be the most promising student of Master Ood Bnar, which is no small compliment considering the many Padawans the elderly Master had taught as well as the many centuries he’d lived for, Shaela Nuur was exceptional at lightsaber combat and was one of few Jedi capable of hunting and killing great beasts, including the ones hunted during the Great Hunt. She was seen doing this single handedly on numerous occasions. \n\nGuun Han Saresh\n\nThe third notable member of the Great Hunt retinue is Guun Han Saresh. This particular Jedi Knight is perhaps the most surprising to be considered an expert hunter of the group, having grown up on the city world of Taris to a wealthy family it is indeed unique that he would have developed such a talent for hunting beasts. Perhaps what is even more unique is that Guun Han Saresh utilized a force-imbued sword, not unlike the ones used by the ancient Je’daii of Tython and a compound bow, with which he was a brilliant marksman.\n\n# Section 5\nCale Berkona\n\nThe forth and least notable member of the Great Hunt retinue is Cale Berkona. Cale was a newly minted Jedi Knight and as such was considered the least experienced and talented of the group. He did not maintain the bond that the original three members had and would only join the retinue for one of their hunts before being gravely injured, having his lightsaber destroyed and being returned to Dantooine for medical treatment. For this young Knight though, perhaps this was a blessing in disguise. \n\n\n\nCollectively these brave and noble Knights set off to carry out what was arguably the most dangerous task in the galaxy at the time, certain they will face conflict and even more certain they run the risk of losing their lives, for these chosen Knights this was nothing to fear.\n\n","meta":{"index":12,"author":"seko1111","name":"Great Hunt (Jedi)","release_year":2021}},"First of the New Jedi Order":{"content":"# Introduction\nAfter the virtual extermination of the old Jedi Order by Emperor Palpatine, few survivors remained; those that did went into hiding. Eventually, Obi-Wan Kenobi introduced a young man named Luke Skywalker to the Jedi ways. Luke would play a key role in the fall of the Emperor and the redemption of his father, Anakin Skywalker, who turned against the Jedi Order at the start of the Purge. This made Luke the primary heir to the Order. Skywalker's first thoughts of training an apprentice came right after the Battle of Endor. During the Ssi-ruuvi invasions, Skywalker came in contact with a young Force-sensitive boy named Dev Sibwarra. After rescuing the boy from the Ssi-ruuk, Skywalker had plans to train Sibwarra as his first apprentice. During the Battle of Bakura, Dev sustained mortal injuries and died aboard the Millennium Falcon. Due to Sibwarra's death and a growing fear that he would create the next Vader, Skywalker became reluctant to take on an apprentice. Around the time of the Nagai Tof War, Skywalker received several requests for training from young freedom fighters who hoped to become Jedi Knights, but Skywalker's reluctance remained.# Section 1\nHe refused to train the young hopefuls on the excuse that he was not yet prepared to take on apprentices. When Luke began instructing new recruits to the Rebellion in warfare, recruits such as Kiro, Barney, and the Rik Duel gang, they assumed that Luke would be teaching them to wield the Force but were disappointed when Luke refused to school them in Force techniques. Luke's refusals also had a negative effect, as one of the first people to request his training, Flint, became embittered when Luke refused to train him and turned to the dark side. Luke's hesitance to take on an apprentice continued until he faced the consequences of his reluctant viewpoint. The young woman Vila came to Luke requesting training, and when Luke refused, she brought him to Naldar to help liberate the planet. On Naldar, Luke came face to face with Flint, now wielding the power of the dark side. In the subsequent battle, Vila was killed, and Flint was arrested and put into the custody of the New Republic. Luke began to see that giving in to the fear of failure was not the path. Luke told the Iskalonian Kiro that he would begin to train him, but before it could begin, Kiro went MIA in the Nagai-Tof War and became disillusioned with the thought of becoming a Jedi. After this rocky start, Luke put his plans for a new Jedi Order on hold.\n\n# Section 2\nFor a number of years after this, Skywalker continued to hone his own skills as he worked as a Jedi Knight throughout the galaxy. During this time, he made a number of discoveries relating to the Jedi, on planets such as Circarpous V, Toola, and Dathomir, and also briefly taught Prince Isolder the basic tenets of the Force. As he was not Force-sensitive, the Prince provided a risk-free student for Luke to practice on.  It was also during this time that Skywalker met many individuals who would eventually become members of his Jedi Order. Perhaps most notable was Kyle Katarn, whom Skywalker met in 4 ABY during the crisis of the Valley of the Jedi. Katarn already possessed a lightsaber and had some rudimentary insights into the Force, mastering Force powers such as Force speed. The rise of the cloned Palpatine shook Skywalker out of his solitary existence. As foretold by Bodo Baas's Master a thousand years earlier, this was a critical time during the history of the Jedi. Faced with the threat of awesome power, Skywalker decided to train under the Emperor and to try to defeat him from the inside. However, in doing so, Skywalker succumbed to the influence of the dark side.\n\n# Section 3\nHe was brought back to the light side by his sister, Leia Organa Solo, who also stole a precious Holocron from the Emperor. On the run from Imperial forces, Luke and Leia gathered around them a cadre of Force-sensitives that Luke began to instruct. These included the redeemed Kam Solusar, Vima-Da-Boda, the Ysanna siblings Jem and Rayf, and Jedi Purge survivor King Empatojayos Brand. Defeating the Emperor did not come without a price. Jem, Rayf, and Brand lost their lives, while Vima fled back into the underworld. The cost to Luke was dear also? his experience under the dark side's sway would scar his soul permanently. However, he gained an appreciation of his own strength and a deeper realization of what it would cost to return the Jedi Knights to the galaxy. This ideal and his enhanced powers made Luke the first new Jedi Master of the reborn Jedi Order. Other gains made were the redemption of Kam and the acquisition of the Bodo Baas Holocron.\n\n","meta":{"index":9,"author":"","name":"First of the New Jedi Order","release_year":0}},"Korriban Incursion":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Korriban Incursion was a battle that took place during the Galactic War between the Republic and the Sith Empire in 3637 BBY.

The first wave allowed the Republic to breach the Valley of the Dark Lords, but they were soon stopped in their tracks by Imperial forces.# Section 1\nDuring the second wave of the Incursion, four Republic heroes took out the Imperial forces and then killed Lord Renning. After the heroes completed their initial task, they helped the Republic forces decide whether or not they should free the Imperial servants. The Republic then advanced towards the Sith Academy in pursuit of its goal. Once they entered the Academy, they went and defeated nearby Sith Instructors so they could access the turbolift to the Dark Council Chamber. The heroes swiftly took out Darth Soverus.

However, their meeting was cut short when word of an Assault on Tython broke out. This forced the heroes and a group of Republic forces to leave and assist their allies on Tython in retaking the planet.

Importantly, this race faced constant crime from the Ereesi species encouraging them to join the Galactic Republic. The Republic only accepted this request due to the Argazdan being closely related to humans, and the Argazdan’s expressional desperation.\n\nFor many years, the Republic Navy relentlessly defended the Argazdans from the hatred-filled efforts of the Ereesi. This lent time to the Argazdans who began building their own formidable military which would later be used to oppress the Lorrdians. Ironically, the Argazdans departed from the Republic alliance citing that it was “corrupt and faithless” only to later exhibit the same characteristics.\n\nIt is unknown whether these characteristics stem from the Argazdan’s belief in Vianism or if it was from their many decades of suffering gifted to them by the Ereesi.# Section 1\nThis term was essentially used to describe the wars and battles that the Argazdan engaged in for a long period of time. The Argazdan’s also endured their own civil war with Loyalists rebelling. These Loyalists caused more damage than would normally be permitted as the Argazdan navy was out eradicating the Ereesi homeworld of Ereesus. Ereesus was literally razed to the ground with not a single life being spared.\n\nGovernor Myrial, the leader of the Argazdan at the time began a conquest of razing other planets and species. One of these included the Amaltanna. The Amaltanna were supported by the Lorddians which the fruitless Governor punished by enslaving the entire Lorrdians race. This autocratic and dictatorial regime lasted hundreds of years with the Mandalorian and Sith wars preventing the Jedi from intervening. \n\nThe power that the Argazdan’s held was however, slowly eroded by the chains of time, and the last Governor made a pact of a demonic alien artisan shaper who was an expert in bioengineering. The alien constructed a monster which was buried in the Slave Pits of Lorrd and only discovered later by the scientist mentioned in the Argazdan case study.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Lorrdian Jedi Mari-Elan Nora led a task force into the Kanz Sector finally freeing over (500,000,000) Lorddians from their (300) year enslavement.

As the Clone Wars were beginning to end in the Galactic Republic’s favor, the Confederacy of Independent Systems launched an attack on the Republic’s capital of Coruscant to turn the tide of the war. With Venator Class Star Destroyers coming desperately to box in the separatist fleet, many Jedi leaders participated in the battle, including Jedi Master Mace Windu, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Master Shaak Ti, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Grandmaster Yoda, and many more. This battle would be a decisive battle that could have been in either side’s favor. However, it did result in victory for the Republic and the death of Count Dooku, the head of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.# Section 1\nAs the Clone Wars raged on, the Confederacy of Independent Systems was pushed out of the core worlds to the Outer Rim. The war was leaning in the Republic’s favor, as Chancellor Palpatine even sent some of the core world’s defense fleets to the Outer Rim to assist republic forces. With most of the political elite on Coruscant at the time, no one could have expected a Separatist invasion, as Coruscant was in the Deep Core Region of the Galaxy, and fleets would have been identified before they could reach the capital. With a secret hyperspace lane being given by Lord Sidious himself, the separatist rallied the largest fleet seen in the Clone Wars, composed of thousands of ships. The attack was under the command of General Grievous with his flagship, “The Invisible Hand.” With the Coruscant Defense Fleet still relatively still composed of a great number of Venator Star Destroyers and frigates, the Separatist caught the Republic forces off guard and broke through the fleet unleashing droid forces down on the surface of Coruscant.\n\n# Section 2\nWith a desperate move to stop the invasion force, the Republic Defense Fleet made a protective screen, and a large orbital battle raged on between the two fleets. With the orbital battle being filled with chaos, hell broke out on the surface, as hundreds of millions of battle droids, armored units, and bombers were causing massive panic in the population. As a lack of communications caused an absence of riot control, evacuation, and emergency response, vulture droids were raining from the sky targeting buildings and landing kamikaze attacks. Luckily for the Republic, with battle analytics, the Republic was able to get communications back online after learning the Separatist forces used a similar tactic in the Battle of Praesitlyn. This allowed the Jedi to lead the Grand Army of the Republic to defend the planet of Coruscant, as Jedi Master Saesee Tiin, Jedi Master Mace Windu, and 22 Jedi pilots all took off to the orbital battle. Master Window was shot down before making it to orbit but reinforced Grandmaster Yoda and assisted in leading ground forces against millions of droids. However, Jedi like Master Tiin broke through and assisted in the orbital battle that raged amongst thousands of ships. The Jedi pilots were also able to send a transmission to the Outer Rim Sieges of the battle, which allowed the Republic to send reinforcements.\n\n# Section 3\nWith the Venator Class Star Destroyer, “The Impavid,” being at the brink of destruction, General Tiin led a battalion of jet troopers to take an enemy cruiser. As this was happening, Grandmaster Yoda, Master Window, and ARC-77 (Fordo) made significant progress on the surface. They noticed that the Separatist forces weren’t pushing towards the temple or senate building. Rather, it was a diversion to capture the Supreme Chancellor. Jedi Masters Shaak Ti, Roron Corobb, Stass Allie, and Foul Moudama were sent to secure the Chancellor’s safety but were soon chased by General Grievous himself. Stass Allie and a few royal guards were able to hold Grievous off but were soon dealt with as Grievous continued to pursue the Chancellor. The chase went on to the Maglev Train Station, where the Jedi were able to lose Grievous for a while. This allowed Master Shaak Ti to regroup with Jedi Masters Stass Allie, Mace Windu, and Kit Fisto, where they sent Chancellor Palpatine to another district. Jedi Masters Roth-Del Masona and B’ink Utrila would reinforce Corobb and Moudama in securing the Chancellor. Masters Fisto and Windu joined the battle. However, General Grievous was able to land near the Chancellor, killing the four Jedi protecting him. While Master Allie notified Windu and Fisto of the situation, Shaak Ti tried to stop Grievous from escaping, not before being neutralized. Master Windu arrives just as Grievous is escorting the Chancellor on a shuttle and wounds Grievous using Force. However, Grievous was able to escape with the Chancellor. Jedi Masters Windu, Fisto, Agen Kolar, Pablo-Jill, and many pilots pursued Grievous in a last-ditch effort to save the Chancellor but were unsuccessful, having Jedi Master Pablo-Jill and Jedi Knight L’lacielo Sageon being caught in “The Invisible Hand’s” tractor beam. The two Jedi were then slaughtered, and their bodies dumped into space, as Grievous announced to a live HoloNet transmission on the capture of Palpatine and how the Republic will soon burn.\n\n# Section 4\nThe tide of the battle would soon change, as a massive force of Spaarti Clones from Centax-2 were deployed to assist the Jedi on the ground forces. Fleets from the Outer Rim Sieges, Open Circle Armanda, and new secret fleets with Imperator-Class Star Destroyers appeared out of hyperspace as they cut off the Separatist from escaping with the Chancellor. This caused the remaining separatist ships to defend “The Invisible Hand,” and the final stages of the Battle of Coruscant were almost to a conclusion. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker made their way into “The Invisible Hand.” As they infiltrated the ship, they engaged the head of the Separatists, Count Dooku.

During his reign, the fanatical Chancellor began a series of crusades that would come in the form of war, purges, and genocide. Officially known as the Recusal, the Jedi Order declared itself independent from the Republic in 11,933 BBY and completely withdrew back to Ossus. Throughout the next millennium, the Jedi Order fought an internal struggle regarding the correct response to the insanity of the Contispex dynasty and the Pius Dea rule it had established. While the majority of the Order refused to fight against the very government it had protected for millennia, some Jedi served as Knights errant, taking the fight to the cultists without the permission of the High Council. Others declared for the Pius Dea, forming a splinter group called the Order of the Terrible Glare. It wasn't until the 11,100s BBY that the Order was approached by the Caamasi and were finally convinced to end their period of isolationism and intervene. The Jedi High Council joined with the Bureau of Ships and Services in seeding the cathedral ships of the Pius Dea with a crippling virus and plotting to arrest the current Chancellor.# Section 1\nIn a stunning move, a Jedi strike team boarded Chancellor Contispex XIX's flagship, the Flame of Sinthara, and arrested him on war crime charges. In accordance with the terms set forth by the Jedi Order at the start of their involvement, the Jedi High Council suspended the Galactic Senate and placed Grand Master Biel Ductavis in the position of Supreme Chancellor. A few generations later, the Jedi Order had returned to their peaceful ways on Ossus upon seeing the Republic make a full recovery from the Pius Dea Era. However, in 7000 BBY the Jedi suffered a Second Great Schism, resulting in a time known to history as the Hundred-Year Darkness. The schism stemmed from the Order's reaction to a group of heretical Dark Jedi experimenting with forbidden alchemy. The monstrosities which arose were deemed abominations to the Force by the High Council and war was begun to end the practice of these dark arts. By this time the Order had managed to develop the lightsaber in a way in which it was useful in hand-to-hand combat. Used before as a siege weapon due to its massive power pack, the Order's scientists were able to create a transportable power pack that could be worn on the belt of the user. Crossing blades with the heretics, the Jedi Order finally saw the end of the conflict with the victory at the battle of Corbos in 6900 BBY.\n\n# Section 2\nThere the Jedi Order arrested the twelve surviving Dark Jedi, led by High General Ajunta Pall, and banished them to Wild Space. Unknown to the Jedi, these Exiles would land on the planet Korriban, homeworld of the Sith species, and conquer the natives, deeming themselves the Dark Lords of the Sith. Shortly after settling on Korriban, a splinter group of exiles, led by Remulus Dreypa, returned to Republic space to enact vengeance but were intercepted by a Jedi patrol. The Jedi pursued those Sith across the galaxy until both factions crash-landed on the planet Kesh. After a period of fighting, the two factions made peace and formed a new organization called the Doomed, striving to achieve the balance between the light and the dark sides of the force. Meanwhile, the Korriban Sith would eventually move their headquarters to Ziost where they would form the massive Sith Empire, an Order of dark side warriors who would dream of crushing their Jedi oppressors.\n\n","meta":{"index":22,"author":"","name":"Pius Dea Era","release_year":0}},"Duel on Mustafar":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Duel of Mustafar occurred in 19 BBY during the Great Jedi Purge. It was a confrontation where Darth Vader, formerly Anakin Skywalker, fought with his Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, on the planet of Mustafar.# Section 1\nIn 19 BBY, the Great Jedi Purge took place after three years of conflict between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Galactic Republic. \n\nAnakin Skywalker informed Master Mace Windu that the Chancellor is the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious. Windu then collected a party of Jedi Masters consisting Kit Fisto, Agen Kolar, and Saesee Tiin, in an attempt to arrest the Chancellor in his office. \n\nArriving in the office, Palpatine greeted the team politely, with the Masters informing that he will be taken into custody igniting their lightsabers, threatening the Chancellor, which angered the Chancellor and revealed his true image and quickly charged at them, eliminating the Masters Kolar and Tiin. As Skywalker was arriving, Palpatine defeated Kit Fisto. Then Windu cornered the Sith Lord and the Jedi Knight arrived.\n\nSkywalker then saw the conflict, with the Master attempting to execute Palpatine–he begged Mace Windu to keep the Chancellor alive. Palpatine then struck Force Lightning at the Jedi Master, who deflected the ability back at him, which slowly revealed the true appearance and facial features of the Sith Lord. After the ability slowly fading away, Mace Windu tried to eliminate the Sith Lord but was stopped by Skywalker by severing his hands, resulting in the Chancellor on a chance to defeat Windu–striking the ability again, sending the Master away from the office, onto the streets of Coruscant, resulting in his death.\n\nSkywalker then felt guilty for his participation in the Master’s attempt to exterminate the Chancellor since he knew that the Jedi would not allow him to stay in the Order due to the fact that taking one’s life is extremely forbidden. Palpatine then offered Skywalker to join and turn to the Dark Side to avoid the death of his wife, Padmé Amidala. Running out of options, the Jedi Knight knelt before the Chancellor, now revealed as Darth Sidious, accepting him as his apprentice; calling the Knight, Darth Vader.\n\nLater that time, Darth Sidious commanded all Republic Clone Troopers to execute Order 66, an order to eliminate all existing Jedi across all star systems, resulting in the start of the Great Jedi Purge.\nSidious then told Vader that in order to be strong in the Dark Side, he should return to the Jedi Temple with the 501st Legion and eliminate all members present there, including the younglings.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter all the events in the Jedi Temple, Vader was sent to Mustafar to end the Clone Wars by eliminating the rest of the members of the Separatist Council.\n\nMasters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda arrived in the Temple, seeing all the members eliminated. They watched the security holograms of Skywalker in his dark deeds. Kenobi asked Yoda to quickly head over to Palpatine and execute him since he will be unable to strike down Anakin since he considered him to be a friend, a brother.\n\nYoda told Kenobi that it would not be possible for him to execute the Emperor, especially without assistance, and that the Padawan that he always knew no longer existed.\n\nKenobi then went to Senator Amidala in order to locate Anakin’s whereabouts. But she told him that the last time she had seen Anakin was the previous day, she hesitated telling that Vader went to Mustafar. He told Padmé that he had turned to the Dark Side and the events in the Jedi Temple, but still hesitated to tell Kenobi.\n\nPadmé left to Mustafar in her personal starship, but before she took off, Obi-Wan unnoticeably boarded the ship in one of its storage rooms, and then fled off.\n\n# Section 3\nIn Mustafar, Vader noticed the arrival of Amidala’s ship. He approached her and had a small talk where she revealed that his Master, Kenobi, knew about her pregnancy with Vader. Padmé confronted Vader to stop all his dark deeds and come back to the light. Vader then refused, angering him.\n\nKenobi then showed up by the boarding ramp of the ship, Vader assumed that Padmé sent the Jedi Master to kill him, Force choking his wife. Obi-Wan then demanded to release her, but he believed that Amidala had turned against him. Vader declared that he is no longer afraid of the Dark Side and Kenobi as his enemy. Resulting in both of them igniting their lightsabers, starting a duel.\n\n# Section 4\nThe pair locked blades, fighting in the Klegger Corp Mining Facility, where the members of the Separatist Council were exterminated. The duel then progressed onto different structures of the facility over the lava of Mustafar.\n\nBoth parties then found themselves trapped on the arm of a structure of the facility, which was separated from the facility by the lava spewing out. Obi-Wan then managed to land safely on a lava skiff with Vader following him, jumping onto a droid collector where both continued to fight.\n\nSoon later, Kenobi jumped onto a hill and claimed that the duel was over since he had the high ground. Vader then jumped towards Kenobi, but was striked by him, severing his limbs, falling down to the edge of the hill.\n\n# Section 5\nKenobi spoke to Vader, crying out his emotions, believing that he was the Chosen One that would end the Sith. He was unable to turn his former Padawan back to the light and then retreated and took Anakin’s lightsaber.\n\nDarth Sidious then arrived and found Vader, taking him to the Galactic Capital of Coruscant to be rebuilt. The suit that Vader wore would support him, but would need him to wear it for the rest of his life, otherwise it would cause his death.\n\n","meta":{"index":36,"author":"kurtnicolo","name":"Duel on Mustafar","release_year":2021}},"Last Stand of the Jedi Order":{"content":"# Introduction\nAfter the battle over Coruscant concluded, the Jedi learned from Anakin Skywalker that Palpatine was in fact Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith, and had been responsible for the war to begin with. Mace Windu led a group of Jedi Masters to arrest Sidious, but Sidious managed to kill all four Masters with the help of Anakin Skywalker, who fell to the dark side and became Darth Vader. This was later propagandized by Palpatine as an attempted coup by the Jedi and provided the reason for the start of the Great Jedi Purge in which most of the Jedi were killed. Just after Order 66 was issued, telling all clones to kill their Jedi commanders, Darth Vader went to the Jedi Temple to kill the remaining Jedi situated there. Accompanied by the 501st Legion, Vader killed all of the Jedi, including the younglings, and changed the signal given off by the Temple's emergency beacon to tell Jedi to return to the Temple. Then, Sidious sent Vader to Mustafar to wipe out the last of the Confederacy's leaders, then ordered him to send a deactivation signal to shut down the droid forces, ending the war. Order 66 was successful in wiping out 99% of the entire Order and wiping out the High Council, officially concluding the Order's position as the dominant Force tradition in the galaxy and destroying nearly all of their temples and academies across the galaxy.# Section 1\nIn a final attempt to save the Republic and the Jedi Order from complete extinction, Jedi Masters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi, two of the most notable survivors of Order 66, embarked on a desperate mission to destroy the Sith. Master Kenobi went to fight Darth Vader on Mustafar while Yoda went after Darth Sidious within the bowels of the Senate building. Vader was defeated, losing much of his organic limbs after suffering grievous lightsaber injuries, necessitating the majority of Vader's body being kept in a mobile life-support system to keep him alive. The battle between Yoda and Sidious ended in a stalemate: Yoda was forced to flee with Sidious keeping his life. With Grand Master Yoda and Master Kenobi going into exile, Darth Sidious declared himself Emperor of the Galactic Empire, and saw the Sith rise to galactic dominance again.\n\n","meta":{"index":67,"author":"","name":"Last Stand of the Jedi Order","release_year":0}},"Conquest of Tatooine":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Conquest of Tatooine was an event that involved the purging of the once lush world of Tatooine.

The downfall of the empire was brought when, having already suffered greatly at the hands of a plague, the Infinite Empire sought new ways to stave off the loss of their political power, and more importantly, extinction. As such, in 25,792 BBY the Infinite Empire sought out the planet of Tython, the home of the Jedi, Sith, and Je’daii orders, as it was rumored an Infinity Gate was on the planet. This started the Second Battle of Tython.# Section 1\nPredor Skal’nas, a high ranking member of the Infinite Empire, invaded the planet of Tython in hopes of finding the Prime Infinity Gate. The fighting itself was brutal, with the Rakatan forces obliterating the forces of the Settled Worlds of Tython on Tython’s moon Ashla. The invasion was a remarkable success for Skal’nas up to this point, as he was about to reach his goal. His plans would not reach fruition, however, with Sek’nos Rath breaking free from his Rakatan imprisoners and leading other freed prisoners into battle against the Rakatan forces. Near the Prime Infinity Gate, Skal’nas was pursued and caught by Daegen Lok and Shae Koda, two members of the Je’daii Order. Daegen Lok fought with Skal’nas while Shae Koda fought Skal’nas’ Xesh, his Force Hound, which were Force-sensitive servants of the Infinite Empire. Lok attempted to perform an ability called the “Mind Twist” on Skal’nas, with the intent to enter his mind, but this backfired when Lok had felt the raw emotions from the Predor’s victims. Shae, meanwhile, was attempting to appeal to Xesh’s humanity. During this, Sek’nos Rath was leading the battle further up on Tython’s surface, defeating Trill, another Force Hound. In the midst of the battle,  Skal’nas successfully activated the Prime Infinity Gate, proclaiming his goal of conquering the galaxy. Xesh, meanwhile, begged Shae to surrender during their fight, right before Skal’nas blasted her with Force Lightning, causing Xesh to attack him.\n\n# Section 2\nAt the temple of Anil Kesh, a Je'daii by the name of Tasha Ryo took the A’nang Holocron to the deepest point of the temple, at A’nang’s request so they could use the power of the Tho Yor, which were ships that were later found to be potent superweapons if enough Force Energy was concentrated into them, on the Rakatan fleet. This would come at a cost, however, as Tasha Ryo would have to give her life to activate the Tho Yor. Tasha would end up jumping into the pit where A’nang had led her. Her sight and Force sensitivity would be restored right before she vanished, causing a charge of Force energy to awaken the Tho Yor. As the Tho Yor awakened they opened fire on the Rakatan fleet, while another blast of Force energy destroyed the Prime Infinity Gate. Xesh then defeated Skal’nas, whose body was turned to ash in the flames of the destroyed gate. After his death, the Rakatan forces felt the demise of Skal’nas and fled, with his Sub Predors turning on each other and the remaining Rakatan ships being destroyed by the Settled Worlds fleet.\n\n","meta":{"index":41,"author":"Librarian's Assembly","name":"Second Battle of Tython","release_year":2021}},"Battle of Hoth":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Battle of Hoth was a decisive triumph for the Galactic Empire and one of the Alliance to Restore the Republic's worst battlefield defeats during the Galactic Civil War. The Imperial attack was aimed at eliminating the Rebel Alliance's Echo Base on the distant ice world of Hoth. When a viper probe droid sent by Darth Vader arrived on Hoth, the location of the base was compromised.# Section 1\nImperial forces eventually forced the Rebellion to vacate their base on Yavin 4 following the Rebel Alliance's significant victory at Yavin. If the Yavin 4 base was ever lost, a holocron produced by Bail Organa, one of the Rebel Alliance's founders, provided a list of probable hideouts. Despite the loss of both the Yavin 4 and the Boz Pity bases, Luke Skywalker picked Hoth as the Rebellion's new major base after being stuck on the planet for a length of time around 1 ABY. Following a surprise discovery by a Viper probe droid deployed to the planet, Vader's own Death Squadron fleet arrived in the Hoth system. Luke Skywalker briefly witnessed the arrival of the Viper robot on one of his patrols, mistaking it for a meteorite, but he was unable to explore the matter further before he and his tauntaun were assaulted by a wampa.\n\n# Section 2\nHan Solo ,who had originally planned to leave Hoth due to his status as a wanted criminal by Jabba the Hutt, with the main motivating factor behind the decision being an encounter with a bounty hunter at Ord Mantell, eventually decided to go into the snowstorm to find Luke Skywalker when he failed to report back before the personnel was forced to close the base due to the blizzard. Skywalker was able to flee the wampa cave while also amputating one of the residents, albeit he was left barely alive as a result of the attack as well as being stranded in the storm. Han Solo found Skywalker, who had almost frozen to death. They set up camp and used Han’s dead tauntaun to keep themselves warm.\n\n# Section 3\nZev Senesca, posing as Rogue Two, was dispatched the next morning to scout for them and bring them back to base, with Solo answering to his calling. Skywalker's injuries were treated in a bacta tank once he was recovered and returned to Echo Base. After examining unusual radio communications detected up near the shield generator, Solo discovered and engaged the Viper, who fought it alongside Chewbacca. After Solo attempted to disable it with a blaster, the probe droid self-destructed, but not before transmitting evidence of their shield generator. Their discovery turned out to be the Rebel Alliance's primary base, which is located on the system's sixth planet.\n\n# Section 4\nVader and many of his best officers planned a surprise strike, jumping out of hyperspace at a safe distance from the planet and exploiting the fact that meteor activity made it difficult for the Rebels to see approaching ships. They'd next launch a restricted long-range orbital bombardment to destroy the base, as well as any spacecraft and defenses that could be present. The next step would be for Major General Maximilian Veers to launch a massive ground attack to capture any survivors. The Imperials would have been able to easily conquer the planet with few losses if the plan had worked. Ozzel, on the other hand, devised his own assault strategy. He blasted out of hyperspace near the star system, aiming to catch the Rebels off guard before they could prepare their defenses. When the Rebels' early-warning sensors discovered the fleet, this backfired. Echo Base was protected by a planetary shield, which prevented any aircraft bombardment. Vader was alerted by Veers, who realized that taking the base would require a full-fledged ground attack rather than simply destroying it from the air. An enraged Vader Force choked Ozzel to death for his incompetence, and promoted Firmus Piett, the Star Dreadnought Executor's chief fleet captain, to Admiral.\n\n# Section 5\nAfter assessing the situation, Vader ordered General Veers to land beyond the energy shield's range and launch a surface assault aimed at knocking out the Rebels' power generator and, as a result, bringing down the shield, while Death Squadron formed a blockade formation to prevent any fleeing Rebel starships from escaping. The Imperial landing force, codenamed Blizzard Force, was made up of multiple battalions of 501st Legion Stormtroopers (also known as Snowtroopers), some of whom were equipped with heavy repeating blasters. This infantry force was transported by AT-AT and A5 Juggernaut transports, which were accompanied by AT-PT, AT-ST, and AT-AR walkers, as well as Viper probe droids for additional sensory support. The Blizzard Force also possessed five powerful anti-air warriors to deal with any aerial threats, albeit they were also tightly guarded due to their vulnerability. The rebel coalition deployed the Rogue Squadron in T-47 snowspeeders as a deterrent to this attack. The attack officially began at this point.\n\n# Section 6\nThe major goal of the Imperial assault was to destroy the Rebels' main power generators. The planetary shield that protects the base from orbital bombardment would be disabled as a result of this. Even before the fight began, the Imperials had incurred casualties. In order to impress Vader, Blizzard 4 sought to make its way through the Kerane Valley. Veers lost three trekkers to ice flow crevasses. As a result, the force was forced to return to the safer western path. After Rogue Squadron destroyed a set of probe droids blocking the transporter's escape route, Rogue 10 was shot down. Before rescuing the pilot, Skywalker and his wingmen destroyed three AT-STs that were threatening him. The shield generator and Outpost Beta were then ordered to be defended by Rieekan. On their route, the squadron destroyed three AT-ATs and five additional AT-STs.\n\n# Section 7\nFollowing that, the Imperial force marched against the Rebel base. To avoid any Star Destroyer fatalities in the space fight, they moved for the Outpost Beta ion cannon. Rogue Squadron's snowspeeders flew in and destroyed the assailants before they could reach the gun. AT-ST reinforcements brought in by Imperial loader shuttles were also killed by the Rogues. In addition, other Rebel Thermal Detonator troops and repeating blaster troopers supported Rogue Squadron by destroying various All Terrain Anti-Air walkers, albeit at a substantial cost to the troopers.\n\n# Section 8\nThe Alliance emplacements opened fire on Blizzard Force, but the walkers' armor plating was too robust for Rebel lasers. Only Rogue Squadron was successful in toppling one assault transport, using magnetic harpoons and tow cables to entangle the walker's feet, a novel strategy devised by Luke Skywalker and Alliance tactician Beryl Chiffonage. Unfortunately, the approach failed miserably, and the AT-ATs killed a large number of snowspeeders with lethal blaster cannon volleys. The insurgents dove into the trenches in search of cover. Luke's craft was hit by walker fire, instantly killing his gunner Dak Ralter, before being shot down. Skywalker just made it out of the speeder wreckage before it was destroyed by a walker, leaving Ralter's body inside. Wedge Antilles was given command of Rogue Squadron for the duration of the mission as a result of this. In an act that seemed to validate Palpatine's concerns about Skywalker's growing prowess as a prospective Jedi, the young pilot decided to take down two AT-ATs (one of which was Blizzard 4) on his own. Luke was able to accomplish this using only a grappling hook, his father's lightsaber, and a concussion grenade before returning to the rebels.\n\n# Section 9\nThe inexorable Imperial attack left the majority of the rebels in the trenches injured, dying, dead, afraid, captured, or demoralized. The rebel gun emplacements opened fire on the walkers, but it was ineffective. The walkers' tearing rays claimed the lives of many rebels. AT-STs and snowtroopers cleaned up what they could with their bodies. As the armored assault force approached the trenches, the Alliance forces came under heavy fire, with the majority of their laser gun emplacements damaged, and the order to retreat was given. Veers in Blizzard 1 smashed through the defensive lines and annihilated the shield power generators with the help of the other AT-ATs. Blizzard 1 delivered the final blow on the shield generator after destroying its core and a turret guarding it, while repeating soldiers and AT-ARs gave backup by annihilating any remaining resistance. The blockade in orbit began a piecemeal bombardment of the battlefield after the decisive winning move, knocking down defensive emplacements and fleeing ships. Snowtroopers were then deployed onto the surface by Imperial soldiers using airmobile tactics. Rogue Squadron was also redirected to help the other grounded transports and put an end to the bombing runs from multiple TIE Bombers until they were ready to take off. Lord Vader personally led 501st Legion warriors into Echo Base, slaying everybody who stepped in his path. They made their way through the base to the back hangar, where the rebels attempted to flee. The majority of the rebels were successful in escaping, but some had to give their lives for the cause. Even while the Empire triumphed in this fight, it did so at a cost. At least one Star Destroyer was momentarily disabled by the orbital-range ion gun, and Rebel defenders destroyed numerous AT-ATs, with more being lost when the dangerous ice floes broke away. Despite forcing the Rebels to evacuate, the Imperial forces were unable to destroy all of the transports, and Lord Vader failed to capture Luke Skywalker, which he considered the main priority. The Rebel Alliance suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Hoth. Thousands of Rebel soldiers and pilots died in the defense of Hoth or were slain when the ships transporting them off the planet were destroyed. The Rebels were forced to flee once more after losing their base, and they struggled to reassemble their battered forces. Seventeen of the planet's thirty medium transporters were destroyed, resulting in enormous material and troop casualties. The Alliance's fighting capabilities were severely reduced by the loss of soldiers and materials, giving the Empire an advantage over the Rebels for a while as they pursued their fleet.\n\n","meta":{"index":58,"author":"","name":"Battle of Hoth","release_year":2021}},"Battle of Jedha":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Battle of Jedha took place on the moon of Jedha in 382 BBY, involving fighting factions from the planets Eiram and E’ronoh, diverse Force-worshiping cults in the Holy City of Jedha, the Jedi Order, and the Galactic Republic. The battle broke out during a summit to sign a peace treaty between Eiram and E’ronoh, organized by the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic. Due to mistrust between the planets and riots caused by the extremist cult Path of the Open Hand, the summit turned into a full-blown conflict between the Eirami and E’roni forces on Jedha, with cults also involved in the fighting.# Section 1\nIn the years 387 BBY to 382 BBY, planets Eiram and E’ronoh, located within the Outer Rim Territories, were engaged in a long-lasting conflict dubbed the “forever war.” After an undecided cease-fire, the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order organized a summit between the leaders of both planets to end the war. The peace would be sealed by the marriage of Prince Phan-tu Zenn of Eiram and Princess Xiri A’lbaran of E’ronoh. However, the wedding was attacked by forces, including the terrorist group Children of E’ronoh and the cult, Path of the Open Hand, who desired to continue the war.\nThe attack was thwarted, and the planets decided to proceed with the treaty, which would be signed on the holy moon of Jedha. Due to the destruction caused by the war, the prince and princess decided to oversee rebuilding efforts on their planets, and their ambassadors, Lain Cerox of Eiram and Tintak of E’ronoh, were sent to represent them at the summit.\nThe summit took place in the Second Spire, an old temple refitted for the occasion, with the Guardians of the Whills serving as guards. Both delegations arrived with large fleets to show their strength, causing concern among the Jedi overseeing the event. Jedi Master Creighton Sun watched over Ambassador Cerox, while Jedi Knight Aida Forte tended to Ambassador Tintak. Morton San Tekka, a member of the San Tekka Clan, was appointed as the mediator for the proceedings.\n\n# Section 2\nExisting tensions between various Force cults were heightened by the presence of fleets from both planets. The Path of the Open Hand, a cult from Dalna, protested against the use of the Force, seeking membership in the Convocation of the Force. The Convocation planned the Festival of Balance, leading to artifact thefts and more tension. Vigilante Tey Sirrek noticed the thefts but got involved in a confrontation with a Jedi Padawan. The Path sought the Rod of Daybreak to control the Nameless, a dangerous species preying on Force-sensitives. They aimed to petition the Convocation for change.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring the signing ceremony, a bomb exploded, killing mediator Morton San Tekka. The Jedi and Guardians of the Whills attempted to find the culprits but faced conflicting accounts, pointing fingers at different factions. Republic Chairperson Meldan appointed Tilson Graf as the new mediator, unaware that he was secretly working for the Path of the Open Hand.\nJedi Master Silandra Sho was asked by Creighton Sun to investigate the bombing. She teamed up with Keth Cerepath and visited different cults on Jedha, including the Path of the Open Hand, where patients provided confusing information. Meanwhile, the Brotherhood of the Ninth Door collaborated with Graf.\nAfter the bombing, Tey Sirrek, the Jedi, and the Guardians of the Whills investigated missing artifacts, leading to a confrontation with Sirrek and the Guardians. An explosion occurred during their encounter.\n\n# Section 4\nAfter speaking with Jedi Knight Gella Nattai, Creigton suspected that Axel Greylark may have been involved with the Path of the Open Hand in their attempt to sabotage the peace process and the royal wedding. Silantra visited the Path’s leader, The Mother to investigate this claim but feels ill in her presence. The Herald of the Path petitioned the Convocation of the Force to ban the use of the Force, leading to a heated confrontation.\nLater, while leaving Enlightenment, Silandra and Keth are attacked by an individual on a speeder. The Herald gives an inflammatory speech to a crowd, inciting riots in the city. The riots reach the Second Spire, where the signing ceremony was taking place, resulting in the Battle of Jedi as the conflict escalates between Eiram and E’ronoh forces.\n\n# Section 5\nDuring the firefight in the spire, Creighton and Forte assisted Ambassador Cerox’s escape. The streets of Jedha were engulfed in riots, and the Jedi faced attacks from angry rioters. Sun called for reinforcements, while Forte rallied the Guardians of the Whills to protect the citizens.\nSilantra was stalked by the Leveler during the chaos but was saved by Keth Cerepath’s droid. The riot escalated, and heavy forces from Eiram and E’ronoh engaged in all-out war. Forte and the Guardians tackled weaponized mining loaders, while Sun and Mesook faced Eiram’s enforcer droids.\n\n# Section 6\nSilanta and Cerepath investigated Cerepaths’ droid, P3-7A’s databank, which revealed that a member of the Brotherhood of the Ninth Door was behind the bombing. Silantra decided to protect the citizens of Jedha from the ongoing battle while Cerepath led them to safety. Later, they confronted the Brotherhood at the Dome of Deliverance. Silandra fought and defeated the members, but Keth Cerepath sacrificed himself to save her and kill the last Brother.\n\n# Section 7\nDuring the battle, a statue of a Jedi known as the Final Protector was taken down by rioters using ropes and explosives. Jedi Master Leebon and Oliviah Zeveron tried to stop them but arrived too late. Creighton Sun and Mesook witnessed the statue's fall, which deeply affected them. Mesook was killed by Eirami enforcer droids, prompting Sun to intercept the converging Eirami and E'roni forces in the central square. A force of Jedi and Republic peacekeeping troops arrived as reinforcements, and Sun's speech convinced many soldiers to stand down and return to their ships, ending the battle.\nMaz Kanata's pirate crew and Jedi Padawan Sav Malagán also participated in the battle. A Spiral-class Viz-Core Eviscerator starfighter also played a role, but production of the model was later shut down and banned by the Galactic Republic.\n\n# Section 8\nAfter the battle, Ambassador Cerox decides to continue fighting the E'roni against the heirs' wishes. The communication system between Eiram and E'ronoh was destroyed again, and the pirates targeted both planets during the chaos. Creighton Sun and Aida Forte planned a mission to Dalna to investigate the Path of the Open Hand's involvement in the battle. Chancellor Greylark considered blockading hyperspace to protect neighboring regions from the chaos. Silandra visited Enlightenment and shared the tale of Keth Cerepath's heroism and sacrifice with Moona, Piralli, and Kradon.\n\n# Section 9\nIn 232 BBY, Maz Kanata and Sav Malagán reminisced about the Battle of Jedha and their long friendship while going through old stuff in Takodana Castle.

Alderaan was one of the founders of the Galactic Republic. It symbolized the archetype on which the early republic was founded. The planet's location was unfavorable for military operations, but the Empire wanted to weaken the morale of the Republic by destroying one of its favorite worlds.# Section 1\nThe Great Galactic War had been underway for a long time, and the Empire continued its offensive. The imprisonment of the six Sith Lords and the loss of their powers angered the Dark Council. Therefore, it was decided to launch the invasion of Alderaan to weaken the morale of the Republic and avenge the loss of the Dread Masters. The commander of the operation was Darth Malgus. Thanks to his cleverness, he managed to make the Republic Fleet leave the planet to solve a conflict light-years away from the planet. However, the planet served as a medical post for Republic soldiers. That is why Republic Special Forces and some others were on the planet. Furthermore, Jedi Knight Salete Shan was also visiting Alderaan to investigate rumors about the influence of the Sith on local nobility. Darth Malgus was unaware of the presence of other Republic forces and began the attack.\n\n# Section 2\nThe attack was preceded by an orbital bombardment, which destroyed several cities and many military facilities. The vast majority survived thanks to the shields activated when enemy ships were sighted. Then came the landing of the imperial forces led by Darth Malgus himself. The Empire had brought hundreds of droids, soldiers, and members of the Sith Order to defeat the defense of the planet. Nothing could stop their march to the capital. Imperium brought fire and destruction to the majority of cities on Alderaan. During this time, the Jedi Knights present on the planet tried to resist the invasion but were quickly forced to flee. The remnants of the Republican forces and the Jedi fled to the ruins of the cities, waiting for an opportunity to strike back. The enemy also managed to capture the royal family and some of the nobility who supported the Republic. Upon learning about the attack Republic began to mobilize reinforcements to take back the Planet, however Republican High Command thought that the planet was lost and the battle was over.\n\n# Section 3\nDespite the initial defeat, the Republic troops gathered in the woods of Alderaan, waiting for orders and preparing for battle. Among them was an elite unit, the Havoc Squad, led by Captain Malcolm. During that time, the Imperial troops approached the capital and Organa Castle. To delay their arrival, a plan was made to attack the troops under the command of Darth Malgus. The Havoc Squad began the assault and the battle against the Empire through the woods of Alderaan. The troopers were able to destroy a good amount of assault droids with blaster fire and explosives but were eventually engaged by Darth Malgus and other Sith Order members. In an act of desperation, Captain Malcolm fired at the Sith Lord and injured him. Then Malcolm ran towards Darth Malgus but was pushed away and lost consciousness. The battle began to turn in favor of the Empire, but the arrival of Satele Shan turned the tide. After a hard fight, Shan defeated Darth Malgus which forced Sith forces to retreat. A short time later Republican reinforcements had arrived and pushed back Imperial forces from the planet.\n\n","meta":{"index":24,"author":"JaroCycle","name":"Battle of Alderaan","release_year":2021}},"Rakghoul Pandemic":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Rakghoul Pandemic was a devastating historic event in the Old Republic. Starting after the end of the Great Galactic War, the Virus was discovered on a Republic ship known as the Stardream, which carried many different animals that had, or by chance, carried the plague with it on the ship. The passengers would eventually get infected with the plague which left the crew disabled, eventually crashed the Stardream on the planet of Tatooine. This released the infected survivors, which resulted in the virus to start spreading to the different tribes of Tusken Raiders and to the native fauna. The deadly plague would affect high populated areas like Mos Ila and Anchorhead, preventing travel to and from the planet.# Section 1\nOnce the Virus started, it had quickly spread across Tatooine including the cities of Mos Ila and Anchorhead. A Galactic news broadcast was sent across the Galaxy, warning the people of the galaxy to go into quarantine and not travel into space. Of course, the people did not listen straight away and it became apparent that the virus would eventually spread across the galaxy to many planets. For instance, planets such as Corellia, Alderaan, and many more in the galaxy. This led both the Republic and the Empire to start quarantine and prevent any more casualties. Many people were killed by the Rakghoul Virus and they were doing this quarantine as a safety precaution to make sure it could be contained from now on.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter some time, the Republic finally started working on a vaccine to prevent the virus from spreading further, but the Empire saw this as an opportunity and attempted to weaponize the virus. Of course, this backfired on them which led them to eventually decide that the Rakghoul Virus needed to be eliminated once and for all. The vaccination was eventually completed and the vaccination process had finally began on the people who were infected with the virus. But however, the Rakghouls were still at large with tunnels created on the many planets for them to hide in. This led to the start of both sides, Empire and Republic, beginning to organize hunting forces to eliminate the rakghoul threat. Many were found on the planets of Alderaan, Tatooine, Corellia, and many more.\n\n","meta":{"index":53,"author":"Librarians' Assembly","name":"Rakghoul Pandemic","release_year":2021}},"Great Hyperspace Wars":{"content":"# Introduction\nIn 5000 BBY an attack on the Koros system by the Sith Empire introduced the Republic and the Jedi Order to the Sith and sparked the beginning of the Great Hyperspace War. The battle began shortly after a Jedi Knight named Odan-Urr had a nightmarish vision of the death of Sith Lord Marka Ragnos, and the war against the Republic that it would cause. He traveled to Coruscant with Jedi Master Memit Nadill and Teta, the empress of Koros, to voice his concerns in front of the Galactic Senate, though they did not take him seriously, and took no action. Returning to Koros, Jedi Nadill, Odan-Urr and Urr's master Ooroo was present when a young convict named Jori Daragon burst into Teta's chambers, telling the Jedi that she had seen the great Sith Empire, and that they were on their way to attack the Republic. Nadill learned as much as he could about the Sith Empire, then traveled to Coruscant to rally the support of the Jedi Knights. The newly christened Dark Lord of the Sith, Naga Sadow, deployed his fleets to invade numerous Republic worlds simultaneously while he left his eye-shaped Sith Meditation Sphere near Primus Goluud and used Sith magic to create thousands of illusory soldiers, which made the Sith army seem far larger than it actually was.# Section 1\nThe Jedi Order played a huge role in the defense of Coruscant, with Memit Nadill leading a team of Jedi Knights, including Tuknatan and Sonam-Ha'ar. Meanwhile, another battle was raging on the planet of Kirrek, where Jedi Master Ooroo and his apprentice Odan-Urr were stationed. However, when Naga Sadow's concentration was broken, the illusory Sith forces disappeared and the Republic's forces' morale was bolstered. On Coruscant, the Jedi realized what had happened and launched a massive counterattack, easily defeating the Sith. The Republic also emerged victorious on Kirrek, however only at the expense of the death of Master Ooroo, who sacrificed his life in defeating a large force of Massassi warriors. With the Sith forces routed, Supreme Chancellor Pultimo ordered the sacking of Sith Space, liberating the Sith from the Dark Lords and ultimately dissolving the Empire. In 4400 BBY, the ambitious Padawan Freedon Nadd was denied Knighthood by his Jedi Masters. In an attempt to find out why this had happened, Nadd went to Jedi Master Matta Tremayne, who challenged him to prove to her that he was indeed a Jedi Knight. Nadd saw this as a threat and decided to attack and kill Tremayne.\n\n# Section 2\nFurious at the Jedi Masters for making him kill his teacher, Nadd went looking for the Sith, because he felt that they were the only ones who would readily accept his apprenticeship and teach him about the Force. During his travels, Nadd discovered the Sith Lord Naga Sadow who was serving out his exile on Yavin 4. Awakening from his status chamber, Sadow trained Freedon Nadd in the ways of the dark side only to be killed by Nadd when his training was complete. Following Sadow's death, Nadd abandoned Yavin 4 in favor of Onderon, located outside Republic space, with hopes of rebuilding a stronger Sith Empire. After Freedon Nadd had made himself the leader of the capital city of Iziz, the Sith Lord began to exile all criminals from the city; some of whom managed to survive in the deadly jungles surrounding the city and organize into a tribe of hunter-gatherers. The world of Onderon suffered through the legacy of Nadd even after his death as a cult devoted to his memory, known as the Naddists, wreaked havoc on the people of the planet. When Jedi Master Arca Jeth attempted to move Freedon Nadd's remains to Onderon's moon Dxun the Naddists, led by Onderonian King Ommin, attacked and managed to capture Nadd's remains as well as Jeth himself. Ommin then fled to the city of Iziz. The Republic's army converged on the planet and attacked Iziz, but was too strong and devastated the city.\n\n# Section 3\nAfter the battle, Freedon Nadd's remains were taken to Dxun and sealed in an armored tomb. In 4250 BBY the Jedi experienced a third Great Schism on Coruscant following Nadd's death. After a brief civil war on Coruscant, the surviving group of Dark Jedi retreated to the Vultar system, where they discovered that the planets of the system were artificial. The Dark Jedi could not control the huge Cosmic Turbine that powered the system and quickly annihilated themselves and the entire system.\n\n","meta":{"index":13,"author":"","name":"Great Hyperspace Wars","release_year":0}},"Russan Reformation":{"content":"# Introduction\nWith the Sith presumed extinct, the Jedi believed that they had at last forged a long-lasting peace in the galaxy. With the Ruusan Reformation passing the Senate and receiving the High Council's blessings, both the Jedi Order and the Republic renounced militarism, disbanding their vast armies and navies. From that point on, the galaxy would rely on smaller Planetary Security Forces and the Judicial Department to help the Jedi keep the peace. The wave of change sweeping the Republic enabled forward-thinking Jedi to make vast strides in the Order' setup during the first years of peace. Under the leadership of Grand Master Fae Coven, the Jedi High Council became more influential, and many loose rules were codified. Adults were banned from entering into the Order after Ruusan proved them to be too volatile and susceptible to the dark side's sway. They would renounce all ties to the outside world to wealth, material possessions, and even family. Training would now be undertaken on a strict one-to-one basis and centralized on Coruscant. With the far-flung academies of the past, the temptation of delving into forbidden knowledge was considered too great for members of the order. Many far-flung, satellite training facilities were closed and the Temple on Coruscant became the heart of the Order.# Section 1\nThe Trials of Knighthood were firmly put in place to ensure all Knights were tested on a fair and equal scale. Coven was also ensured that her changes would be known by every Jedi by drafting and putting into circulation throughout the Order personal copies of The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, a guidebook given to each and every member of the Order. Along with Master Coven's quest to set the Order on a firm footing, Caretaker of First Knowledge Restelly Quist and the other members of the Council of First Knowledge were determined to completely eradicate all memory of the Sith to ensure they never returned. Dispatching Shadows to find and locate all Sith artifacts, relics, and even history books detailing past Jedi-Sith conflicts; the Order essentially erased all memory of the Sith in under five decades.\n\n","meta":{"index":25,"author":"","name":"Russan Reformation","release_year":0}},"Battle of Karidepth":{"content":"# Introduction\nIn 3681 BBY when the Sith Empire had returned and started the Great Galactic War with the Galactic Republic, the Imperial Military had started a campaign to conquer the Minos Cluster. This cluster was rich with resources and the resulting offensive would last for the whole twenty-eight years of the war. Both the Jedi and Republic Army would battle the Imperial Military and it’s Sith Leaders around the whole sector for almost thirty years, three decades. Among the many Jedi that was stationed at the cluster for long periods, Master Orgus Din had been seen fighting alongside Republic soldiers more than any other Jedi that survived. When the Republic beat the Empire in 3667 BBY in the Battle of Alderaan, Harron Tavus would be recruited into Havoc Squad and eventually stationed at the cluster as well. Tavus and Din became friends and would together lead the Republic Forces against the Imperials throughout the cluster.  Some point before the end of the battle in 3653 BBY the Empire tried to invade the planet Karidepth, a world that had a main industry of foodstuff production. Din and Tavus however, led a counterattack that successfully made the Imperials turn back and forced the Empire to abandon it’s invasion efforts. Both men would be named “Heroes of Karidepth” and both continued to serve in the battle for the Minor Cluster until the Empire withdrew in 3653 BBY as an offer of peace.","meta":{"index":51,"author":"Blazey_Kitsune","name":"Battle of Karidepth","release_year":2021}},"Battle of Mygeeto":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Battle of Mygeeto was one of the largest and longest operations conducted in the Clone Wars. It saw some of the harshest and most hectic scenes of warfare in history, which resulted in many casualties presented in both the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Known Jedi presented in the Battle of Mygeeto included Jedi General Ki-Adi Mundi, Jedi Knight Rivi-Anu, Jedi Knight Eon, and two unidentified knights. Although the Battle of Mygeeto was drawn out for two years in the Clone Wars, it was one of the major systems fought for, being part of the Triad of Evil, and allowed military figures to rise from the battle.# Section 1\nMygeeto was a colony of the Banking Clan Guild, where it saw mining and resource operations due to the rich natural resources it presented in shipbuilding and warship construction. The planet was also used by the Banking Clan as credit vaults, where the wealthy class would store their credits to avoid taxes conducted on many other planets under the rule of the Galactic Republic. When the Clone Wars started, Mygeeto was a major target for the Republic because of the natural resources it presented for the droid army and the wealth it displayed through the many credit vaults. Prior to the main battle, republic special forces provided intelligence on the planet, and many missions were conducted for minor operations. An example of missions, before the Battle of Mygeeto, would be a mission conducted by the well-known commando squad, Delta Squad, where they secured credits from a vault from the Vau Family, which was under the planet’s surface. The Galactic Marines provided a distraction for this operation, but they would be presented in many future conflicts in the battle, being somewhat the face of the Battle of Mygeeto.\n\n# Section 2\nAs the Clone Wars progressed, the 4th Sector Army led an invasion force to capture Mygeeto. The invasion force included the 21st Nova Corps and a few Jedi Knights. Battles raged between the two sides of the conflict, causing cities to be burned and urban fighting was mainly seen throughout the battle. This resulted in many civilians being caught in the crossfire and many cities being destroyed. Being almost a sister world to Muunilinst, the Separatists dispatched many droid forces on the planet and even used some of the most powerful droids in their arsenal, including the infamous Octuptarra Magna Tri-Droid, which were the behemoth-sized Tri-droids that were heavily armored. Although the first year of the Battle Of Mygeeto was mostly a stalemate, where both sides of the conflict did not gain any significant sides of territory, it did see some of the harshest resistance. Even a Venator Class Star Destroyer was shot down by a major clone unit. Luckily an injured Jedi Knight was able to use the force to hold off the Venator to allow the major clone unit to escape but died in the process.\n\n# Section 3\nNearing the end of the Clone Wars, a 501st detachment was sent to Mygeeto by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine himself to secure a crystal power resource, which would be used for a future Death Star Project. With Master Ki-Adi Mundi destroying two shield barricades, the 501st were led to fight off the Separatist resistance, where they saw AAT Tanks and AA guns being used against LAAT gunships. After the 501st extracted crystal samples, Mundi led the Galactic Marines for future operations on Mygeeto, where they would primarily see fights on bridges that linked city districts. This would be the last battle Master Ki-Adi Mundi would fight, as a transmission issued by the Supreme Chancellor ordered all clone units to execute their Jedi Generals. Marshal Clone Commander, CC-1138 (Bacara), and his Galactic Marines were pushing against droid forces on a bridge, led by Mundi, but once the order was in effect, the Galactic Marines executed Master Mundi and the battle later came to a halt, as control of Mygeeto would soon be under the rule of the Galactic Empire, where they would use the planet for mining operations for the large Imperial Navy.\n\n","meta":{"index":18,"author":"1tsKita","name":"Battle of Mygeeto","release_year":2021}},"Battle of the South Ridge":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Battle of the South Ridge took place on Naboo in the year 32 BBY. This infamous battle was at the south ridge of Theed, the capital city of Naboo during the Trade Federation’s invasion of Naboo. This battle commenced soon upon the arrival of Queen Amidala and her security force, seeking to liberate Naboo to the planet it recently was. The Queen and her security force partnered with the Gugans to create a massive defence against their capital. The Trade Federation’s forces kept on coming, thousands of B1 Battle Droids and armoured tanks came down the Great Grass Plains. The Trade Federation’s plethora of droids came from their airbase. Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes viewed their base as crucial to their offence, and called upon some pilots to destroy a convoy that was leaving the base, which was being destroyed simultaneously. With the base destroyed, the Trade Federation’s continuous flow of troops was cut short, giving the partnered Gungans and Naboo the upper hand. The alliance used a lot of droid shock grenades as well as land mines. As the battle in space commenced, the young Anakin Skywalker managed to destroy the entire Separatist carrier Lucrehulk, which powered the droids.

Led by the Jedi Generals Mace Windu, Luminara Unduli, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Kenobi’s apprentice Anakin Skywalker, the Republic’s assault commenced shortly after the Battle of Sivvi, a related assault that had captured Thule’s moon and lowered its defenses.\n           As Windu and Unduli unloaded the main assault force, Kenobi led a unit of speedy Republic fighter tanks to destroy Confederate supply depots and capture their forward command center. Though the depots and command center were well-defended with turrets and droid tanks, the Jedi were eventually successful, allowing the Republic to unleash a full frontal attack on the city of Kessiak, where the Dark Reaper lay.\n           Windu and Unduli then boarded fighter tanks to lead AT-XTs and AT-TEs on side campaigns to destroy the enemy’s advantages. They destroyed the Confederacy’s two fighter hangars, cutting off air support for the droids, and destroyed the main armory and a tank garage before rejoining the main assault on the gates of Kessiak. On their way back they were ambushed by Dooku’s Protodekas, but destroyed them at a high cost in walkers.\n           As reinforcements sent by Yoda landed nearby, Cydon Prax entered the battle in his personal tank and destroyed Windu’s.\n\n# Section 3\nForced to fight on foot, Windu made for the city wall as Republic fighter tanks attempted to stave off Commander Prax. Windu managed to find a set of ancient tunnels into the city and opened the gates, allowing Republic forces to pour in and forcing a Confederate retreat inside the city.\n           As Windu’s army entered Kessiak, Skywalker’s attack force landed at the opposite side of the city and blasted their way in. As the Confederacy’s droids were occupied with the main army, Skywalker raced through Kessiak in a fighter tank until he reached the city center. There, he found that Dooku had left, but Cydon Prax had not, and the two engaged in a tank battle, which left Prax dead. Skywalker then moved to engage the Dark Reaper, which was now quickly becoming active, without backup.\n           As Ulic Qel-Droma’s spirit whispered guidance to him, Skywalker destroyed the Dark Reaper’s weapon systems one by one, resisting the power of the superweapon. When the Force Harvester was exposed at last, Skywalker emptied all the missiles on his tank into it, destroying the core mechanism of the weapon and causing the Dark Reaper to explode.\n\n# Section 4\nThe Battle of Thule was a victory for the Republic, though a very costly one. A large part of the Republic army had been killed in the fighting, though they had pulled through and won the day.

This invasion took place within Tatooine’s training yards and in space. The fighters within this invasion were the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.# Section 1\nThe Galactic Republic had created training grounds for the armed forces that protected Tatooine. Jedi Master Ferroda spectated these training grounds, making sure they were safe and free from any forces from the Separatists. Two clone troopers known as X1 and X2 were specially chosen to help General Ferroda instruct the newest batches of clones. This was because of the great skill they showed off during battles with the Galactic Republic. X1 was the first clone to arrive, followed by X2. X2 listened to X1, and they ran training courses as well as instructed them on how to shoot and use hand-to-hand combat. Unfortunately, during the course, the clones all spotted a Confederate probe droid that was currently inside the landing bays. X2 had quickly destroyed the droid, entered a V-Wing starfighter, and flew into space following a drone ship from where the probe had come from. X2 successfully blew up the ship, but now knew there might be a problem with the Confederates soon. Suddenly, X1 realized that there was going to be a substantial Confederate invasion.\n\n# Section 2\nThe little Republic troops that were on Tatooine were greatly endangered by the Confederate invasion and lost some forces. Some Venators began orbiting Tatooine, staying in the battle with the Confederates. The Confederates had also started a surface invasion. They placed a lot of OG-9 spider droids and B1-Series battle droids on the planet, which made some Clone pilots retreat to a bunker to stay safe. However, X1 and X2 helped them by destroying the Battle droids. Unfortunately, they did not have good enough weapons to kill the Spider-Droids. A fellow clone had given X2 a rocket launcher, which allowed him to destroy the Spider droids. The battle continued, making the Confederacy drop more and more battle droids on Tatooine. X1, hearing of this, had called in reinforcements, which allowed the clone troopers to fight off the fellow droids.\n\n# Section 3\nHearing of this, the Confederacy began releasing Vulture droid starfighters around the Republic positions. X2 had a plan to create anti-aircraft guns to shoot the Confederacy ships down, which Ferroda approved. X2, x1, and the Clones all ran to a Republic hanger and cleared out all the remaining droids that lay there. X1 and X2 found a spare starfighter each, and both took one and began fighting in space. They both destroyed many fighter escorts and secured the safety of the destroyer. X2 and some of the Clone Troopers all landed inside one of the ships and destroyed droids and the ship’s reactor core. The Clone Troopers and X2 had escaped the ship just in time, and because of this destruction, the ship exploded. The Republic had begun to clean up the mess and secure their win.\n\n# Section 4\nChancellor Palpatine had noticed this bravery and combat ability during the battle and awarded X1 and X2 medals.

Beginning at 3976 BBY, the resulting conflict would continue for a grueling 16 years, resulting in major devastation across the galaxy and acting as the predecessor to another galactic-scale conflict, the Jedi Civil War.# Section 1\nTwo decades before the outbreak of the Mandalorian Wars, another conflict had been fought between the Jedi, with the Mandalorians taking part in what would be known as the Great Sith War. After being defeated by the newly proclaimed Lords of the Sith, Exar Kun, and his apprentice Ulic Qel Droma, the Mandalorians fought a crusade into the heart of the galaxy and the Republic. These Mandalorian Crusades would see them defeated and once again cast out by the Republic. At the time, the current Mandalore, Mandalore the Indomitable, would be killed on the Onderonian moon of Dxun. It was here a Mandalorian warrior found his body and would claim the mask, proclaiming himself Mandalore the Ultimate, ruler of the Mandalorian clans. \n\nRemaining on Dxun, the new Mandalore would recall the clans, using the moon as proving grounds for the clans and a place to regain their strength. The original species of the Mandalorians, the Taung, were few and dying, and so Mandalore sought to bring new species into the clans, spreading their warrior traditions across countless species. In the eyes of Mandalore, if you could prove yourself worthy and would honor their traditions, you have the right to be called a Mandalorian. However, Mandalore always sought to find a great challenge for his new Mandalorian army, and soon he would have such a challenge.\n\n# Section 2\nIn 3976 BBY, the Neo-Crusaders began their conquest of fringe worlds on the Outer Rim. Not wishing to draw the ire of the Republic, Mandalore the Ultimate sought to hide their presence to begin building up his forces for a confrontation with the Republic. The Mandalorians had a habit of using the local inhabitants of worlds to help with transporting equipment across the surface and would incorporate them into their units. However, the Mandalorians weren’t merciful, as seen in the Battle of Cathar, where the Mando’ade led by Cassus Fett, essentially purged the planet’s population, forcing the remaining Cathar to flee the planet for other worlds. \n\nWhen the Republic finally had begun to move against the Mandalorians, they had already grown immensely. Capable of taking on the entire Republic military, they continued to make progress as their warships slowly conquered Republic space. Despite this threat to the Republic, the Jedi Council refused to intervene and help the Republic. In opposition to this, a young Jedi Knight began to publicly advocate for the Jedi to join the war, inspiring many other Jedi and citizens of the Republic to take up his call to war. Seeking out evidence to force the masters to allow the Jedi to join the fight, this Jedi and his followers traveled to Cathar. When the masters came to confront him and his followers, this Jedi found a Mandalorian mask lying nearby. When he reached out to grab it, every Jedi present received a vision of the atrocity committed by the Mandalorians against the Cathar, and a lone Mandalorian wearing the same mask the Jedi had found, standing against them only to meet the same fate as the Cathar. Taking the mask, the Jedi Knight would proclaim himself as Revan, swearing to stop the Mandalorians and return the Republic to glory.\n\n# Section 3\nUnable to deny the threat of the Mandalorians, the Jedi Council permitted Revan to reform the Mercy Corps, a Jedi detachment meant to act as healers to the Republic during times of war, not having been put into service since the Sith War. Under the command of Revan and his close friend Malak, the Mercy Corps began to help the Republic forces push back against the Mandalorian onslaught. Revan would prove himself a capable General under the Republic military, providing tactical aid and advice to the heads of the Republic military. Revan became so influential in the workings of the Republic military that he was eventually appointed by the Chancellor as Supreme Commander of the Republic military, making him responsible for the war effort. \n\nNotably, during this time, Revan and Malak would seek to bring more Jedi to the war effort to bolster their forces. During this, Alak would visit the Jedi Enclave located in the world of Dantooine. It would be here a young Jedi by the name of Meetra Surik would be convinced to join the war effort, becoming one of the most influential Jedi of the war.\n\nAs Revan and his forces began to push back the Mandalorians however, Revan and many Jedi began to slowly forsake the ways of the Jedi. The Council refused to guide Revan and his Jedi, leaving them to be engulfed by warfare. Revan and Malak especially felt this influence, as they came to despise weakness as the Mandalorians had. Revan began to adopt a more brutal war strategy, willing to sacrifice entire systems if it would lead to the collapse of the Mandalorian war effort. In 3961 BBY, Revan and Malak discovered the remnants of the Rakatan Infinite Empire. Revan would begin to hunt down these relics, ancient star maps leading to the crown jewel of the Infinite Empire, the Star Forge. The Star Forge emanated dark-side energy, and as Revan sensed this, he avoided using the station, which was capable of creating endless armadas and armies that would’ve overwhelmed the Mandalorian threat.\n\nHowever, this was not Revan’s last encounter with dark-side relics, as he would soon come to discover the Trayus Academy, an ancient Sith temple located on Malachor V. Revan, convinced he would need any weapon he could find to stop the Neo-Crusaders, began to study the teachings he found at the long-abandoned academy.\n\n# Section 4\nBy 3960 BBY, both the Republic and Mandalorian forces had been severely depleted. Knowing the Mandalorians had grown weak, Revan looked to end the war in one final confrontation. In order to do this, Revan deployed the use of a superweapon created by the zabrak Bao-Dur, the Mass Shadow Generator. This weapon would pull any ships in orbit of Malachor V to the surface of the planet, ripping them apart and scattering them across the surface. \n\nDeploying much of his forces under the command of Meetra Surik, Revan lured the Mandalorian fleet to Malachor V, engaging in a massive battle over the planet’s surface. Once lured into orbit, Revan’s portion of the fleet arrived at Malachor and began to assist Surik’s forces. Outnumbered and surrounded, Mandalore the Ultimate challenged Revan to ceremonial combat aboard his ship. When Revan arrived, Mandalore and he engaged in a fearsome duel on the bridge. When Revan finally landed the killing blow to Mandalore the Ultimate, he fell to the floor of his ship, speaking to Revan one last time. As he lay dying, Mandalore revealed to him he had been tricked by a Sith infiltrator, who had told him he received a vision of the Mandalorian clans conquering the Republic and goading them into war. Mandalore would give him the location of an ancient Sith world, Rekkiad, telling him he would find the answers he sought there. Revan, taking the mask of Mandalore, fled the flagship and returned to his fleet. \n\nAs Surik and her forces slowly pushed the Mandalorian fleets closer to the planet’s orbit, Surik gave the order for the Mass Shadow Generator to be activated. To her horror, the superweapon not only ripped apart the Mandalorian fleet but slowly caused the planet to crash in on itself, destroying its surface and creating a barren planet in the dead of space. Destruction on such a scale had rarely been seen, and Surik, out of fear and anguish, cut herself off from the Force.\n\n# Section 5\nWith the war ended, the Jedi Council demanded the remaining Jedi who participated in the war return to Coruscant and face judgment before the Council. Revan and Malak refused their command, and instead headed to Rekkiad, the world that Mandalore had told Revan of before his death. It was here that Revan would leave the mask of Mandalore, thereby preventing the clans from reuniting and scattering them across the galaxy. It was on Rekkiad that Revan and Malak would discover that the ancient Sith had not perished, but instead waited out in the Unknown Regions, stalking the Republic and waiting for a time to strike. \n\nOut of the three, Meetra Surik was the only one to return to Coruscant to face the Council. Although the Council wished to punish Surik for her involvement in the war, they were terrified when they finally faced her. When she was brought before them, the Council sensed that she had cut her connection to the Force, creating a dead spot in the Force within her. Fearing what they saw, and unable to understand how she had cut herself off so fully from the Force and survived, the Council exiled Surik from the Order. \n\nWhen Revan and Malak went hunting down the hidden Sith Empire, they saw the strength of this hidden Empire and knew the Republic would collapse if it did not prepare. When Revan and Malak returned from the Unknown Regions, they did not come back as saviors of the Republic or as Jedi Knights, but as Lords of the Sith, leading an army of Dark Jedi along with their own Sith Empire.\n\n","meta":{"index":19,"author":"RynnKaedon","name":"Mandalorian Wars","release_year":2021}},"Despot War":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Despot War was a conflict within the Tython System in 25,805 BBY between the Despot Army and the Je'daii Order. The Despot Queen Haidya tried to unite the crime barons of her homeworld Shikawaa, to then conquer the Tython System. While rising to become the Krall or Overlord of her planet, she looked to unify the planet’s aristocracy under one leader. However, many of the aristocracy resisted this, causing her to kill Clan Ryo’s leader and their oldest son. Despite this fact Haidya had enthusiastic support of many commoners who had been swayed by her promises like safety and freedom from Je'daii intervention.# Section 1\nOnce she was known as the Despot Queen, her ambitions would gain the attention of the Je’daii. The Je’daii would join the Shikaawan Aristocrats in opposing her, realising the system’s stability was at risk. Following this, there would be a short period of small skirmishes in space and some moons of the planet Kalimahr. Haidya had secretly trained a Despot Army, however, initially taking the order by surprise with a full invasion on Tython. The Je’daii Order quickly regained their footing against this invasion. Master Rajivari led the Je’daii into the battle, earning the nickname “General”.Temple Master of Akar Kesh temple and leader of the Je’daii Council Telaat would be slain during this invasion, with Master Ketu succeeding him.\n\n# Section 2\nOn the planet Nox, multiple doomed cities sided with the Je’daii while others sided with Haidya. When it was found out that three domes of Greenwood Station were supplying Haidya, the Order tried to convince them to stop. Despite best efforts and warning the inhabitants, the places would get bombed, with thousands of deaths from the attacks. Greenwood itself would only be damaged as it had a laboratory producing for the Order. The inhabitants there, however, would gain an intense hatred for the Je’daii Order.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring the war many Battle Droids would be used with the Despot Army using both Deathstalker and Deathblaster class fighters, thought many of the Deathblasters would be destroyed. Voynos Rok, wanting revenge for his father's and brother’s death, would seek out Je’daii Ranger Daegen Lok. With help Lok would join the Despot Army and rise through the ranks to Lieutenant. Lok would fall for Haidya, hesitating to kill her first at the siege of the Kaleth Temple. Haidya would attack him, leading him to kill her and fight his way out of the camp. This death would cause generals to fight one another, allowing the Je’daii Order to defeat the remains, claiming Victory of the War.\n\n# Section 4\nFollowing this war, the Deathblaster would become a really rare ship and Greenwoo’d Council would allowed the murder of Je’daii in return for all the civillians killed in the bombings. These assassinations continued for two or three years with now a general resentment for the Je’daii Order across the System. Lok would gain the rank of Master in 25,800 BBY before receiving a vision within Tython’s Chasm, causing him to go insane.\n\n","meta":{"index":72,"author":"Blazey_Kitsune","name":"Despot War","release_year":2021}},"Galactic Wars":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe sham known as the Cold War came to an inevitable end and the Galactic War erupted on a galactic scale but was even more brutal than any other war in the past.

Engaging each other in full-scale war once again, Sith and Republic forces clashed, while the constant specter of betrayal loomed over everyone. Yet despite the copious amounts of traitors and third parties, they did little to stop the Republic and Empire from continuing their war. The Great War saw some of the Republic and Empire's bravest and mightiest heroes emerge, and this only created more tension and alarm, adding to the chaos already generated by the Great War. The immense clash would lead to the defeat of various third parties and their leaders, such as Darth Malgus, leader of his own rebellion, and Bouris Ulgo, leader of House of Ulgo of Alderaan.

The group fought through these enemies, and eventually reached the throne room, with T3-M4 sealing the door to prevent any reinforcements. After dispatching the remaining guards, they confronted the Emperor but were unprepared for his immense power. After T3-M4 was sacrificed, distracting the Emperor, and being destroyed by Force Lightning, Revan, Surik and Scourge stood united against Vitiate. However, Scourge was confronted by a series of visions showing potential futures, witnessing the eventual triumph of the Hero of Tython against the Emperor. Determined to aid this future hero, Scourge stabbed Surik in the back as a ploy to show loyalty.

The Flesh Raiders on Tython started to wage war on both the Jedi Order and the Pilgrims of Kalikori Village. Under Command of Dark Jedi Bengel Morr the Flesh Raiders became more bold with their attacks on the Jedi. Bengel Morr had been driven insane from the devastation of the fall of the Jedi Temple, making him blame the Order and fall to the Dark Side. He would take on Callef as his apprentice and begin plotting the Order’s destruction.# Section 1\nSome of the Flesh Raiders they trained, found out to be Force Sensitive and as such were trained into Force Adepts. Eventually they commanded a significant fight force under the leadership of Grand Chieftain Keshk. While the Order could easily repel their attacks, losing only young and inexperienced Jedi, the Village on the other hand, suffered. The Village had many losses and heavy resentment to the Jedi for following the Senate's request to refuse them aid.\n\n# Section 2\nMany apprentices were imprisoned within cages, while others got injured fighting them off. A Flesh Rider infant would be found near the temple and taken to Master Quib.  While the Jedi Order through multiple Jedi learned more about the Flesh Raider’s culture. On top of this, Twi'lek Viyo was taken by a Force Sensitive Flesh Raider named Fashk. A Jedi would see to Fashk’s request to join the Jedi, which would be accepted by Master Strayen. Viyo would be set free and Fashk headed to the Temple. Master Strayen hoped to calm his violent nature while also showing him the ways of the light side,knowing that without Jedi Training Fashk would likely fall to the Dark Side.\n\n# Section 3\nWithin the month’s leading to Morr’s assault, there was a Minor Conflict at the Fount of Rajivari, between Yuon Par’s Apprentice and Nalen, who had attempted to destroy the Forge. He would be trained as a Jedi, hoping to improve relations with the Village.  Following this T7-O1 would discover plans of the Flesh Raiders and record it while captured. By this time, Morr had many small camps across much of Tython and sent the Force Sensitive Raiders to study for the Force from Holocrons.\n\n# Section 4\nAs Callef led his Forces through the Gharls, a new initiate arrived on Tython. This Initiate would seal off the Gharls, thought Aharo would be found and captured. Called would interrogate Aharo was the Initiate fought through Flesh Raiders to save him. Called and the Initiate would fall into a duel that despite Callef having more experience, led to his defeat and death. Orgus Din, would arrive just as Callef was defeated, collapsing the tunnel using the Force.\n\n# Section 5\nFollowing this the Initiate, now Din’s padawan, would begin to aid the Village in return for information. While this Padawan fought off Flesh Raider Warmasters to get to their weapons cache, they would find T7-O1 and bring them back. The weapons would be delivered to the Village, who had been attacked while they were gone. Din would see and review the recording while his padawan then began to explore the ruins of Kaleth. After defeating the group’s leader the holocron was found and returned before security was set up in the ruins.\n\n# Section 6\nDin and the padawan following this, began an attack on the nearby command base with the padawan attacking the shield generator.

In 40 ABY, the galaxy was plunged into the Second Galactic Civil War. Struggling slightly with the perceived need to side with the Galactic Alliance, the Jedi Order worked as best they could to prevent the situation from escalating. Amid this crisis, however, betrayal came from within as the Jedi Knight Jacen Solo was seduced to the dark side and became the Sith Lord Darth Caedus. Despite Caedus's control of the Alliance, Luke and the Order made a distinction- they supported the Alliance, but not an Alliance controlled by Jacen himself. In the aftermath of the Battle of Kashyyyk, the Order declared its neutrality and formed the Jedi Coalition.# Section 1\nEfforts were then begun to remove Caedus from power; though the Order was forced to retreat secretly to Endor, where they established a temporary base. In 41 ABY, Darth Caedus was killed in a duel by his sister on the Anakin Solo.

However, it’s whereabouts were discovered on the planet of Belsavis a small squadron of Sith specialists utilised an orbital bombardment to peel away the main defenses of the prison.\n\nThis battle was important to the Sith as the prison was used to house the Sith Lords called the Dread Masters, feared Sith who had both immense knowledge and strength when it came to the dark side of the Force.\n\nThe battle itself was strategic in nature and was merely used as a red herring for Executor Krannus who was attempting to soften the defenses so that he would be able to raze the entire planet as part of a Sith empowerment ritual.# Section 1\nThe prison was divided into multiple sections with further sub-sections as it was a prison colony that was fairly large and was built upon another prison called the Tomb. The Tomb was an underground complex consisting of vaults that sealed away Esh-kha species and other violent terrors.\n\nThe surface prison was used to contain Dread Masters, Mandalorians and other criminals deemed to be too dangerous to be kept in a normal prison by the Republic.\n\nSection X, although little is known about it, was supposedly the main goal of the freed dread masters. They aimed to break open the vault and release something devastating to annihilate the entirety of the prison. This fortunately never happened however, as the Dread Masters were thinned away by the Esh-kha and Republic security soldiers, forcing them to retreat beforehand.\n\n# Section 2\nImperial intelligence had been gaining intel about the weak points and guard rotations of the prison for many weeks, and thus when the prison-break was attempted it was done with frightening accuracy.\n\nThe Emperor Executor Krannus and his death cult aimed to use Belsavis for his Sith ritual which would supposedly eradicate all life in the galaxy. In order to complete the ritual he had to carry out a planet sacrifice.\n\nThe first assault was an utter massacre for the Republic as it was completely unexpected. A squadron of Sith and elite soldiers were sent to key areas to release prisoners, which would conveniently add to the Sith army. They used the chaos created by the bombardment to kill many dazed guards. \n\nThe Empire sent a second task force to construct a defensive point within the prison itself whilst the guards were distracted with the first task force. This brilliant assault was further successful in the addition of the Proculus Station which entered the orbit of the planet. It was a mobile battle platform that essentially rained hellfire upon the inhabitants and defenses of the prison.\n\nThe prisoners later gained access to the guard armoury supplying them with equal ammunition and firepower to that of the prisons defenses, which they used to maximum effect.\n\n# Section 3\nThis ultimately motivated a retreat from the Republic guards who’s families escaped under the leadership of Officer Mark Vempor.\n\nThe Republic Military later entered the playing field but still struggled to contain the chaos as they were outnumbered. Fortunately, Jedi Knight Enna Tabord was sent to lead the recapture of the prison and was further supported by “the Hero of Tython” an unnamed Jedi Master who was instrumental during the Galactic War as a battlemaster. Enna Tabord was wounded during the conflict, and the New Men (cybernetic criminals) captured the database of the facility allowing them to download the prison records and locate various more dangerous criminals across the prison.\n\nUltimately, the Sith were successful in their capturing of the Dread Masters and would have decimated the Republic forces had the Esh-kha not turned on them. Furthermore, Major Camren after relentless fighting and casualties on both sides executed a genocidal protocol and detonated the center’s power relays, halting the Sith’s progress.\n\n# Section 4\nThe Sith ultimately left with what they sought, but not without immense casualties. The Republic similarly, suffered great losses, and the lesson learned here is that surprises will come wherever you least expect it. The dark side of the force shrouded these events in mystery and the Jedi were unable to foresee this event. This was pivotal in prolonging the Galactic War and various Sith criminals and Dreadmasters alike who led Sith invasions later were rescued during this prison invasion.\n\n","meta":{"index":16,"author":"Souleth","name":"Invasion of Belsavis","release_year":2020}},"Battle of the Foundry":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Battle of Foundry was a battle during the early moments of the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.

Once docked, the sith team had engaged in combat with the defense squadron of the team filled with droids, Jedi, and republic soldiers. They had then made it to the lead Jedi Master, which had tried to convince them for peace, which in turn failed. The Imperial Expeditionary Fleet had then engaged against the fleet of the Republic just outside of the ship. The Jedi Master was later revealed to be Revan, a Jedi Knight from three centuries ago who had been overcome with the dark side.\n\n# Section 2\nOnce Revan had been revealed to be a Jedi Master, he had decided to confront the Empire and duel the Emperor. In this battle, he had been betrayed by himself, which caused him to be defeated for three centuries. During the imprisonment of Revan, he had been in a long mental battle while trying to convince the Emperor of how the dark side benefits him and why he should return to becoming Darth Revan, while Revan fights back saying peace is the best option.

However, some Mandalorians including Bo-Katan Kryze, refused to serve under Imperial rule and quickly began to stand against the Emperor’s rule.  To counter this rebellious act, the Empire orchestrated Gar Saxon to be the new governor of Mandalore. While a good number of clans still stood with Kryze, the devastating events of the siege had weakened many warriors, causing them to support and join Gar Saxon. At that point the Empire had claimed Mandalore as theirs while some still continued to fight against their rule.# Section 1\nYears later, while the Empire was still in control of the planet and the houses, a young student at an Imperial academy came up with plans for a new type of a weapon that could be used against the remaining rebellious Mandalorians. The student, Sabine Wren, began working on her new project. This weapon was designed to target anyone that wore beskar. The Duchess, as she was going to name it, could vaporize any Mandalorians that got its range and leave nothing but ashes behind, while dealing no damage to Imperial forces. After the Empire turned it against her people, realizing what she had done, Wren proceeded to disable the weapon, but was forced to flee the system as her own clan and family stood with the Empire, against her.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter devastating losses and many attempts to conquer Mandalore, the Empire came up with an alternative solution.

Mandalorians tried to counter the incoming attack but the overwhelming number of Imperial ships made it impossible. While the bombers leaving nothing but destruction and ruins behind them proceeded to head for the next cities, Gunships armed with high-repeating weapons took out huge portion of those who survived.

The attack was planned by Darth Decimus during the Cold War. Thanks to a sophisticated interview, Decimus managed to persuade the entire government, the Corellian Council, to take their side. The Emperor’s first son revealed his identity as Syo Bakarn to the Council to strengthen their loyalty to the Empire. In 3642, the Treaty of Coruscant, which was maintaining peace in the Galaxy, was falling apart. That’s why Darth Decimus started his plan to invade and seize control of Corellia.# Section 1\nWhile the Corellian Council capitulated, the Empire began to invade the planet. It wasn’t really necessary, but Darth Decimus wanted to demonstrate the power of the Empire. All communication was cut off immediately, leaving the planet lonely and without the support of the Republic. The attack on the planet’s capital caused considerable damage to the civilian population, which was augmented by wild alien animals from the Coronet Zoo. Overall, the invasion went almost perfectly with small setbacks, such as the destruction of the rocket tram system of Coronet City. However, the citizens of Corellia weren’t going to submit to the Empire so easily. For the duration of the occupation, the Empire kept having issues with rebeliants and sabotage.\n\n# Section 2\nWhen the Republic re-connected communication lines with Corellia, it immediately sent a fleet and an army to help the besieged planet. Commander-in-Chief of the Republic was General Aves. Republic forces soon established a bridgehead on the Shipwright Auxiliary Spaceport at Coronet’s Blastfield Shipyards. Despite the strong and numerous attacks of the Empire, the Republic remained on the planet and sent more and more troops to the bridgehead. The Republican command center was also set up in the Spin Library when the Legislative Building was under siege. The fierce fighting over Axial Park was soon called the “Battle for Axial Park”, as both the Republic and Empire kept sending more and more troops to gain control of this crucial region. However, after some time the Empire gained the upper hand and won the Battle for Axial Park. After such glorious victory, Darth Decimus focused on the allied forces in Blastfied Shipyards. He proceeded to launch bombarding strikes at the Republican Forces, however, the Anti-Air systems soon forced the Empire to focus on ground fighting. Neither side could gain the upper hand. However, the Emperor running out of patience was putting pressure on Darth Decimus to take over the sector and eliminate the remaining Republic forces. However, the republic began to send reinforcement to aid its trapped forces. Both sides didn’t hold back and the number of casualties kept rising.

Advancing cautiously, the troopers stumbled upon a group of six feral acklay, vicious creatures that had decimated both the 182nd Legion and the initial patrol. Employing rockets and mines, the clones fought valiantly but suffered heavy casualties. Despite the arrival of two gunships attempting to provide support, one was shot down by anti-aircraft guns, crashing nearby.\nMembers of the 501st Legion rallied to protect a severely damaged AT-TE walker from super battle droids and assault droids. Approximately fifty enemy droids advanced down the hill, attempting to destroy the vehicle with rockets. However, their efforts proved futile, and the exposed droids became easy targets for the resilient clones. In order to repair the AT-TE after surviving the assault, the clones retrieved a power cell from the crashed gunship, which allowed them to retake control of the walker.\nThe arrival of Jedi General Aayla Secura marked a turning point in the battle. Leading the 501st contingent, Secura exhibited her exceptional skills with dual lightsabers, cleaving through the ranks of droids. She successfully retrieved a power cell from the crashed gunship, further augmenting the Republic's firepower and causing havoc among the advancing Separatist tanks. With renewed vigor, the Republic troops destroyed six Anti-Vehicle turrets that had been inflicting damage, further pushing forward.\n\n# Section 3\nAs the battle progressed, the focus shifted to the hunt for Presidente Shu Mai, the influential leader of the Commerce Guild, who was believed to be holding Jedi Knight Barriss Offee captive. With Secura at the forefront, the Republic forces set their sights on the Nigkoe Detention Facility, where Offee was thought to be imprisoned. Engaging the formidable Gossam Commandos in fierce combat, the clone troopers, under the command of Clone Commander Bly, successfully secured the facility, allowing Secura to free Offee and her Selonian Padawan, Zonder.\nDetermined to apprehend Presidente Shu Mai, Secura and Offee, accompanied by the 327th Star Corps under the leadership of Commander Bly, advanced towards Mai's heavily fortified compound located near Kway Teow. Employing diversionary tactics that obliterated several B2 super battle droid guards, the Jedi and their clone trooper allies pressed on, utilizing Aratech BARC speeder bikes to navigate the battlefield. A squadron of Republic ARC-170 starfighters effectively neutralized the threat posed by droid starfighters, enabling the ground forces to continue their advance.\nHowever, their hopes of capturing Presidente Shu Mai were dashed when they discovered that her personal ship had departed days before their arrival, and the compound appeared devoid of any recent activity. Despite their disappointment, the Republic forces pressed on, gathering vital intelligence about the ongoing attack on Coruscant.\n\n# Section 4\nAs the Battle of Felucia reached its climax, tragedy struck in the form of Order 66. This sinister protocol, secretly embedded within the clone troopers by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, commanded them to turn against their Jedi commanders. The unsuspecting Jedi, including Aayla Secura and Barriss Offee, suddenly found themselves facing betrayal from the very soldiers they had fought alongside.\nBarriss Offee, besieged by B-2 battle droids, attempted to rally her troops, only to be met with blaster fire from a Republic All Terrain Tactical Enforcer (AT-TE). The betrayal resulted in her untimely demise at the hands of her own troops.\nMeanwhile, Aayla Secura, leading her forces toward Niango, was abruptly attacked when Commander Bly received the fateful Order 66. Seemingly entranced by the sight of a bird taking flight, Secura was caught off guard as Bly turned his blaster on her, ending her life. Concentrated fire from the clone troopers surrounding her sealed her tragic fate.\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Felucia, the surviving Padawans stationed at the Jiaozi water treatment facilities, witnessing the horrifying slaughter of their Jedi mentors, made a daring escape from their own troops. Fleeing the planet, they carried with them the burden of the tragic events that had unfolded on Felucia. With the toxic threat contained and Felucia saved, the newly formed Galactic Empire swiftly assimilated the planet into its growing dominion.\n\n","meta":{"index":38,"author":"DioneSenko","name":"Battle of Felucia (Outer Rim Sieges)","release_year":2021}},"Separatist Crisis":{"content":"# Introduction\nBy the time Dooku began organizing the Separatist Movement, the Republic was already effectively splintered. As part of the Ruusan Reformations, the Republic dissolved its central military in favor of Planetary Security forces maintained by individual worlds. However, many remote star systems could not afford strong defense forces, and so it fell to guilds like the Trade Federation to provide protection for these worlds. In exchange for protection, these megacorporations often received the votes of these systems in the Senate, adding to the corruption and gridlock in which Coruscant was already mired.\n           Among many weaker systems of little note resentment grew for the Republic that could not protect it. These systems were some of the first to rally behind Dooku’s Separatist Movement.# Section 1\nOn the other end, many stronger worlds gravitated towards Dooku as well, seeing an opportunity to grow their own power. The stage for this was set before Dooku even entered the picture.\n           In the eight years between his fall to the Dark Side of the Force and the Raxus Address, Dooku met with the leaders of thousands of star systems and some of the galaxy’s largest corporations. Playing on fears set in place by Sith before him, Dooku began to spread sentiment that the Republic could not protect the systems of the galaxy, using the Battle of Naboo as a prime example. On the other hand, he used the Republic’s post-Naboo treatment of the Trade Federation as an example of another sort to the commerce guilds: under the Republic, they would face nationalization.\n           Dooku ensured that all was ready by the end of Palpatine’s term as Chancellor. One week before Palpatine was scheduled to leave office, Dooku appeared before the whole galaxy on Raxus Prime. His agents hacked a HoloNet transceiver on the world, and the Sith Lord broadcasted a fiery speech condemning the Republic for its corruption and casting the Jedi as overglorified leg-breakers of a tyrannical regime.\n\n# Section 2\nAnd then, before the entire galaxy, he declared the secession of a thousand star systems from the Republic, and the formation of a new government: the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\n           Chaos broke out immediately. Amidst a wave of declarations of secession, the Galactic Senate frantically voted to extend Palpatine’s second term as Supreme Chancellor for the duration of the Separatist Crisis. Palpatine strongly urged for cool heads and unity, but it was to no avail. Raxus, Agamar, Ukio, Metalorn, Serenno, Yag’Dhul, Geonosis, and Celanon all seceded in short order, bringing thousands of worlds with them. The Republic was hopelessly divided. The Separatist Crisis had begun.\n           Some worlds seceded shortly after the Raxus Address, and would be known over the next few years as rabidly Separatist. On the other hand, many Republic worlds - including Kuat and Fondor, which both broke ties with the Techno Union following the Raxus Address - became rabidly Loyalist, urging the Senate to recreate the Republic military and declare war on the fledgling CIS. Others, like Corellia and Mandalore, declared neutrality.\n\n# Section 3\nBut the worlds that saw the worst of the Separatist Crisis were worlds like Antar and Ansion: worlds now embroiled in fierce civil wars between Loyalist and Separatist factions.\n           Antar 4 was the site of one of the most notorious battles in the Separatist Crisis, and marked when the Crisis truly turned violent. Taking place eighteen months after the Raxus Address, Antar 4 - the moon home to the Gotal species - had come under the control of the Gotal Assembly for Separation, which backed the CIS. However, the Antarian Rangers, a Jedi-allied Loyalist group, opposed secession, and kept the Antar System contested. \n           During the New Year Fete Week of that year, however, open violence began. The Roshu Sune, a militant splinter group in the Separatist Assembly, had placed sleeper agents within the Antarian Rangers, and activated them. Many of the Rangers were massacred, and those offworld quickly returned home to avenge their fallen comrades. The Republic responded with a Jedi-led assault, which was shredded by Separatist militants. As a counterattack the Republic fired off several electromagnetic pulses across the moon, overwhelming the Gotals’ sensitive head cones and causing extreme pain for the entire population. The Republic retained control of Antar 4, but had lost the support of the Gotals, and had shown the galaxy that it was not invincible.\n\n# Section 4\nAnti-Jedi sentiment began to grow on both sides at this time. Many of the Separatists hated and feared the Jedi, who they saw as kidnappers and the mysterious servants of a tyrannical regime. On the other side, many rabidly Loyalist groups distrusted the Jedi in equal measure. After all, many said, was not Count Dooku himself a former Jedi? The Jedi did not help their case by refusing to connect Dooku with violent Separatist attacks, even when the Confederate Head of State refused to condemn the attacks done in his name. Bombings on Coruscant continued, seemingly at random.\n           Over the course of the Separatist Crisis, the galactic government on Coruscant continued to prove ineffective. The Financial Reform Act was initiated as a response to the Raxus Address and aimed to combat corruption in the Senate; however, after the assassination of one of the bill’s chief proponents, the vote was indefinitely postponed. This spurred even more secessions, and seemed to confirm Dooku’s claims.   Chief among those secessions were those of Ando and Sy Myrth. Both brought hundreds of systems with them, bringing the total of Confederate member worlds above six thousand. Ando, however, became the center of yet another civil war in short order.\n\n# Section 5\nhe Andoan Free Colonies, in opposition to the militaristic Spiverelda government, refused to acknowledge Ando’s secession, and a bloody civil war began. The Andoan Civil War lasted for three years, and would be a microcosm for the conflict brewing outside.\n           The CIS would often be remembered in later years as having a backbone of major corporations, but in truth none of these openly backed Dooku until shortly before the Battle of Geonosis. However, in secret their leaders conspired and built up massive droid armies nonetheless, and manipulated worlds into secession. The Republic would not discover this until it was far too late.\n           One of these manipulated worlds was Ansion. A backwater grassy planet in a remote part of the Rim, Ansion seemed to have nothing significant about it - but not to the Confederacy. Shu Mai, the Presidente of the Commerce Guild, pointed out to Count Dooku something about Ansion that had previously gone unnoticed: Ansion was the nexus of a complicated net of theories ranging from the Malarian Alliance to the Keitumite Mutual Military Treaty - meaning its secession would bring forty odd major worlds into the Confederate fold, and potentially more besides.\n\n# Section 6\nShu Mai managed to unite the scattered Ansion clans into a Separatist coalition - but the Republic sent Jedi to stop it. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luminara Unduli, with their Padawans, Anakin Skywalker and Barriss Offee, were sent to Ansion to settle the dispute and keep the planet in the Republic. They were ultimately successful: a bright spot for the Republic, but merely a distraction from the storm massing in the galaxy at large.\n           By the time of the Mission to Ansion, the Confederacy was composed of more than ten thousand star systems, with the number rapidly growing each day. In the Galactic Senate, militarism spread, and soon a Military Creation Act was put forward, which would recreate the Republic Military. Many Senators opposed it, including Bail Organa of Alderaan, Mon Mothma of Chandrila, and Padmé Amidala of Naboo.\n           But when Senator Amidala arrived on Coruscant to vote against the act, her star cruiser was bombed, killing dozens of Naboo personnel, and prompting the Supreme Chancellor to put her under the protection of two Jedi: Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. The assassin tried again that night, but after a high-speed chase was caught by the Jedi. The bounty hunter responsible, Zam Wesell, was shot before she could give up her employer by a man in a suit of Mandalorian armor.\n\n# Section 7\nWhile his apprentice took Amidala to Naboo to be guarded more securely, Kenobi attempted to find the identity of the armored man who shot Wesell. After pinpointing the origin of the dart used to kill Zam, he tracked the man to Kamino, a remote Wild Space world above the galactic plane. What he discovered there changed the history of the galaxy forever.\n           Shortly before the Battle of Naboo, a Jedi Master known as Sifo-Dyas had a vision of a war that would split the Republic in two. At the urging of his close friend, Master Dooku, Sifo-Dyas had traveled to Kamino and placed an order for a massive clone army to be grown for the Jedi over the course of ten years. He said the army was for the Republic.\n           But Dooku, operating under the name Darth Tyranus, had Sifo-Dyas killed, and took over the project. He selected Jango Fett for the job of clone template, a Mandalorian bounty hunter whom he had met on Galidraan years prior. Fett accepted, demanding that he would receive a high salary and that he would receive the first clone with no genetic tampering to raise as a son. The Kaminoans agreed, and he named his new son Boba.\n\n# Section 8\nTen years later, Obi-Wan Kenobi entered Tipoca City to find that the first batch of clones was ready - the Kaminoans had grown a massive army, with two thousand units ready and a million more on the way. Though Kenobi assumed “units” to mean individual clones, the Jedi later learned that it actually referred to platoons - and that the army totalled more than forty million clones, with many more to come. Kenobi reported this to the Jedi Council, who found the report disturbing - Sifo-Dyas had never been commanded to place the order, and never discussed it with any of them.\n           Kenobi was then taken to meet Jango Fett - and identified him as the very man who had killed Zam Wesell. Recognizing the Jedi from a few nights before, Jango and Boba immediately prepared to leave Kamino. Though they were able to escape Kenobi in Jango’s ship, Slave I, the Jedi had planted a tracking device on it. Kenobi then followed the Fetts to Geonosis.\n           On Geonosis, Dooku had at last gathered the heads of the large corporations that had come to support him, and officially organized the CIS.\n\n# Section 9\nThe beings present - several Senators and the heads of the Trade Federation, Techno Union, Banking Clan, Commerce Guild, Corporate Alliance, Geonosian Industries, Hyper-Communications Cartel, Quarren Isolation League - became the Separatist Council, and pooled their droid armies into a vast fighting force, which was being expanded in the catacomb factories below. The CIS was now a powerful military threat.\n           Obi-Wan Kenobi reported these findings to the Jedi Council, but was captured by Geonosian guards - as were secret lovers Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala, who attempted to follow and rescue him. As all three faced death in a Geonosian execution arena, the Jedi reported their findings to the Senate. Two hundred and twelve Jedi, led by Mace Windu, departed for Geonosis to rescue the trio.\n           Back on Coruscant, the vote on the Military Creation Act was interrupted by the news of Dooku’s actions on Geonosis. The stunned Senators quickly voted to give more emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor. Palpatine accepted with seeming reluctance, and immediately created a Grand Army of the Republic. Jedi Grand Master Yoda departed to collect the Clone Army from Kamino, and took nearly two hundred thousand troopers to Geonosis.\n           There they found that Windu’s rescue had gone badly.\n\n# Section 10\nOnly thirty Jedi remained (as well as Senator Amidala), and they were surrounded by massive hordes of Separatist battle droids. With little time to lose, Yoda ordered the clones to land and create a perimeter around the survivors, spiriting them out of the arena before landing en masse in the wide flats outside to combat the already-deployed Droid Army. The Battle of Geonosis kicked into high gear, and open war had begun. \n           The Battle of Geonosis was a Republic victory, but an incomplete one. The entire Separatist Council escaped, as well as Count Dooku and most of the Confederacy’s military leaders. Anakin Skywalker had lost a hand in the battle, and many Jedi lost their lives. Vast numbers of battle droids escaped aboard corporate warships. Geonosis was in Republic hands, but only in name and on the surface: in the catacombs below the Geonosians schemed to take back their world. \n           The CIS claimed Raxus Secundus as its capital and moved the Separatist Parliament to it. Sev’rance Tann, Dooku’s favored general, was made Supreme Commander of the massive force that was the new Confederate Military. The Republic brought in the first three million clone troopers of its order immediately, and sent them off aboard assault ships to early battlefronts. Only one thing was certain - Clone Wars had just begun.\n\n","meta":{"index":64,"author":"DemshyAlkion","name":"Separatist Crisis","release_year":2020}},"Huk War":{"content":"# Introduction\nDuring the Huk War, the Kaleesh lost, since the Republic reinforced the Huks in the war.

This war was dubbed “The Clone Wars” because of the vast army of Clone Troopers utilized by the Republic to form their main offensive body. The war ended with the Great Jedi Purge and brought the galaxy into the Age of the Empire. This war was mostly started and ended by Darth Sidious, who posed as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. The Clone Wars were pivotal in the galaxy’s history and shaped the current events within the galaxy today.# Section 1\nThe Clone Wars were the result of Sith Lord Darth Sidious, formerly the disciple of Darth Plagueis, carrying out the Sith Grand Plan. This was a scheme created by the sith that focused on complete political manipulation of the galaxy’s planets and to carry it out, Sidious played to both sides, as Chancellor Palpatine for the Republic, and Sidious for the opposing forces. Sidious planned to shift the Galactic Republic to the Galactic Empire, and bring about a golden age for Sith.\n\nAfter the Galactic Senate had passed 2 pieces of legislation that declared that the Outer Rim was now a free trade zone, they had given immense power to the Trade Federation, which was a Nemoidian cartel. Because of these laws, not only did they have complete control of trade within the outer rim, but they also gained many spots on the Galactic Senate. The delicate issue of the Outer Rim polarized the senate, with sides being taken. During this time, two groups popped up. Firstly, a faction referred to as the Militarists had been calling for the Republic Military to be brought back up to its former glory, to keep the Outer Rim in control. The second group was the Nebula Front, a terrorist group that declared war by any means necessary on the Trade Federation. While these two groups further complicated the issue and caused a storm of politics, Senator Palpatine began his term as a senator representing the Chromell sector. Little did anyone know, however, that Palpatine was actually Darth Sidious, and had carefully set into place each conflict to jumpstart the Sith Grand Plan, which was a scheme to create a war that would bring about the end of the Galactic Republic through political manipulation.\n\nThe Battle of Naboo was where the personalities, Sidious and Palpatine, worked in tandem to create a mass conflict. This invasion began when Darth Sidious ordered the Trade Federation to create a blockade. This incident made the current chancellor, Supreme Chancellor Valorum, seem impotent to stop the conflict on Naboo. As Palpatine, Sidious deceived Queen Padme Amidala to declare a Vote of No Confidence, which, if successful, would remove Valorum from office. During this, not only did Sidious murder his master, Darth Plagueis, and become a Sith Lord, but also became Supreme Chancellor by an empathetic senate vote. Finally, the Sith Lord was at the head of the Galactic Republic.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Trade Federation’s invasion of Naboo caused the death of Jedi Master Qui-Gon-Jinn, who was killed at the hands of Darth Maul during the conflict. On top of this, events that had transpired while Queen Amidala was attempting to escape from Naboo to Coruscant had revealed the discovery of the force-sensitive Anakin Skywalker, who was surmised by Qui-Gon-Jinn to be the prophesied Chosen One, a being said to bring balance to the force. After Qui-Gon’s untimely death, Anakin was assigned as a padawan to Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was promoted to Jedi Knight.\n\nUnfortunately for Sidious, his apprentice, Darth Maul, had also been killed in the conflict during the Invasion of Naboo. In lieu of Maul, Sidious decided that Jedi Master Count Dooku, who had had his faith in the Republic shattered after their perceived impotence over the Battle of Galidraan, and their lack of action in Naboo, was a good candidate for turning into a Sith. After Dooku had betrayed and killed his friend, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, he was officially converted into Sith Lord Darth Tyrannus, and became the Sith puppet for Sidious to carry out his bidding. However, before his death, Sifo-Dyas, foreseeing war, decided to contact the Kaminoans to have them build a clone army for the Republic. However, what he did not realize is that Sidious was one step ahead of him in this matter. Sidious, however, was caught off guard by the fact that the army had been discovered before he wanted it to be. Count Dooku appointed bounty hunter Jango Fett to be the template for this clone army, and the inhibitor chip originally conceived by Sifo-Dyas to be a failsafe for rogue Jedis, became the catalyst for the Clones to perceive the Jedi as gone rogue and kill them in the Great Jedi Purge.\n\nWhile this clone army was being prepared, Palpatine’s eight-year term was coming to an end. However, because of this, Count Dooku finally emerged into the spotlight on Raxus Prime, and declared the creation of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, an organization of different governments and organizations designed with the goal to secede from the Republic. This triggered a wave of organizations and governments seceding to join the Confederacy, which caused the Separatist Crisis. Out of fear, Palpatine’s term was extended past the permitted amount to keep order within the Senate.\n\nSubsequently, tensions between both the Separatists or Confederacy and the Galactic Republic grew, with Dooku appointing Dark Acolytes, further extensions of himself, who included Asajj Ventress, Sev’rance Tann,  Sora Bulq, Tol Skorr, Kadrian Sey, Artel Darc, Karoc, Vinoc, Saato, Trenox, and Jedi Master Quinlan Vos for some time. On top of this, Dooku arranged for a shuttle crash which caused the disfigurement of the Kaleesh warrior Qymen jai Sheelal, whose body was taken to Geonosis and repaired, as well as had support given to his people by the InterGalactic Banking Clan, in exchange for leading the Confederacy Droid Army. Finally, all the pieces had been set in place for the Sith to begin The Clone Wars with the Battle of Geonosis.\n\n# Section 3\nBattle of Geonosis\n\nAfter a bomb attack aimed at killing Senator Padme Amidala on Corusant, and a subsequent second attack, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi was given the task of uncovering the mastermind behind the assassination attempts on Amidala’s life, while his padawan, Anakin Skywalker, escorted the Senator back to Naboo. Kenobi was led to Kamino through his search, where he discovered the Clone Army, which at this time had 200,000 units, with a projected 1,000,000 in production. Here he also met Jango Fett, who attempted to flee to Geonosis, but was followed by the Jedi Knight. When Kenobi arrived on Geonosis, he realized that the Separatists were creating a massive droid army to strike at the defenseless Republic, but was captured by the Separatists. However, he managed to get a message to the Republic before his capture. Meanwhile, Mace Windu ordered Anakin Skywalker to stay where he was with Amidala on Tatooine. However, Amidala wanted to go to Geonosis to free Kenobi, so the pair traveled to the planet, where they were captured. Following their capture, Kenobi, Skywalker, and Amidala were all sentenced to be executed at the behest of Archduke Poggle the Lesser, who was later revealed to be a Separatist leader. With the knowledge of the droid army, Chancellor Palpatine legalized the use of the Clone Army within the Republic’s offensive force.\n\nFollowing this, a Jedi strike team, headed by Mace Windu, traveled to Geonosis in order to free the Jedi and Senator. On Geonosis, they stormed the Petranaki Arena, where the three were being executed. The battle within this arena resulted with many casualties for the Jedi, but also the death of Jango Fett, the clone template. This was also where the Jedi faced B2 Super Battle droids for the first time, and were overpowered by their weaponry.\n\nThe Jedi, despite fighting valiantly, were getting overpowered under opposing forces, and had made the decision to fight to the end. Fortunately, under Jedi Master Yoda’s command, the Clone Army dropped into the arena from Republic gunships, thus saving the strike team from an untimely death. The clones engaged the droid army to prevent their escape. In the air, clone pilots led by Adi Gallia took out numerous Trade Federation Gunships, and clone commandos, namely of the Delta Squad, took out many Separatist forces and leaders, such as Sun Fac, who was Archduke Poggle the Lesser’s chief lieutenant.\n\nMeanwhile, Count Dooku, seeing the losing battle, fled with plans for a Separatist “Ultimate Weapon” to a secret hangar. However, he was cut off by Obi-Wan Kenobi and his padawan, Anakin Skywalker, while on his way there. Dooku managed to best the two, and severed Skywalker’s forearm, before he was confronted by Yoda, and had to use trickery to escape. Dooku escaped to Coruscant, where he met with Sidious in Sector 943. (aka. The Works) Though Geonosis had been a loss, the two were focused on the long game.\n\n# Section 4\nSubsequently, tensions between both the Separatists or Confederacy and the Galactic Republic grew, with Dooku appointing Dark Acolytes, further extensions of himself, who included Asajj Ventress, Sev’rance Tann,  Sora Bulq, Tol Skorr, Kadrian Sey, Artel Darc, Karoc, Vinoc, Saato, Trenox, and Jedi Master Quinlan Vos for some time. On top of this, Dooku arranged for a shuttle crash which caused the disfigurement of the Kaleesh warrior Qymen jai Sheelal, whose body was taken to Geonosis and repaired, as well as had support given to his people by the InterGalactic Banking Clan, in exchange for leading the Confederacy Droid Army. Finally, all the pieces had been set in place for the Sith to begin The Clone Wars with the Battle of Geonosis.\n\n# Section 5\nFollowing the Battle of Geonosis, war had now become inevitable for both the Republic and Separatists. The Clone Army was deployed to find and hunt down Separatists, and defeat the Confederacy for good. These clones were led by Jedi Knights, and this marked the first time the Jedi had collectively taken up arms to fight since the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, marking the severity of this conflict.\n\nThe Republic’s strategy was largely crafted by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who established sector armies, which were large bodies of troopers that covered areas of priority. Each sector army numbered 150,000 clone troopers initially, but this number expanded largely as the war continued. Under command of Jedi Masters, the main purpose of these armies was to be reactionary, incase attacks happened within these sectors, and they were divided under the 1/4/16/64 plan created by Chancellor Palpatine. This plan divided them into 1 corps operation, 4 brigade-level operation, 16 regiment-level operations, and 64 battalion-level operations. The Republic also utilized Planetary Security Forces, which were small defensive deployments. Due to this, many battles during the Clone Wars were fought without use of Clone Troopers or Droid armies.\n\nThe Republic fought rather defensively, though it launched some successful attacks. Most attacks by the Republic were usually raids on a small scale, and were mostly inconsequential. The Separatists, however, utilized a stateless strategy, knowing their army was far outnumbered by the Galactic Republic. This strategy mostly focused on attacking where the Republic could not, and utilizing their spread space to their advantage. Behind the scenes, Darth Sidious was controlling most of the actions of the Separatists indirectly through Count Dooku, his apprentice.\n\nMany battles were fought by both the Republic and Separatists, and further increased tensions between the two groups. The first year of battle consisted mainly of preparations for the long war, and saw mostly prosperity for both sides. The second consisted of far more action, and saw humiliation for the Republic and victory for the Confederacy in many places, and the final year of the battle saw the culmination of Sidious’ motives, and The Great Jedi Purge.\n\n# Section 6\nOrder 66\n\nOne of the main contributors to the downfall of the Republic was Anakin Skywalker, who had been manipulated and lied to by Sidious, whom he considered a father figure. Through Palpatine’s decievement, Anakin began to resent the Jedi, and Palpatine further played into this, offering him more than the Jedi ever could. Palpatine eventually revealed he was Darth Sidious, knowing that Anakin would report this to the Jedi Council. However, when Jedi Master Mace Windu arrived along with Jedi Masters Kit Fisto, Saesee Tiin, and Agen Kolar, Skywalker arrived against Windu’s wishes, and under deception of Sidious, betrayed Windu, cutting off his lightsaber wielding hand, giving Sidious time to throw him out of the Coruscant window to his death with Force Lighting. Anakin’s betrayal completely transformed him into Darth Vader, a Sith Lord. His first task was to go into the Jedi Temple and eliminate all the Jedi within. This event marked the beginning of the Great Jedi Purge.\n\nOn Sidious’ side, he carried out a secret protocol known as Order 66, which activated the Clone Troopers’ inhibitor chips, making them view the Jedi as traitors to the Republic. Almost instantly, tens of Jedi were killed by the troopers, while Vader commenced Operation:Knightfall, a protocol to kill all Jedi within the Temple, regardless of rank. Many prominent Jedi were killed during this operation, and after this purge, there was little opposition left. After Vader’s mission, he traveled to Mustafar, and slaughtered every single one of the Separatist leaders who assumed they would be rewarded. Following this, Vader deactivated the droid army, to force Separatists to surrender to the Galactic Republic, which would soon be converted by Sidious. The Great Jedi Purge had ended, and the Age of the Galactic Empire had begun. However, certain Jedi had survived the purge, notably Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi, both of whom would go into exile and eventually raise Luke Skywalker to become a Jedi, setting off a chain of events that would result in a new Jedi Order being established.\n\nTo summarize, the Clone Wars were a large-scale conflict characterized by the vast armies of Clone Troopers utilized by the Galactic Republic. This war was headed by Darth Sidious, who used it as a way to carry out the Sith Grand Plan, and bring about the Age of the Empire. This war, despite only lasting three years, was pivotal in shaping the current hierarchy within the galaxy today.\n\n","meta":{"index":61,"author":"WhoopeyNight","name":"Clone Wars","release_year":2021}},"Great Sith War":{"content":"# Introduction\nOver the generations, Ossus had continued to thrive as a Jedi fortress world, holding many treasures and knowledge in Odan-Urr's massive archives known as the Great Jedi Library. The Jedi High Council began to take a more active role in the operations of the Order, and Four Masters oversaw the construction of a massive Temple on Coruscant to house members of the Order responsible for working directly with Republic representatives. At the height of Ossus' heyday in 3996 BBY, the talented and curious Jedi Exar Kun, having learned about the Golden Age of the Sith, traveled from Ossus to Dxun where he found the tomb of Freedon Nadd. The spirit of Nadd corrupted Kun and the young Jedi surrendered to the dark side of the Force. After first traveling to Korriban, Kun then went to Yavin's fourth moon and took over Naga Sadow's ancient fortresses, enslaving the Massassi race to further his ambitious plans. Destroying Nadd's spirit for the last time, Exar Kun staked his claim as the true heir to the ancient Sith legacy, which was thought to have been destroyed. When word of this unsettling turn of events reached the Jedi High Council, a conclave was called on Deneba to discuss the growing foothold of the Sith. During the conclave, the secret dark side society called the Krath attacked the Jedi with war droids.# Section 1\nLed by Aleema and Satal Keto, the Krath were able to kill the legendary Master Arca Jeth, who died while saving his student Ulic Qel-Droma's life. When the Krath were repelled, the Jedi regrouped and returned to Ossus. Seeking retribution for his masters death Qel'Droma planned an unsanctioned mission to infiltrate the Krath in an attempt to destroy them from within. The Krath, suspecting he was a spy, injected him with a Sith poison, and eventually, Qel'Droma fell to the dark side and became a Krath general. Concurrently Sith acolyte Exar Kun traveled to Cinnagar to find and destroy Ulic Qel-Droma. However, their duel was interrupted by the spirit of Marka Ragnos, who commanded them to stop fighting each other and form an alliance, declaring them Dark Lords of the Sith. United, the Dark Lords waged war on the Republic, luring young Jedi from Ossus and subverting them to the dark side while in a stunning move, Exar Kun raided the Great Jedi Library and stole the Dark Holocron after murdering the legendary Master Odan-Urr. Elsewhere, Qel-Droma defeated Mandalore the Indomitable, the leader of the Mandalorians, and with their leader defeated the Mandalorian Crusaders agreed to join the Sith. Qel-Droma's Krath and Mandalorian forces laid siege to Coruscant in an all-out attack at the heart of the Republic.\n\n# Section 2\nJedi forces on the capital were few as their temple remained as just a small hermitage but infighting between Qel-Droma and Aleema Keto allowed for the Republic to score a victory through the capture of Qel-Droma and the retreat of his forces. In the custody of the Republic, Qel-Droma was tried before the Galactic Senate on Coruscant for war crimes. During the hearing, Dark Lord Exar Kun walked into the Senate Hall and executed the Chancellor before a shocked audience and later struck down the wise Master Vodo-Siosk Baas. Freeing Qel-Droma, Kun contacted his acolytes within the Jedi Order to assassinate their former Masters in a successful pogrom which left many Jedi dead. At the culmination of their attack on the Order, the Sith Lords made the suns of the Cron Cluster go supernova using Naga Sadow's Sith flagship, which they had discovered on Yavin 4; the exploding stars sent a devastating shock wave through space directly towards Ossus. Aware of their impending doom, the Jedi desperately tried to save as many of the artifacts stored on the world while a mass evacuation took place. In a stunning move, Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma arrived on Ossus as the Jedi scattered in an effort to loot the Great Jedi Library. In the upper levels, Master Ood Bnar buried several priceless artifacts just before the Sith arrived.\n\n# Section 3\nAs the Sith attempted to strike him down, Bnar called on the Force to transform his body into that of a tree, a technique that came naturally to the Neti. Meanwhile, Qel-Droma dueled his brother Cay and killed him in his anger. When confronted with the finality of his actions, Qel-Droma's will was shattered and was then cut off from the Force by the Jedi Nomi Sunrider. A broken shell, Qel-Droma surrendered to the Republic and was escorted off of Ossus as it was swept clean by the supernova's shock wave. With Qel-Droma in the hands of the Jedi Order, Exar Kun knew that his secret forces on Yavin 4 were in peril. To prevent his ultimate defeat, Kun committed a ritual which took the life from every Massassi on the planet to separate his spirit from his body and bind it to his temple. When Jedi forces arrived on the planet they unleashed a Force-assault on the world, trapping Kun's spirit within his temple indefinitely. With both Sith Lords defeated and the Mandalorian Crusaders defeated on Onderon, the Jedi Order had finally brought an end to the Great Sith War. With many great Masters dead and the fortress world of Ossus uninhabitable, Master Nomi Sunrider called a conclave on Exis Station to formally address the Order and begin the healing process. With the entire Order in attendance, Sunrider accepted the leadership role within the Order and set to rebuild the High Council.\n\n# Section 4\nAdditionally, the headquarters of the Jedi was to be relocated to Coruscant, with major expansions on the existing enclave there to accommodate the entire Order. Relics and texts which had been stored at Exis Station after the destruction of Ossus would be transported to Coruscant as a new Jedi Archives was compiled within the Temple. In addition to her work in rebuilding the Order, Master Sunrider ordered the creation of an underground city on the planet Yavin 4 to aid the recovery of the planet's ecology as well as to ensure that Kun's spirit never returned again.\n\n","meta":{"index":14,"author":"","name":"Great Sith War","release_year":0}},"Second Battle of Geonosis":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Second Battle of Geonosis was one of the Republic’s largest operations during the Clone Wars. The military campaign was a planetary-wide invasion that rostered many Jedi Generals in the massive invasion force, which included Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Master Luminara Unduli, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and Jedi General Ki-Adi Mundi. Although the Second Battle of Geonosis was a victory for the Republic, all four Jedi Generals faced heavy resistance and challenges from the native geonosians.# Section 1\nBefore the Second Battle of Geonosis, Geonosis was liberated from Republic control, months after the First Battle of Geonosis, due to high separatist resistance from the native geonosian population. Senator Rush Clovis, Archduke Poggle the Lesser, and Senator Lott Dod were discovered by the Senator of Naboo, Padmé Amidala, to build the largest droid factory of the Confederacy of Independent Systems on Geonosis. This information would lead to the Republic sending a massive invasion force, to recapture Geonosis from Separatist control, due to the threat the large droid factory could present in the Outer Rim Territories. The planetary invasion force was under the command of Admiral Wullf Yularen, while the four Jedi Generals would be in charge of the ground forces, during the operation. The large droid factory was under the protection of a ray shield, so orbital bombardment was not an option for the destruction of the factory. To assault the factory, the Jedi Generals came up with a plan to land near the ray shield, to reduce the amount of open-field combat, as this was a major flaw in the First Battle of Geonosis, where the republic lost about 85% of the clone attack force of 190,000. To reduce the amount of surface fire from the geonosians, they planned to come from 3 different directions, but meet at a singular rendezvous point. What the Jedi Generals did not account for, was that the geonosians also accounted for their mistakes in the First Battle of Geonosis. The geonosians and the droid army’s main weakness during the First Battle of Geonosis, was the lack of anti-aircraft weapons. In response to these flaws, the geonosians armed themselves with their starfighters and proton cannons.\n\n# Section 2\nOnce the LAAT transports flew down from the Venator and Acclamator Star Destroyers, what awaited them were Geonosian Nantex-class Territorial Defense Starfighters and long-range proton cannons. Although a squadron of Y-wings did reduce the number of proton cannons near the landing zone, the LAAT transports were still getting shot down in massive numbers. As a result, Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ki-Adi Mundi, and Anakin Skywalker were all shot down in different areas and Clone Commander CC-2224 (Cody) was the highest-ranking officer at the landing zone. In response to the amount of fire coming from all sides, Cody ordered his forces to make a defensive perimeter, to hopefully hold out until air support and reinforcements arrived. General Mundi’s forces crashed northeast from the landing point, where they were forced to go through a cave to reach the rendezvous point. In the cave, General Mundi’s forces had to deal with a geonosian nest, but luckily his Special Operations Troopers also consisted of a unit of flame troopers. With the use of flamethrowers, General Mundi and his clone forces were able to escape the cave. General Skywalker and the 501st Legion crashed southeast of the landing point, where they were forced into a canyon, where they encountered a droid fortress. The fortress had turrets mounted at the top and droids firing down at the 501st. Luckily, with the combat prowess of General Skywalker and his padawan, Ahsoka Tano, they were able to destroy the fortress and met up with General Mundi’s forces. Unlike the other Jedi Generals, General Kenobi’s force landed at the rendezvous point, but his gunship crashed near the landing zone. Clone Commander CC-2224 (Cody) sent Clone Troopers “Waxer'' and “Boil” to rescue General Kenobi out of his crashed gunship. The rescue was successful, but the 212th Attack Battalion was getting overwhelmed by enemy fire from all sides. Overcoming all odds, Admiral Wullf Yularen was able to get a Y-wing Bomber Squadron to bombard the droid and geonosian lines surrounding the 212th. The 501st and Mundi’s forces regrouped and started their plan to destroy the shield generator, to allow the reinforcements and 41st Elite Corp to the area. General Skywalker and the 501st were able to destroy the shield generator, with the use of EMP grenades and AT-TE walkers. What was up ahead, was the droid factory.\n\n# Section 3\nWith Generals Kenobi and Mundi injured, they were sent to the medical bay on the Venator, where they left Generals Skywalker and Unduli in charge of the assault on the droid factory. With the 41st Elite Corps and the 501st Legion rallying near the droid factory, Master Unduli came up with a plan to destroy the factory. She planned to have her Padawan, Barriss Offee, and General Skywalker’s padawan, Ahsoka Tano, sneak through the geonosian catacombs underneath the droid factory and destroy the droid factory from the inside, while the 41st and 501st will distract the droid and geonosian forces from the entrance of the factory. The plan worked at the beginning, but after the padawans were noticed by a geonosian soldier, the plan changed, as the geonosians took their thermal detonators and flew off to other parts of the factory. Due to time, the padawans used a nearby droid super tank to shoot the main reactor of the factory, causing the whole factory to crumble. Luckily, the padawans were safe from the wreckage, due to the armor of the super tank.\n\n# Section 4\nThe final operations on Geonosis included a search for Archduke Poggle the Lesser and any form of separatist resistance on the planet. After Master Unduli and her clone trooper units were missing, after checking the Progate Temple, Kenobi, Skywalker, and a few troopers from the 212th, inspected the temple. In the temple, they discovered Master Unduli was captured and the temple was the location of Poggle the Lesser and Geonosian Queen Karina. With this information, the Generals and clone units freed Master Unduli, captured Poggle, and killed the Queen, after collapsing the cave onto her. With all major separatist leaders captured or dead, the Second Battle of Geonosis was a success for the Republic.\n\n","meta":{"index":23,"author":"1tsKita","name":"Second Battle of Geonosis","release_year":2021}},"Mission to Prakith":{"content":"# Introduction\nOccuring from 137ABY onwards, the mission to Prakith in short was conducted by the Sith Lord Darth Wyyrlok III in order to acquire a cure for Darth Krayt. Darth Krayt at the time was suffering from the implications of Yorik-Kul implants gifted to him by the Yuuzhan Vong.\n\nWyyrlok III had spent countless days researching Sith archives for answers and any form of antidote. He came upon a holocron belonging to the Dark Lord Darth Andeddu. This was important as Andeddu was famous for supposedly having the ability to preserve his body long after death.\n\nWyrlok III embarked on a mission to Prakith, which was Andeddu’s homeworld in hopes of finding information regarding this method of immortality that ANdeddu had used.\n\nThe Chief Lieutenant, Wyrlok III encountered a cult of Sith named the Malevolence who prohibited the man from entering. He had however come too far to quit, and had them all executed except one named Gerlun. Gerlun was used to awaken Andeddu by sacrificing his own body.\n\nAndeddu and the Lieutenant engaged in combat upon awakening as Andeddu refused to share his secrets. The Lieutenant mercilessly killed Andeddu, who now lay dead for a second time. He now left Prakith without gaining any more progress towards finding an antidote for his master.# Section 1\nAt the beginning of the Second Imperial Civil War, a man named A’Sharad Hett who later became Darth Krayt was captured by the Yuuzhan Vong and implanted with their feared Yorik-Kul slave seeds. This drained power from the Sith and essentially sent him telekinetic commands from a yammosk or dhuryam. It would slowly make it’s victims brain dead which motivated Krayt to seek all means to heal it. He even later turned to Cade Skywalker for assistance.\n\n# Section 2\nThe conflict between Andeddu and Wyrrlok III was both perilous and filled with darkness. The two clashed for a while, lashing out shards of lightning and utilising the Force to best eachother. However, Andeddu’s fault came when Wyrrlok III sensed that he was afraid of death.\n\nThe Lieutenant used the Force to launch lava and rocks at the Artefacts around Andeddu’s tomb. Andeddu, believing these illusions to be real, and treasuring his artefacts was distracted long enough for Wyyrlok III to cover him in real lava and flames. \n\nThe man perished for a second time due to his fear of death, triggered by the fear that he would lose the knowledge he had spent many years to get.\n\n# Section 3\nAs honourable as Darth Wyrrlok III’s mission was, he later betrayed Darth Krayt anyways, sighting one of the most famous Sith philosophies by Darth Bane.

Prior to the Cold War, Jedi Padawans Parkanas Tark, Yuon Par, Cin Tykan, Sidonie Garen, Eriz Vossan and Duras Fain travelled to the planet of Malachor III, located in the infamous system in which Malachor V had been destroyed several centuries prior. They stumbled across the burial ground of Terrak Morrhage, an ancient Sith Lord who centuries prior had created a plague that corrupted Jedi, turning them to the Dark Side and placing them under his control. Morrhage’s spirit began to corrupt members of the expedition, before they managed to escape at the expense of Tark, who was stranded and left behind.# Section 1\nBy 3643 BBY with the Cold War occurring across the Galaxy, the Padawans had all reached the rank of Jedi Master, being notable in their own right. However, Tark, who had been corrupted by Morrhage’s spirit and had assumed the name Lord Vivicar began to inflict the original plague upon his former allies, with the plague beginning to spread to other Jedi. Par’s former padawan, a Jedi Consular who was to become the 3rd Barsen’thor (Warden of the Order) became aware of the plague, and set out to learn an ancient shielding technique that had been created with the first outbreak of Morrhage’s plague. The Jedi Consular learnt the shielding technique after securing several ancient Jedi Holocrons, known as the Noetikons, and began to travel the galaxy, shielding the Masters from Vivicar’s control. Eventually, the Consular confronted Vivicar upon his flagship, discovering his origin as Tark and using the shielding technique upon him. As a result, Tark was redeemed to the Light Side, but Morrhage’s spirit was left intact albeit weakened.

The Galactic Empire strove to eradicate Toonbuck Toora and her army, and almost every front she engaged them on ended in defeat. Finally, an Imperial task force under the command of Admiral Adar Tallon and General Jan Dodonna, chased down Toora's flagship, Defiance's Banner.

The Battle of Kothlis occurred after secret Imperial construction data was stolen during a Rebellion raid on an Imperial freighter. This construction data was revealed to be the plans for the Death Star II, a recreation of the previous Death Star superweapon. The plans were delivered to a Rebellion safehouse on the colony world Kothlis. The site was raided by bounty hunters, who stole the information and took it away on their ship, the Razor. As the Razor was escaping the planet’s atmosphere, an Imperial Star Destroyer jumped out of hyperspace right on top of them. The Razor was ensnared by the Star Destroyers tractor beam. \n\nThe Battle over Kothlis truly began when Rebel reinforcements jumped out of hyperspace and noticed the Imperial Star Destroyer. These reinforcements were made up of Rogue Squadron, and contained three B-wing starfighters, four T-65B X-wing starfighters, and three RZ-1 A-wing interceptors. This squadron was lead by Rogue Leader Wedge Antilles. Rogue Squadron engaged with a contingent of TIE Fighters that were sent from the Star Destroyer. Rogue Squadron engaged with the TIE Fighters and Wedge Antilles destroyed the Star Destroyer’s ion cannons.# Section 1\nHe was also able to cause additional damage to the Star Destroyer. Beginning a swift barrage of attacks, he took out the bridge deflector shields and the reactor. The Star Destroyer, realizing it had no change, began to move to jump into hyperspace, but Antilles committed one last attack and managed to destroy the command deck.

After capturing the moon Aereen to use as a staging base, Echuu Shen-Jon began planning his attack, and supplemented his own army with reinforcements hastily sent by the Republic. When all was ready, he executed a full-scale assault on the CIS strongholds on the world.\n           In the first day of battle, Shen-Jon’s forces were bolstered by a number of escaped Wookiees, which fought on the front lines against Tann’s hordes of battle droids. As the assault force tried to destroy the multiple bases on Krant, the section of the Republic army led by Shen-Jon’s apprentice, Naat Reath, was cut off, and Reath was captured by General Tann. Tann then pulled a majority of her forces back to the main stronghold, where the Decimator facilities were.\n           Furious, Shen-Jon began to fall towards the Dark Side, and ordered his full army to assault the Confederacy’s main stronghold. The defenses fell, and in three further days of battle the Republic gradually overran it completely. Tann’s active Decimators were fought and destroyed at a high cost in clones, and the factories dedicated to producing more were reduced to ashes. General Shen-Jon himself led his troops through the inner sections of the Confederate base, seeking out his enemy.\n\n# Section 2\nHe found Tann deep within the fortress with Reath, and as clone troopers overran the last of the planet’s battle droid forces the two engaged in a fierce lightsaber duel. The two fought to a draw, but - spurred on by his enemy’s taunting - Shen-Jon eventually gave in to his anger, overpowering Tann and cutting her in half. Dying and in bitter pain, Sev’rance Tann used her last words to taunt the Jedi further in an attempt to drive him forever over the edge.\n           But Reath stopped her master before he could strike the final blow. Realizing how far he had gone, Echuu Shen-Jon gave his Padawan orders to finish the battle and return to Coruscant, and disappeared into the jungles of Krant, never to be seen for the rest of the war.

A man named Dessel, who led the Gloom Walkers survived these guerilla tactics for (3) days despite being lost in the jungle, and being ambushed from every angle.# Section 1\nThe battle occurred on the date of 1010BBY with a former Jedi Master, Lord Kaan leading his newly organised forces of the Sith over (20,000) strong into the treacherous jungles of Kashyyyk. The great Wroshyr forests littered with Kshyy vines provided excellent cover to the Republic forces who, through attrition, trained morale from the Sith. The Sith endured thousands of casualties and sent several excursions into various areas.\n\nHowever, when nearly all morale was lost, a special set of reinforcements called the Gloom Walkers commanded by Lieutenant Ulabore was sent to engage the unknown Galactic Republic forces who hid in the trees.\n\nThey were immediately ambushed with Ulabore losing his calm. Thankfully, Dessel, one of the cortosis miners, took brave command. He was surprisingly force sensitive and used this to detect where traps, enemy soldiers and ambushes lay. The man was able to lead the squadron of Gloom Walkers out of the treacherous ambush valley and save thousands of his Sith brethren.\n\n# Section 2\nWhen this squadron came out of the forests unharmed, it inspired the rest of the Sith legion to push on, which they did, and successfully managed to capture Kashyyyk after (2000) more losses. The Republic fled to Trandosha, but were pursued by the Gloom Walkers once more who literally burned them and their city of Hsskhor to the ground. Ulabore was awarded a commendation, and never told his overseers that it was actually Dessel who led the men to safety.\n\n# Section 3\nDespite this being evil against evil, and the Sith having achieved victory.

The Sacking of Coruscant was the concluding event of the war. During the Sacking, the Sith destroyed the Jedi temple and much of the city, killing many key dignitaries, including the assassination of the Supreme Chancellor by the leader of the Sith invasion force Darth Angral. When Malgus destroyed the Jedi temple, many Jedi were murdered, including six members of the Jedi High Council. After the Sacking, the Sith forced the Republic to sign the Treaty of Coruscant, declaring that the Republic had thoroughly lost the war.# Section 1\nThe Sith plan was to lure the Republic Leadership to a peace conference on Alderaan so the attack could go more smoothly. Supreme Chancellor Berooken was warned not to go by the Jedi High Council and stayed in his office on Coruscant. While the politicians of both superpowers were discussing peace, a Mandalorian Force snuck into Coruscant space and disabled the planet's defence systems, leaving it vulnerable to an Imperial attack.\n\n# Section 2\nWith Coruscant’s defensive network down, Darth Malgus walked into the Jedi temple drawing out the Jedi defenders. Soon after, a Republic shuttle crashed through the entrance of the Temple, destroying many pillars and from its hatch emerged 50 Sith Warriors. A large battle ensued that led to many Jedi deaths, including six members of the Jedi High Council. Several Jedi engaged the Sith in combat; one of note was Master Ven Zallow. Master Zallow duelled with Darth Malgus and was on par with the Sith Lord until he was impaled by Malgus just as the siege on the City of Coruscant began. During the battle, most of the Temple was reduced to ruins as many of the Jedi defenders died. With the Jedi vanquished, the rest of the Sacking could continue unimpeded.\n\n# Section 3\nWith the Jedi defenders no longer proving an obstacle, Darth Angral laid siege to the Senate building while an orbital bombardment rained overhead, murdering many senators. The Republic Special Forces and a few Jedi defenders stood their ground against the raiding force fighting hallway to hallway through the Senate building. Republic troops would take cover in offices and fire on the Sith intruders from cover, killing a few of them, but as the Sith and imperial numbers grew, the defenders were overrun and defeated. Supreme Chancellor Berooken managed to make his way to his office. He contacted the Republic delegation on Alderaan and tried to warn them as Darth Angral destroyed his wall and beheaded the Chancellor while his delegation watched in horror.\n\n# Section 4\nImperial dreadnaughts fired on both civilian and military buildings during the battle, killing tens of thousands of civilians and turning the cityscape into rubble. After the Supreme Chancellors' death and the hands of Darth Angral, the Empire declared victory and set up a blockade and an occupying force to subjugate the people. For two days, The Empire ruled Coruscant with their iron fist. During the battle, the Empire destroyed all of Coruscant's communication satellites, cutting off the planet's ability to call for help. During the occupation, the Empire enforced rations. The Sith forces also commandeered a Hospital to make sure imperial forces were treated first so they could be sent to the medical facilities on the orbiting ships. Soon after his successful raid on the Jedi Temple, Darth Malgus was sent to the Blockade fleet to command it. A young Jedi who was part of the Alderaan delegation felt her Master's death and decided to rush to Coruscant to confirm her suspensions. Aryn Leneer was the Padawan of Master Ven Zallow. She didn't ask for permission to leave the delegation and was declared a deserter by both sides. Darth Angral informed Malgus of her impending arrival, telling him to treat her like any common Spice-runner. Padawan Leneer arrived at the Coruscant and tried to run it. The ship she was travelling on was destroyed but not before she jumped out and free fell into the lower city, using her force powers to slow her descent. In her search for Malgus, she found his Twilek companion; Leneer spared the Twileks life and headed for the Ruins of the Jedi temple to find the body of her Master. Darth Malgus followed her to the temple, and the two duelled. Leneer is ultimately defeated when Malgus shot her with Force Lightning.

The delegation then watched as their leader's head was removed through the expert use of a lightsaber. Baras then started laying down the terms of the Republic's surrender. He presented them with a document that was very biased towards the Empire. He convinced the delegation of Senators and Jedi that they had no other choice but to sign the treaty. This document became The Treaty of Coruscant and ended the war with a decisive Imperial victory.\n\n","meta":{"index":26,"author":"Kaede_Vermillion","name":"Sacking of Coruscant","release_year":2021}},"Jedi Schism":{"content":"# Introduction\nA few months before the start of the Clone Wars, unlike other schisms within the order's history, this one remained non-violent. Instead of playing the political game, it focused on the values of the Jedi Order. This nonviolent schism introduced two things first: one of them being that individual Jedi could follow their path, and for protests by Jedi about the Order to be taken seriously.# Section 1\nAround three months before the Clone Wars, following Chancellor Palpatine’s appointment of Jedi officers within the Republic Army, several Jedi including a satellite council, the Almas Council of the Almas Academy, would join the schism. They believed that it was not within the Jedi way to lead armies and that the Separatist situation should be handled through diplomacy instead of violence. Several Jedi within the schism were found to have Separatist ties, including the leader of the schism, Jedi Master Sola Bulq. After the proof of this collaboration came out, many Jedi returned to the Republic’s service. However, some invoked the Right of Denial, and the Jedi High Council permitted it as long those members did not fall to the Dark Side of the Force, turned in their lightsabers, and did not have Separatist ties.\n\n","meta":{"index":69,"author":"ImperatorSidious","name":"Jedi Schism","release_year":2021}},"Battle of Ryloth":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Battle of Ryloth, also known as the Ryloth campaign, was a war with the Galactic Republic and the Twi’lek Resistance facing off against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, taking place on the planet of Ryloth, which was the homeworld of the Twi’lek species.# Section 1\nThe Battle of Ryloth began with the Confederacy of Independent Systems launching an invasion force enough to overrun the defensive fleet commanded by Admiral Dao. The CIS, specifically Executive Council Member Wat Tambor, was interested in the planet for its resources and location in the Correlian Run. Nonetheless, the invasion force faced resistance from the local Twi’lek Freedom Fighters, led by Cham Syndulla, and the Outer Rim Garrison consisting of Clone Captain Keeli and Jedi General Ima Gun Di. Although the combined efforts of the local Twi’lek Freedom Fighters and Outer Rim Garrison were valiant, the overwhelming amount of separatist droid forces allowed the CIS to push the resistance into hiding and the garrison to be wiped out, including Jedi General Ima Gun Di. While The Outer Rim Garrison was completely destroyed after a final stand, their actions were not in vain as they allowed the resistance to retreat far enough to get republic supplies dropped by a blockade runner, thanks to the efforts of Senator Bail Organa.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Republic’s response after many calls for support from the inhabitants and Ryloth was the liberation force led by three Jedi Generals. These Jedi Generals consist of Master Obi Wan Kenobi, Master Mace Windu, and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. General Skywalker and Admiral Yularen were in charge of the space battle to break the blockade. Although General Skywalker and Admiral Yularen suffered the loss of two venator class Star Destroyers, they destroyed the separatist blockade and Padawan Ahsoka Tano developed a maneuver called the Mog Sabel Maneuver, that would go on to be important in future space battles, specifically noted by Grand Admiral Thrawn in the Galactic Empire. With the blockade being destroyed and the liberation force cleared to enter the atmosphere, they suffered harsh resistance from land-based proton cannons stationed at a village, near a landing site they needed in order to deploy the rest of the ground troops. The 212th Attack Battalion sent the Ghost Company, led by Jedi General Kenobi and Marshal Clone Commander Cody, to clear the landing site and destroy the proton cannons. This effort was successful and General Windu was able to land their acclamator class Star Destroyers to deploy the rest of the liberation force. After many operations, the final operation of Ryloth was conducted by General Windu, grouping with the local Twi’lek resistance to do a final charge on the capital where Separatist leader Wat Tambor was located. The final charge was successful leading to the capture of Wat Tambor and the final liberation of Ryloth, bringing it back into Republic Control.\n\n","meta":{"index":32,"author":"Librarian's Assembly","name":"Battle of Ryloth","release_year":2021}},"Battle of Umbara":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Battle of Umbara was one of the most infamous battles during the Clone Wars, where it saw republic forces seizing control of the former republic planet, Umbara. The battle rostered many esteemed Jedi Generals, including Jedi Master Obi-wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Jedi General Saesee Tiin, and Jedi General Pong Krell. Although the Battle of Umbara was successful, it was one of the bloodiest battles of the Clone Wars and a necessary win for the republic.# Section 1\nBefore the battle, Umbaran Senator Mee Deechi was assassinated by Rodian Representative Lola Purs. After news spread in Umbara about the death of Senator Deechi, the Umbarans seceded from the Republic. This was a devastating loss for the Republic because Umbara was an important planet in the Great Kashyyyk Branch, a major hyperspace lane that connected the Republic to the Mid-rim. To make matters even worse, the Umbarans aligned themselves with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. With the increasing presents of CIS forces on Umbara and the vital position Umbara was located on the Great Kashyyyk Branch, the Republic sent their forces to the planet and started the Battle of Umbara.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Battle of Umbara started with a space battle, having starfighter squadrons led by Jedi Commanders Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee, and gunship landings led by the Jedi Generals. The Separatist Orbital Fleet was fierce, but the Republic eventually broke through and had the four Jedi Generals land in specific areas. Jedi General Kenobi would lead the 212th Attack Battalion from the south, to push towards the Umbaran Capital. Jedi Generals Saesee Tiin and Pong Krell would lead their forces from the east, to capture Umbaran bunkers near the Capital. And Finally, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker would lead the 501st Legion from the north, to push towards the Capital from the opposing direction from Master Kenobi’s position. Although this plan sounded good on the blueprint, the Jedi Generals all experienced heavy resistance from the Umbaran land forces, having the 501st Legion facing some of the worst of it. The 501st had to capture a defensive ridge that stationed Umbaran Hover tanks, hordes of Umbaran Militia, and Starfighter strikes that would occasionally bombard platoons of clone troopers. Nonetheless, the 501st was able to capture the ridge, but still faced heavy resistance when they tried to lay down camp on the ridge, due to Umbaran Militia using guerilla warfare. The clone legion had to abandon the ridge and call in an airstrike, where the ridge would be bombarded by Y-wing bombers led by Clone Pilot Commander CC-2237 (Oddball). From the east, clone units were able to capture Umbaran bunkers and were steadily moving towards the capital. As the northern ridge was now carpet-bombed, the 501st now did the same, but news from Coruscant had Jedi General Anakin Skywalker called out of the front lines. The 501st would now be under the command of General Pong Krell, as his forces already met with General Tiin’s forces in the east.\n\n# Section 3\nJedi General Pong Krell’s battle plans and style were different from that of General Skywalker, as Krell planned to advance on the main road towards the capital. This plan had lots of risks, but Clone Captain CC-7567 (Rex) followed the given plan, leading his platoon on the main road. The plan ended up as a disaster, as the road was marked with minefields and the platoon faced an ambush from Umbaran Militia. As a result, the platoon had to retreat to the main legion to drive off the Umbaran forces but was faced with a counterattack by more Umbaran Militia, this time with air support, so the clone legion was forced out of the main road. Krell was furious at the CC-7567 (Rex) for his order to retreat, due to this causing the loss of the main road, even though Krell’s plan was reckless and had a high chance of failure. Krell’s next order was to recapture the main road to the capital, until General Kenobi informed them of the Western Umbaran Airbase feeding supplies to the capital, which gave the other clone units a hard time from the southern and eastern fronts, making an advance towards the capital all but possible. The 501st now were ordered to change route and secure the airbase, to cut off supply lines to the capital. The fastest way to the airbase was going through a central gorge, where it was perfect for Umbaran ambushes. Although the 501st could have looked for a more secure and safer route, Krell ordered the 501st to march towards the airbase through the gorge. What happened was exactly as predicted, the Umbarans ambushed the 501st with a group of Impeding Assault Tanks, as the tanks dwindled the number of clones, before they were destroyed by RPS-6 Rocket launchers and thermal detonators. What came after the Impeding Assault Tanks were worse, the Umbaran Airbase sent their best-armored unit, two Umbaran Mobile Heavy Cannons. The 501st had nothing that could destroy the armored units, so in response, CC-7567 (Rex) sent Clone Trooper “Hardcase” and ARC Trooper ARC-5555 (Fives) to sneak into the enemy airbase and use Umbaran Starfighters to destroy the heavy cannons. With the heavy cannons destroyed, the 501st pushed towards the airbase and took control. With the airbase in Republic hands, the eastern and southern clone units were able to push towards the capital and lay down a siege, but discovered the capital now could bombard the clone units with missiles supplied by a Separatist supply ship.\n\n# Section 4\nAs the space battle was leaning towards the Confederacy’s favor, defying orders to not commandeer Umbaran starfighters, ARC-5555 (Fives), Clone Trooper “Hardcase”, and Clone Trooper CT-5597 (Jesse) flew through the space battle and infiltrated the Separatist supply ship. Successfully destroying the supply ship, at the cost of Hardcase’s life, turned the tide towards the Republic’s favor, as the space battle was now leaning towards the Republic’s victory and the clone units in the south and east now breached the city’s gates and it was only a matter of time till Umbara fell. None of this mattered to Krell, as he was furious at the troopers would ignore his orders to not commandeer Umbaran starfighters. He ordered ARC-5555 (Fives) and Clone Trooper CT-5597 (Jesse) to be executed, but against his orders and a few inspirational words from Fives caused the firing squad to refuse to execute the two heroic troopers. Krell tolerated this and sent Torrent Company to intercept Umbaran soldiers, who he claimed were wearing 212th Attack Battalion armor. Although Torrent Company intercepted the Umbaran soldiers, the Umbaran soldiers were not Umbaran, but rather a 212th platoon led by Clone Lieutenant “Waxer”. Clone Captain “Rex” ordered a cease-fire and found out that the orders of the attack came from General Krell. Furious with the discovery, Torrent Company and 212th troopers marched back towards the airbase to confront the General. Krell revealed that he did give the order and turned against the Republic. The General now had the clone units chase him, killing many of them in the process, but was subdued by a stun by Clone Trooper CT-5385 (Tup), where they imprisoned him in the airbase. There, he was executed by Clone Trooper “Dogma”, not until revealing that he deliberately tried to sabotage the republic’s campaign to gain favor with Count Dooku. After the death of General Pong Krell, the 501st discovered that the battle was over, as the 7th Sky Corps took control of the capital and remaining separatist warships were pulling out of the battle. With the end of the Battle of Umbara, victory came at the cost of many lives and the Republic would have to spread more units from the high amount of casualties on Umbara.\n\n","meta":{"index":35,"author":"1tsKita","name":"Battle of Umbara","release_year":2021}}},"meta":{"name":"Historical Events","index":1}},"TJO - Events":{"articles":{"Group-Wide Crystal Gathering":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe desire to obtain a new Kyber Crystal is one that many can identify with; obtaining one’s first crystal can both be an intimidating notion and an exhilarating thrill.

On the 30th of October 2020, Animated joined the Order as a Force Sensitive. His reasoning for joining the Order was self-discovery and a friend, OmegaVanquished. Both of them joined the Temple Guard within a month of each other. Animated stayed in the Jedi Order because he wanted to help others, and after stepping down as Temple Guard Captain, he was eager to help the Order in some other way and fill a gap. Animated has not only been a Temple Guard Captain, but has also had a seat on the Council of Reassignment as Head Seeker, Head of Advancement for the Jedi Service Corps, and Deputy Editor of the Jedi Chronicle.# Section 1\nAnimated became a Padawan, but disowned his master, Jedi Knight pololemon, due to pololemon's inactivity. He then joined what was then called the Jedi Academy, the forerunner of the current Jedi Service Corps.  Animated took part in a few classes but ultimately chose to leave the Order.  However, he joined the Order again a day later to pursue another master. As a Padawan, Animated tried out for the Temple Guard and successfully joined the division. He was one of the few Padawans who were able to join the Temple Guard before the requirement changed to Jedi Knight and higher. \n\nUpon joining the division, he was forced to disown his master. After joining the Temple Guard, Animated obtained a mentor but asked to be arranged with a more active and experienced one. He was then assisted with the Trials of Knighthood and Trials of the Guard by the infamous former Chief of Security, ExcubariumTenebris. The Trials of Knighthood took place on the 13th of January 2021, while the Trials of the Guard took place on the 28th of January, 2021. “I bounced from one master or mentor to the next. My lack of training with my Jedi Knight masters taught me to be self-sufficient. My training with my Temple Guard mentors taught me discipline and a thorough understanding of the laws and workings of the Order.”\n\n# Section 2\nDuring Animated’s time in the Temple Guard, he only mentored one person to complete their Trials of the Guard. However, he trained at least five Padawans after he left the Temple Guard. “And anyone who was an Initiate II under my leadership of the Jedi Service Corps, I view as my own, too.” While AnimatedEcrux stayed in the Temple Guard, he progressed up to Temple Guard Captain at one point. However, he stepped down around a week later because he felt he did not meet the criteria to stay as Temple Guard Captain. Animated stepping down allowed ExcubariumTenebris to rightfully progress in the Temple Guard. Animated remained in the Temple Guard as a Warden until he left and was granted the rank of Jedi Master for his efforts in the Temple Guard.\n\n# Section 3\nAfter leaving the Temple Guard, Animated decided to join the Council of Reassignment as a Jedi Seeker. He eventually became Head Seeker on the 15th of May 2021, he also led the Jedi Service Corps from the 12th of May to the 19th of September 2021. Animated also joined the Librarian’s Assembly on the 6th of May, 2021. He advanced to the rank of Archivist in the Librarian's Assembly and was later promoted to Librarian. Unfortunately, his promotion did not last long, as the Caretaker of First Knowledge at the time demoted him back to Archivist because the Chief Librarian made the decision without consulting the rest of the leadership. Animated remained in the Librarian’s Assembly as an Archivist until he retired. He wrote, edited, and revised over 30 articles, but he is most proud of his “Great Jedi Purge” article.\n\n# Section 4\nAnimated's greatest accomplishment was a complete reform and revival of the Jedi Seekers. He provided numerous helpful documents, including ones for Knights and other Order members, as well as Padawan mission records, Jedi Service Corps mission documents, and path progression posters. He not only imparted his knowledge to Knights but also shared his expertise with Masters, educating them on the intricacies of the Order. In his prime, Animated cherished the Jedi High Council Activity Award he received for his dedication to the Jedi Service Corps and the Council of Reassignment.\n\nOverseeing the Jedi Service Corps and witnessing the transformation of eager Initiates into Jedi Knights brought him great joy. Together with his team, they taught them not only the ways of the Orde,r but also how to be exemplary Knights. Some of these Knights even went on to become Masters. Although Animated was not officially their master, he made every effort to support them throughout their journey, considering them just as important as his own Padawans. “I just wish I had been recognized for my efforts within the Temple Guard. Many people don’t know or have forgotten I was a Temple Guard.”\n\n# Section 5\nDuring his time as a Head Seeker, although he loved the position, it became burdensome as he struggled to find a purpose for the specialization's existence. To his surprise, many Knights joined the specialization, which thrilled him. Animated was also part of the original cohort of beta testers for Ossus, along with other now-notable members, where he helped Nidoxs and the leadership at the time by bug-testing and suggesting ideas for the game. At that time, he used the username \"anitaanil\" but later changed it to \"AnimatedEcrux\" after leaving the Temple Guard. Unfortunately, the \"Ecrux\" bloodline dwindled soon after Animated joined it.\n\nAnimatedEcrux retired on the 19th of September 2021, due to commitments in life.\n\n","meta":{"index":40,"author":"A1dok4","name":"AnimatedEcrux","release_year":2023}},"Polyfrost":{"content":"# Introduction\nJedi Master Polyfrost joined the Jedi Order on the 17th of January, 2022. Her reasoning for joining the Order was because of a friend, Flare, who was consistently seen playing daily.

Polyfrost has served the Jedi Service Corps for much of this time as an Instructor and eventually Head of Advancement.# Section 1\nOriginally a Padawan to the former Jedi Master EnvyNix, Polyfrost would learn most of what she knows from the current Jedi High Councilor Vanestc. Van would be assigned to Poly as her mentor within the Jedi Assault Team. Poly would learn many things from her mentor during this time; such things include how to efficiently use a form that was infamous for being one of the worst at the time, as well as helping Poly understand how our Order’s specializations work in tandem with each other to benefit the Order’s progression.\n\n# Section 2\nVanestc eventually convinced Poly to join the Jedi Praeceptors within the Jedi Service Corps. Initially hesitant, Poly would be convinced, thus kick-starting her career in the organization. Poly would show resilience and a love for the Jedi Service Corps, growing and teaching throughout her time there. Eventually, her efforts would be rewarded as she was given the rank of Master and a temporary seat on the Council of Reassignment on the 21st of July, 2022.\n\nPoly could only do a little as a Councilor on a temporary seat. However, her work would truly begin as DercyeNix, the former Head of Advancement, would step down, leaving an empty permanent seat as the Head of Advancement on the 18th of September, 2022. As the Head of Advancement, Poly overlooks and manages the Jedi Service Corps. This ranges from all students, Mentors, and Instructors; Poly is directly responsible for managing this path to Knighthood.\nAs a permanent Councilor on the Council of Reassignment, Poly would be directly linked with the Service Corps due to the majority of specializations under the council hailing from the Service Corps. Poly’s time as Head of Advancement has seen her change the organization many times, including the progression system. Previously, Initiate IIs were locked to a phase system, and to progress, they would first have to pass the previous phase. In Poly’s eyes, this was redundant and did not provide much freedom, so instead, she would remove it for an open curriculum where the Initiate IIs could take any class at any time.\n\n# Section 3\nPoly and Van had reworked the Jedi Service Corps, and it had worked. One of her most recent changes to the Jedi Service Corps was the addition of the Padawan Training Course. Originally a running joke, this course would hold its first class on the 12th of February, 2022. The course would exist to teach new Knights how to train their Padawan best.

As a result of his efforts within the Praeceptors and the Jedi Service Corps, he would receive this title.\n\nA Councillor on the Council of Reassignment plays a significant role. These few members would hold several meetings discussing the Council, the Jedi Service Corps, and Specializations. Ocean has a permanent seat on the Council of Reassignment; this means he will remain on the Council until he retires. Ocean was given a permanent seat because of his determination and hard work as the Head of Praeceptors.\n\nThe High Command of the Jedi Service Corps is a small group of members that directly oversee the ongoings of the Corps. They would be directly responsible for everything that goes on within the organization. Ocean’s job within the High Command is to ensure that everything runs smoothly and accordingly.\n\nThe Librarian’s Assembly is a group of Jedi that strive to protect the knowledge within the Jedi Order. Not only that, but they also help preserve knowledge and information in the form of articles within our Archives. As a Librarian, Ocean is in charge of monitoring the Archivists of the Librarian’s Assembly and the rest of the division alongside his fellow Librarians. Each Librarian oversees a specific part of the Assembly, and Ocean manages any Lore Seminar within the division.\n\n","meta":{"index":25,"author":"JowsDemici","name":"OceanDemici","release_year":2021}},"AustinVKaril":{"content":"# Introduction\nAustinVKaril was previously known by many past usernames, such as AustinPlays_RBLX, AustinEcrux, Austin_Innit, and AustinKaril, was a member of the Jedi Order who joined in December 2020.

From her time as a Padawan to her time as Head Artisan, she always had a proficiency for the work she did within the Order, and is admired and respected by many of her peers.# Section 1\nColdLazyMia joined the order on November 5th, 2020, after she was recommended it by her sister, who saw a group ad for the Jedi Order. She first got to experience the Jedi Sanctum, where many people that had already inhabited the group for awhile helped and guided her throughout her first few experiences within the Order. Though she briefly lost interest in pursuing the Order when she reached the rank of Youngling I, she returned later in the year, eventually reaching the rank of Jedi Knight in March of 2021 on an account named lyraez, though with the permission of the Jedi High Council, she returned to the account she originally started on, ColdLazyMia.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter reaching the rank of Jedi Knight, Mia was quite unsure of what she wanted to do next, she didn’t think herself to be proficient in combat or writing. Following the advice of her friends, she decided she wished to be a Jedi Artisan, due to her inclination to host trainings for the Younglings. On May 5th, 2021, she took and passed her Jedi Artisan trials, officially reaching the rank of Advanced Jedi Knight.\n\n# Section 3\nIn the beginning of her time as an Artisan Mia did not host Crystal Gatherings very much but soon after hosting a few, She began to love hosting Crystal Gatherings and grew to enjoy them. Around this time, the Head Artisan introduced two new ranks to the Artisans Assembly, which where those of Senior Artisan and Assistant Head Artisan.  She at the time held the rank of Jedi Instructor in the newfound Jedi Academy, where she helped build the Academy Database we know today. When the two new ranks were introduced, she was then appointed as a Senior Artisan due to her proficiency in hosting Crystal Gatherings as of that time. Aspiring to reach Assistant Head Artisan, she gave herself a goal: Reach 100 Crystal Gatherings, and to her surprise, she accomplished this goal.\n\n# Section 4\nWhen she was a few months into her tenure as a Senior Artisan, the Head Artisan departed the specialization, leaving the seat vacant. On October 2nd, 2021, she was messaged by Jedi Master PoH to join the Jedi Temple on Ossus, where she would notice herself at the rank of Jedi Master, and that day be appointed to the rank of Head Artisan for her profound work within the specialization. She, like her tenure within the Jedi Academy, helped make the first Artisan Database, providing a lot of the helpful resources and formatting that the Jedi Artisans use to this day. Though she found a lot of enjoyment in the role of Head Artisan, many personal problems had started to affect her work abilities for the post, so on February 14th, 2022, she resigned from the post of Head Artisan, cementing herself as one of the true founding members of the specialization, and a stepping stone for the Head Artisans after her time.\n\n","meta":{"index":11,"author":"ValusArachne","name":"ColdLazyMia","release_year":2021}},"Unite5000":{"content":"# Introduction\nUnite is a well-known member of the Jedi Order who was renowned for his dedication and leadership. Unite joined the Jedi Order with his friend on the Seventh of November, 2020; during the 2020 quarantine, Unite joined the Order for fun and dedicated a large portion of his time contributing to its legacy. Unite5000 achieved not only the position of Senior Councilor of Reconciliation, but also Jedi Consular, Jedi Sentinel, the Jedi High Council Kindness, Excellency and Activity Award.# Section 1\nWhen Unite joined the ranks of Jedi Knight on the 30th of December 2020, he was very interested in the process of writing articles for the Grand Archives, and he always wanted to be an official member of the Librarian’s Assembly. That is why he became a Jedi Consular because, back in his time, individuals had to be a Jedi Consular to write articles. Unite was not only in the Librarian’s Assembly but also in the Jedi Assault Team. After two to three months, Unite realized that he had made a mistake, because he could not fit in with his fellow colleagues as Jedi Consular. That is why he decided to find a new specialization where he could contribute more. These were the Jedi Investigators. Unite prepared, re-took his Advanced Jedi Knight trials, and passed on the Second of March. At first, Unite was a Jedi Recruiter; he recruited over 500 people that joined the Order. When that phase passed he had finally got ranked to Jedi Investigator after being accepted by former Senior Councilor of Reconciliation ZestyTrev. During the time Unite was a Jedi Investigator, he learned how to work as a team with people around the globe and how to patiently work and wait for it to be recognized. After two months as a Jedi Investigator, Unite was promoted to Jedi Instructor on the 15th of May, because of all the work and effort he gave in every possible way.\n\nUnite5000 has trained over 20 Padawans. Some of them reached the rank of Jedi Master, such as Jedi High Councilor Truenks and Jedi Master GutsNix, also known as MarcosMalvern. Unite puts effort not only in the Padawan branch but also in the Librarian’s Assembly. He wrote over ten articles. Unite also put effort into the Jedi Service Corps, where he hosted leadership classes for many individuals who made it to the rank of Jedi Master. After a week as Jedi Instructor, Unite got promoted to Jedi Master and received a seat on the Council of Reconciliation as the Chief Investigator. After Unite accomplished everything he wanted, he saw opportunities to rise, such as the Jedi High Council Temporary seat. He was known as the “Chill Jedi Master that always helps everyone,” so Unite had a good chance at the elections.\n\n# Section 2\nUnfortunately, Unite was not considered capable of upholding the responsibility of the Jedi High Council Temporary seat because he was still a new Jedi Master. However, Unite was lucky; after two weeks, a permanent seat of the Jedi High Council had to retire. That was the moment when the Jedi High Council invited Unite and the Master of the Order KennaexMalvern to replace the Temporary seats, which they did great. After the period Unite was on the Temporary councilor seat, he rejected a re-election because he wanted to give other individuals a chance to be on the Jedi High Council. After one month,  the Jedi High Council proposed to Unite and former Chief of Security iSingToooMuch the honor of being a Senior Councilor of Reconciliation. Their responsibilities were to look after the Council of Reconciliation, but iSing was more responsible for the Temple Guard, while Unite was more responsible for looking over the Council of Reconciliation. \n\nAfter some time passed, iSing retired. A new Chief of Security had to be elected. The candidates were the Council of Reconciliation representatives. Unite was offered to be the new Chief of Security, but he rejected any offer. Instead, Unite chose ExcubariumTenebris to take such responsibility, because he was the Temple Guard Commandant for over six months. Excub was deemed not only a great leader but also a good friend that always cared for his co-workers and for his people. For over a year, Unite has been in his position; he has seen a lot of changes, many people left, and new people came up with new ideas. Unite5000 mentioned that the group's most significant attribute is that the group accepts every new idea and debates on it. Unite decided to retire, which was not an easy decision, but he had to leave this group behind and focus on his life. The Jedi High Council celebrated all of Unite's work by granting him the rank of Jedi Ghost as a notable member who left an impact on the Jedi Order.\n\n“There is nothing impossible if you do not try, that is how I earned every role and every award.

Starting out as a Force Sensitive on the 26th of September 2021, Mara initially joined the Order to quench their curiosity about the Order’s progression system, as part of their quest to find other Star Wars-related groups to take part in.# Section 1\nMara reached the rank of Initiate just three days after; due to their pre-existing duties as a Jedi Councilor in Askavix’s Jedi Order, however, they halted their rank progression until February 2022 when they joined the Jedi Service Corps on the 28th, after their retirement from Askavix’s Order. \n“My time within the Jedi Service Corps opened my eyes to how well organized and looked after the Order was, and the various opportunities open to those who graduated from it. The moment I joined the Service Corps, I knew that was where I was meant to be.” Mara passed their Trials of Knighthood on the 8th of March, just ten days after joining the Service Corps.\n\nBeing enamored by the lightsaber combat system on Ossus at the time, as well as the attention to detail and magnitude of the temple, Mara was drawn to the Lightsaber Instructors ever since becoming a Service Initiate. As a result, once they passed their Trials, they immediately began working on the requirements for their Advanced Knighthood Trials. However, due to a change in leadership of the Lightsaber Instructors at the time they were eligible to take their trials, Mara’s aspiration was brought to a hiatus. In the time since they have trained and raised three Padawans to Knighthood: Local_HD, AlexiusNoctis and Ghostly_KarambySW.\n\n# Section 2\nGrowing “impatient” with waiting for their Lightsaber Instructor trials, Mara decided to join the Jedi Peacekeepers in order to “see what else there is to offer”. Although failing their trials initially, they were finally promoted to an Advanced Jedi Knight on the 6th of April 2022, when they officially joined the Peacekeepers. However, Mara ended up spending just two weeks in the specialization; the reasons being cited as a lack of motivation and a feeling of being unsuited for the work that the Peacekeepers did. They felt that the Peacekeepers’ style of diplomacy before action was not suited to their liking - hence, Mara ended up transferring to the Council of Reassignment, passing their trials and joining the Council as a Lightsaber Instructor on the 22nd of April 2022. \n\n“Being a Lightsaber Instructor…, I thoroughly enjoyed my time there - I was very committed to the Service Corps and I learned a lot about Lightsaber Combat from it, which really was my aim from the start.” Mara’s commitment to the specialization and the Service Corps as a whole earned them the esteemed position of Jedi Master on the 10th of July 2022, followed by the title of Chief Lightsaber Instructor on the 31st of July 2022, two and a half weeks after attaining the rank of Master.\n\n# Section 3\nMara has since then earned numerous positions and accolades for their extensive work within the Jedi Order and the Council of Reassignment. They have been the recipient of the Jedi High Council Excellency, Leadership, and Combat Excellence awards - but Mara feels that the latter is the one that matters most to them. “My motivation to stay in this Order has always sparked from lightsaber combat, and being the best duelist I can be. My goal was to be recognised for that, and that is exactly what I have done.” Mara is one of the few individuals to have held a prestigious seat on the Jedi High Council, occupying the 12th chair on the 17th of September 2022 and serving for two months.  \nTheir love for combat and dueling is what led them to join the Jedi Assault Team on the 19th of March 2022, quickly rising up the ranks to become a Vindicator. Honing their combat skills in the Assault Team led to them securing third place in the Duelist of the Order competition for April 2023.  Wanting to gain new experiences in the Order, though, Mara joined the Librarian’s Assembly on the 7th of July 2023, where they ranked up to Scholar. Alongside these already time-consuming positions, Mara aids the Known Galaxy community as a whole as a Community Moderator, Senior Beta Tester for future projects, and Senior Apparel Advisor.\n\n“The awards and titles are simply accolades that allow me to do the job I believe needs to be done… Everything else that I possess, is a means to an end. I am the Chief Lightsaber Instructor because I care for the Jedi Service Corps, and I want to do whatever I can to help it run. I am a Jedi Assault Team Vindicator because working with others that are as passionate about combat as I am is what I enjoy the most, and I believe I have a good analytical thought process to assess situations and come up with solutions to them.”\nOwing to the structural changes made to the Jedi Service Corps and the Council of Reassignment as a whole, the Lightsaber Instructors were one of three specializations from the Council to become defunct, making Mara the last person to serve as the Chief Lightsaber Instructor. She ended up trading one position for another, though, and was made the ninth-ever Battlemaster of the Jedi Assault Team on the 5th of October 2023 - a position well deserved.\n\n","meta":{"index":39,"author":"DioneSenko","name":"Maravia_Strak","release_year":2021}},"ExcubiarumTenebris":{"content":"# Introduction\nExcubiarumTenebris was an esteemed member of The Jedi Order who was renowned for his dedication towards the Order and his tight and strong leadership. On the Fifth November 2020 Excubiarum joined the Order as a Force Sensitive. Excubiarum obtained not only the position of Fifth Commandant on the 26th of July, 2021 but also the rank of Chief of Security on the ninth of January, 2022 serving as a Master on the Jedi High Council. During his time in servitude, he had been awarded the Excellency and Leadership awards which fit his length of time within the Order and effort he put into improving the community.# Section 1\nExcubiarum joined the Order on the fifth of November, 2020. Excubiarum had already known a member of the Order known as ValSenko. They had previously known each other from outside the genre, and this had been an incentive for Excubiarum to progress through the ranks as he had a friend with him. However, this was not his only reason for him to quickly rise through the ranks of the Temple Guard. Excubiarum had decided early on that he was going to put the entirety of his time and effort into the Temple Guard, serving it well and improving it how he saw fit, though later on this idea was twisted to the Order itself rather than focusing on the Temple Guard subsection of the community. It was on the 22nd of the same month that he became a Candidate within the Jedi Temple Guard, an impressively short timeframe to obtain such a rank, in which he shortly took his Guardsman Trials and became a Sentinel and Guardsman on the 29th of November. Within his time as a Guardsman, the Tempe Guard underwent new leadership - the Former Commandant, KingBurayden, retiring his position - as Joelbloxx came into power as the Third Commandant. \n\nDuring Excubiarum’s days as a Guardsman he worked extremely hard until he eventually reached the position of Instructor on the 26th of December. Unfortunately, on the ninth of January, 2021, he retired from his position of Instructor for reasons unknown.This was short-lived, however because on the 27th of February he was promoted to Instructor again. Less than a month later on the eighth of March, 2021 he was promoted to Warden within the Temple Guard. Excubiarum attributes the short timespan between these two promotions to the former Commanders knowing how capable he was and the trust within him showed itself with his performance as Warden. Excubiarum had observed many shifts within the Temple Guard community as well as the whole populace community in a manner that very few have, he credited this to his continuous involvement within The Jedi Order’s affairs. Continuing to work diligently for approximately 2 months, he was once again promoted on the 21st of April to the rank of Captain. This was a notable time within his career as it was his first time serving on the Senior Command of the Temple Guard.\n\n# Section 2\nUnfortunately, on the 10th of May, Excubiarum had once again retired as his position of Captain, only this time his reason for leaving was that he felt dissatisfied with leadership and he felt as if he had served his time. However, the Temple Guard had fallen into disarray as soon as Excubiarum had retired - whether his retirement was directly involved within the Temple Guard’s disarray is unconfirmed. This disorder within reached the higher echelons of the Jedi Order, the High Council and above. On the 29th of the same month, the Grandmaster of the Order contacted ExcubiarumTenebris to attend a meeting concerning the affairs of the Temple Guard. This meeting involved the Grandmaster, the Chief of Security and the Master of the Order. The result of the meeting was an offer to Excubiarum in which he would be reinstated as a Captain within the Temple Guard and would use his leadership skills to remedy the Guard to the state it previously was, in which he naturally took the offer. On the same day the largest purge of members within the Temple Guard occurred, leaving only a few Guardsmen - almost all command were kicked from the Temple Guard. Excubiarum personally remarked that it was the largest Temple Guard reformation he had seen. On the 27th of July Excubiarum was officially promoted to the rank of Commandant of the Temple Guard, being the Fifth Commandant.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring this new era of Excubiarum as Commandant of the Temple Guard, he worked hard to make repairs to the Temple Guard and Order itself that had been made whilst he was not in a position of power. Excubiarum believed this was when he first realised he was now putting his effort into the Order rather than the Temple Guard; working for the betterment of the group rather than strictly the Temple Guard. On the ninth of January, 2022, the former Chief of Security - iSingToooMuch - retired. Inherently taking his place, Excubiarum was promoted to the rank of Chief of Security and was placed on the Jedi High Council. To many people’s surprise, Excubiarum was temporarily demoted from the Council on the Fifth of February for three weeks. The reasons for his temporary demotion are withheld from public knowledge as for the sake of Council discretion. He said that he had “Grown too comfortable,” for the sake of people asking why he was demoted. Within this time of punishment he came to realise the meaning of his position as Chief of Security and how fundamentally different it was from the Temple Guard, he admitted to his mistakes and learnt from them how a True Jedi should. Excubiarum grew as a member of the Jedi Order, when asked what his awards meant to him he said “The High Council awards mean nothing to me now because every Councillor is expected to uphold the standards which merit the awards.”\n\n# Section 4\nExcubiarum credited a lot to his former Master when he was a Padawan; JamesEcrux. He believed his willingness to take him in as a Padawan permitted for everything good and bad to come within his career as a member of the Jedi Order. As a member of the Jedi High Council, Excubiarum wanted the Order to focus on education more than anything. He believed that not enough people knew about the Jedi Law which resulted in many meaningless arrests which could’ve been easily avoided. Excubiarum described his alignment as a Democratic Autocrat, and the one thing he essentially encouraged was opinion. He often forced it out of his commanders, as their voices were expected to be heard and he would make decisions based on their opinions. However, the Excubiarum’s autocrat side came in whenever he made a decision - it would be final. He would tolerate zero dissent, if anyone refused to comply with his decisions they would simply not serve under him.\n\n","meta":{"index":1,"author":"Librarian's Assembly","name":"ExcubiarumTenebris","release_year":2021}},"creation_v1":{"content":"# Introduction\ncreation_v1 was a recognizable and astute individual in the early days of the order that continuously put effort and work into what he was yet to achieve. creation_v1 did not have any other reason to join the order to begin his journey towards becoming a full-fledged Jedi Knight other than pure curiosity.

Twelve days later, on the 25th of February, he was offered by the Senior Councillor of Reassignment and Barsen'thor Skaxon to become the Head of Advancement.\n\n# Section 3\nWhen Dercye became the Head of Advancement, at first he did not know what to do and he decided to discharge and go to the Sages. The Baren’thor Shaxon messaged him, telling him that he was needed back in the Service Corps. Soon after this, Dercye left the Sages and transferred to the Service Corps. He became the Head of Advancement once again on the 29th of April, serving for over 7 months in the position. During the time of the old Battlemaster Adrian retiring, Dercye decided to take up the role of Battlemaster and step down from the role of Head of Advancement, leaving the JSC officially.\n\n","meta":{"index":19,"author":"Librarian's Assembly","name":"DercyeNix","release_year":2021}},"ChristopherLucifer":{"content":"# Introduction\nChristopherLucifer joined The Jedi Order around September 16th, 2020, and he had been participating in saber-fighting genres since around 2012. He joined just in time to see the last days of JamesCelestial as Grandmaster, right before Snatchup took that position. As a matter of fact, he ended up being Grandmaster Snatchup’s Padawan. He was promoted directly from Jedi Knight to a seat in the Jedi High Council. This was entrusted to him so he could oversee the formation of the Jedi Assault Team as its first Battlemaster, as well as lay down the framework for the Jedi Service Corps.# Section 1\nAround the same time that Snatchup became Grandmaster, he began removing James’ old Jedi High Council members and replacing them with his own friends. This of course only served to worsen the reputation of Grandmaster Snatchup, who was already suffering over having purchased the group from James. James’ old followers formed a sort of rebellion, and they frequently raided the Jedi Sanctum.\n\n# Section 2\nChristopherLucifer enters the equation, as he was taken as Grandmaster Snatchup’s newest Padawan at that time. He reached Knight easily and was given a spot on the Jedi High Council not only to form the Jedi Assault Team as their Battlemaster but also to run the Jedi Service Corps. His tenure on the Jedi High Council was a year and three months long, during which he had laid the foundations out for both the Assault Team as well as the Jedi Service Corps.\n\n# Section 3\nIn the face of his most positive contributions, those who knew him know that he was not without a somewhat dramatic past. Christopher was quick to speak on anything and everything, and he usually had no filter when he did. As the group became larger, its members had little to no tolerance for this aspect of his character. His mindset towards teaching favored combat and power rather than knowledge, and that mindset led to many disagreements of varying intensities with his fellow High Councillors. His dissenters argued that his methods were not those that a Jedi would use to teach other Jedi. To top it all off, he was the leader of the Lucifer bloodline, and to many outsiders, it seemed as though he favored Lucifer members over everyone else. However, this may seem true, but that assumption was not wholly correct. If anything, he punished the Lucifers, who misbehaved worse than anyone else, solely because they knew better than to cause problems for the bloodline at large. Eventually, conflicts between members of his bloodline combined with others within the order and the gradually increasing size of the group, and intolerance towards his own demeanor became constant. This ensuing personal and group conflict with the other High Councillors finally led him to permanently retire from the Order as a whole.\n\n# Section 4\nOverall, during his time spent in the Order, there were more positives than negatives. He won Duelist of the Order twice, pushing back raiding Sith groups even if they outnumbered his own forces, and he was able to see the community explode in popularity while also helping people achieve their goals within the Order. He laid down the frameworks of the Jedi Assault Team and Service Corps, and he served on the High Council for a little over a full year. To those who knew him personally or those who served with him during his time in the Assault Team, the impressions he made will be forever remembered.\n\n","meta":{"index":27,"author":"TBTI_X","name":"ChristopherLucifer","release_year":2021}},"vanestc":{"content":"# Introduction\nVanestc was a recognized member of the Jedi Order who was renowned for her dedication and leadership. Vanestc joined the Order on the 15th of September, 2021. Vanestc achieved not only the position of Jedi Assault Team Captain, but also the rank of Senior Councilor of Reassignment on the 22nd of April, 2022; overseeing the Jedi Service Corps and a permanent seat serving on the Jedi High Council as a Jedi Master. Vanestc has also received high praise in the form of the Jedi High Council Activity and Leadership awards.# Section 1\nJoining on the 15th of September, 2021, Vanestc started her journey as a Padawan where her master AbsxrdNix genuinely the biggest role model and great friend was. After Knighthood, where she trained roughly 8 Padawans to Knighthood, Vanestc continued her journey as Jedi Watchman on the First of November, 2021 serving under the Council of Reassignment. She ended up becoming a Jedi Master and the Head Watchman exactly one month after, on the First of December, 2021. \n\nUnfortunately the specialization was removed on the 11th of January, 2022, but Vanestc was put as the Head Praeceptor and tasked with overseeing Phase III aka the Leadership Phase of the Jedi Service Corps.

One month later she was invited to join the Jedi High Council for the remainder of the Rotating Public Seat, as well as being invited to become a Senior Councilor of Reassignment on the 22nd of April. Vanestc was nowhere near as confident as she was as Councilor of Reassignment.\n\n# Section 2\nVanestc has said that she did not expect to be put in charge of a specialization or get awarded for her work, let alone sit on the Jedi High Council.

There were people in The Jedi Order who did have faith in her and trusted her with positions that would have been far outside her comfort zone. \n\nBeing out of her comfort zone, Vanestc was able to work on specializations and divisions she cares for, to change things for the better and meet some amazing individuals along the way. Vanestc has said that she gets to run the Council of Reassignment alongside some of the most talented people she has ever met within the Order, which is something she is still incredibly grateful for.

Bladed found himself joining the Order as a joke with his cousin, 3Bladed. Bladed eventually grew to respect, and enjoy the system of the game, and the beauty of the architecture; so he decided to remain in the Jedi Order and take it seriously. The ranks Bladed has held and currently holds are Councilor of First Knowledge, Jedi Master, Head Mystic, Senior Academy Instructor, Instructor, Jedi Mystic, and Jedi Knight. He has also been rewarded with the JHC | Excellency Award, JHC | Activity Award, JA | Medal of Activity, and JA | Performance Award.# Section 1\nBladed became the Padawan of HermesPrice on April 12, 2022. Unfortunately, HermesPrice was arrested, demoted, and eventually left the Order. Because of this, the duty of raising Bladed to Knighthood successfully was passed down to Jedi Master ValiantPrice. Bladed completed his Padawan training and became a Jedi Knight on April 28, 2022. Bladed has successfully trained three Padawans to the rank of Jedi Knight, two of them reached Jedi Instructor and the third one became an Artisan. Though he had multiple Padawans in the past, they left in the middle of their training due to boredom.\n\n“He was rather patient with me as time went on. We would run around the temple to take pictures as a way to practice joy as a way of teaching me virtue without really telling me, which I think is nice in the end. During training, he would guide me on what to do and give me tips on how to improve. He would always let me know if I was showing improvement as we trained and was patient with and told me that I could take my time. He practically taught me virtue while I was his padawan without even realizing it, even now looking back, that was probably nice to learn virtue while under his wing. He taught me skills that I needed that prepared me for being a teacher and an instructor as well.” - Jedi Instructor GREENSRROW\n\n# Section 2\nBladed successfully passed the Jedi Mystic trials on May 14th, 2022. He still serves as a Jedi Mystic and has been part of the Mystic specialization since its reform from Jedi Arbiters. “My time as a Mystic has been a rewarding one. I was always very fond of hosting classes and teaching to new and old members within the community.” - 1Bladed\n\nBladed was added to the Senior Academy Instructor team on June 28th, 2022. He was granted the rank of Jedi Master a few months later, on December 31st, 2022. Shortly after, he was appointed as Head Mystic and Councilor of First Knowledge, on January 20th, 2023. As a Jedi Master, his responsibilities are maintaining a good and friendly environment within the Order, making sure that everyone’s needs; whether that be new players or veterans, receive the proper treatment. Bladed’s duty as Head Mystic is pretty simple, he oversees and runs the Jedi Mystic specialization under the Council of First Knowledge. As a Councilor of First Knowledge, he must represent his specialization on his seat on the Council of First Knowledge, and become part of the Order’s governing body.\n\n# Section 3\n1Bladed mainly progressed through the Jedi Order alone, but he had close friends that he made on the way that made his progression so much more worth it and valuable.

He journeyed from the rank of Seer to Senior Seer, to Associate Chief Seer, and then to the rank of Chief Seer on the 25th May 2023, because of the departure of DylanMalvern. He gained this rank due to his hard work throughout his interim period and his dedication since becoming a Jedi Seer. During Twin’s time as Chief Seer, he welcomed many people to the specialisation and transformed it into a little community where everyone felt welcomed.\n\n# Section 2\nTwin had met many new friends during his time as Chief Seer, one of the most best people he met were JowsDemici, Vanestc, and Polyfrost. JowsDemici assisted and motivated him during his time in the Jedi Order, and he has become an amazing friend to Twin. Vanestc and Polyfrost were great leaders of the Jedi Council during Twin’s time in the Order, and they generously assisted him during his first days on the council. However, his most notable friend in the Jedi Order was AxisMorningStar as he got Twin to join the Jedi Order and assisted him within the group. He also helped Twin reach the rank of Mentor in the Jedi Service Corps.\n\n# Section 3\nDue to the unfortunate removal of the Jedi Seers, he later took up the role of Head of Advancement, now named Taskmaster. Twin has revamped the Jedi Service Corps greatly. He has opened the Jedi Service Corps to Knight and above, allowing them to be able to teach there. Another key change he brought to the Jedi Service Corps was creating more of a community for Mentors, Interns, and Instructors, allowing them a comfortable place to talk and have fun. Some additional changes Twin brought included: weekly meetings, boosting community engagement, and making the  Jedi Service Corps into a better organisationthan it was before he started making changes.\n\n# Section 4\nTwin hosted a job fair on the 2nd of December 2023, where he assisted all specialisations in advertising, and allowed them all a chance to shine so they could possibly gain more members.

Throughout his time within the Order, he made many lasting impacts and gained numerous recognitions and awards. He served in many esteemed positions, such as a Temple Guard Officer, Keeper of Advancement, and Head Seeker. His most notable achievement was being on the Council of Reassignment acting as the longest-standing Battlemaster of the Jedi Assault Team. During his career, he received the Jedi High Council Leadership and Combat Excellency awards.# Section 1\nAdrian first joined the Order on January 13th, 2021, after being introduced to the group by his older brother. They both enjoyed the game, atmosphere, and community while they progressed through the ranks together. Adrian went through the Jedi Service Corps in order to achieve Knighthood. Although Adrian did not have a formal master, he considered RavMalvern as his mentor. Rav played an essential part in Adrian’s career, helping hone his lightsaber combat and playstyle. Adrian was a well-rounded individual, serving under all three minor Councils, allowing him to gain a considerable amount of knowledge and experience. \n\nAdrian joined the Temple Guard on April 28th, 2021. He served dutifully, eventually achieving the rank of Advanced Jedi Knight. By showing leadership and dedication, he was appointed as a Temple Guard Officer. During his time in the Temple Guard, he learned the importance of discipline, holding himself accountable for his actions, as well as how to be a leader. These lessons helped him prepare for larger leadership positions he would take on in the future. After leaving the Guard, Adrian wanted to explore the opportunities open to him. This was when the Jedi Assault Team caught his interest due to how respected they were as well as their purpose and customs. This, along with the support of his friend Kekansi, convinced Adrian to join the Jedi Assault Team and strive to become the Battlemaster. To prepare himself for this goal, he would assume other leadership positions, starting under the Council of First Knowledge as an Artisan, then transferring over to the Council of Reassignment as a Lightsaber Instructor. Once again, his excellent leadership and willingness to take action eventually led him to achieve the position of Keeper of Advancement, where he led and made lasting improvements in the Jedi Service Corps. He then transferred back to the Council of First Knowledge as the Head Seeker.\n\n# Section 2\nThe experience and wisdom he gained during his time within these specializations helped prepare and qualify him to become the Battlemaster of the Jedi Assault Team. Adrian joined the Jedi Assault Team on July 11th, 2021. He climbed up the ranks and took the initiative when he saw problems. After the retirement of Skaxon—the previous Battlemaster—he was elected to be the Battlemaster. He would lead the division through its arguable prime by engaging with the community, making trainings creative and interesting, helping create the Jedi Assault Team’s reputation of having skilled and capable duelists, and overall making the division an amazing place to be within. One of his goals was to make the Jedi Assault Team hold a sense of community, a place where its members could form friendships and engage with each other while also being held responsible for their actions. \n\nOf course, with every path there are obstacles. Adrian’s career within the Order was no different. Being the Battlemaster was no small task, the well-being of an entire division stands upon their shoulders. When Adrian first became the Battlemaster, the Assault Team went under major changes. The division limit was raised from 25 to 50 members. The activity was not the best prior to when Adrian was the Battlemaster, so being able to raise the division capacity was a huge achievement and signaled that activity was picking up. But at the time there were only three officers within the division, Adrian included. Hence, there was a lot of pressure on them to navigate these changes. But with the newfound activity and the excellent problem-solving skills of the officer team, the Jedi Assault Team was able to maintain activity while keeping its standards.\n\n# Section 3\nWithin the Order, Adrian met many incredible people that helped him get to where he is today. One of these people was his first Padawan, Floatmanmichael. They had an excellent Master-padawan bond, both learning from each other and improving themselves together. Kekansi, MarcosMalvern, and Netnix were also some of the key people who helped Adrian achieve the rank of Battlemaster.\n\nAdrian retired and became a Jedi Elder on September 18th, 2022, due to not having enough time to commit to the group. He felt that he accomplished everything he wanted to within the Order, allowing him to retire with no regrets. Adrian was an excellent role model and left a positive impact on many members of the Order. He paved the way for the future of the Jedi Assault Team, and his impacts are still present within the Order to this day.\n\n","meta":{"index":26,"author":"topskies","name":"adrianbound","release_year":2021}},"KennaexMalvern":{"content":"# Introduction\nIn November 2020, KennaexMalvern became a member of the Order.

Eventually, he decided he was going to extend his welcome within the Jedi Order, which led to him having positions such as Jedi High Councillor, Chief of Lore Keepers, and temporary Chief Librarian. He was well known in the Jedi Order for his great knowledge.# Section 1\nBookZulfor didn't have a Master, so he had to go through the Jedi Service Corps route to reach Knighthood, which worked out for him because he received it after only 9 days of being in the Order.  Only soon after reaching the status of Knight, BookZulfor located and assigned himself his first padawan, known as,  lolpoker, whom he trained to knighthood very soon after earning the status of Knight, although his first Padawan didn't advance very far in this order because he unfortunately left. Zulfor has trained three padawans during his journey within the order. BookZelfur attained the rank of Advanced Jedi Knight on June 28th, 2021. He joined the Council of First Knowledge and became a Lore Keeper.\n\nOn October 24th, 2021, BookZulfor was given the rank of Instructor, whose role during this time was to host knight trials for padawans and service initiates. However, BookZulfor never hosted a knight trial because he wanted to focus on his Lore Keeper specialisation, which earned him the title of Jedi Master on December 12th, 2021.\n\nThis has opened up many opportunities for him because he was the Head of Lore Keepers following the retirement of the previous head.

It was around a year after his first visit that he would receive an invitation from BookZulfor to join the Order, believing SciFalded’s familiarity with the genre would make him enjoy it. Despite his skepticism, his knowledge of Nidoxs’s involvement would ultimately solidify his willingness to join on the 17th of July, 2021.# Section 1\nSciFalded would begin his journey as the Padawan of someone well-known to him — GalekVerandus. Following his ascension to Knighthood, he would raise a number of Padawans: the former Jedi Master Shad0wSeer, soggydoggy2019, FastoniTix, BraydenBode, and hshelscott. He then would become a Jedi Consular, specializing as a Sage — a position he still holds to this day.

He joined the Order because he saw multiple people he knew being on Sanctum, and went to check it out. Wolf had been in another Jedi Order before, but it had been a while so he decided to try one again. WolfSupport was an exceptional Master of the Order before KennaexMalvern took the responsibility over. He held not only the title of Master of the Order but also Sage Master, Master of Shadows, and Chief of Security.# Section 1\nWolfsupport had many responsibilities for the different positions throughout his time in the Order. The three most notable positions were the Master of Shadows, Chief of Security, and Master of the Order. As the Master of Shadows, he anonymously led the secret organization known as the Jedi Shadows. Identities of Wolf, and his Shadows were known only to the Senior Councilors of First Knowledge, the Master of the Order, and the Grandmaster. They were tasked with performing both internal and external intelligence operations to maintain the security of the Order. \n\nAs the Chief of Security, he led the Council of Reconciliation alongside the other Senior Councilor of Reconciliation, as well as having direct oversight over the Temple Guard, and of course, participating on the Jedi High Council. Last, but not least, as Master of the Order, Wolf effectively led all day-to-day operations of the Jedi Order. His most prominent, and involved job was hosting, and moderating the weekly Jedi High Council meetings.\n\n# Section 2\nBesides the titles Wolf held, he has also been in a few different specializations. He initially was in the Jedi Investigators for one day before being recruited to join the Jedi Shadows program. As a cover identity, he joined the Jedi Sages and eventually became the Sage Master in conjunction with his role as Master of Shadows. Wolf thoroughly enjoyed his time as a Shadow and was honored to be an integral participant in stopping the DDoSe attacks the Order endured consistently in April and May of 2021. Wolf was in both the Jedi Assault Team and the Librarian’s Assembly as he ascended the ranks of the Order. Later, as the Chief of Security, he technically was in the Temple Guard as well.\n\nWolf still remembers a Jedi named marqtiger who he trained with often as an Initiate and a Padawan. Marqtiger and Wolf’s master, Blazey_Kitsune, were the ones he spent the most time with as a Youngling, Initiate, and Padawan. Wolf himself trained eight Padawans.\n\n# Section 3\nEven though the game has endured multiple drastic combat changes, Wolf has always been a Form II user.

On this ordinary Wednesday, someone quite extraordinary would enter the arms of the Jedi Order. An individual that goes by the alias of Blazey would become something special. Upon joining, she realized that combat was not her specialty. With this acknowledgment, she looked to follow a different route; lore. Following this endeavor, she became a Lore Keeper and worked within the Jedi Service Corps. Her task as a Lore Keeper was to ensure all students in Phase I successfully made their way to Phase II. Not long after, Blazey found herself becoming the Chief Lore Keeper, securing her place as a Minor Councilor.# Section 1\nBlazey had initially struggled to find someone who would take her as a padawan. Having no Jedi Service Corps back then would make it difficult for individuals who couldn't find a Master. Thankfully, she had become friends with SpartanMorningstar, who at the time was a padawan. Spartan promised that if Blazey had no Master by the time they became a Jedi Knight, he would take Blazey as his Padawan. The inevitable had arrived, and Spartan kept to his promise. Soon after, Blazey would eventually become a Jedi Knight. Throughout her journey, Blazey would raise several padawans, most notably former Master of the Order WolfSupport and former Jedi High Councilor reyrosky.\n\nFrom here, Blazey spent around three months as a Knight before finally becoming a Consular, having the Caretaker ValSenko take her trial, which she describes as the most worrying 10 minutes of her life. As noted earlier, Blazey's chosen specialization was Lore Keepers, now known as Jedi Seers. She worked arduously, with her efforts paying off and being selected as the first Chief Lore Keeper.\n\n# Section 2\nUpon Blazey's unretirement from Jedi Elder, she was reinstated as a Jedi Master. With the unretirement, she had the task of joining a specialization. Blazey settled with becoming a Jedi Sage under the Council of First Knowledge. Blazey's duties consist of ensuring the temple's safety and healing Jedi if need be. Her other duty is within the Librarian’s Assembly, with her role being the Oversight of Article Production. This entails ensuring all individuals within the Librarian’s Assembly are writing the articles they claim. This aforementioned task is instrumental to the success of the Librarian’s Assembly, as it guarantees the continuation of produced articles.\n\n\"Sometimes a road is bumpy, and trying to advance without combat may seem hard. But it isn't the combat that makes a knight or a master. Combat can be learned from others, but attitude and how one acts cannot. Focus on how you act and present yourself.

After Remus transferred Flare to join the Temple Guard, former Jedi Master DivineTemenos took over as her master while she completed her Trials of Knighthood. Flare did not train any Padawan herself, because she joined the Temple Guard two weeks after she became a Jedi Knight, which was on the 20th of November, 2021.

During the time Omega joined the Order, progression was based on competence. This is why he essentially traveled through the hierarchy rather quickly. OmegaVanquished became a Temple Guard Instructor two weeks after he joined the Temple Guard; became a Temple Guard Captain two months after, and a Commandant a few months later. When Omega was Temple Guard Commandant, his responsibilities were rather simple; it was to report to the Chief of Security and lead the Temple Guard in his own image. Omega’s regime mostly focused on expansion and management.\n\n# Section 2\nOmegaVanquished found his master, SparrowElysee, one week after he passed his Crystal Gathering. Throughout Omega’s tenure in the Jedi Order, he was only a Temple Guard. “My time in the division was honestly the best times I have ever had on the platform, notably during that 2020 era. Serving under and with some of the greatest leaders and companions was a blast, and it is hard to put in simple words how great that age really was.” Omega made his journey with various people, but notably, those who stood out were AxisMorningstar, who attended the same Crystal Gathering as Omega and FNTSlat, an individual who Omega joined the Temple Guard with.\n\n# Section 3\nThe one award Omega received, was  the Jedi High Council Excellency Award, which was originally called the Jedi High Council Competence Award. However, it is not the award that means much to Omega, the bestower does. Omega was awarded by a former Master of the Order and Chief of Security Vermened. “Vermened without doubt is the most influential figure I have met here, and working under and with him has been a thrill throughout the past two years.

On February 28, 2022, Foolzy served as the Headmaster of the Jedi Academy, occupying a seat on the Council of First Knowledge. Three months later, Foolzy occupied the 11th seat on the Jedi High Council and served for two months. Throughout his career, he was awarded the Activity, Excellency, and Leadership Award by the Jedi High Council.# Section 1\nOn December 4th, 2021, Foolzy joined the Sith Order as a Hopeful due to the influence of his cousin, Redjaal. Soon after, he transferred to the Jedi Order. When Foolzy joined the Order he was ignorant and not prepared for his journey as a Jedi, Foolzy was not interested in hosting trainings at first. But after Jedi Knight ThosapBrawl trained Foolzy to Knighthood, Foolzy was given the chance to be supervised by an Academy Instructor. Foolzy was all about showcasing his creativity and willingness to help the Jedi Order. That was the time when he found his purpose which was to become the best Academy Teacher he could possibly be. Foolzy believed that hosting a training for a Youngling would start their journey to becoming a Jedi Knight. Through this mindset, nothing held Foolzy back. He even was the first Academy Teacher to host 100+ Youngling trainings as a three-week-old Teacher Foolzy also broke the record for most trainings hosted in one day, which was twenty, as well as the most Youngling Trainings hosted which was 316.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter Knighthood, Foolzy began his journey with the Jedi Sages on the 29th of December, 2021 under the former Sage Master AxisMorningstar. Foolzy’s main reason why he joined Sages was that he liked to help people and the ability to heal. Foolzy had many plans and ideas for the Sages that he would love to offer. The Sage Handbook used to be just writing and a few paragraphs about Sages itself. Now, it is something more with Foolzy’s knowledge behind the tips and tricks for healing. Under Sage Master Inesnix, his leadership they were able to create the Sage Trainings where Sages will gather once a week to learn about the art of support. Not only this, but Foolzy also created the Sage Database Spreadsheet with the assistance of Sage Master Inesnix.\n\n# Section 3\nOnce the Academy Instructor applications were open, Foolzy took the opportunity and applied immediately. After becoming an Academy Instructor, he made sure he asked as many questions as possible as he believed he will make little to no mistakes if he was to do so. As Academy Instructor Foolzy was in the open water, he had the opportunity to prove his worth as an Academy Instructor. That is why he supervised 15 trainings in his first week. After this, Foolzy’s next step was to become an Assistant Headmaster so he could share his thoughts on the training guide. When he became the Assistant Headmaster, Foolzy asked a question to the team about the duties of an Assistant Headmaster. He was then given a database and a monthly review. After one month, Foolzy became the Headmaster of the Academy, with his first order of business was to hire Assistant Headmaster that deserve the position. After Foolzy hired his Assistant Headmasters, they began the massive change throughout the Academy. One of those changes is that former Assistant Headmaster DementedDroid created the Academy Spreadsheet which Foolzy revamped to what it is today. The Headmaster of the Academy Foolzy believed in “working hard to work less.” If Foolzy put in the maximum amount of effort, everything will soon run smoothly, like a flowing river. Being the Headmaster of the Academy, Foolzy makes sure everyone is tended to including himself as Headmaster hosting Youngling trainings, displaying to the Academy team that he is there for them.\n\n# Section 4\nFoolzy was given an opportunity to see what it was like as a Jedi High Councilor as the 11th Jedi High Council temporary seat of the Order. This opportunity was an amazing experience for Foolzy. He loved interacting with the community regarding law changes and community-based updates. As a Jedi High Councilor, Foolzy had the chance to delve deeper into confidential topics. Not only this but Foolzy was also given the opportunity to help recognize all the Academy staff’s efforts to host through the Jedi High Council. This two-month experience was a big eye-opener to what the Jedi High Council has to deal with on a daily basis for Foolzy.\n\n# Section 5\nThroughout his time within the Jedi Order, Foolzy had a very unique way to select his future Padawans. From January to March 2022, Foolzy hosted a Padawan Trial every time he was short on Padawans. Foolzy would take the Initiates through three different trials: Trial of Lore, Trial of Combat, and Trial of Scenario. Each Trial had a specific location within the Great Jedi Library on Ossus and was all scored up to an overall number of 30. The Initiates with the highest scores would become the new Padawan of Foolzy while giving the other Initiates to spectators if there were any. The newly appointed Padawans of Foolzy would join a top-secret Padawan server he owns where the Padawans would be given a step-to-step guide on where to start with their Knight Trial document, essentially making Foolzy’s work easier in the long run. \n\nFoolzy would also host Padawan Combat Training where they would go through some practice rounds with his Padawans; after the practice rounds, he would teach them some combinations on how to duel properly. Once the Padawan Combat Training is complete, the Padawans will come out three times better than they were before. At one point, Foolzy had four Padawans during his time as Jedi High Councilor. Though this was when Foolzy had a mental breakdown as he had too many duties in The Jedi Order. During his time training Padawan, he learned that not giving his all will only let him down. Foolzy has trained 31 Padawans throughout his career.\n\n# Section 6\nThroughout Foolzy's career, he has hosted events such as “The Great Youngling War” which was an event for Teachers to host the most trainings, “Initiate Scout Event” which is where Initiates showcase their skills for an opportunity to be chosen by Jedi Knight or above as a Padawan and the “Jedi Order Wide Hosting Event” which is where all Academy Teachers, Instructors, and Jedi Masters compete to host/supervise the most Youngling Trainings/Uncertified Teachers/Knight Trials. Foolzy made these events to bring activity back to the Order and help the community thrive once again.\n\n“Special thanks to the Assistant Headmasters, kurtnicolo, KenobiExostlyx, InenNix, Jaxoolzy, DeBraamster, JaroCycle, ScarlettMalvern, TreyOrigin, DanielMalvern, SOMM1E and HxgoNix for their constant support throughout the Academy; and not to forget, a special thanks to the former Headmaster vJesko and Senior Councilor of First Knowledge Archimedes_v1 for being a mentor and a friend throughout my time as Headmaster.

He has served in several divisions, ranging from the Temple Security Force to the Jedi Assault Team, all the while doing his best to leave a positive impact. Undoubtedly, he has been one of the most significant contributors to the community.# Section 1\nReyrosky became a part of the Order on the fifth of May, 2021. He joined the Jedi Order as he and his friend, FoxtrotMalvern, were bored of other ROBLOX games. This led to the duo becoming invested in the Star Wars genre, eventually discovering the Jedi Order, in which they would each play a major role. He would then train under Blazey_Kitsune as her Padawan and progress in the Order. Following that, he would come to bring up two Padawans - his friend, FoxtrotMalvern, and AeIithia.\n\n# Section 2\nHaving a deep interest in combat, compounded by his being in the Jedi Assault Team, reyrosky would become a Paladin for his first specialization. Following the retirement of then Head Paladin, SanctusTenebris, reyrosky would take over and be inducted into the Council of First Knowledge. As a Councillor of First Knowledge, he would spearhead the creation of the Path to Knowledge class that is still used to this day. Moreover, he would attempt to give Paladins a role within the Order, which they had lacked. Unfortunately, his efforts were short-lived, as the specialization was shut down.\n\n# Section 3\nAfter the shutting down of the Paladins, reyrosky became a Peacekeeper under the Temple Security Force, once again trying to find a role for them. His time in the Temple Security Force would see the retirement of Gate Master VexillumUsh. Due to this, Masters Unite5000 and iSingTooMuch would grant reyrosky the position of Gate Master. Taking this chance, he remade the entire Temple Security Force Discord server, introduced squads, and implemented Sages into the division for assistance. This was all in a bid to improve the division. Not long after reaching the rank of Gate Master, reyrosky would also attain the position of Vindicator in the Jedi Assault Team.\n\n# Section 4\nWhile serving as the Gate Master, reyrosky would see himself as a nominee for the publicly-elected Jedi High Council seat. He would ultimately succeed in becoming a member of the Jedi High Council. As a High Councillor, he would try to implement many things to improve the group - rank evaluations, clarification on what Instructors are, and so on.\n\n# Section 5\nAlas, albeit understandably, reyrosky would retire from the Jedi Order once his term as a Jedi High Council member ended, leaving behind a significant legacy. It was during this time that Vermened had requested for reyrosky to join the Dark Council to assist in building the foundation of the Sith Order. However, realizing how burnt out he had become in The Known Galaxy, he refused and stepped away from all responsibilities in the group.\n\n# Section 6\nReyrosky’s time in the Order under many positions has given him invaluable wisdom.

As a Jedi Master, Harlaw would refuse to participate in competitions around the Order as he preferred to focus solely on the Seekers over any other division.# Section 1\nHarlaw has been in the Jedi Order for over a year; during this time, he has reached the rank of Master and led the Seeker specialization through its most challenging moments. Harlaw has also raised many young Padawans to the noble status of Jedi Knight. However, Harlaw believes that a Master must prepare their Padawan for their Knight Trials, teaching them everything the Master knows. They do not have a claim over their Padawan and should treat them as friends and mentorees.\n\n# Section 2\nAs the head of the Seekers, Harlaw helped reform the specialization through a difficult time. Currently, the Seekers reside on the Council of First Knowledge. However, they were previously on the Council of Reassignment, helping with Initiates in the Jedi Service Corps. The Seekers would also be responsible for keeping hold of any data relating to the Order. The Jedi High Council removed all of their previous duties during the transfer to the Council of First Knowledge. \n\nAfter the move, Harlaw would be responsible for helping reform the Seekers, moving them in a new direction, and creating the Galactic News Network, or GNN for short. He also assisted with recreating the Council of First Knowledge in a way that represented their specializations and divisions instead of ruling over them.\n\n# Section 3\nEventually, TntHarlaw would retire on the 7th of July, 2022. A controversial retirement but ultimately a needed retirement. Harlaw, along with the Council of First Knowledge, decided that for the Seekers to carry on working efficiently the way it was, a new head would have to be appointed.

Fortunately, he completed these goals.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter his time in the Temple Guard, Divine wanted to join the Jedi Assault Team. He joined the Jedi Assault Team on the 17th of October 2021. He participated in multiple raids within the Jedi Assault Team, and it was one of the things he enjoyed the most in the Jedi Order. However, before Divine joined the Jedi Assault Team, he first became a Jedi Lightsaber Instructor on the ninth of September 2021; not long after that, Divine was granted the rank of Jedi Instructor on the 21st of November. Divine was very eager to get the rank of Jedi Master while being a Jedi Weapon Specialist. However, he was “a bit childish,” and he “did not have the maturity” to become a Jedi Master. Luckily DivineTemenos had Senior Councilor of Reassignment PrimeSicarius as his role model.\n\n# Section 3\nOnce DivineTemenos was finally granted the rank of Jedi Master on the 28th of April 2022, he became more mature and acted as a good role model. It was more than one year before he joined the Jedi Order; Divine has been here longer than some of the Jedi High Councilors. At the time of the year, Divine was Head Weapon Specialist, hosting Practice Raids and Advanced Combat Trainings with his Weapon Specialists, which he had a lot of fun in. DivineTemenos was a very aggressive duelist, using the first variant of  Form V during the Sanctum time. After that, he used Form II, Form VI, and the first variant of Form VII.\n\nWhile being Head Weapon Specialist, Divine always joined Jedi Service Corps meetings, even though he did not work in the Jedi Service Corps as Weapon Specialist. He usually joined them just to troll and make people laugh; he could do that because he was a Councilor of Reassignment. Divine made a lot of friends along his journey, especially BellaXl, ExcubariumTenebris, Ising, Axis, Vanestc, DeBraam, Jt, Jesko, Fox, Blazey, Adam, and Float. DivineTemenos is mostly proud of his reputation as Councilor of Reassignment. However, his greatest accomplishment was the improvement in his maturity.\n\n","meta":{"index":28,"author":"A1dok4","name":"DivineTemenos","release_year":2021}},"PoH_v1":{"content":"# Introduction\nPoH_v1 joined the Order around the end of September 2020 because a comrade of his was in this group.

Slate joined the Jedi Order on November 26th, 2021. He wanted to get involved in a community, in this case, a Jedi group. Slate saw a friend of his playing as a Sith Knight at the time. Slate is the Keeper of Antiquities, the second Senior Councilor of First Knowledge. However, some may know him as a Head Mystic, or Head Arbiter. He has also been a Lightsaber Instructor and Jedi Paladin.# Section 1\nSlate has really only been in two specializations, he became a Jedi Knight on December 11th and spent two weeks preparing for his Lightsaber Instructor trials. After passing the Lightsaber Instructor trials on December 28th, he served the specialization for only nine days before transferring to what was a newly revitalized specialization at the time, Jedi Paladins, serving under the Council of First Knowledge. At the time Slate transferred to Jedi Paladins, which was on January Sixth, the Head Paladin was MarcosMalvern. Transferring in such a short period of time was technically illegal according to the Law of Conveyance, but they did not realize it until about a month later.\n\n# Section 2\nSlate was made an Instructor on January Eighth. Two days later, the Instructor rank changed to an extra-curricular role, so in complete dismay, he ended up being made Jedi Master on January 10th. Paladins ended up splitting into Arbiters and Peacekeepers, and the Caretaker of First Knowledge at the time appointed Slate to be the Deputy-Head Arbiter, he served under creation_v1 who was the first Head Arbiter, and laid out the philosophical elements we use today, the Jedi Virtues, Vices, and Principles of Knighthood, along with additional information that Slate did not have officially recognized or published until later. \n\nA few months later, on April 24th, 2022, Slate was appointed Head Arbiter. It eventually turned to Jedi Mystics, and that was when his duties became focused on building a philosophy to be taught to Jedi Knights-in-training and then developing a curriculum for which Jedi Mystics still use to this day.\n\n# Section 3\nMeanwhile, Slate committed the rest of his time to the Jedi Assault Team and rose to the rank of Warrior, which saw him hosting pieces of training within his Squad and for the rest of the division. Slate’s master was RahmNix, he picked Slate because he was blue, just like Rahm himself. However, to this day, Slate tries to remind Rahm and his other Padawans that Slate is not like them because he is Chiss and have always been Chiss, not just some blue guy. His Chiss name is Tes’lat’ethima, therefore his standard galactic name is Slate. Slate trained two Padawans himself, all the other Padawans he had were inactive.\n\n# Section 4\nThere was not one particular person that Slate grew alongside, but FallenValiant was one of the first people who welcomed him into the group and in fact Slate modeled a lot of the ideas about what makes a “Good Jedi Knight” off of him and a few other people; such as lucasj26, and SigurdGravidus. Those people have contributed to Slate’s upbringing early on, and many, many more have contributed since then. Regarding lightsaber forms, Slate has always preferred Form II, Makashi, and Form VI, Niman. “Not only am I most accustomed to Makashi, it also just looks \"right\" for my character's avatar/robes.”\n\n# Section 5\nSlate has received a Jedi High Council Excellence Award for his work early on in the Jedi Paladins/Arbiters, and he also received an Activity Award due to his Knight Trial hosts during a time when there was not a lot being hosted. “My awards truly don't mean a whole lot to me, of course I value them, but I also think there were lots of unrecognized contributions early last year. That is something I want to be mindful of now that I am on the High Council. However, my role as Head Mystic was important to me, not so much as the title, but the work I was doing was something that I wanted to do for the 4 months prior as a Paladin and an Arbiter, I wanted to teach the ideas I had to the group because I felt that it was something the group lacked. To this day I think it still needs some work to make it more effective, but it was entirely about the teaching that I valued in the role”\n\n","meta":{"index":34,"author":"1Aimes","name":"SlateStatic","release_year":2021}},"PrimeSicarius":{"content":"# Introduction\nPrimeSicarius, also known as Prime, joined in the early days of the Jedi Order’s group development and from what has been observed. He has been accommodating, intelligent, and a logical thinker throughout his time. PrimeSicaruis works with directing the Council of Reassignment and its specializations, holding crucial titles, and taking immense responsibility for the Order, which he has been doing for two years. PrimeSicarius joined the organization after wandering across multiple groups but ended up in the Jedi Order. He was instructed and taught the ways of the force by his former master, TimelessHarmony. After accumulating Knighthood, Prime went on to take over six Padawans later on during his career.# Section 1\nPrimeSicaruis officially started his journey in the Jedi Order in late August 2022. PrimeSicaruis was a curious wanderer in the galaxy, joining several different groups until he stumbled upon the Jedi Order. It caught his eye and fetched his attention. Prime raided the group for a couple of months and later started growing interest in it. He decided to start his journey and began climbing the ranks. The community back then was small but had a significant purpose. PrimeSicarius was more attached to the blade and combat-oriented activities within the Order. Due to that reason, he began working with the Council of Reassignment and achieved very crucial titles like Barsen'thor and a permanent seat on the Council.\n\n# Section 2\nWith these ranks, Prime had many responsibilities, such as making sure the Council of Reassignment and its specializations run smoothly, voicing the community, implementing new ideas for the rest of the Order, illustrating and presenting the Council of Reassignment and its specializations with excellence, and clearing the atmosphere for the people he leads. \n\nPrimeSicarius has contributed a lot to his respective Council. Reforming and adjusting some areas, mentoring others, and implementing handbooks, regiments, and events. One notable job he was given was to help decide some roles for the Jedi Service Corps and Jedi Assult Team back when the Council of  Reassignment was in its early stages.\n\n# Section 3\nWhen PrimeSicarius was an Initiate, he was taken under the wing of TimelessHarmony. His master’s teachings were one of the primary reasons for his success. He was taught about leadership, and how to endure the blade. Prime spread these teachings he acquired from his master to the Padawans he trained and instructed. Some notable and most recent ones are PoH, dire_dread, EternalBlades, Trexori, VoltexNix, and 5PH. \n\nPrimeSicaruis believes that to do extraordinary things in the order of an individual’s career, they must maintain balance, control their sentiments, and stay modest. Do not let other minds drag them to perform illegal actions because of the fun of it. They must scent the elements of the world that the eye cannot see. Construct a stair of the components of failure and have an understanding of why the staircase is not stable.

Through AxisMorningstars career, he has taught and raised several Padawans each with successful careers which goes to show how successful AxisMorningstars teaching methods must have been.\n\n# Section 2\nThroughout his career, AxisMorningstar has been in key roles.

Catawack first joined the Jedi Sanctum and stayed with the Order as they moved to Ossus. Throughout his time, Catawack achieved many ranks and titles, showing dedication to Order-related causes.# Section 1\nAs a Jedi Master, Catawack would ensure that the Order was flowing smoothly, as well as making sure that any Youngling trainings or Knight Trials were being hosted correctly. He also fondly remembers enjoying his talks with many other members within the Order, such as GatoMorningstar. He would enjoy these talks, whether it be how life was going or any specific Order-related cause.\n\nCatawack would show dedication to his Padawans and the Order by rising through the ranks of the Temple Security Force, reaching Gate Master.

Despite quitting Roblox three years ago, his close friend KittNix returned from Basic Training in the United States Army. Kittnix suggested that their friend group consisting of SayianLannister, SebbNix and Netnix join the group to check it out and have some fun over summer break. The four planned to stick to their friend circle and chill by themselves, but that did not go as planned. Little did they know, they ended up branching out through the Order and creating long-lasting friendships outside their initial group. Netnix has gone on to achieve greatness and received many awards for his dedication and faithfulness to the Jedi Order. He has been awarded the Jedi High Council awards for activity, combat excellence, general excellency, and leadership. The path of Jedi Master Netnix is one for the archives for all to learn from and aspire to replicate.# Section 1\nNetnix quickly rose through the Youngling ranks and became the Padawan of KittNix. On August 12th, 2021, Padawan Netnix ascended to the sacred rank of Jedi Knight after passing his Knight Trials. Net first thought he wanted to continue his journey in the Order as a Lightsaber Instructor in the Jedi Service Corps, under the Council of Reassignment. However, about a month later, Netnix ended up taking his Advanced Jedi Knight Trial to become a Jedi Praeceptor, though working within the Service Corps anyways. Net worked hard, put in the hours, and quickly became a Jedi Instructor within the Jedi Service Corps a month later, though his time as a Jedi Praeceptor would come to a close a few weeks afterward. After two months of service as a Praeceptor, Net decided to pursue his initial goal and transferred to the Lightsaber Instructor specialization. A quick week later, Master FloatYouuurBoat announced that Netnix had ascended to Jedi Master. Unfortunately, Net was burning out from the Lightsaber Instructors behind the scenes. He wished to find something with a lot of variety and little repetitiveness. Four days later, Master Unite5000 inquired if Netnix was interested in becoming the Chief Investigator, with the backing of Master Float. Net considered this proposition very extensively as it was a field that he was interested in pursuing in his real life and would bring something fresh to experience within the Order for his burnout. However, with great humility, Net chose the honorable path and requested to become a regular Jedi Investigator instead in order to learn the ropes of the specialization. Netnix quickly discovered the disorganization, lack of collaboration, and lack of a clear vision within the specialization. He began creating a list of changes to revamp the Investigators. After sending these suggestions through the proper avenues, Unite, Excub, Float, and iSing decided to put their faith in Net and appointed him as the Chief Investigator on December 13th, 2021. Thus, he began his journey to overhaul and reorganize the Jedi Investigators to achieve their mission and goals for the good of the Jedi Order.\n\n# Section 2\nNetnix has been Chief Investigator for over ten months now. When he began his tenure as Chief Investigator, there were about 130 cases completed. As of this biography, 187 more cases have been completed during his ten months. In celebration of the Investigators surpassing a whopping 300 cases, he hosted a Discord Nitro giveaway to celebrate all the hard work of his faithful, dedicated employees. Netnix’s favorite aspect of being the Chief Investigator is hard to pinpoint. First and foremost, he loves the people he leads and believes “they are some of the most competent and well-rounded individuals a leader could ask to work with.” The environment within the specialization is quite open and friendly. Teamwork is everything to the Jedi Investigators under Master Net. His second favorite thing would be his ability to ensure this community is kept safe and friendly. Being able to lead the charge against malicious and negative acts is very sacred to Netnix. He strives to keep everyone in the Order accountable. Not only does Netnix love to ensure his specialization is up to standards, but he is also always looking to recruit into the Investigator squad. For those aspiring to become a Jedi Investigator one day, Net recommends you are “always ready to write, listen to people, and be good at analyzing reports.” Out of the 300+ cases that the Investigators have completed, only the reports with sufficient evidence backing them up are included. Many reports do not end up having a strong enough reason or charge, so they end up being dismissed. Occasionally, a warning will be warranted in place. Being reported in itself does not guarantee a tribunal will occur; instead, it is up to the analysis and expertise of a Jedi Investigator to make that decision. Netnix believes it is imperative to be cautious in deciding whether a report goes to a tribunal, as it can tremendously affect someone’s career within the Order. As such, he recommends people interested in joining the specialization have an open mindset and always be open to different points of views. The best way to demonstrate interest would be to reach out and start asking questions to any Investigator! The specialization may sound very intimidating with a lot of hard work, but Net believes anyone can excel if they put in the effort.\n\n# Section 3\nNetnix did not stop his path to greatness as Chief Investigator. On January 30th, 2022, Master Net got elected to one of the two month rotating seats on the Jedi High Council alongside his friend and mentor, Master Float. Following the conclusion of his two-month term, he and Float were appointed to the two six-month Semi-Permanent Seats. While serving in this prestigious position, Net has provided insight and opinions on all matters brought to the Jedi High Council’s attention. He also ensures he considers the voice of his fellow Jedi when stating his views. In the meantime, Master Netnix had been a highly skilled and hard-working member of the Jedi Assault Team division, which he joined with his good friend SayianLannister on the First of September, 2021. They both progressed in combat for a bit until Sayian went to focus on school. Net concentrated primarily on improving combat with force movements, utilizing low-flips heavily for an agile playstyle to confuse his opponent and get cheap hits while his opponent was off guard and incorporating multi-hits into them. While improving his combat, it led Net to his main form Ataru, which he thinks is the best form. He has ascended to the high rank of Captain currently and served under five Battlemasters. He strives to recruit skilled fighters into his team alongside fellow Captain Vanestc through tryouts and raids for the division. Additionally, no matter how high up he climbs, he always remembers that Initiates are the future and create the backbone of the Order. As such, he has taken a whopping twenty-one Padawans throughout his time, being, IstroNix, rice_paddies, MellOTR1, Perio_Laxima, PsychNix, Pure_Rebirth, TuskeNix, ValiosNix, Joopnix, TalziNix, CaitlynNix, his son GalaxyNix, GleamzFroston, VaaSerrus, Misscripto, AnnieElder, VayuNix, VoltexNix, illusant, CammNix, reyrosky, AbsxrdNix and yuni1700. Many of his Padawans have gone off and achieved great things, from becoming part of his Jedi Investigator specialization to becoming Jedi Masters, becoming renowned fighters, and more. Netnix has hosted every Duelist of the Order since November, 2021. He attained the Jedi High Council Combat Excellence Award after barely losing to RileyOnika in the April Duelist of the Order semi-finals. “Combat was a very good stress reliever for myself, and those that practiced with me heavily were some of the most chill times in the Jedi Order.” Finally, all the hard work paid off for Master Netnix on September 17th, 2022. Following Master Unite’s retirement into Jedi Ghosthood, Grandmaster TiberiusMalvern announced to the Order that Net would be ascending to the top. Netnix had made it to Senior Councilor of the Council of Reconciliation. After leading the Investigators out of darkness into the light, Master Netnix will now have the opportunity to strengthen and lead his minor council alongside Chief of Security ExcubiarumTenebris into its next era.\n\n# Section 4\nIt is no secret that Master Netnix has bountiful wisdom to spread to every member in the Order. His lasting message he hopes everyone takes to heart is that “everything happens for a reason.” He quit Roblox due to his disinterest and desire to separate from the platform, but his own Jedi Master, KittNix, drew him back to Roblox. Had Netnix not returned, he would have missed out on so many friendships and happy memories throughout this past year. Net is very loyal to his friends and hold the following very dear for all their support and friendship: vanestc, PrimeSicarius, AlrightyAdrian, GutsNix also known as MarcosMalvern, RahmNix, TuskeNix, AbsxrdNix, LxthalNix, Solito1020, DercyeNix, GleamzFroston, JakesNix, “Inesnix (my son)”, CammNix, SeniorNix, JoopNix, RileyOnika, kurtnicolo, Unite5000, Flare_Valentine (Flate), Kybrenic, FoxtrotMalvern, reyrosky.\n\n","meta":{"index":20,"author":"Librarian's Assembly","name":"Netn7x","release_year":2021}},"ShadowEngineer":{"content":"# Introduction\nShadowEngineer, also known as Shadow, is publicly known for his commitment to the Jedi Order as a Jedi Architect, as well as an active Jedi Master. He also holds a long record of service in the Temple Guard division, holding the rank of a Captain at the time of writing. Along with his unique path of rank progression in the Order, he is an open and experienced person with many talents and qualities. He has been a member of the Jedi Order since August 2021, and he certainly is not getting discouraged by his work. He loves computer science, enjoys listening to music as well as creating his own, and is a long-time Star Wars fan.# Section 1\nShadow’s journey within the Jedi Order began on the 11th of August 2021, when he joined the Order as a Force-sensitive, having seen one of his friends on the Jedi High Council. On the same day, he passed his Basic Newcomer Training and began his journey in the Order. Shortly afterward, he saw the Temple Guards on duty and decided then and there that joining them would be his goal. As an Initiate, he did not hesitate much before joining the Jedi Service Corps to prepare for his Knighthood Trials. Shadow quickly advanced to Phase IV, the final phase before graduation, displaying the ability to learn quickly. Although graduating from the Jedi Service Corps may have seemed like the next goal to achieve, Shadow decided that his expectations towards the organisation had not been fully met. He left the Service Corps in search of a more suitable path. He did not have to wait long. Fortunately for him, his activity and potential were recognised by catawack2, a Jedi Consular, who gladly accepted Shadow as his Padawan. The two shared a friendship and a rewarding bond between a teacher and student. They also found a common interest in programming, which made this bond even stronger. After around a month of training, Shadow underwent his Trials and passed with satisfying results.\n\n# Section 2\nUnlike many others, ShadowEngineer had already thought about the Advanced Jedi Knight Specialisation he wished to join after becoming a Jedi Knight. After around three weeks, he attended a Temple Guard tryout and passed it on his first try. His career in the Guard began on the 17th of December 2021. To this day, Shadow is still eager to supply the division with his insights and skills. Because of his decision, Shadow lacked the occasion, and the willingness, to ever train a Padawan. This does not mean that he has not had any teaching opportunities since then. Instead of training with a classic Padawan, Shadow decided to increase his commitment to the Temple Guards by taking part in mentoring a new generation of Candidates to the rank of Guardsman. During his time there, he mentored four Candidates and aided each of them with their progression within the Temple Guards. His first trainee, TheRamiBlox, has reached the rank of Warden and is still an active member of the division at the time of writing. These mentorships were a great factor in strengthening Shadow’s bond with the Temple Guards. This bond never wavered, even as he was awarded the rank of Captain. Along with the ability to lead his fellow Guards into battle, organise events, and support the division from a more administrational perspective, he also was able to gain one of his best memories since he joined the Order. This memory is a day when he would lead a team of fifteen Temple Guards during a rally. Together, they worked as a team and defeated their enemies, having fun with each other the whole time. To this day, Shadow mentions this experience as one of the most unifying moments of his time in the division.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that along with his career in the Temple Guard, ShadowEngineer also developed himself as a member of the Jedi Order. On the 30th of September 2022, he was awarded the rank of Jedi Master for his commitment as both a developer and a Temple Guard. His work as a Jedi Architect, alongside Nidoxs and SolarHorizon, taught him much about creating, programming, game development, software engineering, and systems architecture. He is currently serving as a Sith Architect. His position allowed him to collect beneficial feedback and perspective from both Jedi and Sith, which can only support him in adding various improvements to the game, as well as fixing bugs and introducing many new features.\n\n# Section 3\nThere is no doubt that ShadowEngineer is an interesting person, whose unique experience as both Temple Guard and a developer is not something commonly met. As a Jedi Master, he is a candidate for the public Jedi High Council seat at the time of writing, along with his plans to pursue the rank of Commandant in the Temple Guard. One of the philosophies that motivated and encouraged him to put in the effort and work towards his goals was the honest pleasure of seeing his actions’ effects from a first-hand perspective. He also found it very inspiring to see other people get excited and happy about the results of his work. As Shadow stated, “Hearing the phrase ‘oh this is so much nicer now’ lights a fire of a kind of flame in my heart that nothing else in life has managed to do, and that makes all the work worth it.” \n\nHe also shares three pieces of wisdom that helped him in his journey:\n\n“Nothing ever has a sole reason. Every outcome is a product of multiple factors, and the best problem solvers find all of them.\"\n\n\"Positive is only positive because negative exists. Without the negative, positive has no meaning. Without the positive, negative has no meaning. Every coin and every war has 2 sides. It is for this reason that an open mind is a powerful tool.\"\n\n“Read books. Why take 5 years to learn from your own mistakes, when you can take 5 weeks or 5 days to learn from someone else's entire life of mistakes.\n\n","meta":{"index":18,"author":"abc_5329","name":"ShadowEngineer","release_year":2021}}},"meta":{"name":"TJO - Persons of Interest","index":28}},"Wild Space":{"articles":{"Morrelian Commonwealth":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Morrelian Commonwealth was a Star Cluster found in the Wild Space regions, containing several star systems with the center being the Morellia system, to which it bears it’s namesake.

It had one sun named Bakura and had two moons. It had two trade routes, Bakura Trace and the Shiritoku Way. The diameter was 21,400 kilometers in length and had a temperate climate. It had terrain consisting of forests, plains valleys, and small seas. The Kurtzen was a native species found solely on Bakura. It was one of the eight planets in the Bakura system. Bakura’s industry heavily revolved around repulsorlift coils used to build a repulsorlift engine. Bakura was quite similar to Alderaan, as noticed by Princess Leia.# Section 1\nThe Bakur Mining Corporation settled in Bakura in 150 BBY. They mined the planet’s metal and crystal deposits, using droids as they were efficient and cheap. They developed cities, with the droids mainly carrying out their construction. The capital of Bakura, Salis D’aar, was the principal place in which trade happened. Bakura quickly changed from a mining planet to a populated planet, with a Bakuran government and prime minister.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring the Clone Wars, Bakura supported the Confederacy of Independent Systems due to their planet mostly using droids to carry out tasks, with a Separatist base being established there. They then fell quickly to Imperial rule and accepted this, rarely revolting.

The planet is home to the intelligent bipedal hunter-warriors, the Kaleesh.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring the Galactic War, the Kaleesh began populating other star systems. The Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire acknowledged them due to their brute forces and strength as warriors. Many of the species were against the Sith, yet they supported both forces in war.\n\nDue to many engagements with conflict, poverty arose with the Kaleesh. Around 100 BBY, Bitthævrian threatened the border of the Kadok Regions with plans to overthrow a government–which alerted the Republic and convinced the Kaleesh that they should defeat the Bitthævrian. The Jedi supported the Kaleesh against the Bitthævrian, marking the start of the Kaleesh–Bitthævrian War.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring the Huk War, the Kaleesh lost, since the Republic reinforced the Huks in the war. General Grievous, who led the Kaleesh, nearly defeated the Huks, but he was incapacitated in a shuttle crash. San Hill, Chairman of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, paid the Geonosians to create a cybernetic suit for Grievous, later leading the Separatist Army. The economic recovery of Kalee was funded by the Banking Clan in return for the work of Grievous. The Huk on Oben were slaughtered by Grievous’ former subordinates, which were now under Bentilais san Sk’ar’s command, and later emigrated to Oben.\n\nWith the rise of the New Order, the Kaleesh, together with Bentilais san Sk’ar and his subordinates, opposed the rule of the Empire, which resulted in a conflict between them.

Located between Reecee, an astronomical object,  and Adumar, a temperate planet, Utegetu Nebula was created by a supernova. A supernova occurred when a large star stopped to combine light elements into substantial elemental products. The loss of heat allowed the star to subside onto itself to form a neutron star or a black hole which could happen naturally or with a superweapon. Utegetu Nebula was also located near Chiss space, a portion of the galaxy ruled by the Chiss, and the Rago Run, a spacelane anchored by the Mid Rim world of Rago.\n\nSection 2: History\n\nUtegetu Nebula contained Woteba, a planet discovered in 35 ABY by Han Solo, a galactic legend who gained fame from being a member of the Rebel Alliance, and his wife, Leia Organa Solo, Luke Skywalker’s twin sister. There were also estimated to be at least thirteen other planets within Utegetu Nebula. Under the Qoribu Truce, a truce forged by the Killik Colony and Chiss Ascendancy in 35 ABY,  Woteba and the many other planets were occupied by Killik nests. \n\nThe Dark Nest, an undisclosed nest of Killiks hidden from the rest of the Colony, secretly colonized a fifteenth unnamed world orbiting the star Tusken’s Eye, a G-class star. A G-class star was yellow and medium-temperature with a lifespan of ten billion years. The Galactic Alliance’s Fifth fleet surrounded the nebula at the Murgo Choke to prevent Killiks from traveling to Chiss space, so they wouldn’t start a war; however, a war eventually occurred called the Swarm War.\n\nThe Swarm War occurred in 36 ABY, including the Chiss Ascendance, the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, and the Colony, which consisted of Killiks and Joiners. The Joiners were non-Killiks marinated into the Killik hive mind. The Swarm War was also a continuation of the Dark Nest Crisis, even though the Galactic Alliance attempted to combine with the Chiss, Jedi elements sided with the Killiks, so the Chiss thought the Alliance aided the Colony; accordingly, it ended up becoming a three-way battle. Eventually, the Alliance came together in order to win the Swarm War.","meta":{"index":11,"author":"Misscripto","name":"Utegetu Nebula","release_year":2020}},"Odessen":{"content":"# Introduction\nOdessen was an unsettled planet situated in Wild Space, near the Unknown Regions. Featuring extensive oceans and mountainous continents, the planet had a mild climate and a variety of wildlife amid its forests. The entire planet was a Force nexus and it had a balanced connection with the Force. Following the Eternal Empire’s victory over the galaxy, the Grandmaster Satele Shan went into exile on Odessen for several years. In 3631 BBY, it was selected as the location for the headquarters of the Alliance against Zakuul. The planet’s location was kept hidden until its revelation to the Eternal Emperor Arcann, who mounted an unsuccessful attack on the planet. Odessen was assaulted a second time by Vaylin, who succeeded her brother to the Eternal Throne. The second battle was far more catastrophic to Alliance forces, yet it still saw them emerging victorious over the Eternal Empire. Odessen became the capital of the Alliance against Zakuul, which had reformed themselves as the Eternal Alliance.# Section 1\nAs a backwater planet, Odessen’s location was unknown to the galaxy for the majority of galactic history. Over half of the planet’s surface was covered with oceans and seas, while the terrain was filled with flourishing vegetation and tall forests that sprouted from the mountain ranges. Native to Odessen, the shade stalkers were highly aggressive predators that hunted in packs. The animals had thick scaly hides, suggesting that they were not always predatorial, and they seemingly did not require food to survive. Doctor Juvard Illip Oggurobb had theorized that their rapid evolution may have been related to the planet’s Force properties. When the scientist introduced several more species to Odessen, he found that evolutionary changes were present within a year.\n\n# Section 2\nIn 3636 BBY, Satele Shan discovered the planet and went into exile after failing to defend the Galactic Republic against the Eternal Empire, choosing the planet because of its strong affinity with the Force. The Grandmaster cut down a section of wooded land and transformed it into a small camp, where she lived for years with the company of the Force ghost of Darth Marr. In 3631 BBY, the pair anticipated the arrival of the Alliance Commander and planned on adequately preparing them against the Eternal Empire. Following the Battle of Asylum, the former Sith Intelligence Minister Lana Beniko chose Odessen as the prime world for the Alliance headquarters after the planet pulled at her through the Force. Lana called upon her contacts to participate in the war against Zakuul, and the Alliance base was soon established on a cliffside. News of the Alliance’s exploits against the Eternal Empire spread far across the galaxy, leading Republic and Imperial personnel alike to travel to the planet and join their cause. After finding the Alliance Commander unconscious in the wilderness, Satele Shan carried the Commander to her starship, parked near her camp. Along with Darth Marr, the two imparted their knowledge and wisdom to the Commander, trialling them to ensure they were ready to put an end to the Eternal Empire.\n\n# Section 3\nIn around the following year, the artificial intelligence, SCORPIO, had revealed the position of the Alliance headquarters to Arcann, who responded by sending his detachment of the Eternal Fleet towards the planet. The Alliance Commander scrambled the Gravestone, an ancient warship of tremendous power, to defend the planet from orbit. In the ensuing space battle, Arcann was defeated in a duel when his Eternal Flagship was boarded by the Alliance Commander, while the remainder of his fleet was crippled by the Gravestone. In his absence, Vaylin became the new Empress of Zakuul and eventually launched another assault on Odessen. The Eternal Empress managed to land battalion sized units accompanied by Eternal Empire walkers and Siege Skytroopers. She was killed in a confrontation at the Alliance base, bringing about the surrender of her soldiers by the thousands. In the aftermath of the battle, the Alliance had occupied Zakuul and the Eternal Throne was relocated from the Spire to the Alliance base, where it was used to control the Eternal Fleet.\n\n","meta":{"index":5,"author":"SciFalded","name":"Odessen","release_year":2020}},"Maraqoo Sector":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Maraqoo sector, which was located in the Wild Space section of the Galaxy, was home to only one system; known as the Reo system.The Maraqoo Sector was mostly known for its Mission to Reo.

The Death-Hunter Cyborg was Imperial Moff Jessco Comark’s brainchild, who used his position in the Imperial Intelligence’s Bureau of Operations Renik branch to extract funds in order to replace the Galactic Empire’s bounty hunters with perfect killing machines. Within the research facility, he would capture humans from Bescane and turn them into his own cyborg assassins.

Sentience was determined by the life form’s ability to reason, speak, and operate tools. The Mephout politicians and diplomats were all female due to the male’s inability to control their tempers and their hot-headed natures. Mephout was also home to the Plintep Cybernetics Corporation, a company responsible for creating the RST Model Translator Droid to use within the Mephout Dominion. The translator was built with feminine programming and a large bust because of the prominence of females in the species. The RST model was able to translate languages without the delicacy and refinement of a protocol droid.\n\n# Section 2\nThe RST model’s sensitivity to electromagnetic pulses affected their rationality circuits and life conservation programming. These defects led to several problems with the Mephout’s government affairs, resulting in a dozen assassinations, half a dozen declarations of war, and even a marriage proposal. Eventually, the RST model was considered a liability and sold off or given away as presents, being retired. Later, they were replaced by modern protocol droids.\n \nOne notable RST model was 42-RST, also known as Rusti. Rusti was owned by Bungo Bung, captain of the Chubby Gundark, a SoroSuub freighter. Rusti was given as a gift to Captain Bung for services rendered, but Rusti was a part of the outdated technology giveaways. Rusti was Captain Bung’s co-pilot on the Chubby Gundark. Great Bantha Breakfast Biscuit Run, a two-week transport mission where Bung made several thousand credits to transport large amounts of Bantha Breakfast Biscuits, was a direct consequence of owning Rusti. She established it by off-handedly commenting that he should give them to thousands of beings in the galaxy who have never tried them; however, the mission was ended when they found out the biscuits were mutating into Giant Amorphous Bantha Breakfast Buscuits, amoeboid creatures that were created when the biscuits were placed into the autochef. The biscuits bonded with the bantha genetic material in the meat to create a creature that would rapidly eat the chef.

The planet was coated with an exceptional amount of southern ocean and swamps, including the Endless Swamp, known for its prodigious overgrown trees. Balancing between the light and dark sides of the Force, the planet had a rare connection to the Force, similar to Odessen. Home to many immigrated humans, Zakuul also had other species such as Iknayid and the swamp rancor. Resting place of the throne and branching off from the Spire, Zakuul City, the planet had up-to-date technology with numerous cities spread throughout the world.# Section 1\nBecause of its backwater position in Wild Space, Zakuul was a planet that had possessed no interaction with the rest of the galaxy; however, the builders of Iokath occupied the planet to be used as a testing site for their weapons. Although the cause of events is unknown, somehow early Zakuulans immigrated to the world and started tribes led by three superstitious Force-Sensitive Leaders: Matriarch, High Shaman, and Champion. The Zakuulans believed in Zildrog, an adviser to warriors who gifted them the Breath of the Dragon, a spiritual blessing.\n\nDuring the time of the Zakuulans, the final conflict between the Eternal Fleet and the Gravestone transpired. Concluding the conflict, the Gravestone was left in the Endless Swamp and the Eternal Fleet was over.  At the most influential point of the Old Ways, the Zakuulans were nihilistic and worshiped a pantheon of gods. The leader among them was Izax, the god of death and Ultimate Devourer, who demonstrated his power through the discomfort and torture of his followers. The Zakuulans believed their fate was tied to the Old Gods, and the ones who debated were identified as a demon and outcasted from society to the Endless Swamp. Later, a prophecy was made promising that the Demon Savior would revolt above the pantheon and murder Izax leading to a new era. Hundreds of years later, Vitiate appeared on the planet after being tempted by gossip about the Eternal’s Fleet’s new obliteration of Wild Space’s inhabitants. As he traveled, he found Zakuul and decided to claim it as a place for his new empire and later became the powerful warrior known as, Valkorion. Valkorion declared himself Demon Savior and built his new empire from the base of the Endless Swamp.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter Valkorian defeated the Old ways he repurposed multiple tribes from around the planet, taking their force-sensitive leaders, and turned them into the Knights of Zakuul. The Knights of Zakuul’s job was to guard their planet and to serve Valkorian and even included a sector of Knights known as Scions who were able to see visions of past events and the future. The Old World was the first city created on Zakuul; however, Valkorian didn’t deem it worthy enough, so he kept renovating it until he finally developed the Spire. He then was able to make his people scientists by evolving sociology and purpose for generations who held a connection with the Old Ways. In due course, he was able to navigate the empty Eternal Fleet using his Scions and assigned the installation of the Eternal Throne. Once the Eternal Throne was operational, other planets were taken over by the Eternal Empire, who eventually expanded its power to a large chunk of Wild Space.\n\nEventually, a surplus of resources entered into Zakuul, including credits and raw materials which were essential to the planet’s expansion and expansion of its military technology which, in many regards, was inspired by the Eternal Fleet. The citizens of Zakuul were given a stipend of credits making them the highest class of any core world who got everything they desired. Throughout this time period, the Old World was a place to live out their darkest dreams of brutality and to feed on any other desires before returning to the Spire. For about a hundred years, the Eternal Empire was at a calmness with the Eternal Fleet barely being mobile other than when collecting resources. That is until the murder of Valkorion.\n\n# Section 3\nFollowing the Battle of Zakuul, the Eternal Empire ended and was taken over by the Eternal Alliance, who inherited control over Zakuul. Even though the planet was under the Eternal Alliance’s rule, many rebellions were set out during the same time period as the War on Iokath. In 3629 BC, after The Outlander’s Mission to Nathema, the people of Zakuul split from the Alliance to start their own government, because the Eternal Alliance was no longer a threat after the Eternal Fleet and Gravestone were demolished.

These two debilitating weapon systems could knock out shields, communication arrays, and weapon systems of those caught in the O-shaped ion ring. The rest of the ship’s plethora of weapons contained a tractor beam, five-point defense laser cannons, and a whopping total of 500 turbo lasers — which could all open up simultaneously in a broadside engagement with disabled enemy vessels floating helplessly in space. \n\nOn top of this, the cruiser was massive in size compared to most ships in its time, being five full lengths of the Republic’s Venator-class cruisers and some change. This required a lot of manpower, leading to the 900 droids dedicated to serving as crew members. This number does not include the infantry on board, ranging in the thousands — from B1 and B2 battle droids to droidekas. This ship also contained B1-series rocket droids, including reports of B2-HA battle droids, being used to eliminate escape pods deployed from helpless Republic ships caught in its range. Though the ship’s primary arsenal could sustain itself, the use of fighters in open space would prove difficult to repel, so multiple hangars housing vulture-class droid starfighters were utilized to deploy and engage opposing bombers and attacking spacecraft.# Section 1\nThe initial shock and awe of the Malevolence occurred in 22 BBY, when the Republic lost communication with Jedi Master Plo-Koon and his fleet after an engagement with the subjugator-class cruiser. After a hard-fought escape, Plo-Koon and a small detachment of surviving clone troopers were able to relay information on the Malevolence and its last known location and paths - beginning an assault on the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center, aiming to eliminate more than 60,000 clones being treated on board. The cruiser was intercepted by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and the Shadow Squadron detachment of Y-Bombers, able to hold them off while a fleet of Venator-class ships came into range and forced the Malevolence to retreat.\n\nOn the backfoot and seeking a route for escape, General Grievous sought to capture Republic Senator Padmé Amidala as a hostage, seeing as they happened to jump into the same system she was traveling through.

In a daring escape, Senator Amidala and her rescuers were able to get a safe enough distance away for Republic Venators to engage. In a last-ditch attempt, the crew aboard the Malevolence attempted to jump to a secure Separatist base in Sector-4; however, due to malfunctions with the navigation, sent the now doomed cruiser on course into the Dead Moon of Antar.

Dritus bragged that the vessel was incredibly strong and could withstand all sorts of climates. However, in 9 BBY, the Mantis endured internal damage during a landing on a planet.# Section 1\nThe Mantis had a unique exterior design, which was divided into three sections: front, back, and a moving piece housing the outer board engine and vertical fin. This piece gave the vessel a distinctive appearance. The Mantis had two laser cannons for light armament. The floor inside the cockpit was somewhat made of glass, which offered a wide field of view for the pilot. The seats for both the pilot and co-pilot were raised, which provided an assertive position, and the third seat served as the communication station.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Mantis featured a well-chosen interior with six specific areas. Behind the cockpit was the holotable room, where a cozy semicircular sofa upholstered with Potolli-weave fabric surrounded a central table. There were two boarding ramps situated on both sides of the ship, which would be changed to complement the ship's landing orientation. Further back was the common area, which had a roomy seating area. Fancy terrariums, behind an Umbaran glass wall, decorated the area. A couple of stairs would lead to a raised galley that featured a table and a couple of shelves for food storage, along with another large terrarium. \nPassing through the main corridor, which was available through the back of the galley, were three separate doors that led to different rooms within the vessel.

Due to its architect, former Rendili designer Walex Blissex, it was marketed as a Rendili design. The ship's bulbous, organic-like shape spoke of substantial influence from the Mon Calamari Shipyards, and it was more of a political move aimed to attract Rendili away from the Galactic Empire. The Republic-class Star Destroyer was smaller than Blissex's daughter Lira's Imperial-class Star Destroyer, but it was a considerably more economical design.# Section 1\nDespite being half the price of an Imperial-class Star Destroyer and having a fifth of the crew size, the Republic-class had 20% more firepower than the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer. The Imperial II-class Star Destroyer and the several Super Star Destroyers, however, were still superior. 40 heavy turbolaser batteries, 40 heavy turbolaser cannons, 20 ion cannons, and 10 tractor beam projectors made up the armament. A Class 2 hyperdrive, similar to that found on the Imperial-class, was also installed on the Republic-class. The Republic-class was just 1,250 meters long, much shorter than the Imperial-class, which was 1,600 meters long. Because the smaller spacecraft retained a similar level of firepower, cargo capacity and endurance had to be sacrificed. The Republic-class was equipped with enough consumables to last two years without resupply, compared to two years for the Imperial I-class and six years for the Imperial II-class. Only a single regiment of 3,200 ground troops, as well as a single entire New Republic wing, could be carried aboard. Long-range starfighters, rather than short-range fighters like the Defender and K-wing starfighters, were usually carried by Republic-class ships.\n\n# Section 2\nOne of the first warship models designed for the New Republic's standardization efforts was the Republic-class. Due to the Thrawn campaign in 9 ABY and Emperor Palpatine's return the following year, production on the Republic-class and other vessels was finally restarted at a lower level, and the new ships were scattered across the fleet. The New Class Modernization Program was selected to build its largest ships from Republic Engineering Corporation's Nebula-class Star Destroyer hull design rather than the Republic-class Star Destroyer.

Owned by the esteemed Jedi Lord and Master Valenthyne Farfalla, this unique vessel played a pivotal role in the events of the New Sith Wars. With its distinctive design reminiscent of ancient sailing ships, the Fairwind combined the elegance of traditional aesthetics with advanced weaponry and technology.# Section 1\nThe Fairwind possessed a striking appearance, resembling a colossal sailing ship transposed into the realm of spacefaring vessels. Its rounded hull, twin masts, and wings evoked the grandeur of a bygone era. The upper surface of the ship functioned as an open-air deck during atmospheric flight, providing unobstructed views to crew and passengers. With a timber-framed construction and a golden keel running down its center, the Fairwind exuded an aura of magnificence.\nThis gunship boasted an impressive array of armaments, including three double-barreled laser cannons on each side, two laser turrets integrated into its figurehead, and an additional laser turret at the leading edge of the bow. Its wooden hull was reinforced with the durable wroshyr tree material from Kashyyyk, further augmented by deflector shield skins. The Fairwind's design, though unconventional, found echoes in other vessels throughout the galaxy, such as the Merriweather and the flagship of the notorious pirate Reddjak.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring the New Sith Wars, the Fairwind played a vital role in Lord Farfalla's efforts to bolster the Jedi forces on Ruusan. As a Jedi Master aligned with Lord Hoth and the Army of Light, Farfalla embarked on a mission to recruit Jedi Knights for the cause. With the Fairwind serving as his flagship, Farfalla assembled a fleet composed of capital ships and massive gunships, each emblazoned with his personal colors. Three hundred Jedi Knights of various species joined this armada, ready to confront the Sith threat.\nThe Fairwind's true moment of glory came when it broke through a Sith blockade to rescue Lord Hoth and his forces on Ruusan. Despite the initial tension between Farfalla and Hoth, a cunning ruse initiated by one of Farfalla's subordinates successfully mended their relationship. When a section of the Sith blockade engaged Farfalla's fleet in orbit, the Fairwind and other gunships seized the opportunity to rout the Sith's ground forces. The intervention proved pivotal, allowing Lord Hoth's depleted forces to replenish and thereby turning the tide in the Ruusan campaign.\nFollowing the Sith Lord Skere Kaan's fateful activation of a thought bomb that devastated both Jedi and Sith ranks on Ruusan, Farfalla led rescue missions from the Fairwind to locate and aid Jedi survivors. The gunship played a crucial role in the aftermath of the war, facilitating the recovery and healing of wounded Jedi while ensuring that any remaining threats were contained.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Fairwind was commanded by Jedi Lord Valenthyne Farfalla, a half-Bothan Jedi Master hailing from a noble family. Though some perceived him as foppish and vain, those who knew him well respected his prowess and unwavering dedication to the Jedi cause. Alongside Farfalla, Jedi Knight Lirondo, wielding both a large ax and a green lightsaber, fought valiantly aboard the Fairwind during the decisive Seventh Battle of Ruusan.\n\n","meta":{"index":61,"author":"DioneSenko","name":"Fairwind","release_year":2021}},"CR70 Diplomatic Corvette":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe CR70 Corvette was the predecessor to the more famous CR90 Corvette, also known as the “Rebel Blockade Runner.” Like its successor, the CR70 was manufactured by the Corellian Engineering Corporation.

The most visible indications of a CR70 that had undergone the refit package were ring-like fins and extra thruster modules to complement the 11 engines that the CR70 already possessed. The retrofit process would take 2-3 weeks to complete. Once fully retrofitted, the CR70 would be a few meters longer and possess a second docking ramp at the back of the vessel.

The UT-60D U-Wing was a unique craft that performed the hybrid role of a troop transport and an air support-oriented starfighter. Due to balancing between both roles, the U-Wing was not exceptional at either. The U-Wing had limited fuel due to needing to power more life-support, and its larger hull made it less maneuverable than a typical starfighter. While it was worse than a Y-Wing when it came to dogfighting, it was remarkable when it came to close air support.# Section 1\nThe UT-60D U-Wing was one of the last products produced by Incom Corporation before the Galactic Empire nationalized the company. Despite its short production run, it had two models. The first model lacked weapons and s-foils. It also lacked a hyperdrive and possessed two engines instead of four. For obvious reasons, this model did not see much use in the Rebel Alliance.\n\n# Section 2\nThe better-known model had four engines instead of two. The engines were Incom’s 4J.7 model. Inside each of the engine modules, there was a hyperspace motivator that allowed the craft the ability to go into hyperspace. Unlike the earlier model, the later model had two KX7 laser cannons. Due to the presence of laser cannons, the U-Wing needed to radiate off much more heat. Incom Corporation decided to utilize their signature solution to problems of this nature: they made the wings of the craft have s-foils so that they could throw off heat far away from the main section of the craft. Behind each of the loading doors on the U-Wing’s sides, a gunner could operate an improved weapon attachment. The UT-60D U-Wing could have a single pilot or two pilots working in tandem.\n\n# Section 3\nBail Organa was responsible for most of the U-Wings that were under the Rebel Alliance’s control. After a shipment of U-Wings was “lost” by Bail Organa, they eventually showed up in the hands of Rebels.

One might ask, \"How did the Jedi Order come to be?\" This would be best told by going to the beginning of the Order, to the Order's precursor, and how it came to be. The Jedi Order was an organization that originated from the Je'daii Order, which was founded on Tython and consisted of mostly Force-sensitive species. However, this once again begs the question of how all of these species got to Tython in the first place. This can be answered by the introduction of the Tho Yor. The Tho Yor were nine vessels that had existed far before the Order did, with no one knowing where they came from. Of these nine vessels, eight were found outside of Tython, with the last being a much larger vessel, serving as some sort of rallying point for the other seven.# Section 1\nWhile it was unknown when these vessels were created, it was known when they were activated. In the year 36,453 BBY, the Tho Yor suddenly came to life across the galaxy, collecting various Force-sensitive peoples. This ranged from Selkath, Wookiees, Dathomiri, Twi'leks, Humans, Sith (species), Iktochi, Cathar, Zabrak, Miraluka, Devaronians, Noghri, Koorivar, Krevaaki, Sullustans, and a plethora of other species. In the same year, the eight Tho Yor had completed their mission and traveled back to Tython. There, the Tho Yor gathered around a colossal Tho Yor. During this time, a Force storm appeared due to the imbalance on the planet. Shortly after the Force Storm had quieted down, the eight Tho Yor traveled to different locations on Tython where each vessel delivered its Force-sensitive passengers. This led to the building of many separate temples and communities across the planet.\n\n# Section 2\nOn the continent of Thyr, a Tho Yor came to a stop above a large cavern. There, the newly formed Je'daii Order established the temple of Qigong Kesh, where advanced Force abilities were taught. On Masara, the Temple of the Arts, known as Bodhi, was built. On Kato Zakar, located in the Ice Giant Range, the fortress of Stav Kesh was constructed. It was here where martial arts were taught. Not all Tho Yor settled above land, however. Above the ocean, a Tho Yor arrived, and the Temple of Healing, Mahara Kesh, was built deep under the ocean's surface. The continent of Talss was where most of the Tho Yor had congregated. Above the Chasm, a vast canyon, Anil Kesh, the Temple of Science, was built. The Tho Yor above Anil Kesh orbits constantly. In the eastern continent of Talss, the temple of Vur Tepe was constructed along the mouth of an active volcano. It was in this temple where students constructed tools and weaponry. In the southern portion of Talss, the Temple of Knowledge, or Kaleth, was built. Elsewhere on Talss, the temple of Padawan Kesh was established. This temple housed the Je'daii Academy. Lastly, under the largest of the Tho Yor, the tower-temple of Akar Kesh, or Temple of Balance, was constructed.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Tho Yor were present for the entirety of the Je'daii Order, but their purpose was not known until the end of the Order's life. After much meditation, two purposes were found for the Tho Yor. Firstly, it was discovered that the symbol on the sides of the Tho Yor could be used to breach the Chaos Wall of the Chasm, which housed the Kwa Holocron and an infinity gate. After finding the Kwa Holocron, the Tho Yor's second purpose was found; to serve as a weapon via channeling large amounts of the Force into them. This was found out at a critical time of the Order's life, as they were being attacked by the Infinite Empire. This second purpose was shown to a Je'daii wanderer named Tasha Ryo. From the infinity gate's Gatekeeper, A'nang had shown the Je’daii how to weaponize the Tho Yor, using them to destroy multiple Rakatan ships after the Infinite Empire attacked.\n\n","meta":{"index":53,"author":"ForbiddenTankerBozo","name":"Tho Yor","release_year":2021}},"Katana Fleet":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Katana fleet, also known as the Dark Force, was a task force of two hundred Dreadnaught-class heavy cruisers launched by the Galactic Republic to restore its Navy’s power.

Five years after the Battle of Endor, Grand Admiral Thrawn of the Galactic Empire discovered the fleet's whereabouts, and the New Republic also joined the race to find the fleet. The Empire managed to acquire 178 of the ships before the Republic arrived.# Section 1\nIn the final years of the Galactic Republic, the Senate funded ambitious projects, including the Katana Fleet, which was completed in 46 BBY. These ships were equipped with experimental AT-PT walkers and were named after their flagship, the Katana. To reduce labor requirements, the fleet was modified with advanced slave circuitry, reducing the crew needed to operate each ship from over 16,000 to just about 2,200 members. Rendili StarDrive also redesigned the fleet’s interior and hull color, earning it the nickname “the Dark Force.” The Katana fleet marked a new era in military warship technology.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Katana fleet’s demonstration turned into a disaster when a hive virus infected the crew, which drove them insane and caused them to jump into hyperspace, taking the entire fleet with them. This incident embarrassed the military leaders who commissioned the fleet and contributed to the decentralization of automated ship functions. Efforts to salvage the fleet failed because of its random location in the galaxy. The Republic suspected Zeta Magnus, a genetic terrorist affiliated with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, as the culprit behind the virus. The fleet eventually became a legendary tale, and some doubted its existence.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Katana fleet was lost for nearly fifty-five years, until the smuggler Captain Hoffner and navigator Talon Karrde discovered it in 6 BBY.  They kept the fleet’s location a secret, eventually selling some ships to Garm Bel Iblis. By 6 ABY, the fleet’s value could shift the balance of power in the Galaxy. The fleet’s importance was used to draw away the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer, the Eviscerator, before the Second Battle of Borleias.\nIn 9 ABY, Grand Admiral Thrawn sought the fleet and acquired information from Hoffner. During the Battle of the Katana fleet, Thrawn obtained all the Dreadnaughts except for twenty-two. The New Republic got hold of those remaining ships, which were crewed using cloned soldiers produced quickly from Spaarti cloning cylinders.

One of the ship’s main features was its six Magnite Crystal Tractor Beam Array that was 10 times stronger than tractor beams equipped on Star Destroyers. The tractor beam array itself was a weapon and was able to tear the hulls of ships.# Section 1\nEventually, the Imperial Navy discovered project Starhawk and they tasked Admiral Rae Sloane with hunting down the location of project Starhawk. Admiral Rae eventually located the Starhawk vessel and destroyed it. But despite its destruction, the crew and engineers on the prototype escaped the ship’s destruction and later were sent to Chandrila to continue their work on the construction of more Starhawk-class battleships. \n\t\tThe vessel would carry on the New Republic as a part of the New Republic Defense Fleet. A Starhawk convoy would consist of several CR90 corvettes and GR-75 medium transports. The Starhawk would be one of the New Republic’s newer bigger ships that could match with an Imperial Star Destroyer. Starhawk would be equipped with multiple turbolaser batteries. The ship’s unique design allowed its tractor beam to be on the front, Starhawk was arrow-shaped. While in its prototype stage, Starhawk faced many battles that eventually led to its destruction on the moon of Galitan.\n\n","meta":{"index":34,"author":"TedMorningstar","name":"Starhawk","release_year":2021}},"VT-49 Decimator":{"content":"# Introduction\nVT-49 Decimator was seen to be either a symbol of pride and progression, or a show of destruction and doom, depending on which side of its laser cannons you were on.

Being the commander of this ship as a middle rank was seen as a stepping stone to command of a capital ship. Rodian hunters were also known to use the ship for their day to day outings for sport of survival. The creators of the Decimator were the leading ship manufacturers of the galaxy, Kurt Drive Yards. The company would sell the ship for the high pricing of 160,000 credits.# Section 1\nTo continue on the decimator’s features, the military Assault Ship could play the role of both reconnaissance and a force to protect the perimeter of Imperial fleets. The decimator’s interior included a navigation computer, a six-passenger seating, and minimum of two crewmen to operate the ship, allowing an optional two gunners system for a total of 10 souls on board at a time. The heavy ship even allowed for the capacity of up to 80 tons (75,000 Kg) for cargo and a month of consumables. The exterior of the Decimator is a force to be reckoned with.

Many turbolaser turrets equipped by the Lucrehulk battleship were designed for short point defense. Rather than being used for large capital ship battles, the Lucrehulk-class battleships were used for blockades and planetary invasions. The Lucrehulk battleships at maximum capacity could hold 50 landing crafts, 1500 vulture droids for defense, 1500 landing transports, and 6,000 battle tanks. This carrying capacity makes the Lucrehulk ideal for large planetary invasions. During the early years of the Clone Wars and during the Invasion of Naboo these ships served as central control ships that gave command and orders to ground mobilized battle droids. This later was removed, as this posed a serious weakness to the droid army.

The fighter carried at least six concussion missiles.# Section 1\nThe prototype for this fighter was introduced first during the first assault on Geonosis. After its success in the assault, the production rates were ramped up to aid in the rest of the Clone Wars. After the execution of Order-66, the Galactic Empire continued to use these starfighters.

The wagon was one of their many inventions that suited their small stature and was made from wood and rope which was abundant on their home planet. The Ewoks were a short, furry, and tribal race native to the Forest Moon of Endor. The Ewoks were quite territorial, often capturing trespassers no matter the size wielding spears. They were members of a polytheistic religion in which they praised multiple Gods, often connected to the forests in some way. Their species wasn’t as advanced as the normal species in the rest of the Galaxy, and they were isolated on their moon, having no connection with the rest of the Galaxy. The battlewagon was seldom used due to the peacefulness of their moon, but it was surprisingly deadly.# Section 1\nThe main weapon was a battering ram made out of a severed tree log in which inflicted mass damage to any attackers. Erpham Warrick, the greatest Ewok Warrior of all-time invented this, along with a plethora of other inventions. The wagon was controlled via four stone wheels, making it a far more sturdy vehicle. It also carried their spears and missiles which the Ewoks used. The Ewoks liked to trophy their feats by decorating skulls and bones of animals far greater than them on the wagon as to enforce intimidation. This wagon was the main offence that the Ewoks had during the Battle of Endor, in which they managed to take down battalions of stormtroopers and AT-STs during the battle, mounting the cockpits on the top of the wagon as to show that it managed to take down an Imperial walker. This entire wagon was held together via string, and quite feeble and susceptible to fire. Nonetheless, this was a dangerous weapon that the Ewoks had in their arsenal, and were not afraid to use it if needed.\n\n","meta":{"index":33,"author":"Pololemon","name":"The Ewok Battle Wagon","release_year":2021}},"Arkanian Legacy":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Arkanian Legacy, a large capital Ship, was the primary headquarters of The Adasca BioMechanical Corporation of Arkania, though mainly known as Adascorp to most individuals that interacted with the vessel.

With four light turbolaser batteries, along with twelve medium of the same type, the Arkanian Legacy’s firepower was almost unrivaled at the time of it’s commission into the Mandalorian War. The ship also contained an accompanying fleet of twenty-four Starfighters, and eight other various shuttles, excluding  Lord Arkoh Adasca’s personal fleet and various shuttles. The Arkanian Legacy also had a class 2 hyperdrive, containing a class 8 backup hyperdrive in cases of emergency retreats, or the primary hyperdrive becoming inoperable.The Arkanian Legacy could hold approximately ten thousand tons of cargo,  around one hundred thousand passengers, and almost two years worth of stored  consumables, including food and other various resources.\n\n# Section 2\nOriginally constructed during the Great Sith War by Aragaloh and his son Alok, the Arkanian Legacy was primarily used  to keep the headquarters of Adascorp quickly out of harm's way and generally protected from most slower, less mobile threats in the galaxy. Around 3963 years before the Battle of Yavin IV, the galaxy was engulfed in another large-scale conflict that would mold the course of it’s history; The Mandalorian Wars. Referring back to an idea held by his grandfather, Aragaloh, Arkoh Adasca had then plotted to use exogorths, a rare species of massive space slug, to create a profit and new standing stage for Adascorp on the galactic stage. With his plan almost underway, Arkoh had The  Mandalorians, Jedi Order and his own Adascorp warriors fighting on another, though two Jedi were able to see through the guise Arkoh had made. Sadly, the exogorths were still incredibly powerful, and eventually took the lives of most individuals involved in the conflict aboard the Arkanian Legacy. After the conflict had finally ended, the Galactic Republic declared the ship unable to be salvaged, and let it drift into contested space as the Mandalorian War was still occuring.\n\n# Section 3\nEventually, near the end of the Mandalorian War, a raiding party said to consist of mainly Mandalorians raided the Arkanian Legacy for what is documented to be the final time.

Developed by the famous Corellian Engineering Corporation, the YT-1300 was as ubiquitous to supply lines as Tie Fighters were to the Imperial Starfleet. It was beloved by pilots because its modular design made it easily customizable for a plethora of jobs, both legal and less-than-legal. Used by shady smugglers and honest freight captains alike, the YT-1300 became commonplace quickly after its introduction in 72 BBY. The YT-1300 freighter would see great demand even a century after its first models left the shipyards.# Section 1\nIntrepid owners of the saucer-shaped YT-1300 could remove and replace entire sections of the freighter to their hearts’ desires. While most YT-1300 possessed a cockpit on the right side of the hull, the modular craft could be modified to have the cockpit lie on the left side or even in the front between its two mandibles. Its two mandibles at the front of the craft could be used to haul external cargo pods, over even to tug containers larger than the YT-1300 itself. Some owners opted to upgrade the YT-1300’s standard armament with semi-legal alternatives.

It remained in service as a private and low-priority government fighter. The design was based off of the ARC-170 and would be the basis of the T-65 X-Wing starfighters. However, unlike both the ARC-170 and X-Wing, the craft did not have a hyperdrive until later models in its service life.# Section 1\nThe design was first constructed before the start of the Clone Wars for the Galactic Republic’s use. It was used by several different types of characters, such as a Bothan pilot by the name of Eelo Begraas around roughly in 31 BBY. Another notable individual is Nirama, who was a crime lord. He sponsored Z-95s as ships for racing on Eskaron and to provide armed transport. A year before the Clone Wars began, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi piloted a Z-95 that had been owned by Senator Rodd whilst on mission to Fondor. The clone Z-95 starfighter was born during the Clone Wars and was utilized by the Galactic Republic during several different campaigns against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, such as the campaign to take Umbara.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter the fall of the Galactic Republic and rise of the Galactic Empire, the Z-95 Headhunter changed hands to different parties other than the Galactic Empire who wanted a cheaper fighter. Instead it fell into the hands of pirates and underworld cartels. The Z-95 was very much out of date by the Galactic Civil War, but because of its resilience, it was still in use by a variety of different parties. The Rebel Alliance used the Z-95 as a trainer spacecraft and a close air support role. It was also used temporarily for an Alliance covert operation, by Bandit Squadron. Despite the fighter’s age and how obsolete it became because of advancements in spacecraft.\n\n# Section 3\nMany people of interest after the Galactic Civil War used the Z-95, such as Mara Jade who used a Z-95 that had been modified with a ion cannon instead of a concussion missile launcher. It was also equipped with hyperdrive technology, allowing the craft’s operational range to exceed its earlier counterparts. Another individual who used the Z-95 is Jaina Solo, who’s first ship was a Z-95. Jaden Korr also flew a Z-95, which was also equipped with a hyperdrive.

Though it is not entirely clear what the Magna-spike’s purpose was, it is surmised that it was used for one of two things. The first surmised use was as a magnetic spike that would attach to objects and physically latch on to them with spikes, thus interfering with the components of the vehicle and inhibiting a podracer’s ability to function normally. The second surmised use was as a magnet that interfered with repulsorlift technology when latched onto a podracer, making it spin out of control and crash.# Section 1\nThe Magna-spike’s only recorded instance of being used was by Sebulba, a notorious Podracer who was the champion of the Mos Espa Grand Arena, and was particularly adored for his race during the Boonta Eve Classic, until he was upstaged by Anakin Skywalker.\n\nSebulba was a male Dug who originated from the planet Malastare. Dugs were creatures bearing some semblance to a monkey, yet their skin was rather dehydrated and they had long snouts. The Dugs also walked using their arms. Sebulba used Magna-spikes on his podracer.\n\nSebulba’s podracer was a massive, orange podracer, notable for its enormous Plug-F-Mammoth Split-X Turbojet engines, which were engines developed by Collor Pondrat. These engines were some of the fastest podracing engines conceivable, yet they were also extremely fragile and unstable. These engines were fast due to their use of chem-boosting, which was essentially the usage of certain chemicals or minerals to boost an engine’s performance. Sebulba’s enormous success stemmed largely from this podracer, as it was illegally modified in many ways.\n\nFirstly, the engines of the podracer were modified with tradium, which was pressurized with quold runium, and finally, injected with ionized injectrine. These volatile chemicals gave the podracer a distinct rumbling sound as it blasted down the track at incredible speeds.\n\nThe podracer also utilized weapons. The most notable of these was the flamethrower, a device that shot liquid, usually some sort of gas, and then used a small flame to produce a continuous stream of fire. This made him incredibly powerful as he could set any podracer aflame when he was within a cave. Sebulba’s podracer had modifications such as nail shooters and buzz saws, which he used to become a significant threat to any other racer on the track. Finally, Sebulba also made use of Magna-spikes on his podracer, increasing his level of threat further.\nTo conclude, Magna-spikes were a weapon modification, usually to podracers, that could interfere in some way with other Podracers.\n\n","meta":{"index":58,"author":"WhoopeyNight","name":"Magna-spike","release_year":2021}},"Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing Starfighter":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe alpha-3 nimbus-class v-wing starfighter was a light interceptor that was used by the Galactic Republic in the Clone Wars.

The Star Forge was made so that Capital ships could move in and out very easily, as for many of the fighter crafts, they could dock using the bays located on the fins. The fins of The Star Forge could extend downwards allowing The Star Forge to draw matter from the star of the Rakata system, using it to produce weapons and armament.# Section 1\nThe Star Forge would not be made possible without the work of the slaves, because of the cruelness and savageness of the species.

These five zones are introduced as the trainee learns Shii-Cho. Each of the five target locations has a corresponding strike and block in Shii-Cho.# Section 1\nThe first of the zones covers the head, and hitting this zone involves the attacker doing a downward strike down the middle of the defender's head. To defend against a zone one attack, the defender must raise their lightsaber above their head and angle the blade down. Some expert practitioners can turn a zone one defence into a downward attack on zone two or three.\n\n# Section 2\nThe second zone is the upper half of the right side of the defender's body, with the third being the upper left. Attacks against zones two and three were commonly diagonal strikes through the zone. Interestingly a zone two attack can be parried by a zone three attack and vice versa. Defending zones two and three are important as they are the zones where most humanoid species keep essential organs, such as the heart and lungs. Failure to protect zones two and three can also lead to loss of limbs, primarily the weapon arm in zone two. Zone two and three attacks can also be parried by an upward stroke through zone five and six. With zone six parrying zone two and zone five parrying zone three.\n\n# Section 3\nZone four covers the back of the body as well as the midsection. Hitting the back of a defender is quite tricky, but a successful hit will almost guarantee a killing blow. Zones two to five all intersect zone four. Most attacks against zone four are horizontal strikes across the defender's body. There are two ways to defend against a zone four strike. The first and hold the hilt over your head or shoulder with one or two hands extending the blade down behind you. The other is more awkward, it involves having the blade in one hand behind the waist and extending the blade upwards.\n\n# Section 4\nZones five and six cover the legs of the defender. Zone 5 is the right leg, with zone 6 being the left leg. Attacks to zones five and six can be difficult to block as they can be pretty low. But an attack on the opposite zone will be effective. However, the best defence to a low strike on zones five or six is by jumping and attacking high on the attacker while their weapon is low.\n\n","meta":{"index":10,"author":"Kaede_Vermillion","name":"Body Target Zones","release_year":2021}},"Teräs Käsi":{"content":"# Introduction\nTeräs Käsi arose from the world of Bunduki inside a star cluster that was named Pacanth Reach.

The weapon has been used throughout galactic history, from the Begali Uprising to the Clone Wars and beyond.# Section 1\nThe Force pike was first introduced during the Begali Uprising, where it was used by the Sith assassins to hunt Jedi. Its design was perfect for this purpose, as it was powerful enough to withstand the blow of a lightsaber. Later, Atris's Echani handmaidens used it as a weapon of choice. The Sith Lords also used it during their training exercises, such as the one Darth Plagueis and Darth Sidious undertook on Kursid.\n\n# Section 2\nOne of the most famous users of the Force pike were the Emperor's Royal Guards. They mainly used the weapon as a ceremonial weapon, but it was also useful for torture and crowd control. The SoroSuub Corporation Controller FP model was their preferred weapon, but other models were also used by planetary militias and police forces. The weapon was perfect for keeping people away from important figures, as its meter-long pole allowed it to be operated in small hallways.\n\n\nDuring the beginning of the Galactic Civil War, Imperial stormtroopers also used the Force pike as a weapon instead of the E-11 blaster rifle. Admiral Terrinald Screed and Admiral Kazz's forces used it extensively.

It teaches the basics of handling a lightsaber in combat: (i) attacking - an action to strike and hit an opponent; (ii) blocking - a move or pose to defend incoming attacks; and (iii) parrying - a way to attack the opponent by means of countering, a combination of attacking and blocking.# Section 1\nShii-Cho primarily relies on utilizing the Force to sense incoming attacks. The first training conducted for students is the blast-deflect training. The training had a small droid called a training remote, which were used to shoot sting beams. These beams were used as a tool to deflect blaster bolts using their lightsaber. Students were required to be blindfolded, forcing them to trust their instincts and rely on the Force. The next training was run using velocities. Velocities are a quick series of attacks and parries to an opponent until one gets hit or concedes by calling “Solah!” These training sessions were conducted once every day.\n\n# Section 2\nThe methods of combat in this form are separated in two: The Ideal-Form and the Live Combat Form. The Ideal-Form utilizes horizontal and vertical angles, together with the basic moves that are perpendicular to each other. The Combat Form is mainly focused on speed; with attacks mainly angled diagonally when hitting the target zones. This was considered more functional than the Ideal-Form.\n\n# Section 3\nWhen engaging an opponent, there are specific target zones tailored for the form and are numbered as [1] head, [2] right arm, [3] left arm, [4] back, [5]right leg, [6] left leg.  It is designed to avoid injuring the opponent but rather disarm them. These target zones are not only designed for a humanoid body but also in other types such as spherical or segmented.\n\n# Section 4\nOther techniques were inspired by Sun djem–an attack that is specifically used to destroy the opponent’s weapon. The Disarming Slash is a series of attacks aimed to disarm the enemy, and the Sarlacc Sweep is a sweeping attack meant to hit multiple opponents.\n\n# Section 5\nAlthough every Jedi was expected to have full mastery of this form, there were others who were exceptional such as Kit Fisto, Cin Drallig, Luke Skywalker, and Yoda.\n\n","meta":{"index":4,"author":"kurtnicolo","name":"Shii-Cho","release_year":2021}},"Sokan":{"content":"# Introduction\nSokan is a principle of lightsaber combat that focuses on using the local terrain for tactical advantage.

Much like the lightsaber, many variants existed including the vibro double blade and vibrosword. During the Old Republic era, Jedi Padawans and Sith Acolytes often trained with such weapons before progressing to lightsabers, and the amnestic Darth Revan was known to have wielded such a weapon before constructing his second saber.

This can be done in a defensive manner, where one saber is used as an offensive tool and the other is used to defend the body from strikes. It can also be used purely offensively, using two blades in a constant onslaught of strikes to one’s opponents.# Section 1\nThe technique required both hands if the practitioner was bimanual - using both hands to hold either lightsaber. This can be both a strength and weakness, as practitioners could not then use two hands in an effort for a more powerful strike, however having two lightsabers could easily overwhelm less experienced duelists who would have a hard time tracing the movements of both lightsabers in a duel.\n\n# Section 2\nThe use of two blades can be traced in history to its origins, created by the Yovshin Swordsmen where the first Jar’Kai sabers were constructed - sabers that were designed to be wielded as pairs. Similarly, Niman was a dual-bladed combat style, created by the Royale Macheteros for the triumvirate of the Kashi deities. Both forms predated the use of lightsabers and its lightsaber forms. These styles would later be adopted by the Legions of Lettow, and practitioners could be seen across the First Great Schism. Upon the defeat of the Lettow, Niman was later refined to the sixth Lightsaber Form, and Jar’Kai became a blanket term to describe combat that utilized two lightsabers.\n\n# Section 3\nNotable practitioners may include Ahsoka Tano, Padawan of the Jedi Order. She used a single traditional lightsaber, alongside the aid of a lightsaber shoto - a traditional lightsaber that was considerably shorter in length. Her traditional single saber was used for offensive strikes, such as jabs, swings and other offenses. The shoto was primarily used for blocking, parrying and defensive maneuvers. Her mastery of Jar’Kai was impressive when compared to Masters who could not or had only just begun this accomplishment.\n\n# Section 4\nAnother example of a Jar’Kai practitioner would be the dark-sided Asajj Ventress. An extra blade can considerably increase a user’s defense, which Ventress displayed nicely in her mission to Ruul where she defended herself against 3 Jedi opponents at once. Asajj would also opt for a more offensive approach, using both lightsabers for several duels in order to overwhelm the opponent with a continuous onslaught that allowed no opening, with the ability to become more defensive if it was required.\n\n","meta":{"index":1,"author":"mo_ooth","name":"Jar'Kai","release_year":2020}},"Lightsaber Crystal":{"content":"# Introduction\nLiving crystals, because that’s what they were called, although some used the name Kyber. Incredible and extremely rare, of course, applicable to Jedi and Sith weapons. The journey to the Crystal Caves of Ilum,  is one of the many tasks of the Jedi Initiates and required a lot of courage and dedication as finding Kyber Crystals wasn’t an easy task. Although locating a planet where crystals could be found was quite easy, the actual search was extremely difficult.  Crystals also existed in larger forms, and if legends are to be believed, the largest and most powerful of them were used in the mysterious and deadly weapons of the Sith.# Section 1\nKyber crystals were somehow sensitive to the Force and resonated with it. A Jedi could have communicated with the Crystal by sensing collective consciousness or something like a strange presence. Although the stone itself could not speak in the traditional sense, it was able to establish a kind of contact. Kyber consists of organic and inorganic materials. They remained stable at temperatures and pressure comparable to the pressure and temperature of the core of the star. They were resistant to fire and physical storms, to some extent, of course. Each of them had an original, sophisticated pattern, and as with the fingerprints of a human being, one could identify a certain crystal by them. The stone was also able to withstand the destruction of the lightsaber. Kyber did not give off heat and reacted only to animated matter. The crystals grow slowly and in a certain arrangement that they reach without having a specific lifespan or size. Some are as big as the grains of sand on Tatooine, and others can be bigger than humans. However, they are all equally present in the Force. Real crystals were the only ones found in the kyberite deposits. The stone must not be contaminated in any way, if this is the case, it will be impossible to contact it. The crystals themselves could accumulate vast amounts of energy and give much more. There were recorded attempts of creating synthetic crystals, however, all of them failed as crystals were too unstable to be used.\n\n# Section 2\nEach Jedi had to choose a crystal that spoke to them and matched their character. The Jedi heard from the crystal a kind of music or sound that symbolized harmony for him. In the beginning, all crystals are colorless, similar to glass. It was only after connecting to the Jedi that the Crystal received a certain color. In most cases it was blue or green, but there were cases of other colors. The color corresponds to the nature, character, and connection with the Force of each Jedi.  The more unconventional and complex the owner’s character, the greater the chance of getting a different color. All crystals were naturally associated with the light side of the Force and reflected all the influences of the dark side. However, the Sith found a way to bleed the crystal to give it a red color. They poured in all their pain and hatred until the crystal gave up and distorted. Such twisted stones could be cured, but it was extremely rare. Ahsoka Tano was one of the few, who successfully healed the crystal. In addition, the process itself could lead to the destruction of the crystal which is why most of the Jedi avoided such attempts. The crystal protected itself from the unwanted owner, giving him extreme headaches and crazy thoughts. The Jedi has developed and expanded the crystal cutting to minimize the waste of energy and ensure the crystal could store the optimal amount of power.\n\n","meta":{"index":18,"author":"JaroCycle","name":"Lightsaber Crystal","release_year":2021}},"Trispzest":{"content":"# Introduction\nTrispzest was a lightsaber combat form derived from Juyo or Form VII as well as elements from traditional S’kytri aerial combat, it was invented and developed by a Force-sensitive Majestrix native of Skye, Kharys.

It heavily implemented the use of Sai-Cha, or decapitation with a lightsaber as a quick means of killing an opponent. Another technique, specifically utilized by Maw, was a spinning attack utilizing sporadic, wild attacks in the air effective in killing large swathes of enemies.

Professionals of this style rely on using acrobatics on their attacks, this must be also fast paced to confuse the opponent. Through this, it is known as an aggressive fighting style. Practitioners of Ataru have the ability to attack from all directions resulting in the opponent being disorientated from combat. \n\nThe Force plays a big part in guiding the attacks and movements of Ataru Practitioners. This form had three types of rotations that were used in combat these were spinning, somersaults, and cartwheels these were a part of the acrobatics aspect. Many practitioners had to flee from battle through the failures of many attacks. Ataru requires space in order to successfully use this form, this is due to the acrobatics of this form.\n\n# Section 2\nForm IV dates back to the Mandalorian Wars where Yoda gave a demonstration on this style and this is now recorded and kept in the Jedi Temple. Ataru was mastered to the highest potential by Yoda, this could be seen in all the battles Yoda has been a part of. Dooku was known for being able to counter Ataru through the use of Form II or Makashi. \n\nOn planet Coruscant and planet Kashyyyk, Yoda appeared to apply this form to fight clone troopers. Ataru has weaknesses in blocking blaster fires and several other opponents. Even though Ataru has deficiencies, Yoda was still able to combat clone troopers. Ataru couldn’t be used for lengthy battles as this may cause fatigue which was what happened to Qui-Gon Jinn on planet Naboo.

These quillons were on opposite sides of the hilt. They projected two small blades, which were tributaries of the main blade. They were created using an array of activators to separate energy from the crystal inside. Emitter shrouds were used to protect the wielder’s hands from any possible injury from these small blades.\n\nSection I\n\tThe Crossguard was an ancient blade design. The Crossguard was commonly used by Makashi users. When the Sith were powerful and plentiful, a sith known as Darth Atrius owned a pair of Crossguards. Full of the Sith Lords’ rage, the sabers survived long after the defeat of Atrius. Due to being full of his Anger, the blades were capable of driving anyone who wielded them insane with anger. They were eventually destroyed by Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker during the Imperial Era.\n\tJedi Master Stellan Gios owned an odd form of Crossguard. This was during the High Republic Era. It was different than most due to the physical Crossguard being retractable. When the blade was designated, the arms would fold up. When ignited, the arms would fold out to support the quillon beams. This provided an additional layer of hand protection. \n\tDuring the Galactic Civil War, a young Jedi by the name of Ezra Bridger found an ancient green-bladed Crossguard. He found this while on Malachor. When he ignited the blade, it almost instantly broke and deactivated itself. Later, Kylo Ren built his own Crossblade. It was unstable due to the usage of a cracked crystal. At the end of his time as a Knight of Ren, he flung his blade into the sea on Kef Bir. This was a sign of rejection of his commitment to the Dark Side.\n\nVariations\n\tThe first variation is the Forked Lightsaber. This variation of the Crossguard had only one smaller blade. This saber was utilized by Jedi Master Roblio Darte, whose saber had two blue blades. With only a single secondary blade, the smaller emitter was at a 45-degree angle from the main blade. Another known wielder of this variation is a Jedi of the Gran species. The next variation is the Vented Lightsaber. This variant emitted three blades, a primary one and two smaller ones on the side. During the war against Zakuul Jedi Master Dazh Ranos used two of these blades.  This type of Crossguard was commonly used by Makashi Duelists. Similar sabers were used by a group of Nightsisters during the Clone Wars. A very well-known user of this form is Kylo Ren. The third variation of the Crossguard is the Vented Dualsaber. This variant had four blades in total. It was a double-bladed saber with small power vents forming blades on its sides.","meta":{"index":19,"author":"Shad0wSeer","name":"Crossguard","release_year":2021}},"Vaapad":{"content":"# Introduction\nSometime during the later days under the Galactic Republic's reign, Master of The Order Mace Windu alongside Master Sara Bulq would engineer a new form of lightsaber combat. This form of lightsaber combat became known as \"Vaapad\" which was the second variant of form seven. Regardless of it being more known as a form of combat, the form itself was a \"State of Mind\" as well. This was due to the form channeling one's inner darkness into a specific engagement and redirecting their opponent's fury. This state of mind would allow it to be applicable within hand-to-hand combat as well as in lightsaber confrontations.# Section 1\nCommonly referred to as \"The Ferocity Form\", it was known to be practiced by both Jedi and Sith alike. Although, the original name of the form came from a native creature on the planet of Sarapin which was named both Juyo and Vaapad by the locals. This creature was known for utilizing various attacks that were almost seemingly invisible to its prey. This was a major reason why the form was named after the creature as Vapaad. It was noted to create a weave of near-invisible energy. The form would also require the practitioner to use bold and direct movements in rapid succession which were heavily unpredictable. These maneuvers would flow into each other with precision, that of liquid. Due to this, it made the wielder appear as if they were wielding a plethora of lightsabers at once allowing the practitioner to easily throw off an opponent. Lastly, this form would also require much more Force energy from a user as it required much more emotional concentration. This extensive Force energy would cause the wielder to undergo exponential internal pressure when using the form.\n\n# Section 2\nJust like any other form of lightsaber combat, the moves that the form utilized could be practiced. Although, a practitioner would not be using the full extent of the form until they permitted the excitement and passion of battle to take over, which often disarrayed these sequences. Although, when a user of the form allows for this passion to take over the movements of the form would become much more unpredictable or paradoxical. Nevertheless, allowing the form to take over one's actions would also lead them closer to the dark side of the Force. Hence why information regarding the form would later become heavily restricted. Mace Windu would later completely restrict the usage of the form without his permission. The only known Jedi that Windu would ever go on to grant the knowledge of this form was Depa Billada.\n\n","meta":{"index":17,"author":"cxcthelit","name":"Vaapad","release_year":2021}},"Double-Bladed Lightsaber":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe renowned double-bladed lightsaber, known by the names of saberstaff, lightsaber lance, doublesaber, dualsaber, and lightstaff, was a modified specialization of the traditional lightsaber, with variations in hilt length being predominant and of course it’s twin emitting blades. Its origins are traced to those of Zabrak origin, with a popularised quarterstaff known as a zhaboka. In its essence, it was a single hilt with two blades allowing for a more amplified style of combat.# Section 1\nIt was first invented by the Sith, under the Dark Lords of the Old Sith Empire as observed from its Zabrak origins, it was often very sophisticated with it’s two sets of emitters and a particularly long hilt as in most designs. One such very notable example of this is the lightsaber of Exar Kun, originally a single-blade lightsaber which was then transformed by Exar Kun upon discovering the schematics of the design within a Sith Holocron.  In later years, the original design of the doublesaber would be slowly shifted into its more adherent form with a simplified single mechanism yet a larger hilt. Some doublesaber designs had much more simplicity, being two individual crystals within the same hilt; simply two lightsabers in one.\n\n# Section 2\nThe very nature of the double-bladed lightsaber made it difficult to utilize without strict discipline and accurate footwork as in accordance with the twin blades, with the user only being allowed to attack diagonally or vertically. Many who would utilize the doublesaber would meet their fate at the hands of their own, accidentally decapitating or stabbing themselves. But its wonder lies in its rapidly fast swings, able to provide twice the damage and more openings to attack the enemy from. Its defensiveness was also impeccable with two blades and a longer hilt, allowing for more surface area for parries and deflections to defend themselves from.\n\n# Section 3\nIn the more recent history of the Jedi Order, the use of the doublesaber would fall into obscurity, with its most popular surge being at the height of the Sith Wars with notable individuals such as Grandmaster Satele Shan, and the Sith lord Darth Thanaton. In the essence of the double-bladed lightsaber being a weapon to kill more effectively and excruciatingly, the Order would frown upon its use, seeing the lightsaber as a means to defend. In this measure, there was no true rule forbidding its use. But masters and most knights of the Order refrained and even discouraged their students from constructing such a weapon. Only a portion of popularity remained of it with the Jedi Consulars and fringe groups of the Order.\n\n","meta":{"index":20,"author":"AeristicHistoria","name":"Double-Bladed Lightsaber","release_year":2021}},"Mou Kei":{"content":"# Introduction\nMou Kei was often called the most brutal Mark of Contact when referring to lightsaber combat. Mou Kei was a fighting technique that allowed its user to successfully target and dismember several limbs of their opponents with just using a single strike; this allowed this lightsaber combat to be brutal and dangerous. If used in a correct situation, one Mou Kei attack could finish the fight and disable the opponent from taking any offensive actions against the Mou Kei’s user.# Section 1\nThe nine Marks of Contact were one of the most important principles of lightsaber combat taught in the Jedi Order. Even though every Mark directed the learner’s attention to a different technique of wounding the opponent, the main potential of these movements lay in targeting smaller areas of the user’s body and maximising one’s defensive and offensive potential in these sections. Mou Kei was considered the most violent Mark, as it relied on cutting off more than one major limb of the opponent, often in a singular chain of quick, circular lightsaber strikes.\n\n# Section 2\nBecause of its brutality, Mou Kei became one of the favourite Sith combat techniques, which would not only defeat the prey but also disable their body from functioning properly for the majority of their life. The Jedi, on the other hand, feared Mou Kei and only a handful of Masters were able to fully master it. The most famous usage of Mou Kei was undoubtedly the duel between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi on Mustafar, during which Master Kenobi utilised it to counter Vader’s aggressive leap and succeeded by taking Vader’s both legs and one arm with this strike.\n\n","meta":{"index":30,"author":"abc_5329","name":"Mou Kei","release_year":2021}},"Makashi":{"content":"# Introduction\nMakashi was the second of the seven forms of lightsaber combat that were used.

One of the bad sides of using Soresu is that the form is lacking offensive capabilities, which was heavily criticized.# Section 1\nSoresu, Form Three, the Way of the Mynock; also known as the Resilience Form is the most effective defensive form of all the saber forms. Practitioners of this form were using tight moves, efficient parries, and subtle dodges, trying to provide the maximum defense. For the longer battles, a Soresu user was able to have the upper hand in the duel, because of the ability to observe the opponent and to learn how their combat style was, because of this, the Soresu practitioner could choose to kill, disarm or just use Form Zero on their opponent. Not that practitioners of other forms could not do this, but Soresu users are the best at this.\n\n# Section 2\nThe key to ultimately mastering Soresu seems to come from grasping the concept and philosophy of Form Three, rather than adhering to the form's tactics and maneuvers. If a Form Three practitioner had to duel individual shooters, then the Form Three practitioners were encouraged to use the deflecting slash. The deflecting slash allowed the Jedi using Form Three to come closer to their opponent and deflect the projectile into a slashing attack. If a Form Three practitioner had to duel multiple shooters, then the Form Three practitioners were encouraged to use the circle of shelter. This technique allowed the Jedi to hold off multiple projectiles by dropping into a moving mediation. The goal of most of the Soresu practitioners was to prolong the duel, waiting until the opponent gets frustrated and exhausted as they try to keep up their offense.\n\n# Section 3\nLuminara Unduli once said, \"The road is long, but it is worth the journey, for a true master of Form Three is invincible.\" Even though Form Three was created to combat blaster shooters, it did exist for thousands of years. Almost millennia after the creation of Form Three, Soresu was mastered by the Jedi Battlemaster Cin Drallig, not only Jedi Battlemaster Cin Drallig, but also Grand Master Yoda and Swordmaster Mace Windu were Form Three practitioners. Even towards the end of the Clone Wars, Soresu was the most common lightsaber form used in the Jedi Order. But of course, a populair practitioner was Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, during the Clone Wars, Obi-Wan Kenobi was one of the highest masters of Soresu.\n\n","meta":{"index":12,"author":"A1dok4","name":"Soresu","release_year":2021}},"Lightwhip":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Lightwhip, or ‘energy whip,’ is a variation of the traditional lightsaber which made use of the same basic principles. However, the lightwhip differs in its construction, opting for multiple crystals, a far longer blade, and no cell barriers to keep the weapon on a straightened path. Most whips only make use of a single blade, as the skill required to operate without maiming the user is significantly higher than other forms of lightsaber - however it was not unheard of for lightwhips to contain multiple blades.# Section 1\nThe whip’s mechanics and style are wholly unfamiliar to most combatants in the galaxy, and therefore it is able to gain significant advantage over opponents who lack the skill to understand it. The range of the whip is its secondary advantage apart from flexibility, and allows for strikes from a distance of multiple meters and nearly infinite angles. This flexibility of attack allows the whip to dodge and weave through parries of all but the most skilled warriors, and is especially deadly against lightly armored and unsuspecting opponents.\n\n# Section 2\nThe whip is not without significant drawbacks, however, as unless the wielder is sufficiently practiced with a regular whip, this weapon was all but impossible to control, able to easily maim its wielder as well as opponent. The whip also needs to be swung in a large, wide sweep in order to gain sufficient momentum to deal more than superficial damage. The blade cannot easily penetrate many standard issue armor materials or even walls, and is almost completely vulnerable to close quarters assault. If an opponent recognizes this and closes the distance, the wielder of a lightwhip is almost certainly defeated. Jar’kai is essentially a perfect counter to the whip, allowing the whip to wrap around one blade while attacking with the freed hand.\n\n","meta":{"index":26,"author":"WeaponizedStoners","name":"Lightwhip","release_year":2021}},"Vibro Saber":{"content":"# Introduction\nA Vibro Saber is a type of weapon that utilized high-speed sonic vibrations making each cutting stroke and slash more deadly for the opponent; with the melee repercussions of the attack being very dangerous. The matter on how is by the use of cortosis, a lightsaber-resistant material capable of shortening a lightsaber if it ever comes into contact. Due to this, the weapon itself and those like it can be very devastating.\n\n\tThe Saber utilized a vibro-generator found in the hilt, which would send out high-frequency sonic pulses that can cause anything attached or that come into contact with the blade to be sent into a shocking and quick vibration. Particularly, if the blade comes into contact with organic tissue or flesh, the vibrations would cause tremendous damage due to the rippling effect within the material, causing tremendous pain for the target. This makes it very lethal compared to blades without a vibro-generator, and can bring even the smallest cut into a gaping wound. It could penetrate even the strongest of armor with a more focused and upgraded vibrator cell.\n\n\tWith this, most Vibro Sabers have a cortosis-weave, implemented only in some vibroweapons but allows for the Saber to successfully block lightsaber blows directly, although reducing its strength as an overall alloy and would allow for less blunt blows. Vibroweapons have gained an infamous reputation as the primary choice for criminals and lawbreakers, being illegal in most ‘civilised’ worlds. Although in others such as the worlds in Hutt Space, this weapon would be the norm for self defense or provocative measures.","meta":{"index":28,"author":"AeristicHistoria","name":"Vibro Saber","release_year":2021}},"Tràkata":{"content":"# Introduction\nTràkata is a rarely used form apart from the seven standard and well known forms. While dueling the user would swiftly dis-ignite the lightsaber then re-igniting again, giving them a variety of options to attack since the opponent is unable to react. This style of dueling was crafted by a Jedi Consular during the Old Republic. Controversially, it wasn’t used as much due to the dishonorable and dishonest form of combat it could be used for. Both the Jedi and Sith alike neglected Tràkata, using the main and most known forms instead.# Section 1\nThe Jedi would deem this a dirty trick and unhonest to the duel at hand, seeing as it mostly was used with deceiving the opponent and opening up their guard.  Claiming it was used with signs of weakness and lacking in power, the Sith would stray from this form of combat as well.\n\n\nSince Tràkata enforces much of a practical combat and deception in its use, neither side would use it commonly. When disigniting the saber, you give away the blade in which are the roots from both sides of the Force. Turning your main key in combat into a deceptive and manipulative tactic. This did not go hand in hand with either side's focus of combat, Sith being the raw strength and power it takes to overpower one's opponent. While the Jedi would be more patient and defensive, unlike the quick, deceptive practice Trakata used.\n\n# Section 2\nThere are many ways to use Tràkata as an advantage towards your opponent, such as disigniting with perfect timing and various feints. However when disigniting the blade, you lose a great deal of defense, meaning your next move must be quick and swift. Users would wait for the opponent to swing their saber with full force, allowing them to feint and hold their victim in place with very little time to react. There are three distinct and common techniques that go along with Trakata. \n\nThe first being a technique called, “Pass the Blade''. As the user swings, they would wait for their opponent to raise their block. Then disignite the saber, by passing through their defense before reigniting and striking successfully on the now defenseless opponent. \n\nThe second technique being, “Unbalancing Block''. The user would wait until the opponent collided blades against one another, before dis-igniting and letting the opponent stumble from the force they had just put into their own attack. Allowing the user to attack a now stumbled and open opponent. \n\nThe third and final technique, “Flash Slash”.\nIt was a quick strike that required letting the blade reach full length before deactivating. This wouldn’t allow the opponent to block and as soon as the user got past their defense they would reignite again. Slashing the opponent in one swift motion.\n\n","meta":{"index":15,"author":"InsaneLies","name":"Tràkata","release_year":2021}},"Ready Stances":{"content":"# Introduction\nEach lightsaber form had its own unique start-up and ready stances. However, some of them were standardized across all lightsaber combat. The known ready stances were Jedi ready, defensive neutral, offensive neutral, and center of being.# Section 1\nThe first was Jedi ready, which was the most common stance amongst all Jedi. This stance had a lot of similarities with the Ataru guard. When using this form the dominant foot was held back and the blade was held in a vertical parry position. Next was defensive neutral, the differences between this stance and Jedi ready were little to none. The blade would still be held in a parry position, but the user’s feet would be evenly spaced.\n\n# Section 2\nThe next known stance was offensive neutral, which has some similarities to defensive neutral. However, instead of parrying the blade would be pointed directly at the enemy. This stance was intended to give a smaller time frame that the blade is visible. Thus preventing the enemy from being able to track and target the user’s moves. Lastly, there was a center of being, which could also be used for meditation. This stance was used by members of the Old Jedi Order and they did so by holding the saber horizontally with the hilt just below their chin.\n\n","meta":{"index":13,"author":"ElysiaLValkyrie","name":"Ready Stances","release_year":2021}},"Lightfoil":{"content":"# Introduction\nCreated by the Sith of the Mecrosa Order, the lightfoil were exquisite weapons equivalent in quality to Jedi lightsabers. The technology behind lightfoils extended beyond the Sith and became a favored weapon among certain Tapani nobility.# Section 1\nThe lightfoil can be traced back to the Mecrosa Order, a clandestine Sith organization that existed before the Great Sith War. They are thought to have created the first lightfoils in secret, employing technology comparable to that of the Jedi Order. These weapons were equal to Jedi lightsabers and were designed to be wielded in the Makashi technique with one hand. Because of their small and finely crafted handles, they were ideal for this function.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Sith influence on the Tapani sector decreased following the Cleansing of the Nine Houses, leading to the development of less potent \"modern\" lightfoils. These weapons were favored amongst select nobility, who would pay exorbitant prices to obtain them. These post-Cleansing lightfoils, however, were weaker than genuine or \"archaic\" lightfoils because of the poor quality focusing crystals utilized in their construction and the comparatively low degree of expertise of the crafters of modern lightfoils, in comparison to Jedi artisans.\n\n# Section 3\nThe lightfoil was created for exquisite, one-handed combat in the Makashi style, which places an emphasis on precision and grace. Because of its lightweight and balanced construction, it was an ideal weapon for this purpose. Yet because of its smaller size and weaker blade, it was not as effective in combat as a lightsaber. Proficient lightfoil users, however, could still employ the weapon to lethal effect.\n\n","meta":{"index":32,"author":"DioneSenko","name":"Lightfoil","release_year":2021}},"Bifurcating Cyclical-ignition Pulse":{"content":"# Introduction\nBifurcating cyclical-ignition pulse was a common lightsaber modification, designed to allow the blade to function underwater or in the presence of other similar liquids. The modification was more commonly known as waterproof casing because of this.# Section 1\nWhile the Lightsaber is one of the most advanced pieces of technology in the galaxy, it is not excused from the laws of physics. When exposed to water, the saber’s circuitry would short out and overload, requiring some maintenance and repairs. The workaround for this was to use two kyber crystals that are rapidly switched between, allowing the blade to function. For clarification, water would not be able to enter the saber from the emitter as the blade boils all water surrounding it, insulating the circuit in this scenario. Alongside this, the secondary focusing crystals would act as another layer of protection\n\n# Section 2\nOriginally invented for their saber by the ancient Jedi, knowledge of bifurcating cyclical-ignition pulse technology was lost to time due to war or a force-sensitive purge. It was only discovered millennia later by Jedi Master Kit Fisto, who re-discovered it and popularised it. This gave him a great advantage against his opponents as he was mainly deployed to aquatic environments due to his species’ amphibious nature. By the time of the clone wars, most Jedi were fighting in wet or aquatic environments which resulted in many adopting the modification. Finally, by the time of the Jedi Order’s revival after the Fall of the Empire, bifurcating cyclical ignition had become standard in all lightsabers.\n\n","meta":{"index":14,"author":"MechanicaAlfire","name":"Bifurcating Cyclical-ignition Pulse","release_year":2021}},"Unarmed Combat":{"content":"# Introduction\nUnarmed combat is a fighting style where no weapons are used. It is also known as hand-to-hand combat or just martial arts. A lot of species used this form of combat, and a small number of species developed the combat into another form of martial arts. When an individual practiced unarmed combat, then they would be called a martial artist, if the individual would be an expert in unarmed combat, then they would be known as a martial arts master.# Section 1\nEchani martial art, it was known to be practiced by military special forces, they were not the only ones who used it. The Jedi used the Echani martial arts as well but then in lightsaber combat. Some organizations created their own form of unarmed combat, such as the Followers of Palawa.\n\n# Section 2\nIn technically advanced civilizations, soldiers trained in unarmed combat to counter technology such as personal energy shields. Soldiers were required to learn this because it was useful with blaster deflection with personal energy shields. People who were a lot involved with war, like Mandalorians, trained in a lot of combat styles, including unarmed combat. They were also known to create their own shields against physical attacks.\n\n","meta":{"index":9,"author":"AimTheKinge","name":"Unarmed Combat","release_year":2021}},"Lightsaber Shoto":{"content":"# Introduction\nColloquially known as ‘light daggers,’ Lightsaber Shotos were yet another variant of the standard lightsaber design. The Shoto was a smaller, more ergonomic version of the classic lightsaber, its blade extending a maximum of approximately half a meter, with a narrower and less bulky grip. Being just a smaller version of the standard configuration, Shotos weren’t that hard to make and so during times of war, it was relatively easy for a Jedi to create one. That being said, there is no mainstream combat form which utilises the Shoto, and so it was extremely hard to learn it or find a Master to teach it.# Section 1\nShotos were originally conceived during the Old Sith Wars (4000 BBY - 3950 BBY) by Force-sensitive duelists who sought to recreate a smaller offhand weapon, useful for parrying and countering. The introduction of the Shoto allowed for lightsaber duelists to attack with their primary sabre while keeping the Shoto in a defensive guard which greatly increased a duelist's protection. Alternatively, a Shoto allowed a user to simultaneously attack with both blades, allowing for a furious onslaught of strikes, great when used in conjunction with Form Four. Though not created for this explicit purpose, Shotos were widely adopted by Force Sensitives of a smaller physical stature as their primary weapons, such as in the case of Master Yaddle or Master Yoda since it better complimented their physical limitations.\n\n# Section 2\nJar-Kai - As described previously, in this technique, the Shoto is held in the off-hand, allowing the user to block and deflect enemy strikes while riposting with the main sabre. Alternatively, two Shotos could be used in conjunction with each other which limited the users' reach. However, this could be compensated for with training in Form Four lightsaber combat.\n\nGuard Shoto - This technique requires the fundamental changing of the Shotos construction in which the emitter and blade are at a perpendicular angle to the hilt. This weapon was excellent at blocking lightsaber attacks but allowed for very few offensive techniques. The sabres could be held in a reverse grip with the blade extending parallel to the forearm, which allowed the user to incorporate more hand to hand combat techniques including grappling and elbow strikes. This could then be combined with Jar-Kai, allowing a guard Shoto in both hands, deadly when used in combination with Form Three.\n\nThrowing - As mainly a sidearm, the Shoto could be thrown without entirely disarming one's self as there would always be a secondary sabre to back it up. With proper force techniques and extensive practice, a user could theoretically attack from two angles simultaneously, as seen in the case of the Dark Jedi Taron Malicos.\n\n# Section 3\nPerhaps the most notable and famous user of a Shoto is the Jedi Ashoka Tano, who utilised a Shoto in combination with Form Five. She used this primarily in an offensive style but could be seen to have mastered the defensive possibilities of the weapon, like when she defended herself from upwards of ten clone troopers who had surrounded her.\n\n","meta":{"index":25,"author":"MechanicaAlfire","name":"Lightsaber Shoto","release_year":2021}},"Shien and Djem So":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe fifth form of lightsaber combat was Djem So. However, this form had two variants, one being Djem So, and the other being Shien. This form was the “Perseverance Form” and it was commonly associated with the “Krayt Dragon.” The form's origins date back to the 3996 BBY era; this form had just started to be utilized within the Jedi and Sith.# Section 1\nThis form was most prominently based on form three, Soresu. Soresu was a very defensive form that focused on defense and waiting for the opportunity to strike from the opponent's mistakes. However, Jedi feared that this form could be too passive and lead to more lengthy duels. Djem So was created to be more offensive and overwhelming an opponent, resulting in the end of a duel as quickly as possible. In contrast, Shien was more focused on deflecting blaster shots and more defensive methods. Shien was the more defensive variant of the form, often relying on blaster bolt maneuverability and accuracy.\n\n# Section 2\nThe sub form of Shien focused on turning a defensive block into an offensive one by consistently deflecting bolts or lightsabers. A weakness of this form is the difficulty to duel other lightsaber wielders because Shien's is used explicitly for defense and blaster bolt deflection, with a minuscule amount of offensive advantages. However, if dual-wielded, this form was deadly against those equipped with sabers, and especially blaster users. Shien strengths against long range foes resulted in opponents who wielded a blaster could be easily forced into submission.\n\n# Section 3\nDjem So was a very aggressive and combative form. The form was to be used strongly, it required a high level of physical demand and energy. The style was focused on heavy lightsaber strikes with finesse speed.  The overall objective was to overwhelm an opponent by exhaustion or sheer strength by breaking the guard. In the Djem So stance, the user was less prone to lose defense as their offense would easily overcome any attack thrown from a foe. Those who used this form must be careful, it was usually disliked by the Jedi for its aggressive nature, it was stated to hold a dark side energy to it when used. Notable users of this form were: Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, and Kyle Katarn.\n\n","meta":{"index":16,"author":"Librarian's Assembly","name":"Shien and Djem So","release_year":2021}},"Lightsaber Pike":{"content":"# Introduction\nLightsaber Pikes, also known as Saberlances and Polesabers were known as a unique weapon type that resembled a spear, glaive or most standard pole-arms. These weapons utilized a shorter but thicker lightsaber blade to compensate for the weapon's immense size. Most often, these weapons were crafted using a lightsaber resistant material such as Cortosis, Phrik or Mandalorian Iron. Typically the pikes were constructed to be at shoulder length from pommel to emitter; but have been noted to stand at the full height of the weapon user.# Section 1\nDuring the time of the uprising of the Eternal Empire under Valkorion, the Knights of Zakuul utilized lightsaber pikes and a blaster reflective shield.

Is the threat real? This is an important lesson for the Jedi, as violence is never the answer. They were required to see if they could find a peaceful way out of the matter.

Only a few people wielded such a weapon like this, for it was not easy to make. Not only Jedi wielded the Sabercane, Sith Acolyte Haazen wielded the sneaky, powerful weapon as his main lightsaber. Haazen built it while he was still a Jedi but he was not permitted to wield one so he built the Sabercane in secret so the Jedi would not know that he had a lightsaber. Occasionally, he would train with it without letting the Jedi know.\n\nIt was a weapon used by the skilled and not the weak, for it was a very elegant type of weapon that if lost and found by Sith it would be very critical to the Jedi Order. A Jedi Master Tera Sinube’s sabercane had a hilt made out of wood from his home planet. Some Jedi or Sith would use the other part of the cane to block stuff while they dueled with the lightsaber part of the sabercane. The sabercane was very elegant and hard to wield so it was restricted to some people.

Dun Möch took place in the form of taunting, distraction and doubt. The Sith aimed to dominate an opponent’s spirit, hence they incorporated it heavily into their Lightsaber combat doctrine. (Quote: “Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem… Surely you can do better!” - Count Dooku)# Section 1\nDun Möch commonly used verbal taunts to expose the opponent’s hidden fears, weaknesses or doubts, making the opponent lose their concentration. Mental attacks would also be utilized, making the opponent less precise and effective. (Darth Bane in his writings marked that Mind Shard, a dark side mental ability, can be improved if used in conjunction with Dun Möch - Book of Sith)\n\n# Section 2\nDun Möch could be quite deadly, especially to Jedi, since concentration was a vital part to use the Force. Dun Möch used the Force as a form of psychological warfare. Many notable Sith have utilized Dun Möch including Darth Bane, Darth Traya, Darth Nihilus, Darth Sion, Darth Tyranus, Darth Maul, Darth Vader and Darth Sidious. Dun Möch was also utilized both in its regular form and inverse form by some Jedi including Luminara Unduli, Galen Marek, Luke Skywalker and Jaina Solo to name a few.\n\n# Section 3\nIf not carefully used, Dun Möch could backfire on the user, as Darth Sidious comments on Bane’s writings (Book of Sith). A famous example of this is the duel of Obi-WanKenobi and Anakin Skywalker versus Count Dooku. After Obi-Wan was incapacitated, Dooku taunted Anakin about his fear and Anakin not using his anger. This taunting prompted Anakin to attack viciously, until he had Dooku at his mercy, and killed him.\n\n# Section 4\nAs mentioned before, some Jedi used an inverse form of Dun Möch, famously used by Luke Skywalker on the Second Death Star against Darth Vader. Young Luke tried to remind Vader that he still has good within him. Luke was successful, and redeemed Anakin Skywalker. This technique was also used by Revan to redeem Bastila Shan.\n\n","meta":{"index":5,"author":"therussiancup","name":"Dun Möch","release_year":2021}},"Niman":{"content":"# Introduction\nNiman, the sixth form of lightsaber combat otherwise known as “The Moderation Form” or “The Way of the Rancor” is a combat form developed from two past martial arts fighting styles. The form is rather unlike the rest of the general lightsaber forms and contains more relaxed blade work compared to others as well as any significant specializations. The fighting style overall lacks advantages on other forms, but is much easier to master for the average Jedi compared to other utilized forms and contains a series of force-based attacks including telekinetic pulls and shoves. In other words, the blade work is used mainly by individuals focused on their studies and diplomacy rather than combat itself. The overall success with this form depends on the handler's creativity within the duel. \n\n\nSection 1: Background \n\n\tThe original version of the Niman form was practiced by Royale Macheteros of the Kashi Mer Dynasty. The Macheteros called the form its name based on the dual triumvirate of the Kashi deities. The form was first adapted by a group of Dark-siders who were involved in the First Great Schism. The form was eventually adopted by the Jedi Order and refined into the sixth form rather than the fourth. Once adopted by the order, the form was mostly utilized by Jedi Consulars who were mainly focused on their studies and diplomacy because of the forms' naturally adaptable usage. The form was prized for its usage in various wars against the Sith Order and over time became a standard in lightsaber training.

The temple was designed to reflect the Order's ideals of peace, wisdom, and harmony. It was made of stone, metal, and glass, with tall, imposing towers and massive, intricate designs.\n\n# Section 2\nThe interior of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant was as impressive as its exterior. It was home to numerous training facilities, meditation chambers, libraries, and living quarters for the Jedi. The main hall was a massive chamber with a large statue of a hooded Jedi in the center. This statue symbolized the Order's commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and the protection of peace. The temple was also equipped with numerous security systems, including guards and droids, to protect the Jedi and their secrets.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Jedi Temple on Coruscant played a vital role in the Galactic Republic. The Jedi Order served as peacekeepers and advisers to the Galactic Senate, and the temple was often used as a meeting place for the Senate and the Jedi Council. The Jedi were also responsible for maintaining the stability of the galaxy and preventing conflict. They did this through diplomacy, peacekeeping missions, and using their Force abilities.\n\n# Section 4\nThe fall of the Jedi Temple was one of the most devastating events in the history of the galaxy. The Clone Wars, a massive conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Separatist Movement, led to the downfall of the Jedi; and during the penultimate days of the war, the Jedi Temple on Coruscant was attacked and occupied by the forces of the Galactic Empire. Many Jedi were killed or forced into hiding. The Empire used the temple as a symbol of their power and as a base of operations for their military. \n\nThe temple was a symbol of the Jedi and their ideals, and its destruction was seen as a blow to the forces of good and a victory for the Empire. However, the legacy of the Jedi Temple lived on, as the ideals of the Jedi Order continued to inspire future generations.

Immediately after entering the planet’s gravitational field, they noticed that the entire planet was covered with snow and ice. Furthermore, the planet produced a very strong resonance in the Force. Ilum became a major point of interest to the Jedi Order after the discovery of immense amounts of Kyber crystals, used in the creation of lightsabers, inside its cave systems.# Section 1\nEven though it had been uncovered by the Jedi, it was the Gree who established the first civilisation on the Ilum’s surface, using it as a launch site for their “Gray Secant '' spaceship. Despite this, they have never officially conquered the planet, leaving its secrets to be found. In 22,800 BBY, when the Jedi became aware of the planet’s existence, the High Council members decided not to publish their new findings and keep the secret of Ilum to themselves to protect the Order’s discovery from unwanted attention. A complicated chain of hyperspace routes was developed to offer the Jedi an easy navigation method while simultaneously keeping the final coordinates in secret. Over the years, the icy world’s importance only grew, and the Jedi would often heavily rely on its almost infinite supplies of Force-resonant minerals. \n\nDuring the Great Galactic War, one of the most feared Imperial Sith Lords, Darth Malgus, was assigned to lead the assault on the planet, with its main target being the planet’s crystals. Malgus’ engineers planned to use them to create a new generation of stealth generators which would serve a great use as the power source of his new stealth, practically undetectable armada. In the end, Ilum was successfully defended, and the war records have been classified or destroyed.\nAnother milestone in Ilum’s history took place after the Jedi Purge when the newly formed Galactic Empire began to search for various power sources. Ilum, because of its amounts of Kyber crystals, perfectly suited the Emperor’s plans of creating an undefeatable battle station and powering it with the crystals’ cores. After the Battle of Endor, most of the planet’s surface was devastated, but a part of the environment survived.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Jedi Temple on Ilum lived its greatest period during the Old Republic era. After the planet’s successful hiding by the Jedi, the Order resumed launching Crystal Gathering pilgrimages to Ilum. A typical Crystal Gathering would be led by a Jedi Master, who travelled to Ilum with a group of worthy Younglings, and occasionally a few assistants. After their arrival, the Younglings would be tasked with embracing the Force and finding their own Kyber crystal in the icy caves of the planet. Many would get lost, and die from starvation or other dangers but if the Youngling successfully came back with a Kyber crystal, they would be able to proceed further with their Jedi training and potentially become a Padawan one day. What was more interesting, the colour of the crystal found by the said Youngling was said to be determined by their character and connection to the Force, making the process of choosing a Jedi specialisation much more detailed and interesting.\n\n","meta":{"index":29,"author":"abc_5329","name":"Ilum Temple","release_year":2021}},"Chasm":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe place named ‘Chasm’ was a large canyon located within the mountains of Tython, inside the continent of Talss.

The base ran smoothly under his control, ensuring the continued development of the Death Star and connected bases.

Jedi who were seen to have gotten very close or possibly even stepped into the dark side would be placed in stasis fields. This allowed their mind to stay open but their body to be stuck, leaving the Jedi to search for the path back into the light.

It is entirely likely that the Spice mine’s labor workers depended strongly on the state of the servant trade.

Soon after this, the Gungan leader was invited to the Palace and was presented with the Orb Of Peace at the top of the stairs leading from the Palace Plaza up to the Palace's grand doors.\n\n# Section 3\nWhen the Galactic Republic became the Galactic Empire, Queen Apailana used the Palace to hide fugitives of the Galactic Empire. When the Empire discovered this, they sent an occupation force to subjugate and put the planet under martial law. They captured the Palace and executed the Queen for treason. The Empire then installed a Puppet Queen so they could control the planet. In 4 ABY, when the people learned that Emperor Palpatine had been killed, the people of Naboo rebelled and stormed the Palace Plaza defeating the Imperial Garrison in the Palace and freeing the planet from Occupation. The Palace continued to stand well into the New Republic Era.\n\n# Section 4\nThe Palace is constructed in classic Naboo style featuring a lot of domes and porticos. The Palace is constructed with sandstone blocks built into large towers capped with green tiled roofs.

With new towers being constructed during each reigning monarch's time in office. The entrance to the Palace is marked by a large Plaza heading out into the rest of the city with a large Triumphal Arch at the far end built after the Trade Federation was expelled from Naboo, Queen Amidala's addition to the Palace's grand structure. The Palace grounds are surrounded by a large garden structure with complex water features.\n\n# Section 5\nThe Palace is a marvel of Naboo artisanry with long hallways showcasing the skills of the finest artisans on Naboo with extraordinary sculptures and paintings. The entrance hall of the Palace is lined with statues of the founders of Naboo's government, great philosophers and leaders. There are many rooms within the Palace's many towers. The throne room is the most important as it is where most of the governing decisions of Naboo are made. It features ceiling-high windows with several chairs commonly filled with high-ranking noble men and women who inform the elected Queen on the varying governance issues. Other rooms include the Queen's private chambers and rooms where visiting dignitaries can stay. In the rear of the Palace is an extravagant library. In the lower part of the Palace is a hangar backing onto the Plasma refinery where the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi fought and defeated the Sith Apprentice Darth Maul. It is also where Qui-Gon Jinn perished in the arms of his Padawan, using his final words to ask Obi-Wan Kenobi to train The Chosen One, Anakin Skywalker.\n\n","meta":{"index":2,"author":"Kaede_Vermillion","name":"Theed Royal Palace","release_year":2021}},"Lorana's Labyrinth":{"content":"# Introduction\nLorana’s Labyrinth was a famous cantina built in the Kelada Spaceport, on the planet carrying the same name.

Along with the Labyrinth’s size, the cantina quickly became very popular for various smugglers and scoundrels who either wanted to drink in an unusual setting or needed to lose somebody in the crowd among the mirrors.# Section 1\nLorana’s cantina lived its best period during the rise of the New Republic after the battle of Endor. The owner shared strong liberal beliefs, which corresponded to the ones of her clientele, and would not hesitate to give friendly smugglers a helping hand from time to time. For this purpose, she installed a network of secret passages inside the Labyrinth, which allowed Lorana’s friends to quickly vanish from the sight of their chasers. Even though Imperial Intelligence was aware of Lorana’s suspicious activity and raided the cantina regularly, they could not find proof of her crimes against the empire. To make her customers’ time more enjoyable, Lorana would occasionally hire less-known local bands to play their music in her tavern.\n\n# Section 2\nThe planet Kelada was located in the Mid Rim, right on the track of the Corellian Trade Spine. Because of this, it was greatly enjoyed by many smugglers who wished to trade their goods or avoid being seen.

In that same year, Jedi trainees Anakin Solo and Tahiri Veila discovered the ancient Jedi Master Ikrit and freed the trapped Massassi souls within the Golden Globe, a dark side device created by the Dark Lord Exar Kun in 3,997 BBY to drain the souls of the trapped Massassi to fuel his powers. These two Jedi along with Tionne Solusar, Uldir Lochett, and R2-D2 also discovered the Holocron of the ancient Jedi Asli Krimsan at Bast Castle on Vjun, and Kenobi's lightsaber and thwarted Orloc's attempts to start his own Jedi Order. Later that year, Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker traveled to the Unknown Regions to locate the wreckage of the disastrous Old Republic Outbound Flight expeditionary fleet in an inaccessible region of space known as the Redoubt. They were accompanied by Chiss Aristocra Formbi, Commander Chak Fel of the Empire of the Hand and New Republic envoy Dean Jinzler who wanted to honor his late Jedi sister by visiting the wreck, and several Geroons who wished to pay their respects to the Jedi who had freed them from their cruel Vagaari masters.# Section 1\nHowever, upon reaching the site of the wreckage on a planetoid within the Redoubt, they discovered that the survivors had formed a colony and that the Geroons were actually the Vagaari themselves, who had come to avenge their defeat at the Chiss decades earlier. However, the two Jedi along with the Chiss, Empire of the Hand, and the survivors of the Outbound Flight defeated the Vagaari and drove them away. In 23 ABY, the Jedi Order was faced with the Shadow Academy (Dark Jedi training ground founded by Brakiss) and its ally: the Second Imperium which rejected the Pellaeon? Gavrisom Treaty signed between the Imperial Remnant and the New Republic in 19 ABY. The Second Imperium kidnapped Jedi trainees, including Luke's niece and nephew, Jaina and Jacen Solo, and their friend Lowbacca, from Luke's Jedi Order and then went recruiting disadvantaged youth when that failed with the Solo twins and Lowie's rescue by the Solo's close friend Tenel Ka.

Accordingly, enormous numbers of battle droids overflowed the arena, flagging the beginning of the Clone Wars, battling before long emitted between the different sides. The 212 Jedi were overpowered by the sheer number of droids, and soon somewhere around 30 Jedi were left. It would have been a loss for the Jedi notwithstanding the opportune appearance of Master Yoda and the recent addition of the Clone Army, who figured out how to defeat the Alliance of Free Frameworks' powers.

The Fortress also held in its depths, the personal Holocron of its creator, Belia Darzu.# Section 1\nBelia Darzu was a Dark Lord of the Sith during the New Sith Wars. She was a female Shi’ido who frequently appeared as a Human woman. Belia brought the Sith Order back from nothing, after studying Sith alchemy for a considerably long time, the Dark Lord created a virus that would transform people into mutations which she called Technobeasts. Within the laboratories in her fortress, she created an army of these Technobeats.\n\nBelia used the Fortress to train her Sith acolytes; however, this would eventually be her undoing as she would eventually be assassinated by the Mecrosa Order. The Mecrosa Order would poison Belia after she would intrude into the Tapani sector.\n\n# Section 2\nEven with Belia gone, the Fortress would stay standing and functional for centuries after centuries, protected by the Technobeasts within, as well as by two automated ion cannons on top of two parallel pillars.

It possessed a Type I  breathable atmosphere, a dry environment, and a wide range of desert fauna living on its surface. Many cave systems and canyons would serve as places to hide from the sun, though the main cities and settlements of Vaklin were built on cliff sides and flat pieces of terrain. The planet had been discovered, and colonised, by Trivak Ninegun, who also initiated the Jedi Order’s plans to populate and use Vaklin as their outpost. Despite a rising depopulation due to the world’s harsh conditions, the Jedi successfully encouraged many races such as Togrutas, Twi’leks, Zabraks, and Rodians to create their own conclaves,  with the human race still being a majority, similarly to many other colonised planets.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Jedi Temple on Vaklin was created on the edge of Howling Ruins, an ancient and abandoned city. As a prime example of the Jedi architecture, the facility had a shape of a square, mostly painted light grey due to the planet’s strong solar heat. The main hallway was supported by ancient Jedi statues. Once inside, its visitors would find themselves lost among many tunnels and portals, lighted by the Jedi stonework lamps, mosaics, and illuminating crystals. Because of its planetary location, the Temple of Imperfect Repose was said to be filled with tunnels and caves.\n\n# Section 3\nThe temple’s history began during the age of the Old Republic when the planet was discovered by the Jedi. After hundreds of years of cooperation, the natives grew attached to the Jedi present on the planet and never hesitated to support them in any way. During the Great Jedi Purge, the Vaklinese successfully resisted Imperial propaganda and even initiated a small resistance movement led by Cho’na Bene- a Myneyrysh survivor of Order 66. Shortly afterwards, the rebel cell was targeted by the Galactic Empire and Darth Vader himself was sent to defeat the rogue Jedi. The resistance forces engaged Vader’s soldiers in a few short ambushes, but the Dark Lord soon discovered the rebels’ base and ordered an orbital bombardment of the whole planet, followed by an operation aimed to destroy all Jedi relics and mementos on Vaklin. Bene himself fought Vader in the temple’s ruins, but he was forced to retreat. Vader allowed the wounded enemy to escape, only to watch him seek help in a nearby city. Even though they initially supported Bene’s movement, the Vaklinese citizens had been turned against the Jedi by Vader’s cruel and merciless campaign and did not aid him.

Seeing this, he would deem the planet fit to house a brand new academy only for the most promising Jedi, and would quickly construct it, giving it the name Enclave.# Section 1\nIn time, there would be a Jedi Council assigned to the Enclave to oversee it and to make sure its students and teachers were upheld by the Jedi Code. This council was a subset of the main Jedi High Council in Coruscant. In the decades that followed the academy prospered under the leadership of the Council. However tensions rose within the academy during the Mandalorian Wars, as the Council decided to not assist the Republic in their war efforts, and students within the academy found this unacceptable. Jedi Revan alongside his close pupil Alek led a group of Jedi that turned to hundreds of Jedi to fight the Mandalorians, eventually leading to the defeat of the Mandalorians, and the Galaxy deemed Jedi Knights Revan and Alek as saviors of the Republic.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter the war, Alek and Revan disappeared, all the while the Enclave flourished as a key point in the community. The Enclave would house landing facilities, and shops, and offer the locals a safe space from the raiders and dangerous wildlife.

Revan and Malak would then declare a civil war upon the Jedi Order, and the Jedi Council had to act quickly. The council sent an assault upon Revan and Malak, capturing Revan in the process and manipulating his mind so that he could be trained once again under the light side of the Force, in hopes that he would defeat his former pupil Darth Malak.

For many decades, the temple at Kaleth, a massive stone structure with four large square towers, served as a repository of knowledge and wisdom. The Je'daii fled Tython after the terrible Force Wars, and others settled in the remains of the great fortress city. The temple at Kaleth was in ruins by the time the Jedi Order returned to their ancient homeworld during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the rising Sith Empire.# Section 1\nKaleth was situated within the heart of a gently sloping mountain range in the western Tythos Ridge. The gigantic castle was composed of painted stone, organized to make large geodesic circles in the faces of the four square towers, and was accessible by two paths, one of which was known as the Elarian Trail. The stone walls of Kaleth crumbled after centuries of being unoccupied, leaving just the lower levels standing. The temple-city's entrance remained in the shape of a gigantic stone archway that opened into a spacious courtyard with a towering statue guarding the entry. There were numerous little structures in the region, and stairs that led up to the few remaining stories. War droids were still stationed in various halls, ready to attack any invaders.\n\n# Section 2\nA society of Kwa occupied Tython long before the Tho Yor arrived with the first Force-sensitives who would become the Je'daii Order. They built temples and monuments on the forested planet. The globe eventually became depopulated, and the Kwa temples were abandoned. Hundreds of philosophers and academics from all throughout the galaxy arrived on Tython in 36,453 BBY aboard huge pyramidal structures known as the Tho Yor, which were carried down from the stars. These nine gigantic ships dispersed over the earth and landed in various regions, freeing those who had been held captive to help settle the planet. These pilgrims' new dwellings and halls of learning would be built on the foundations of the Tho Yor. One of these Tho Yor landed in the Tythos Ridge and was given the name Kaleth, which is a Je'daii word that means \"sanctum.\" The Je'daii Order of philosophers built a stone structure beneath the vast floating ship, encasing the ancient ruins of one of the Kwa temples within it. Kaleth was the most important temple on the planet since it functioned as a gathering site for Je'daii leaders and a convocation temple for the entire Order. Kaleth was the location of the Je'daii's huge library, as well as where vital situations arose, judgments were decided, and judgement was rendered on behalf of the entire Order. As a result, when the Despot War broke out in the Tython system, the armies concentrated on Kaleth at the war's climax.\n\nMaster Kora Ryo, a Twi'lek, was the Temple's overseer in 25,793 BBY. During his investigation, Zabrak Je'daii Master Ters Sendon came across an ancient Kwa temple down in Kaleth's lower levels, as well as an ancient holocron of Kwa philosopher A'nang. The holocron was activated with the help of Je'daii Journeyer Tasha Ryo, and upon its activation, its gatekeeper promised to share its knowledge. The Force Wars erupted between members of the first Jedi High Council and the heretical Master Rajivari after years of study and peace. As their erstwhile brother and sister Jedi converged on them, Rajivari and his disciples holed up in the Temple of Knowledge. While Rajivari fled, all of his followers died, leaving only data files documenting their final moments. The Jedi Order abandoned Tython at the end of the war, leaving Kaleth and the other temples to decay. Regardless, other Force-wielding civilizations from the system's adjacent worlds would try to recolonize Tython. Kaleth became a city of sorts after taking up residence in the old Temple of Knowledge, with successive governments attempting and failing to restore Kaleth to its former glory.\n\n# Section 3\nFollowing Jedi Master Satele Shan's finding of Tython, the Jedi Order transferred their headquarters to Tython to substitute for the Coruscant Temple that had been devastated at the end of the Great Galactic War. When the Jedi discovered Kaleth, they thought it would make an excellent foundation for their new Temple. Despite this, the Jedi High Council thought that studying Kaleth from afar would be more beneficial, so they built their new Temple in a nearby valley directly north of the spot. When the Jedi set up an archaeological site near the ruins, they were surprised to find ancient war droids attacking anybody who entered; if the droids were developed by Jedi, why were they killing people? The droids had been constructed by an old Jedi known as the Weapon Master to protect the First Blade, the blueprint for the contemporary lightsaber, unbeknownst to Tython's new colonists.

The Corellia Droid Factory was located in the Bindreg Hills, a remote and mountainous region of Corellia. The factory was dug into the mountain and consisted of a network of passageways and rooms. A natural cave provided the entrance to the underground facilities. The factory, which was built to produce enormous quantities of battle droids like B1-Series battle droids, B2 super battle droids, and droidekas, was fully automated.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems constructed the Corellia Droid Factory in preparation for a possible invasion of Corellia. During the conflict, a Separatist squad infiltrated the planet Corellia, which was aligned with the Galactic Republic, and built the factory in complete secrecy. The Confederacy's goal was to mass-produce and deploy combat droids to create mayhem on the ground while the Separatist troops attacked the planet's defenses from orbit. When the CIS invaded the Core Worlds, they bypassed Corellia and went straight for Coruscant. Corellia was never invaded, and the factory was never operational. After the Confederacy was defeated at the end of the Clone Wars, the Corellia Droid Factory was forgotten. The facility was finally discovered by the droid IG-88 two decades later, during the Battle of Yavin. The assassin droid intended to exploit the factory to mass-produce combat droids for his revolutionary droid army. As a result, IG-88 turned on the factory and began producing battle droids.\n\n# Section 3\nAfter receiving reports of hostile Clone Wars-era battle droids active in the Bindreg Hills in 1 ABY, the Corellian Security Force found the issue. Lieutenant Varias led a team from Coronet to investigate, which included Officers Savas, Hirka, Kener, and Mener, as well as many Corellian Security Force troopers. The unit discovered that the factory was fully operating and that it existed. Even though the facility was defended by a large number of hostile battle droids, the Corellian government was hesitant to send reinforcements because it did not want to catch the attention of the Galactic Empire. The government was concerned that it would be used by Imperial forces as an excuse to send a large number of troops. Sergeant Hirka and her squad were told to recon the area upon their arrival at the droid factory, Sergeant Mener was tasked with fighting the droids, and technical officer Kener was tasked with shutting down the facility. Lieutenant Varias dispatched spacers to rescue Sergeant Hirka and her unit after they were trapped by the droids. Meanwhile, spacers collaborated with Officer Kener to infiltrate the factory's control system and establish a security breach. Sergeant Mener was assisted by other spacers as well, who killed dozens of droids. Lieutenant Varias eventually assigned spacers with gaining access to the facility's control override interface.

As expected, the Empire responded immediately. This drove the Nationalists into the Government Center, pushing the forces provided by the Rebel Alliance off the planet. There were many fights between the Empire and the Nationalists, occasionally occurring in the streets. One of the commanders who had helped reconquer the planet, joined the Rebels.  Due to this, he captured the Government Center, rescuing the leader of the Abridon Nationalists. The leader of the Nationalists requested the Rebel Alliance to assist in their fight to free Sayan, an industrial city on Abridon, in exchange for A-Wing fighters. Thus, the Nationalists were able to regain control of the shipyard, delivering the A-Wing fighters to the Republic unscathed.\n\n","meta":{"index":5,"author":"AerialPanik","name":"Abridon Shipyard","release_year":2021}},"Green Jedi Enclave":{"content":"# Introduction\nDeep within the planet Corellia’s government district of Coronet City was the fortified structure of the Green Jedi Enclave, an area of pacifist Jedi who worked outside the commands of the Jedi High Council of Coruscant. The Green Jedi Council oversaw most Jedi who helped with maintaining the planet as well as the internal chambers of the Enclave. But after news of the attack on the Jedi Temple of Coruscant, the Green Jedi Enclave sought to fortify their own structure, using shields as well as internal reactors to protect from any external attacks.# Section 1\nNot long after the Sith Empire brought down the Jedi Temple of Coruscant during the Cold War, they made their way to Corellia to eliminate the remaining Jedi as a top priority. They were, however, met with multiple failures as the shields held up and the Jedi within managed to set up assault cannons to start a counteroffensive, leaving most of the casualties to the Sith as they continued to further their progress of penetrating the Enclave. Even the warship used during the assault would partially crash down onto the Enclave’s defenses, but it did not budge or break through the shields, making it a nearly complete loss for the Sith.\n\n# Section 2\nA fatal error would occur in the defenses as the Jedi Battlemaster, Jun Seros, attempted to make a plan to reinforce the Enclave but was assassinated by a bounty hunter, leaving the front undefended. The Sith, led by Darth Decimus, broke through the Enclave’s shields after gaining the access codes, rendering the structure useless to the barrage of attacks from the Sith, and the elite forces of Decimus. This ultimately led to the demise of the Green Jedi within, and the structure being repurposed for the Sith. Although the Republic forces attempted to reclaim the Enclave, they were met with a grinding halt as the Sith managed to hold their ground.\n\n# Section 3\nAfter many years and the fall of the Sith Empire, the Galactic Empire laid claim to the Enclave fortress and used it as a liaison building for the Imperial Corellian Security Force. The history of the Enclave has been all but forgotten by the testaments of time, as it had remained under their control since.\n\n","meta":{"index":31,"author":"YBPhoenix","name":"Green Jedi Enclave","release_year":2021}},"Great Tree (Kachirho)":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Great Tree of Kachirho was a massive wroshyr tree that formed the Wookiee city of Kachiro on the planet of Kashyyyk.

These trees completely dominated the planet with over a thousand different varieties and had a life span of fifty thousand years. These trees were significant as entire communities could build on top and within their large trunks. However, these trees are also substantially valuable due to their resources. Many tree parts, particularly the sap, or \"tree blood,\" were utilised in rituals, feasts, medicines, and beverages. It would also be broken down and used to provide fuel, oil, and other chemicals. Additionally, the bark and leaves could also be used in the manufacturing of weapons, and furniture, among other things.\n\n# Section 2\nIn 19 BBY, Kashyyyk was invaded by the Separatist forces during the Clone Wars. During this battle, the Wookiees had a considerable advantage against their enemies due to the Great Tree.

Previously known as Didi’s Café, Dexter remodeled it to fit a more Med’soto style. The Besalisk hired Hermione Bawga, FLO, and R4-A22 as waitresses. The latter two employees were droids.# Section 1\nDex’s Diner would have a variety of food and beverages for all guests. A popular selection was Jawa Juice composed of brewed ardees. In addition to this, another demanded drink, the Photon Fizzle, was also very refreshing. A favored entree on the menu was the classic Shawda club sandwich that could be served on therm-zapped or toasted bread. To finish off the meal, the mouthwatering Sic-Six-layer cake was also a delightful treat.\n\n# Section 2\nWhile the restaurant was under its previous branding, Oddo constantly was in communications with Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn in regards to criminals at his eatery. Dex would also house the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi with similar sort of issues such as with poisonous darts and bounty hunters. Sadly, Dex’s Diner attracted some rather unattractive characters.

Echo Base served as a spaceport, strategic command post, and forward operations base. Unfortunately, less than one standard month after the construction of Echo Base, the Empire discovered the base, and launched the Invasion of Hoth.# Section 1\nBefore the Rebel Alliance occupied the plot of land Echo Base was built upon, the glacial-cave system housed a clan of wampas. It should be noted, many large plots of land on Hoth housed the dens of wampas, however few were as impactful later in history as the Echo Base caves. \n\nBefore the Rebellion took up residence inside of the caves, they first needed to make sure the ancient ice caves were large and stable enough to be lived within, an endeavor which took eighteen standard months, as well as an additional two months simply for sake of installing equipment, such as doors, generators, computers, droid-housing, and living quarters.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring the Rebel occupation of Hoth, Echo Base served as a large base of operations, allowing Rebel ships to come to-and-from Hoth to refuel, re-arm, hand over vital mission details, and supply black box system reports. \n\nWhile building the base, an enormous shield generator was constructed, which was capable of protecting the entirety of Hoth from siege. This is due to Hoth’s relatively small scale, and the technological prowess of the Rebel Alliance’s Engineering Corps. Adding to the defense of Echo Base and Hoth as a whole was a V-150 Ion Cannon, which could offer covering fire for Rebels attempting to flee off-world. \n\nDue to the rapid construction of the structure, entire sections of Echo Base could go completely without heating, however this was noted to have resulted in stronger, more disciplined troops, opposed to those not subject to such extreme climates. \n\nBecause of the size of Echo Base, and the amount of Rebel troops stationed there, multiple outposts were built on the outskirts of the base, including Echo Station 3-T-8, Echo Station 5-7, and two Perimeter Outposts, Delta and Beta respectively. \n\nEcho Base’s location and existence were highly classified, and because of this, many Rebels on other planets were withheld information about it, causing rumors about its location to begin to spread. Two common rumors were that Echo Base could be found on an asteroid, while another stated it was an underwater city, on an unnamed planet. On top of this, any inbound traffic would be given randomized coordinates in hyperspace, forcing them to make multiple jumps before the final jump to Hoth, where Echo Base was located. This secrecy was all in an attempt to prevent the Empire from locating Echo Base, however these attempts proved fruitless.\n\n# Section 3\nEcho Base, being a large base of operations for the Rebel Alliance, housed many weapons, vehicles, ammunition, and fuel. Due to the sub-zero climate of Hoth, it became clear a different alternative method of transportation would eventually be needed, due to the cold temperatures causing malfunctions in airspeeders used by the Rebels. This led to the adoption of tauntauns, a hardy, bipedal Hothian beast, for transportation. \n\nInside Echo Base, the Rebellion kept many different forms of equipment. For example, in their medical bay, the Rebels kept a large ‘bacta tank’. The Rebels also maintained a fleet of T-65B X-wing fighters, and BTL-A4 Y-wing bombers, thirty GR-75 transports, as well as numerous T-47 airspeeders, nicknamed ‘snowspeeders’. Aside from vehicles, the Rebels also maintained a large armory of weaponry, such as the E-11, and the DH-17 blaster rifles.\n\n# Section 4\nEcho Base maintained a large army of Rebel fighters, including seven thousand five hundred combative units, and three hundred fifty medical units. There was also a large command center, where Rebel leaders could communicate, and plan. There was also a large variety of droids on-site which assisted the Rebel alliance in many ways.\n\n# Section 5\nDespite the Rebel alliance’s best efforts, eventually they were discovered by the Empire, resulting in the Battle of Hoth. Echo Base served as the forward operations base for all Rebel forces stationed on Hoth during this battle, before it eventually fell to the fleets of Imperial walkers and infantry. \n\nAfter being overrun, it is not particularly clear what happened to Echo Base, however it is a common assumption that the base was either destroyed completely, or repurposed into an Imperial field outpost.\n\n","meta":{"index":15,"author":"NotSoxri","name":"Echo Base","release_year":2021}},"Holocron Chamber":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Holocron Chamber is a secured vault located within one of the five spires of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant known as the “Tower of First Knowledge.” It houses several Jedi artifacts, mainly holocrons which hold deep secrets of the Order.# Section 1\nIn 4000 BBY, the Holocron Chamber had been constructed to house secrets and information about the Jedi Order. However, this would later be destroyed by the Sith Empire on 3653 BBY. The Jedi Order were able to raise funds for it’s reconstruction on 1000 BBY with the support of the Galactic Senate. After nine hundred and seventy years later, a holocron that holds information on an Anzati Dark Jedi, named “Volfe Karkko” was activated after fourteen generations of it being housed in secrecy. A Kiffar female known as Tinté Vos demanded Jedi intervention to cease this artifact and return it to safety.

The Librarian's Assembly was built just for the purpose of providing the most thorough records of information in the entire Star Wars genre and to spread the knowledge throughout the Order. The motivation stemmed from the interest in Star Wars lore and the ability to provide accounts of lore effortlessly.

Upon seeing this sight, the ship’s captain, Valoris, attempted to divert the ship from crashing into a standstill Republic cruiser. In this attempt, the ship suffered major engine failure from fire from Republic starcruisers; this would result in forcing him to make a split-second decision.# Section 1\nHe steered his ship towards the unknown planet that the fleet was guarding against the vessel full of Sith Lords. Flying into the planet's orbit, he was greeted by the lush forests of the unknown planet and the snowy mountains. In order to stop the ship from crashing head-on, Valoris was forced to land near a cave. Valoris checked to see if the other Sith Lords were as battered as he was; dozens of Sith were killed on impact, along with the starcruiser's on-board maintenance crews and officers, but CaessrTemenos, as well as Rogan and several other Sith Knights, were still alive and able to walk.\n\n# Section 2\nExiting from the heavily damaged ship, the realization finally set in that they were stranded on an unknown planet. Not knowing where to go or what to do, Caeser suggested that they explore the cave and attempt to find shelter. Upon exploring more, they found scattered clothes, cans of expired rations, and a blanket; they used this to start off the hidden Sith Shelter. The group of lords decided they would roam and get a better understanding of the land. Caeser stayed with the group to hunt and build a shelter, while Rogan went east and Valoris went north. Upon exploring, Valoris found fragments of a lightsaber, and as he explored deeper into the lush forest, he discovered a stairway up to the top of the stone mountain he had seen upon his initial crash.\n\n# Section 3\nWhen he observed closer, he could see that it was a structure, with Jedi-like statues in front and the sight of flashing blades. Upon learning of this, Caeser raced back to tell the group, realizing that it had been hours since he'd first gone out, hoping the group was still alive and well. Once Caeser arrived back to the group, he told everyone about the large temple he had found on the planet.

Late in the evening, the Sith would begin their assault on the Jedi Sanctum. The Sith would charge hastily towards the cavern, which led to the entrance of the Temple, and was led by the Dark Lord of the Sith Vermened. The Jedi fought courageously, knowing their home could be lost. The two forces clashed inside the humble cavern, creating a spectacle of gallantry and fury. The entirety of the Jedi Temple Guard stood at the entrance, bracing the charge up front whilst more Jedi stood behind as reserve forces. The Sith broke the defenses of the Temple Guard, causing them to scatter and forcing other Jedi to join the fight. A line of Jedi jumped over the main line, flanking the Sith on the front line and shocking those behind the front, giving the Jedi an advantage.

However, an attack had occurred at the Temple, ending 4 years of development, consistent growth, and the training of many Younglings and Padawans.# Section 1\nThe Jedi Temple came under attack by a Sith Fleet from orbit, which landed troops just outside the Temple. While the defense fleet attempted to destroy the Sith forces in orbit, many were able to break through the Temple defenses. During this time the Sith capital ship commanded by ShokuMatsu the Emperor's Dread, began to bombard the temple with high powered turbolaser fire. Despite this, the Jedi continued to fight the Sith around the Temple, believing the Sith to be after the archives where secret Jedi and Sith artifacts alike believed were to be held. Despite the Temple Guards, Jedi Sentinel, and Assault Team's best efforts, the Sith quickly overpowered the Jedi forces and quickly took over what remained of the temple. The remaining Jedi, wise and unfoolish, gathered into their starfighters to depart to another Temple on another planet, and the Jedi forces in orbit of Ossus were forced to retreat to Coruscant.\n\n# Section 2\nThroughout the entire time of the invasion, a small force of Sith Inquisitors led by none other than Darth Invictus raided the archives and engaged in battle with Jedi Librarians and Ossus Keepers. While it was a very difficult fight leading to the deaths of many Sith and Jedi alike, the Sith quickly gained access to the hidden vault of the Archives where the artifacts were held. They quickly looked around for many ancient Sith artifacts. During the time of the bombardment on the temple, having recovered these lost artifacts, the Sith Inquisitors quickly returned to their vessels and returned to the Sith Fleet, providing aide and the likes in fighting the Jedi Fleet while Darth LuciferTemenos returned to the Sith Temple on Crucible Prime with the artifacts.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring the attack on the Temple, the numbers of the Jedi on Ossus had dwindled to less than a third of the forces that were originally there. Of the some 600 Jedi present at the time, roughly one hundred and fifty (150) Jedi remained before the retreat order was issued by Jedi Master Creation, the highest ranking Master present on the planet at the time. When Master Creation issued the order for retreat, he ordered all remaining Jedi to link up at the Temple of Eedit on the planet Devaron, the nearest available refuge. When the order was issued, all remaining Jedi quickly made their way to their starships and fighters, many taking along Youngling’s and Initiate’s with them as an attempt to protect the young trainee’s, and quickly left for the Jedi Defense Fleet, which was rapidly preparing their hyperdrives. While a few ships were shot down by Sith fighters, most of the retreating Jedi forces made their way to the hangars and jumped with the rest of the fleet, leaving the Ossus Defense team to defend the archives from the Sith forces.\n\n# Section 4\nWhen the news reached the Jedi High Council on Coruscant of the state of Ossus, they quickly made the call to mount an assault force and sent them out to attempt to regain Ossus, with the force being led by none other than Jedi Council Member, Master DylanMalvern as the supreme commander. With a force of roughly 1200 Jedi, assorted support personnel and the main Jedi Defense Fleet, the Jedi forces made short work of the Sith fleet in orbit before landing troops and beginning to assault the Sith which had occupied the Temple. Much to the surprise of the Jedi, most of the Temple had actually been destroyed in the short time of the invasion. The Council chambers were in ruins, the Knight Hall where trials were conducted had completely collapsed, and the Archives were in a complete disarray.\n\n# Section 5\nAfter the Sith forces were completely eradicated from the Temple and its immediate surroundings and in full retreat, a multitude of Jedi Sentinels, Assault Force members and assorted personnel were quickly dispatched to survey the land surrounding the temple more thoroughly for any remaining Sith, with the order of capturing them alive if able for interrogation. During this period of time, Jedi Master DylanMalvern contacted the rest of the Council on Coruscant from the remains of the Council Chambers and gave them a rundown; listing casualty reports, what was lost/taken (after a quick investigation), and a report on the temple’s status itself. In the eyes of Master DylanMalvern, he told his fellow councilors that the Temple itself could indeed be restored, but with considerable work and effort due to the immense damage that was sustained from the orbital bombardment. From there, the council would decide to instead abandon the temple as a whole, turn it into an outpost to listen in on potential Sith activity in the surrounding sectors in a hopes to dissuade this situation from ever occurring again.\n\n","meta":{"index":6,"author":"SulliSlaesia","name":"Downfall of the Jedi Temple on Ossus","release_year":2021}},"Creation of the Jedi Temple on Ossus":{"content":"# Introduction\nHaving left the Jedi Sanctum, the Jedi colonists had one purpose to achieve; the fate of the Jedi Order’s future rested in their hands. Unless they found a suitable world, where a colony could be established, the Sanctum would eventually be overrun with constantly incoming visitors, scholars, and hostiles. The Order needed to possess another sanctuary, both as a backup facility and a much larger stronghold adjusted to holding hundreds of students at once. This, along with the sudden rise in the Sith activities revolving around the motherland planet, caused the Jedi High Council to dispatch a few most talented Jedi in this search. The navigators would use a wide variety of methods, such as utilising the planetary research data, sending specially designed probe droids to different regions of the galaxy, gathering reports from other allied worlds, and even relying purely on the guidance of the Force.# Section 1\nAfter many weeks, even months, of extensive searching, one of the navigators travelling through the Outer Rim sensed a distortion in the Force. The scout followed the resolution in the Force and jumped out of hyperspace in the system of Ossus. Even though the environment of the newly discovered world did not appear promising, the Jedi Researchers recognised the planet’s potential in the Force almost instantly after landing. The cliffed shores of Ossus were a natural defensive formation, and the seas of the planet significantly facilitated the methods of possible communication.\n\n# Section 2\nFollowing the creation of a camp near one of the Ossus’ largest mountains, the Jedi Researchers gathered all pieces of information they would need in the future and forwarded them to the Grandmaster’s office. As expected, the plan of inhabiting Ossus has launched soon afterward. Such a large project would require many sacrifices and investments, but thanks to the hard work of many Jedi, the colonisation of what would become the capital Jedi Temple started to take place.\n\n# Section 3\nAfter most of the Jedi Masters engaged in the project had arrived safely on the planet and the supply routes had been set up, the official construction began. The highest mountain peak on Ossus, along with several small, grassed islands, was chosen at the prime location due to its defensive capabilities, strong alignment with the light side of the Force, and easy access to the planet’s fauna and flora. The building would be led by the Grandmaster of the Order, TiberiusMalvern himself, who came down to Ossus to oversee the raising of the stronghold and use his mastery in the Force for the benefit of the whole Order. Shocking news regarding the complete eradication of the Jedi Sanctum caused by a Sith earthquake would leave many Jedi sorrowed. However, thanks to the overwhelming support from the Jedi Council, it did not take long for grief to turn into hope for a greater future. Ironically, the news of the destruction caused even more volunteers to come to Ossus.\n\n# Section 4\nSoon, thousands of Jedi Knights, Masters, and even Younglings, gathered on the planet’s surface. Everyone wanted to use their own set of skills to help with the Temple’s creation. The Jedi Council members such as Dercye, Vermened, Unite5000, and Essence_v1, along with two of the Masters of the Order, who had served continuous cadencies one after another, WolfSupport and ValSenko, would quickly begin launching various projects, events, and information broadcasts to ensure the whole community would be prepared for launch. Skaxon, the Order’s Barsen’thor and the leader of the Jedi Assault Team at the time, was another important personage to have contributed to the Jedi Order during the Ossus’ development. The enthusiastic, passionate atmosphere boosted the morale of the workers; with every chamber hollowed inside the mountain’s caverns, everybody worked even harder and longer with a smile on their faces. To this day, this historical event was considered one of the prime examples of the Jedi Order’s power and teamwork.\n\n# Section 5\nAs time passed, the Jedi Temple on Ossus would grow and develop, with many assembly rooms such as the duelling mats, lecture rooms, and the private administrative rooms being modelled to match those from the old, but not forgotten, Sanctum Temple. One of the most notable achievements of the Jedi was the successful forming of the Great Library on Ossus. After the prevailing Chief Librarian, CannonMalvern during the time, initiative, almost all of the archived database from Sanctum had been moved to Ossus to supply the largest gathering of knowledge in the galaxy. Another notable individual, without whose commitment Ossus’ building would not be as easy, was iSingToooMuch, also known as iSing. His influence and leadership as the Chief of Security were very beneficial. Owing to him and his Temple Guards all the Jedi assisting in the Temple’s creation would be safe and provided with the necessary aid they might have needed. iSing was also one of the Jedi Masters famous for the last ceremony hosted in the Sanctum Temple, followed by a great festival to celebrate a new Temple’s opening. With many lore seminars, educational classes, and rallies being hosted every day, the library would soon become a symbol of teaching, progression, and tenacity of the Jedi. In virtue of the overwhelming engagement in the Temple’s expansion, the team of Jedi Architects additionally assembled a network of magnificent gardens, meditation paths, and a track of countless Jedi pieces of architecture around the Jedi Temple. With a large, almost 100 metres high staircase engraved in the rocks, along with an ornamented facade and monumental statues portraying the ancient Jedi Masters, the Jedi Temple on Ossus was easily one of the greatest architectural advancements of the Jedi.\n\n","meta":{"index":7,"author":"abc_5329","name":"Creation of the Jedi Temple on Ossus","release_year":2021}},"Founding of the Jedi Seers":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Jedi Seers is a specialization within the Council of Reassignment.

Then on May 14, 2021, led by the first Chief Lore Keeper Blazey_Kitsune, they became a real specialization within the Council of First Knowledge.

Upon his appointment, WolfSupport had been serving on the Jedi High Council (JHC) since May 29th, 2021. Wolf transitioned from the private rotating seat to the permanent Chief of Security seat and he served on the JHC for five months and 25 days. With this previous experience, it was believed that WolfSupport was more than fit for the role, and it was generally accepted by the group.

They host the required Ethics & Philosophy class for Padawans and Initiate IIs. The purpose of the Jedi Mystic is to teach philosophy in the manner it was fleshed out during the development of the Jedi Arbiters, which consisted of an overarching approach to do good things while participating in the Jedi Order community.# Section 1\nJedi virtues were listed as the basic teachings of the Jedi Code, yet are also applied to the community as its core values. That, among other various concepts about how to interpret toxicity and how to define the quality of Jedi Knights, is all tied in the philosophy Jedi Mystics teach. The Jedi Mystics were created because the Senior Councilors of the Council of First Knowledge were attempting to fill a hole that was made when the community stopped doing philosophy classes during the days of the Jedi Sanctum. From the understanding of Head Mystic SlateStatic that is what the Senior Councilors intended, but they allowed Slate to do what he thought was best in that regard. Slate’s thinking was that all these rules and laws of the Order existing, showcase the line that you should not cross, yet he wanted to fill the gray area of what you should do as a community member in the Jedi Order to provide a good environment for all in this community. That is why the philosophy is communicated in the manner that it is. However, this philosophy was built during the time of the Arbiters, because the question of what a good quality Knights makes had to be answered. When Slate was experimenting with this idea, he went off to sort of research and ponder that question, studying the various interpretations of the philosophy of the Jedi. Generally speaking, they adhered to various world philosophies like Buddhism, Taoism, Stoicism, the teachings of Socrates, and the warrior philosophy of the Samurai. The duty of the Jedi Mystic is to communicate with the community’s values, provide an environment of debate and discussion. Mystics teach ethics and this philosophy, but whether Knights-in-training honor it is up to them. The job is not to enforce an ideology on the community, but preach its value and application while they perform their duties, while in the progression system.\n\n# Section 2\nJedi Mystics are the third and most likely final version of a specialization in the Council of First Knowledge that started with the reintroduction of Jedi Paladins back in January, 2022. Jedi Paladins were going to be a Guardian specialization that specialized in enforcing discipline on members of the Jedi Order through discipline trainings, part of the basic proposal that SlateStatic wrote up for the former Head Paladin, MarcosMalvern. Once what was greenlit, Slate also wrote up a document called the Paladin Doctrine, which detailed the duties and expectations of the Jedi Paladin, on top of a list of what Slate called “Knighthood Ethics.” These were not only part of the Jedi Paladin’s expectations, but also meant to be a series of ideals that were to be enforced considering that was part of the proposal. This is where the philosophy known until this day began.\n\n# Section 3\nHowever, the Jedi Paladins were short lived, as eventually it was dropped, perhaps due to conflicts of duties with the Weapon Specialists. The remnants of the discipline training idea were going to be moved to the Jedi Peacekeepers and the enforcement part of the Paladin idea were moved to the Jedi Arbiters. Jedi Peacekeepers kept MarocsMalvern as their Head, where he served as Head Peacekeeper for a time. Slate did not follow his former Head Paladin, he decided to join the Jedi Arbiters which were meant to be the quality inspectors, who participate in sending people into the “Discipline Trainings.” In a call with the former Caretaker of First Knowledge, PoH_v1, who appointed SlateStatic as Deputy-Head Arbiter, they mutually agreed that creation_v1 would be an ideal decision to represent the Arbiters on the Council of First Knowledge. Jedi Arbiters were organized as a means to enforce the ideology the Mystics now teach, which included violations of the Knighthood Principles as well as vice. Vices  are what is interpreted as an element of toxicity. On April 23rd 2022, the Jedi High Council determined the Jedi Arbiters were not fulfilling their role, and decided to go down the route of traditional Jedi-monks, and with that change Caretaker of First Knowledge ValSenko appointed SlateStatic as Head Arbiter due to his previous contributions regarding the Jedi philosophy ideas. About a week later, Arbiters were about to come to an end.\n\n# Section 4\nThe Jedi Mystic concept, as it is known now, was communicated to Slate on May 1st 2022, when Senior Councilors of First Knowledge ValSenko and Archimedes_v1 were pushed to reform the Arbiters from what it used to be. The idea was about a required class for both Padawans and Initiate IIs to undergo before taking their Knighthood Trials. This was something Slate actually had wanted for quite some time, as he never thought “enforcement” of an ideology was a good thing, in fact inherently negative. Slate wanted the philosophy to be used in a positive, productive way, and not to punish people for their mistakes. Slate brought up a number of different name change possibilities as this was an alteration of the job Arbiters did, a new name should represent that change. A few strong candidates were Cleric, Prophet, Druid and Mystic. Mystic ended up being chosen as both Senior Councilors and Slate thought it fit best. As for the former Heads, the Jedi Mystic basically has no former Head. Jedi Paladins were run by MarcosMalvern, Jedi Arbiters were first run by creation_v1. Jedi Mystics are significant to the Order because, unlike the laws of the Order, which tell you what line you must not cross, the philosophy that Mystics teach provide the basis for good behavior and good deeds. An fact of virtue is an act of love for the community. Jedi Mystics cannot force Knights to follow the virtues and adhere to them, but they must encourage it, and they must show them that it is important for building strong relationships in their time as a Jedi in the Order. It is an extension of the ideals outlined in the Jedi Code. Mystics must represent the virtues to the best of their ability, but even Mystics are not saints. “It is our duty to provide not perfection, but potential for growth in ourselves and our peers.” \nHead Mystic SlateStatic\n\n","meta":{"index":8,"author":"A1dok4","name":"Founding of the Jedi Mystics","release_year":2021}}},"meta":{"name":"TJO - Group History","index":29}},"Outer Rim Territories":{"articles":{"Dantooine":{"content":"# Introduction\nDantooine is a green, grassy world within the Outer Rim with an orbital period of around 378 standard days, each day lasting approximately 25 hours each. The planet boasts a Type I (Breathable) atmosphere and is mostly covered in grasslands, lakes and rivers; the climate is temperate and pleasant. It has several continents, most of them roughly of the same composition. It is known to be quite a beautiful world, vast savannahs stretching out across open fields - the moons shining brightly in the sky. There are hilly regions, though not common as the planet is mostly flat. It has two moons and orbits a single yellow star named Dina.# Section 1\nIt is somewhat of a quiet planet, almost completely devoid of galactic traffic. The planet has quite a low population, mostly consisting of human farmers and various wildlife. Though the planet does have an indigenous species of its own, the Dantari. A near-human species with primitive tech and a tribal culture. Not yet having learned about farming, they would mostly hunt - wandering the plains in search of their food. The planet inhabits many different alien species, though most are the non-sentient animals that are native to the world. Strangely enough for such a calm-seeming planet, most of the native wildlife is quite aggressive in nature. Many predators roam the savannahs and only a few true “prey” animals exist.\n\n# Section 2\nThe planet has numerous structures of interest, namely the ancient Jedi Enclave. The Enclave was built sometime around 3997 BBY and used for around forty years until it was destroyed by the ancient Sith Lord Darth Malak. It was rebuilt a few years later and was used as a temporary residence for the Jedi Council, but due to unfortunate circumstances it was soon abandoned as it mostly stands to this day.

The Qeimet System was allied with the Republic in the Old Republic era and continued to ally throughout the Clone Wars, allowing the Republic to set up its Sarin Oversector headquarters there and serve as the base of operations for the Fifteenth Sector Army. Due to their alliance, the Qeimet System quickly fell to Imperial rule in 19 BBY. The Sarin Oversector was explored in the years between 1000 BBY and 25 BBY, which produced many impressive findings. The discovering of the Rebel base on Hoth drew the attention of the Empire to the Qeimet System, which was where the report came back that a probe droid had sensed activity on the barren and frozen planet of Hoth in the Outer Rim, which intrigued the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader, to focus all attention on the snowy planet. Imperial rule was relatively weak in the sector, as the New Republic was quite rebellious there. Thus the Empire created the Qeimet Fleet with the flagship “Victorious,” leading the fleet to destroy all rebellious activity in the system.

No significant population of intelligent life lives there, partly due to the planet’s sun emitting green firestorms making space travel difficult in the system, and partly the hostile life on the planet.# Section 1\nThe planet does not have any major population of intelligent life which may stem from the fact that incredibly hostile life lives on the planet.

Their government was also incredibly corrupt; as long as one had enough credits, they could easily bribe their way into obtaining anything they needed at the time. Most of the trade and deals happened on the black market, despite a working economy existing on the planet. Almost anything that was worth credits could be found on Cyrkon, including weapons, spices and servants. Life on the outside of the domes was impossible since not only was the atmosphere deadly, but all the terrain had overheated as well, the only suitable temperature was inside the domes.

Telos was once orbitally bombarded during the Jedi Civil War, but after the war occurred, Restoration Zones came to design. These zones are scattered around the planet, however, it did exclude many of the planet’s ruins and deserted bases during the first restoration wave. The Restoration Zones stabilized the atmosphere in these zones, allowing for flora and fauna to take root in the once desolate planet. These were exported to the planet from ecologically rich planets such as Ithor, Onderon, and Dxun. The restoration project was eventually successful, becoming a lush and beautiful planet.# Section 1\nTelos was the victim during the earliest days of the Jedi Civil War, which was devastated by the Sith Empire who were under the orders of Darth Malak. He demanded the planet's surrender, which was rebuked. This led to the orbital bombardment of the planet. Soon after this, the Jedi Order feared an attack against the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine. With these fears lying in the possible loss of many of the Order’s valuable relics; Telos was chosen to be a site for a secret Jedi academy and repository because of these fears.\n\n# Section 2\nSupreme Chancellor Tol Cressay chose Telos to be the first Republic-sponsored restoration project. If successful, Telos would be the first in many planets to be restored that had been devastated by previous wars; such as the Mandalorian Wars and the previously mentioned Jedi Civil War. Being called the Telosian Restoration Project, it had called for the construction of Citadel Station, a station large in scope that orbited the planet. This project was overseen by the Telosian Council, a herd of Chodo Habat had been chosen to manage the project. During the First Jedi Purge, the Jedi Exile sought to end the purge. Telos and Citadel Station both played crucial roles in this mission. At Citadel Station, the battle for the restabilization of the Republic took place, in which the Jedi Exile was victorious against the Sith Triumvirate. The actions of the Jedi Exile allowed for the completion and success of Telos’ restoration.\n\n# Section 3\nBefore the collapse of the Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Telos had become a politically significant world. It was noteworthy for the natural beauty and tourist trade that its beauty drove. In 53 BBY, Governor of Telos Crion and his son, a former Jedi named Xantos co-conspired together. They plotted to annex a neighboring planet to gain access to its resources and factories. This started a civil war after the Telosians discovered the plot, the resulting conclusion of the war ended with Crion’s death. Nine years later, however, Xantos convinced the Telosians that he and his deceased father, Crion, were innocent. He sought to industrialize Telos for his own material gain. However, just like with the plot nine years earlier, it was foiled. Rather than face judgment for his crimes, he took his life. During the Imperial Period, Telos had rebelled along with several other planets within the Kwymar sector that Telos resided in. The following Kwymar Suppressions had Telos attacked by Imperial forces, which ultimately resulted in an Imperial victory.\n\n","meta":{"index":53,"author":"JerichoJireh","name":"Telos IV","release_year":2021}},"Savareen":{"content":"# Introduction\nSavareen was a planet in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories, located on one of the Kessel Run's spurs. The world was made up of sand-covered landmasses and vast oceans. Savareen was also recognized for its well-known brandy cocktail. The Crimson Dawn used to run a business there, chopping off the tongues of the locals. The world resembles the other desert planets of Tatooine and Jakku and might easily be confused with them. This planet, unlike the other two, has water but is just as thinly populated as the other desert planets. Because of its proximity to the Kessel Maw Nebula, the planet has become known for processing coaxium on the black market.# Section 1\nBefore 10 BBY, Crimson Dawn, a crime syndicate, had a presence on Savareen. When the indigenous attempted to revolt against Crimson Dawn, they were unable to speak. The Dry Gulch had been harassed by the Bellwing Gang over the refinery by 10 BBY, and the townsfolk hired the mercenary Gallandro to deal with the gang. Gallandro's crew was permitted to tap the raw coaxium in exchange for 10,000 credits. The specifics of the Dry Gulch job were written in the Smuggler's Guide logbook by Gallandro's employee Loonoo.\n\n# Section 2\nHan Solo and the rest of Beckett's gang proceeded to Savareen after the raid on Kessel to refine the coaxium they had taken from the Pyke Syndicate. Enfys Nest and her Cloud-Riders fought with Beckett's group while they were there, after which Enfys regaled them with the narrative of how Crimson Dawn plagued the village. Han concluded he couldn't give Dryden Vos the coaxium and devised a scheme to deceive him.

The planet’s climate was very high, due to its distance from the star Ea. Geonosis was the second planet from the star. A day on Geonosis would last 30 hours and a year would last 256 days. Geonosis had 15 satellites, some having the same climate as the planet, a hot and arid one and some satellites were covered in Ice.# Section 1\nThe planet had a diameter around 11,400 Kilometers. Its atmosphere was breathable, with water on the planet’s surface, so it could contain life. Because of the planet’s hot weather, the water amount wasn’t higher than 5% of the planet’s terrain. Because of this, the planet couldn’t sustain a large population.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Flora and the Fauna were not very large due to the low amount of water. The Flora of the Planet is very restricted, having very few representatives.\nThe Fauna on the other hand it’s much more extended, having many native species like: the Orray, the merdeth, the phidna, etc.\nGeonosis also sustained intelligent life. The intelligent native species called: Geonosian was a semi-Insectoid Creature with Wings that allowed him to fly. The geonosians were living in Hives and were led by a queen.\n\n# Section 3\nThe economic activity of the planet was made by the import and export cycle. The Planet was importing raw materials, as Geonosis was a hot and arid place full of deserts, there weren’t many materials obtainable. The Planet was exporting processed materials, but mostly Geonosis was exporting battle droids and war equipment for the Separatist Forces.\n\n# Section 4\nDuring the Clone Wars, Geonosis was the Capital of the Separatists. The Planet was producing droids for the Separatist army. The battle on Geonosis and the Battle on the Geonosian Arena marked the beginning of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY. After the end of the Clone Wars, the construction of the Death Star began. The Planet was now under the lead of the Galactic Empire.

The surface of Bogano was grassy, with mesas and wetlands. The planet was home to an ancient Vault, which was built by the ancient civilization, the Zeffo. Bogano was important to the Zeffo because of the Binog, a large creature shown in Zeffo art and culture. The Jedi Eno Cordova theorized that the location of the Vault was there because of electromagnetic winds. The Vault housed a single object, a holocron, which had a list of all the Force-Sensitives in the galaxy; the holocron was placed there by the Jedi, Eno Cordova.# Section 1\nBogano thrived as a planet; it had a balanced ecosystem and was barely touched by sentient life, which left the environment to thrive. After the fall of the Jedi Order, Cere Junda brought Cal Kestis to the planet, hoping to restore the Jedi Order. After finding the Vault, Cal Kestis left and returned with the Astrium, which he found on the planet Dathomir. He unlocked the Vault and found the holocron, which was then stolen by Cere Junda’s former Padawan, the Second Sister, Trilla Suduri.\n\n","meta":{"index":90,"author":"Librarian's Assembly","name":"Bogano","release_year":2021}},"Kintan":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe world of Kintan  is located in the system of Kintan, in the Si’Kaata Cluster, on the Ac’fren Spur, within Hutt space, in the Outer Rim Territories. The official languages spoken on Kintan are Nikto and Huttese. Kintan was the original home of the Kintan striders that were taken off world to be used as pets and guards for the Hutts before the planet's pollution and other natives of the planet, the sentient species Nikto, and their hunting habits of the creatures drove them to extinction. Kintan’s harsh planetary makeup was described with “rivers of fire and sand of ground glass” by the Jedi Alaya Secura. The planet had vast mountains, deserts, swamps, forests, and magma fields. The Nikto, the sentient species of the world, evolved into five subspecies after the supernova M’dweshuu had exploded. Three of these species are more known: the green-skinned Nikto known as the Kadas’sa’Nikto, the lavender-skinned Nikto known as the Esral’sa’Nikto, and the red-skinned Nikto known as the Kajain’sa’Nikto.# Section 1\nNotable landmarks of Kintan include the Basin of Torturous Flame, the Canyon of Despair, Burning Moon Range, River of Fire, Gluss’elta Archipelago, Glussa Island, Gluss’elta Sea, Fortress Kh’aris, and Wannschok Desert. Fauna of Kintan are the Spine Dragon and the now extinct Tuskbeast. Besides the Nikto and Kintan strider, the Kintan crusher is also native to the Kintan.\n\n# Section 2\nIn 26,000 BBY, the Nikto species, the sentient species of Kintan, formed a violent cult, worshipping the nearby supernova - M’dweshuu. The cult was called the Cult of M’dweshuu. Circa 25,130 BBY, the Cult of M’dweshuu came to power over the planet of Kintan and drove the world into four gruesome civil wars. Thirty years later, circa 25,100 BBY, with the four wars nearly over with, the Nikto became permanent indentured servants of the Hutts under the Treaty of Vontor. Roughly 24,000 years, circa 1000 BBY later the Nikto cultists were able to drive the Hutts off of Kintan for a brief time.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring the Cold War between the Sith Empire and Galactic Republic circa 3653 BBY, Nikto miners uncovered ancient cave paintings, which they assumed were made by pre-civilized Nikto. Some time thereafter, historians were sent to study the paintings and interpreted them as describing the four violent civil wars the Nikto had tens of thousands of years before. The paintings showed worshipping of an honored warlord named Da-Shek Yalaa. For many years after, the Morgukai warrior tradition was born on Kintan among the Nikto elites, separating themselves from the other Nikto. Circa 30 BBY, an exiled Twi’lek by the name Kh’aris Fenn lived in the Kh’aris Fortress on Kintan guarded by the last two remaining Morgukai known as Bok and Tysr. The pair kidnapped a Twi’lek heir named Nat Secura and brought them to the fortress where the heir was then rescued by the Jedi and Tysr killed in the process. The last Morgukai, Bok, was killed on Saleucami along with his army of Morgukai clones supplied by Count Douku, during the Galactic Republic's Outer Rim Sieges\n\n# Section 4\nKintan joined the Republic twenty years before the Clone War broke out with direct representation in the Senate, however, in reality the senators who represented Kintan were ultimately the mouthpieces of the Hutts who still held strong control over the planet and the Nikto species. As the Clone War started, Kintan faced yet a new wave of violence between the Nikto cults making the Sisar Run hyperspace trade route particularly more dangerous than it already had been running through Hutt space as is. In 26 ABY, the planet was taken over by the Yuuzhan Vong, a sentient species that is known to have originated outside of the galaxy. During the Vong occupation over Kintan, 75% of the Nikto were either killed or enslaved, driving the rest of the population into hiding in the harshest areas of Kintan. After the war with the Vong had ended, the Niktoand planet slowly recuperated to their former states.\n\n","meta":{"index":21,"author":"WeaponizedBoomer","name":"Kintan","release_year":2021}},"Tatooine":{"content":"# Introduction\nTatooine is a desert planet located in the Outer Rim Territory, in the Arkanis Sector. The sand planet is located on a binary star system, which is the main cause of the planet’s scorching hot temperatures, loss of life and water shortages. With the planet’s small water supply, Tatooine could not afford for large populations to live there, leaving much of the  planet undiscovered. Tatooine is thought to be one of the oldest planets in the galaxy, formed by a strong molten core and thick rock crust, which has allowed it to survive for so long.# Section 1\nMost of the local people of Tatooine are poor. Due to the minimal water supply of the planet, people have begun to live and work on moisture farms. These farms provided the people enough water to live. Many locals also buy and sell scrap from shipwrecks and from Jawas. Due to the low population of Tatooine, criminal activity is very high.\n\n# Section 2\nTatooine is most infamous for their large population of Jawas and Tusken Raiders. Jawas are small, human-like creatures that wear long coats. Their faces are indescribable, but they have 2 bright eyes, which are typically orange. Jawas are most typically known for their collecting of scrap. They take almost any parts they can find, and use them on random things. Jawas typically are seen living in large, portable scrap ships, which can hold hundreds of Jawa. Tusken Raiders are said to be the first inhabitants of Tatooine, and have had their land taken by the new inhabitants, causing them to dislike said inhabitants. Tusken Raiders can be seen wearing long, cloth clothing to protect themselves from the heat, and no part of their skin is showing. They also are seen wearing large goggles, to be able to protect their vision in the sands.

Most of the planet’s surface consisted of water due to Rodia being a swampy planet. One could see giant trees sticking out of the water and reaching the skies. While a good amount of Rodia was considered as swamps, some oceans could be found, separating land masses from each other. Since there were few predators and dangerous creatures on the planet, the Rodians constructed their cities on giant platforms that were built right above the swamp water level. Their cities were also protected with bubble domes since they had very little space to flee to in case of an attack, even some hidden bunkers were built underwater in case of an emergency. During the early years of the Clone Wars,  Rodia became part of the Republic and continued to remain loyal to them after seeing the benefit between their relationship.

It was also home to a species known as The Dulok, who were very aggressive and would hunt down the Ewok. The Wistie, also known as the fire sprites, were used by Ewoks as a weapon against intruders like the Imperial Stormtroopers, and, finally, the Gorax, a semi-sentient species that were built like giant humanoids, would also hunt for Ewok villages.# Section 1\nThroughout galactic history, Ewoks were prime targets for visiting raiders/intruders. They would hunt the Ewoks to make an outer-rim snack known as Ewok Jerky. The Forest Moon was quiet until the Galactic Empire took over and used the moon to establish an Imperial Outpost, which contained a shield generator complex to defend the second Death Star while it was still being constructed. What caused the Ewoks to rebel against the Empire was when they bulldozed a whole village. Because of this act of hostility from the Empire, the relationship was strained between both parties which led to them assisting the Rebellion. Since the Death Star was very close to the Forest Moon, there tended to be earthquakes and other geological disturbances.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter the attack on the village from the Empire, the Ewoks and the rebels joined in unison to overthrow the empire by launching an attack on the shield generator. If the Rebellion hit the shield generator, the Death Star would be unprotected while incomplete. The Empire had the rebels trapped, but the Ewoks saved them, and together, the Empire was overthrown on land. Above the Forest Moon, there was an intense space battle between the Empire and Rebellion to blow up the Death Star, and it was successful for the rebellion but at a cost. The Death Star blowing up meant that there would be debris raining down into the atmosphere, damaging the ecosystem. After the war between the Empire and Rebellion had ended, the Ewoks and Rebels celebrated together. The rebellion repaid the Ewoks by putting shields and tractor beams to protect the planet from debris. Despite all the issues due to the Death Star blow-up, debris proceeded to rain down for at least a decade; however, Endor’s ecosystem prevailed and remained strong.\n\n","meta":{"index":89,"author":"Librarian's Assembly","name":"Endor","release_year":2021}},"Basteel":{"content":"# Introduction\nBasteel--often misspelled as ‘Bastille’--is an overall, relatively underwhelming planet found within the Outer Rim Territories.

Basteel itself experiences frigid temperatures, and its terrain is extremely mountainous, with only one major city erected below the planet’s surface - Eladro city.# Section 1\nIts most notable fauna consisted only of the ‘unidentified tunnel creatures’ that inhabit the cave systems inside Basteel’s mountains. Despite its uninteresting appearance, however, Basteel and its neighbouring systems would show some interesting activity from an outside influence at around 4 ABY.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Basteel would show little to no activity from the Empire. Its extremely far location from the planet Endor and its uninteresting appearance elected it to be the perfect place for Leia Organa’s Operation Yellow Moon.

This planet was the homeworld for Pantorans, and their leader, Supreme Chairman of Pantora. Pantorans were close to humankind, apart from their blue colored skins. The most common immigrated species you could see on Pantora were Sullustans, Rodians, and humans. For a long time, Pantora had belonged to the Republic with  great loyalty and respect towards them. After the Galactic Republic was reorganized, Pantora welcomed the Empire to their homeworld with open arms and kept the alliance strong between them.# Section 1\nDuring the Clone Wars, fearing that the Separatists might attack their core world, a Republic outpost was built on Orto Plutonia after being requested by Chairman Chi Cho. After all military personnel had been wiped out from both Republic and Separatist outposts, Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi began investigating what caused all those deaths. Eventually, they came upon a primitive village that belonged to the warrior species known as Talz. After attempting to negotiate with them, the Jedi managed to come to an understanding with these primitive species, both sides only wanted peace. Any further negotiations were quickly interrupted by Chi Cho, claiming that Orto Plutonia had always belonged to Pantorans and accused Talz of trespassing. These words led to another conflict between the Republic and Talz. Shortly after this, the Chairman met his end after he was ambushed by Talz and underestimated their strength. In the end, Senator Riyo Chuchi with the help of C-3PO was able to come to a mutual understanding with Talz Chief and put an end to that battle.\n\n# Section 2\nLater during the Clone Wars, the Trade Federation formed a blockade over Pantora, claiming that Pantorans owed them large debts, but in reality, the blockade was formed to pressure the moon to join the Confederacy of the Independent Systems. Separatists also ordered the Trade Federation to send bounty hunters to kidnap both Chairman Papanoida’s daughters, meanwhile, the Separatists offered their help to solve this kidnapping. However, Padawan Ahsoka Tano and Senator Chuchi found one of the daughters on a Trade Federation Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship. The Captain of the vessel and Senator Lott Dod were forced to let them go, so that the Trade Federation could remain neutral in the eyes of the Republic Senate.

It resided near a trade route, yet was only reachable through an obscure hyperplane. Dagobah was home to a harsh and humid climate with many swampy areas that cover the entire planet. Along with the swamps, covering the planet were many trees. The planet had very few true open waters, most of the water was from its thin coat of swamps. Although there wasn’t much to the planet, it still held some lifeforms, creatures such as the bogwings, dragonsnakes, sleens, vine snakes, and swamp slugs; it also had few faunas living on the planet, examples are Adder moss, the hassling, gnarltree, and meat flower. Although it had lifeforms living on the planet, it did not house any advanced civilizations.\n\n# Section 2\nHundreds of years before the Clone Wars, a Jedi by the name of Minch came across Dagobah while chasing down a Sith priest also known as a Bpfasshi Dark Jedi. The Jedi Minch killed the Dark Jedi, and with the death of the Dark Jedi, the surroundings began to consume the dark energy coming off the deceased body of the Dark Jedi. In the coming years, the planet was seldom found, most times when it was found by explorers, they were either eaten by the wildlife or had to resort to cannibalism.\n\n# Section 3\nIn 22 BBY, a Republic research team was stationed in Dagobah under Halka Four-Den, a commander of the Republic. The initial assessment of the planet was that it was beaming with a diversity of lifeforms; they were wrong with their assessment as Halka Four-Den and her team died on Dagobah. They could’ve been retrieved but because of the upstarting of the Clone Wars, their transmissions were likely cut off from the other many transmissions. The surviving members of the team raised their children as cannibals. Years later during the outbreak of the war, Jedi Grandmaster Yoda found thirty-eight worlds that were deleted from the Jedi Archives, one of them was Dagobah. Yoda would go to Dagobah following the spirit of fellow Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. There he was given the task to find out how to become one with the Force and how to achieve immortality. During this short visit, he entered a cave where he experience a powerful vision of the Sith’s powerful hold on the galaxy, the fall of the Jedi Order, and the confirmed existence of Darth Sidious.\n\n# Section 4\nIn 19 BBY, at the start of the Great Jedi Purge, Yoda entered exiled on Dagobah after his defeat at the hands of Darth Sidious. He chose Dagobah because of the cloud future he could not see, he decided to go to a nameless world, a planet that was writhing with the Force, enough to hide his presence in the galaxy. He also stayed near the Cave of Evil which negated his light side energy, further hiding his presence. In his exile he had met many people, one was a clone of Galen Marek, renamed Starkiller; he allowed Starkiller entrance into the cave. Other people he has seen before were Tash Arranda and Zak Arranda two orphans who survived the destruction of their planet Alderaan. They were two Force-sensitive humans who Yoda chose not to train in the ways of the Jedi, waiting for another. Even though Dagobah was a remote planet, it was an included destination on the Intergalactic Passport.\n\n# Section 5\nIn 3 ABY, Luke Skywalker was visited by the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi on the planet Hoth. Luke was instructed by Obi-Wan to go to Dagobah so that he may be trained in the ways of the Jedi. He traveled to Dagobah but crash-landed on the surface of the planet almost losing his X-wing to the swamp. There he met a grumpy little green creature, who he discovered later on to be the Jedi Master Yoda. He would be taught the ways of the Jedi through hard training, learning to control the Force. Luke would later enter the Cave of Evil, given a powerful vision of Darth Vader fighting him; where he would cut the helmet seeing his own face there, hinting at Darth Vaders identity. Later in his training, he would have a vision of his friends, Han Solo and Leia Organa suffering on Bespin. He stopped his training promising to come back to finish his training, and he certainly did come back but, came back too late as Yoda was on his deathbed.\n\n# Section 6\nOver the years, many Jedi have come to Dagobah either looking to overcome their fears or to reconnect with the Force. Luke came to Dagobah with his lover Callista Ming to try to reconnect her to the Force, while Anakin Solo, grandson of Anakin Skywalker came here to overcome his fear of becoming the visions of himself as a Dark Jedi.

Captured as a child in 3838 BBY, Bowdarr had only known violence for most of his life. For more than a century, Bowdaar fought in single combat. He had fought well over ten thousand matches, fighting rancors, Mandalorians, gundarks, and a Jedi. He hadn’t lost a single match. To add on to this, Bowdaar refused to wear armour or use any form of weaponry, giving him a fierce reputation that he was merely immortal. Those who survived their encounter with him, however, would merely say he was just better than them.# Section 1\nAround 3643 BBY, nearly two hundred years after his capture, Bowdaar was acquired by Drooga the Hutt as payment for a gambler’s debt. Bowdaar was kept caged between his matches and was treated cruelly. Drooga would eventually get annoyed at Bowdaar due to the fact that Bowdaar would slay all of his opponents before any real entertainment could be gained from the fight. This led Drooga to take many steps to put Bowdaar at a disadvantage, such as draining half of his blood or just outright poisoning him.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring his tenure with Drooga, a smuggler captain arrived on Nar Shaddaa to barter an incredibly rare male Shanjaru, a beast that was near extinction at this point in time, in exchange for an experimental engine. Once the smuggler located Drooga’s barge in Nar Shaddaa’s Nikto Sector, the captain was able to arrive just before Bowdaar’s next fight against a gang of Kaleesh warriors. And although Bowdaar could have easily taken the gang by himself, the smuggler chose to intervene. Bowdaar would later repay this by assisting the smuggler against Zank Helrott, a bounty hunter in the employ of Rogun the Butcher. Following this, Drooga had decided that he wanted to be done with the Wookie once and for all. As such, Bowdaar and his new friend, the smuggler captain, were pitted against Drooga’s pet gundark, which was specifically starved for this occasion. Once the gundark had died, Drooga had finally had a suitable amount of entertainment for the night, and decided that Bowdaar was no longer worth the cost it took to maintain him and simply released him, which led Bowdaar to join the smuggler’s crew.\n\n","meta":{"index":38,"author":"dereklo","name":"Bowdarr","release_year":2021}},"Rishi":{"content":"# Introduction\nRishi was a jungle-like planet, similar to Felucia.

Rishi also contained many swamps and tropical areas that were a common place for many criminals to live in the Old Republic era. The climate was quite hot and humid, as it was a tropical planet. In addition, Rishi had many islands such as the Tracyn island, Sky Ridge island and Razorback island. Rishi had a population of around 2 billion, with the majority being Human and Rishii.# Section 1\nWhen Rishi was first discovered by a group of pirates known as the Nova Blades, they made it into a safe area for criminals to come to. The Nova Blades refined the many fossil fuels found on the planet, and throughout the Galactic War the planet stayed neutral, but the Nova Blades supported The Order of Revan. Soon after the Battle of Rishi, the Padawan of Master Orgus Din went to Rishi and cured many of them from the Tanamen Fever. The fever was not very fatal on other planets, however on Rishi it was quite damaging. In a Force vision by Master Orgus Din, most pirates on the planet were gone due to the Rishii and many people were able to live peacefully.\n\n# Section 2\nSometime around 60 BBY, over 50000 H’kig formed a colony on Rishi, but it went downhill extremely fast as many of them went and formed another colony on the planet J’t’p’tan. By the time the Clone Wars began, The CIS tried to take the fossil fuels from Rishi. This was dissolved by Kit Fisto and his clones, with the help of the Rishii.

It is tidally locked to its planet and has an orbital period of 413 days, each around 87 hours each. It has a Type I (Breathable) atmosphere and a temperate climate. While it is presumed that the moon was once a green world full of forests and life in pre-ancient times, eons of building layers of cities on-top of one another has left it completely unrecognizable; there is no history dating back to before then. The moon is very similar to planets like Coruscant and Taris, where cities cover every square inch of the world. It has no natural surface water that we know of, since it has all presumably been built over. The Smuggler’s Moon is known to be one of the most dangerous places in the whole galaxy, mostly because of the criminal underworld and various gangs that have made it their home. All the industry has left the moon extremely polluted and the cities are filthy, streets covered in trash - nearly every sector a borderline garbage dump save for the highest levels where the rich crimelords make their living. As mentioned earlier, the moon has layers of cities, each layer being home to a different wealth class - the lower the worse people have it in life and the bottom layers are near-inhospitable.# Section 1\nThe moon does have native wildlife, namely the Fang-rat - but most notably the Gank. This is a sentient alien species indigenous to Nar Shaddaa and the only one we know about so far. The Gank species is an intelligent, highly aggressive and unforgiving race known for their prowess and strength in battle. A bit like the Kaleesh and Tusken Raiders, nearly nobody outside their species know what they look like because of the high-tech armour they wear from head-to-toe. Members of this species usually worked as hired killers for criminal gangs. When the Hutts arrived on the moon, they began industrializing it, building spaceports and docks across the surface of the moon. It quickly began to prosper and traders, smugglers and pirates among other types flocked to the moon in droves - immigrating and building the very diverse population it has today. For the majority of the moon’s existence it’s been mostly controlled by the Hutt Cartel, though the government is often overshadowed and controlled in itself by all of the major Criminal Organizations present on the world who are constantly at war with each other. The moon is also a popular smuggling spot for Spice.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Smuggler’s Moon is a giant city, therefore it has all sorts of hotspots and interesting areas - far too many to list here. Notable points of interest would be the various Cantinas and Casinos around the moon, the different sectors such as the Corellian Sector and some would also consider the Undercity and Refugee Sector to be points of interest. Rumours have also come about that large research corporations use the lower layers such as the Undercity for shady experiments that would otherwise be illegal in the rest of the galaxy, since the law does not regulate it like in Republic and Empire controlled worlds.\n\n","meta":{"index":10,"author":"Zerthys","name":"Nar Shaddaa","release_year":2020}},"Hydian Way":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Hydian Way was a super-hyperroute established in 3705 BBY to 3693 BBY by renowned scout Freia Kallea, opening up much of the galaxy being the sole route that accompassed the entirety of it. It began on the Corporate Sector and went way past Eriadu, effectively accompassing past The Slice and fundamentally changing the state of galactic civilization. With this, the route was named after Duros scout Banu Hydia, a colleague of Freia Kallea. With the establishment of this hyperroute, the state of the galaxy is forever changed as it now compasses the Inner and Outer Rim regions with relative ease in comparison to previous routes.# Section 1\nThe beginning of the Hydian Way started at the Outer Rim world of Bonadan, streaking it’s way past Bandomeer and Taris to Bogden, within the Inner Rim. With this, the hyperroute would make its intersection with the well-known Corellian Run near Caamas, through the Perlemian Trade Route at Breental. The Way would then make its way through Alderaan, as well as Rendili, and would cross the Corellian Run again at the Inner Rim world of Denon. Continuing this, the route would go near Derra IV in the Expansion Regions and Malastare within the Mid Rim, crossing the Rimma Trade Route at Eriadu and would end at the Outer Rim.\n\n# Section 2\nWith the Hydian Way being one of the most important routes throughout the galaxy, its history should come as no surprise with relevancy. In her first advances into space, Freia Kallea would make advances into the regions beyond Farana would result in the creation of a reliable path through the Crombach Nebula, and the formation of a decisive route between Serenno and Telos IV. With this, two Neimoidian scouts named Thoax and Farge Ossax would hire Duros Banu Hydia to eliminate their growing competition, to which he would refuse. Freia Kallea would continue chartering routes south of Denon, eventually establishing a route to Demos IV by 3703 to 3702 BBY. \n[-]\n\nUpon her entry unto Malastare, Kallea would be captured and arrested by Thoax and Ossax’s thugs, with Hydia aiding in her rescue. She would attempt to continue their expansion, only to be crippled by the Neimoidians and force her ship into crash-landing on a relatively desolate world of Nuvar, where she would be rescued by Hydia 6 standard years later. In her return to civilization, she would begin to launch her scouting expeditions again, making her way past the Tosste System and would finalize her route with the Hydian Spur, ending on the luscious planet of Imynusoph. They would be caught under trap by the Neimoidians and their henchmen, ultimately resulting in the death of Hydia, who would be the namesake of the Hydian Way. Remaining stretches of former hyperspace routes would be sown into the Hydian Way by Kallea, with routes -such as the Morellian Trail, the Sprizen End Run, and the Dustig Trace, which would be absorbed into the Hydian Way in 3693 BBY, rejuvenating Malastre as a trading hub of the Way. \n\n[-]\n\n\tIn recent history, the Hydian Way would be a centerpiece of many conflict across the galaxy, with the Mandalorian blockade of the Hydian Way in 3661 BBY or 7 BTC in an attempt to choke the Republic’s trade in the region, to an extent even placing it under economic crisis. With this, the Republic would strike back under a Mirialan named Hylo Visz, who would drive the Mandalorian blockade from the Way, ending the time of turmoil and starvation with the Republic. She would be hailed as a hero of the Republic after.  In the Galactic War between the reinvigorated Sith Empire and the Republic, the Empire would blockade the Hydian Way with their Mandalorian mercenaries, with vast traps placed around the Way ambushing Republic convoys in redirected routes.  After century after century, the Eriadu Way would be eventually integrated into the Hydian Way, no longer becoming a separate hyperlane.

Due to the planet’s environment, it barely has any intelligent species living on it. However, a flying species named Tibidee could often be seen flying above the ground.# Section 1\nDuring the Clone Wars, an extremely secure prison was built on Stygeon Prime on top of a high mountain by the Separatists, they called it the Spire. This location was an excellent choice since even if the prisoners somehow managed to escape, they would not survive the long way down from the mountain. Anyone that was brought in had very little chance to escape unless they managed to hop on a Tibidee and use it to glide away from the prison, even then, without a ship they would not survive long outside the walls.\n\n# Section 2\nOne of the most dangerous Sith Lords and force wielders, Darth Maul was held in this facility during the Clone Wars.

Few well-protected spaceports have been built to connect cities on the planet. Because of her climate, Nal Hutta had few guests. Most things were done on Nar Shaddaa, Nal Hutta's largest moon. The capital of the planet was Bilbousa, where the Hutt Council sometimes held office. The majority of Hutta fauna has been extinct by Drengir, and the only native species which survived the invasion were the Hutts. Over time, new animals were brought to Hutta from different worlds.

In these sinkholes lived the Pau’ans and the Utai, collectively known as the Utaupauans, who both called Utapau their homeworld.# Section 1\nUtapau orbits a singular sun located 51,000 light-years from the core and has nine moons orbiting itself. The planet itself is comprised of a small molten core with a rocky mantle and a calcareous crust. Only 0.9% of Utapau’s surface is water, but below the crust is a vast underground ocean that has surrounded the planet. This subterranean ocean was formed when the surface oceans that once covered Utapau leaked away through the large caverns that once were magma chambers. Due to the erosion caused by these oceans leaking through the planet’s crust, giant sinkholes formed in the planet’s habitable, windswept savannas. The mineral deposits that resulted from these sinkholes acted as a major source of wealth for Utapau’s residents.\n\n# Section 2\nUtapau is a peaceful world, and its residents always attempted to remain neutral in times of galactic war and conflict. It is home to two symbiotic sentient species, whose ancestors settled the planet sometime after 57,000 BBY. 30 percent of the planet’s population consists of the Pau’ans, a thin, grey-skinned, lethargic race that acts as port masters, patricians, and bureaucrats; while the other 70 percent of Utapau’s population consists of the stout Utai, who act as the working class. Originally, these two races lived independently of each other, with the Pau’ans living above ground and the Utai living down underground. However, in the 10 thousand year period before the start of the Clone Wars, Utapau’s shifting climate caused the hyperwind storms on the planet’s surface to grow more intense. This caused the Pau’ans to retreat underground. In turn, both races reestablished connections with each other, and soon their sinkhole-dwelling communities developed considerably; and both species' architectural styles mixed into what is now known as Ossic, where animal bones were heavily used to support and build their cities that hid on the crevasses and ledges of Utapau’s many sinkholes. And to fuel these large cities, many windmill farms were constructed on the planet’s surface, serving as the source of 99% of the energy consumed by Utapauan communities. However, this didn’t result in both societies completely cooperating immediately. At first, the mixed populations were divided into city-states that occasionally skirmished and held small wars with each other. But with the effort of Utapauan nobles such as Timon Medan, all of these cities were brought together and unified.\n\n# Section 3\nUtapau, despite its constant attempts to remain neutral, has been the site of numerous battles during numerous wars. During the Clone Wars, their hand was forced in joining sides with the Separatists when the Master of Port Administration at the time, Tion Medan, was taken hostage by General Grievous and the Separatist Council. If Tion were to call for any assistance, Grievous threatened to retaliate with the destruction of Utapau’s capital, Pau City. Luckily for Tion, Jaing and Kom’rk Skirata located Grievous on the planet and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi went to Pau City to launch an ambush on the Separatists. With Tion having secretly given him the location of Grievous’ Droid Control Ship “Unlimited Projection,” Kenobi was able to catch Grievous off-guard. With support from Commander Cody’s 212th Attack Battalion, a detachment of the 501st Battalion, and local Utapauans, Kenobi killed General Grievous and won a decisive victory against the Separatists, marking the end of the Clone Wars. However, upon the issuing of Order 66 and the Declaration of a New Order, Kenobi’s clone troopers made an attempt on his life, which forced him to flee Utapau. Afterwards, the clones rounded up the members of the resistance movement, which included Tion Medan, and deported them to Byss, where they were used as servants for “recolonizing.”\n\n# Section 4\nLater, the Galactic Empire established a secret storehouse on Utapau, which included artifacts such as Grievous’ remains and his modified Bellbullab-22 starfighter. In 0 BBY the planet was predominantly controlled by the Fey Family, and there was some Rebel influence still remaining on the world. However, the Zann Consortium, an underground crime syndicate, had the opportunity to corrupt Utapau. They planned to do this by sending Nightsister Silri along with a detachment of Defilers, a pair of Missile Attack Launchers, and droideka Mark IIs to kidnap the head of the Fey Family, Garnak Fey. They believed this would force the Utapauan Government to cooperate with the Zann Consortium, and make them meet their demands. Once the Galactic Empire’s downfall started after the Battle of Endor, Utapau was one of the first worlds to join the New Republic, in an attempt to avoid being caught up in another war that could result in the Utapauans being dominated by outside forces again.\n\nHowever, during the Second Imperial Civil War, the remnants of the Galactic Alliance, led by Admiral Gar Stazi, built a base on Utapau after their victory on Mon Calamari against the Sith-Imperial forces. And following the Devastation of Da Soocha the Sith made their way onto the planet as well, when Sith scientist Vul Isen and Darth Azard set up a secret laboratory to study the planet’s flora and fauna to poison them and the Alliance; and they also planned to send an assassin to murder Gar Stazi. However, the Sith’s plans were thwarted by Jedi Knights Wolf Sazen and Cade Skywalker, along with Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue. Syn and Blue took care of Isen’s assassin, who was an Alliance Guard that was paid off by the Sith, Azard was mortally wounded by Sazen in a duel, and Isen herself was bisected by Skywalker before her plans of poisoning the planet came to fruition.\n\n# Section 5\nSince before the Clone Wars Utapau was one of the worlds that had an arms embargo restriction placed on it by the Trade Federation. Therefore, the Utapauan’s local defense fleet was centered only on downsized warships, most of which were designed and manufactured on Utapau itself; including a variant of the Rendili StarDrive Dreadnaught. This ship was capable of offering protection from pirates and marauders, but in terms of battleships, it was fairly outclassed by those made by rich, industrialized sectors. As an example, Utapau’s Dreadnaughts were merely one-fifth of the size of a Lucrehulk-Class battleship, and all of these dreadnaughts were destroyed by invading Separatist forces. \nYet on the other hand the Porax-38, Utapau’s main starfighter, was a tough long-range snubfighter that was designed for Utai pilots and could make extended interstellar patrols that lasted up to twenty days. These ships saw good use when the scattered Utapau Skyforce rallied to face the Separatists alongside Republic forces during the Battle of Utapau. And in addition to mechanical vehicles, the Utapau Skyforce also utilized dactillions; native flying reptiles that can carry riders into battle.\n\n","meta":{"index":61,"author":"JaccPrice","name":"Utapau","release_year":2021}},"Concord Dawn":{"content":"# Introduction\nConcord Dawn was an Outer Rim planet within the Concord Dawn system. The planet has suffered colossal damage due to wars or small squabbles. Nearly ? of the planet’s mass has been blasted to bits. However, Concord Dawn has a fair share of history, notably being the birthplace of Rako Hardeen and Jango Fett, two bounty hunters renowned (or despised, as bounty hunters are) for their works. Concord Dawn was governed and overseen by the Mandalorian Protectors, headed by Fenn Rau.# Section 1\nAround the time of the Age of the Empire, a congregation of Mandalorian warriors referred to as the Mandalorian Protectors set up a camp on Concord Dawn and began to rule the planet and its third moon. At their head was Fenn Rau, who forged an agreement with the Empire which had occupied their homeworld, Mandalore. In 3 BBY however, a group of rebels known as the Spectres, particularly Hera Syndulla and Sabine Wren, were attacked by the Protectors attempting to negotiate hyperspace routes. The leader of the Spectres, Kannan Jarrus, was sent to destroy their fighters to halt more conflict between them. However, Kannan had a double intention of attempting to negotiate. Sabine hid on Kannan’s ship, with the purpose of killing Fenn Rau for maiming Hera during the dogfight. When Jarrus got to the planet and spoke with Rau, Sabine Wren planted explosives on the Mandalorians’ Fang fighters. After being captured and assumed a bounty hunter by the Protectors, Wren demanded a duel with Rau, to honor the Mandalorian Code. Rau agreed to this duel. However, Sabine then set off the explosives that she had planted earlier, prompting Fenn Rau to attempt to capture the rebels. However, this was in vain and backfired, as Rau was captured by the rebels. Eventually, Rau was forced by the Spectres to let them use their hyperspace routes.\n\n# Section 2\nIn 2 BBY, the Protectors’ deal with the rebels to allow them to pass through Concord Dawn in order to escape Imperial Patrols was discovered by the Imperial Viceroy of Mandalore at the time, named Gar Saxon. Saxon attempted to lure Fenn Rau to the planet, who was offworld ever since his capture, by decimating his subordinates within the Mandalorian Protectors. After learning of this and Escaping Gar, Fenn Rau joined the rebellion. After this, when the Mandalorian Civil War broke out, Fenn Rau declared that the Mandalorian Protectors would join the other Mandalorians under Bo-Katan to lead them.\n\n# Section 3\nTo summarize, Concord Dawn was a planet characterized by its many wars, and is now a desolate planet. It is a warning of what can happen if a planet is abused over petty squabbles, as it now sits uninhabited, with nearly a third of the planet decimated by war. However, Concord was responsible for the Mandalorian Protectors, a prominent Mandalorian group, and two fearsome bounty hunters who still are venerated/feared by many. Though its time has passed, the legacy it has left on the Galaxy is remarkable.\n\n","meta":{"index":84,"author":"WhoopeyNight","name":"Concord Dawn","release_year":2021}},"Chad":{"content":"# Introduction\nChad was a planet in the Outer Rim Territories, it served as a homeworld for the Chadra-Fan race. It was located in the Jospro sector, inside the Chad system, being the only inhabited planet. The members of Chad’s government were either from local ranches or anarchistic clans. Most of the planet’s surface was covered in water, causing areas such as wetlands, swamps, bayous, and marshes to form. The only surfaces that could be walked on were the highlands and mountains. However, many inhabitants chose to live on the ocean on ranch-arks and sail barges. Knowing that their homes could be destroyed and civilization damaged by the huge waves, some chose simply to live on top of tall trees. Due to the warm climate of the planet, it often rained heavily on the highlands as well. Storms and hurricanes could often be seen moving through the deep oceans. There were barely any variations during different seasons, and despite the overwhelming degree of heat, the north pole surprisingly still froze during winters. Whenever the ocean floors shaked on Chad, a tidal wave, or a “death wave”, as the Chadra-Fan had named them, was expected to arrive. These massive waves killed hundreds of thousands of the inhabitants, mostly Chadra-Fan and Humans, while wiping out their property.

But the war came to them nonetheless.” - Bly.\n\nOut of the (7) planets within the Honoghr system, Honoghr is the only one to contain a permanent and stable living species called the Noghri who consider the planet to be their homeworld. This planet is particularly interesting considering that the entire planet is made up of one land-mass, it’s only continent.# Section 1\nHISTORY\nUnsurprisingly, the Rakatan Infinite Empire had dominated the planet and annexed it as part of their conquest in roughly 30,000 BBY. The Rakatan ancient ruins of a once owned temple remained as evidence, and the Noghri utilised this as a sacred area to their people.\n\nThe Sith had also once used the temple as a training camp for Sith Warriors and Marauders during the New Sith Wars period. The Yuuzhan Vong had also laid assault to the planet at one point.\n\nUnfortunately, a cataclysmic disaster brought the planet to its knees in 20 BBY when a Lucrehulk-class Core ship during a starship battle plummeted into its mass. This alone would not have been deadly; however, the ship contained Trihexalophine 1138, a deadly toxin that consumed the planet.\n\nThe toxin left the planet barren, killing all it’s plant life and most of its ecological systems. The hunter-gathers at the time, Noghri, travelled across the planet to refuge areas or oasis’s where they could survive and escape starvation.\n\nLater on, during the Galactic Empire period, Darth Vader visited the planet. His soldiers had actually been killed by the natives. The Noghri still had primitive weapons at the time, and being able to kill the Stormtroopers had impressed Lord Vader.\n\n# Section 2\nLord Vader in kind restored the planet to its former beauty in exchange for the Noghri’s skills who would serve him as assassins. These assassins titled “Death Commandos” were deceived as the grass on the planet was actually a hybrid of the toxin and still poisoned the local Noghri.\n\nGalen Marek, Tao and Ennix Devian, (3) of Vader’s apprentices were also later trained on the planet by having them fight and survive Noghri hunting groups.\n\nLater on, a Zann Consortium sent a task force to the planet in order to kill Commander Malinth, an imperial commander stationed there. This led to conflict with the Noghri who sided with the Empire against the empires. The Noghri were defeated.\n\nDuring the Thrawn crisis in 9 ABY, Leia Organa Solo visited the planet and convinced the Noghri (being the daughter of Lord Vader) to abandon the Empire. They would seize their freedom, join the alliance and never be deceived again.\n\nThis very relevant and important species became part of the New Republic and their respective clan, Kim's Bar represent them in the senate.\n\n","meta":{"index":8,"author":"Souleth","name":"Honoghr","release_year":2021}},"Mandalore":{"content":"# Introduction\nMandalore is the fifth planet located within the Mandalore system. The said system is also a part of the Outer Rim Territories and is close to the Hydian Way trade route. The planet sits at the end of the lane called Mandalorian Road, an ancient route that connected Mandalore to another planet by the name of Corsin that was located in the Inner Rim.# Section 1\nThe planet has normal gravity levels and two moons, including a well-known mining and agricultural center, Concordia. Both Mandalore and Concordia were unique in the way that they had an iron ore that was known by the name of beskar. It was known to be indestructible and capable of withstanding hits from all weapons, even lightsabers. Metalsmiths used beskar to make armor, weapons, and starships. Besides its plentiful amount of ore, Mandalore possessed a breathable atmosphere with days made up of 19 hours. Meaning that a year on the planet of Mandalore lasted for a total of 366 days.\n\n# Section 2\nBefore the reign of the Mandalorians, the planet was roamed by mythosaurs. These beats were known to compete with cities when it came to their size. Not much later, Taung warriors arrived on the planet and set out to slaughter them in order to conquer the new world. Mandalore is covered by veshok trees that were mostly native to the northern hemisphere. Winters on the planet were taken over by heavy amounts of snow and freezing cold temperatures. On the other hand, you would see herbivores called shatuals living within the dense forest. They were known to live there alongside strills that called them prey. You could also find galek trees, wild mushrooms, and serpentine rawl throughout the forest of northern Mandalore.\n\n# Section 3\nIf you traveled up north of the forest you would find Keldabe that served as the capital of Mandalore since 3960 BBY. The city was also the meeting point for government officials across the whole Mandalore system. Some time passed and up rose a new faction known as the New Mandalorians. They began running their base of operations within the city of Sundari. The city was conveniently located over an expansive beskar mine. Keldabe, on the other hand, was surrounded by lush forests and the waters of the Kelita with farmlands perfect for their growing culture. The Oyu’baat hotel and tap cafe were housed in Keldabe and later became the hub for clans and the Mand’alor. Operations were run here until 40 ABY when MandalMotors Hall was constructed. Most of Manadlore’s settlements were built where there was lots of fortification so the citizens living there would feel at ease. One of the prominent settlements was the town of Norg Bral which housed members of Clan Bralor. Architecture for the towns and cities of Mandalore was diverse like the people who lived within them. The design, structure, etc. would vary depending on the region and the specific inhabitants that lived there. Ranging from towers of steel and granite to durasteel, and even amongst the trees.\n\n# Section 4\nThe Taung arrived on the planet Mandalore due to being driven from Coruscant by the Battalions of Zhell. They would arrive on the planet Mandalore near 7000 BBY, which they originally named the planet Manda’yaim or “Home of the Manda’lor”. They would soon come to want more planets under their control, they would abandon their Mandalorian space by the 3996 BBY during the Great Sith War. They went to other Star systems to try to conquer them, being dubbed the Mandalorian Crusaders. As the attacks of the Mandalorian Crusaders increased, a new faction within the Mandalorians planet, named Neo-Crusaders. However as the number of planets within their control grew, a new enemy arrived, named Jedi Knight Revan. The efforts of Mandalore the Ultimate were in vain, as he was defeated; many Mandalorians after losing their leader came to be mercenaries, bounty hunters, or regular citizens that moved back to the central planet of the Mandalore system. Many years arrived when veteran mercenary Aga Awaud returned to his home planet Mandalore. He was met with raiders trying to take over their planet during an era of many deaths due to the Candorian plague. Aga Awaud would reunite the scattered Mandalorian tribes across the galaxy, with Aga becoming the Manda’lor.\n\n# Section 5\nAt the end of the New Sith Wars, the Mandalorians pushed themselves to become a more technologically adept and rigid, militant society. As they grew more powerful, the Jedi became more alarmed and attacked the Mandalorian clans, but as a new era came, a new clan of “New Mandalorians” arrived. They were peaceful Mandalorians who created their own small cities in the deserts of Mandalore. The New Mandalorian with their new wealth of beskar and their love of advanced technology was named the faithless for turning their backs against the old traditions. Then in 60 BBY, a new leader arose Jaster Mereel, he served as a law officer where he would fall from grace. His strong morals drove him to murder a corrupt officer. Mereel disliked the old traditions of conquering and changed them by implementing the Supercommando Codex, a new behavioral guide to being better, something close to Mereel’s morals. With new rules comes the opposition, a new group called the Death Watch appeared, their leader Tor Vizsla. With a new group growing, Mandalore was led into a Civil War. As the war raged on, Mandalorians living off-world did not join and those in the Mandalore sector also did not join. At the end of the war, Jaster Mereel was defeated, and Tor Vizsla was the victor. However Mereel’s son, Jango Fett took command of the True Mandalorians. He would later be sold into servitude after being wrongfully captured by a Jedi strike team, led by the scheming Death Watch. After his escape from servitude, although he was able to take his revenge on Tor Vizsla, he grew very distant from his people. With an old Civil War gone, a new civil war arose, named the Great Clan Wars because of how much damage the new war gave to each clan. In the war, there was betrayal, fights within the clans, etc. and at the end of the war, a lot of the warlord chieftains either joined the New Mandalorians or went into exile on the moon Concordia.\n\n# Section 6\nIn this era, during the Clone Wars, Jango Fett perished but 10 years earlier, his DNA was taken to make a secret army for the Republic.

The world was mostly covered in dry grasslands with occasional rainforests hiding in wetter meadows. Besides the Amanin, the only sentient beings that inhabited Maridun before the Imperial Era was a group of Lurmen. The Lurmen were seeking refuge from the enslavement of the Intergalactic Banking Clan on Mygeeto. Many non-sentient species are native to Maridun. There is enough non-sentient life on Maridun for the Amanin tribes to sustain themselves solely on hunting for food rather than agriculture.# Section 1\nOne of the non-sentient species native to Maridun is the Mastiff phalone, which is, in essence, an eagle with four strong legs rather than wings. Another creature from Maridun is the Charnoq, a horned crocodile-like predator with eight legs that even the Amanin feared. A more peaceful non-sentient species native to Maridun is the Carrier butterfly. The Carrier butterfly is favored by Lurmen colonists because it can relay messages by repeating words that it hears. Due to its usefulness, the Carrier butterfly is a common pet of Lurmen colonists. The Amanin keep the native Fwit as their pets and guardians. Fwits are half-meter-tall predatory mammals that favor fresh meat and blood above all else. They are so vicious that even the Galactic Empire disliked them, resulting in the Imperials encouraging hunters to eliminate them whenever they saw them.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Amanin seemed to tolerate the Lurmen’s presence, as the Lurmen colony settled in the grasslands rather than the rainforests that the Amanin tribes called home. The colony of Lurmen refugees, motivated by the horrors of the Clone Wars, embraced pacifism. Their devotion to nonviolence was so great that they almost let a Separatist General, Lok Durd, test his experimental Defoliator tank on them without even offering resistance. Without the efforts of a marooned group of Jedi and clones, the colony would have perished. While they held onto their pacifism, they accepted the need for defense.\n\n# Section 3\nWhile the Lurmen colonists were strict pacifists, the native Amanin tribes were anything but. The Amanin tribes regularly engaged each other in ritual battles, called takital, over territory in the rainforests they inhabited. Being incredibly primitive, the Amanin relied solely on hunting and gathering to feed themselves, despite the Lurmen proving that agriculture on Maridun was practical. When they defeated other tribes, it was not uncommon for them to enslave the survivors. They were open to selling their slaves to the Imperials who later occupied the world.\n\n# Section 4\nAfter the Galactic Empire officially discovered Maridun in 11 BBY, initial interactions between the Imperials and Amanin tribes were anything but peaceful. After accidentally trespassing onto a sacred site, an Imperial army was besieged for two days before the Amanin recognized the Imperials as worthy opponents.

It was the primitive Wampa species' homeworld.# Section 1\nDue to its extensive snow and ice cover, the planet of Hoth seemed to be a pale blue sphere from space. Between Hoth and its sun, there were five planets, and an asteroid belt encircled the planet, with meteors sometimes reaching the surface. Glaciers and frozen ice plains covered the majority of its surface. Oceans covered another 2/3 of the planet. Even though it was always cold, the temperature was known to plummet below -60°C at night.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, it was home to Echo Base, the Alliance to Restore the Republic's temporary headquarters until the Galactic Empire tracked them down, resulting in the Battle of Hoth. Scavengers set up temporary base camps on the planet in the months afterward to scrap the AT-ATs that had been destroyed. During the months following the Battle of Endor, reports circulated that the New Republic intended to turn Hoth into a prison for Empire loyalists, but the veracity of these claims was questioned.Chancellor Mon Mothma had been dedicated to a pretense of justice over punishment, thus rumors were rejected. During the Iron Blockade, the war returned to Hoth, which was the site of yet another fight.\n\n# Section 3\nThe ice planet of Hoth was the scene of a fight between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance, which had set up its temporary headquarters, Echo Base, there. The Imperials, however, had located the Alliance outpost within a month after the Rebels' arrival on the planet, owing to one of the thousands of probe droids they had dispatched throughout the galaxy. Despite the fact that Echo Base was evacuated at the eleventh hour, the Alliance was clearly defeated at the Battle of Hoth, which was won by the elite Imperial Blizzard Force.\n\n# Section 4\nScavengers set up temporary base camps on the planet in the months following the Battle of Hoth to scrap the AT-ATs destroyed by the Rebel Alliance during the Empire's onslaught.

Scarif was no short of a tropical paradise. If it wasn’t for the dangerous wildlife and ecosystem, it would be a very nice place to be. The planet was also dense with valuable resources that could be used for starship construction, but because of its remote location within the Outer Rim it was not used a lot for this purpose.# Section 1\nThe Galactic Empire built the Imperial Center of Military Research and housed the Empire’s deepest military secrets as well as any information the Empire wished to keep hidden from the Imperial Senate.

The challenge in this route was not getting caught by Imperial ships that were guarding the movement of spice from Kessel. Han Solo famously completed this route in 12 parsecs.\n\nThe route took travelers who were in realspace (which is the perception of space when traveling at less than the speed of light) around the Maw cluster, or simply the Maw. This was a cluster of black holes, and due to the gasses being drawn into it, it was made visible and was even hailed as one of the Wonders of the Galaxy. It was somewhat of a mystery, and many believed it was created by an advanced civilization. Because of the gravity of the black holes, the Kessel system was also slowly drawn into the Maw. Also due to these gravitational forces, smugglers often noticed that their ships were being pulled apart. Smuggler Han Solo skirted around this cluster instead of simply avoiding it to achieve a run of fewer parsecs. \n\nAfter smugglers were out of the Maw, they would reach the homestretch - The Pit. This was an area of stray asteroids, which were dispersed across the arm of a nebula. While this area was easy to navigate through, smugglers who got to this point were often so relieved that they would lose focus and collide with an asteroid, destroying their spacecraft.# Section 1\nHan Solo famously boasted about his 12 parsec Kessel Run.

Seeing as this was the 4th moon circling the planet, it was named Yavin 4. This moon was known mainly for its extremely prominent role within the Galactic Civil War, that being a base for the Rebel Alliance. The flora of this moon were ubiquitous, with the entire moon being densely covered in foliage, yet the moon had a surprisingly comfortable and temperate climate - at the cost of having dangerous fauna and a very unforgiving ecosystem. Some predators there included things like the Howler, a dangerous creature that derived its name from its piercing cries that could stun prey easily, or more subtle creatures such as the crystal snake, a snake that had nonlethal venom capable of making a victim fall into an hour-long sleep, as well as many other forms of wildlife, chiefly reptilian, aquatic or amphibious. The moon experienced only two seasons, though each was very extreme. These two were a wet season, covering the moon in rain, or a dry season, which caused the moon to become extremely dry and hot. This moon was also the place where two Rebel veterans, Shara Bey and Kes Dameron, settled down and had a son, Poe Dameron. It was here that they also planted a force sensitive tree that once grew on the planet Ahch-To, and was made of the same wood the ancient library in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant was made out of.# Section 1\nLong before the Rebel Alliance’s occupation of Yavin 4, another tribe, the Massassi, a race in tune with, and also that fed off (in a literal sense) the dark side of the Force, occupied the moon. This race originated from the planet Korriban, the homeworld of the Sith, who were the primary users of the dark side of the Force. This race was the original conceptualizers and creators of the Great Temple, which they had built under enslavement by a Sith Lord named Naga Sadow, a prominent Sith Lord who had also mutated the Massassi using Sith Alchemy, a rejected ability by the Jedi Order that allowed a Force user to bend things to their will. Preceding this, the Temple was then used long after the extinction of the Massissi, by the Alliance to Restore the Republic, or simply the Rebel Alliance, as their main base of operations. It is from here that Operation Fracture came to fruition, which was an operation carried out by the Rebel Alliance to sabotage the superweapon known as the Death Star by extracting a scientist known as Galen Erso in order to get him to testify its existence to the Imperial Senate.\n\n# Section 2\nFollowing this, small fighter squadrons were dispatched from the moon’s surface with the order to destroy the Death Star. These fighters were occupied by some prominent figures, most notably Luke Skywalker, who, using his knowledge of the force, fired off a missile shot into a vulnerable part of the superweapon, thus blowing it up and bringing an end to the Empire’s sinister plan. After Luke and his friends Han Solo and Chewbacca were honored during a subsequent award ceremony, the rebels evacuated the base, out of fear that the Empire may strike back with their own planetary missiles. The rebels barely managed to escape the moon after an Imperial-Class Star Destroyer accompanied by some TIE fighters began to attack the Rebel headquarters, but the Destroyer was hijacked. Here the rebels learnt that the course of attack for the destroyer was pre-programmed to fire at their headquarters. A rebel named Evaan Verlaine was able to just barely veer the lazers off course, however, by ramming the destroyer with a Raider-class corvette.\n\n# Section 3\nShortly after the evacuation, a rebel force was sent back in order to extract Rebel information from the moon that had been left there. Once the Extraction Team arrived, they saw that the Empire had taken the planet over. The extraction failed and instead resulted in the Empire taking the information, which they wouldn't have found if it weren't for the rebels, for their own purposes.\n\nOverall, the moon of Yavin 4 was a moon with a rich history, despite the jungle-covered planet’s unassuming appearance.\n\n","meta":{"index":64,"author":"Whoopeynight","name":"Yavin 4","release_year":2021}},"Fest":{"content":"# Introduction\nFest was a primary planet located in the Outer Rim Territories of the Atrivis Sector.

The Empire then populated Delrakkin City with Imperial citizens. They installed a massive ion cannon on the side of the mountain to defend the Imperial citizens from any threats. During the Empire’s reign, groups of Stenax immigrated to Delrakkin after their homeworld of Stenos was also invaded by the Empire. The Stenax were sent there to see if Delrakkin would be a good candidate for conquest, as they were doing on many other Outer Rim worlds. They also examined the technology of the Delrakkin, only to find it rather primitive.\n\n# Section 2\nIn 0 ABY, Delrakkin almost became the subject of an Imperial experiment led by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. He planned to use the planet to test the new interdictor technology, which would prevent enemy ships from going into hyperspace. This technology was going to be developed under extreme secrecy. To ensure that nobody caught wind of his tests, he ordered Admiral Termo to eliminate the planet's populace using Rebellion ships and to frame the Rebel Alliance for the act. However, the scheme was foiled by the Rebellion leaders Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Leia Organa, and they evacuated the civilians on the planet.\n\n","meta":{"index":6,"author":"Scrubadubub4282","name":"Delrakkin","release_year":2020}},"Gand":{"content":"# Introduction\nGand was a planet that was located in the Outer Rim territories Shadola sector, specifically located in The Slice past the Centrality and bordering the Wild Space region.

While the native species on the planet is the Mluki, multiple species have immigrated to Belsavis such as Humans, Duros, Ho’Din and even the former occupant Rakata species.# Section 1\nWhile the exact date of the planet's discovery is a mystery to historians, Belsavis' earliest recording was during the Infinite Empire reign of the Rakata species. They used the planet as a prison colony placing dangerous prisoners around the galaxy there, making their imprisonments last a millennium. It was around the year 5000 BBY that the planet had entered an ice age, the inhabitants of the planet had to take refuge in three volcanic rifts for survival. Later after the planet's end of the ice age, Belsavis was used by the Republic during the Great Galactic War. The use for the planet's prison was not for regular prisoners, but it was for bigger threats such as Sith Lords or war criminals. By the time that the Galactic War started, the Sith Empire had learned of Belsavis from the help of the known crime lord Ivory through a Rakata transmitter to set up a mass prison break. This plan would also have the goals of freeing the Dread Masters and taking Rakata secrets for themselves during the break. While this plan was set in motion, the Sith Emperor had sent Krannus to destroy Belsavis. Doing this would cause a disruption of shockwaves into hyperspace, destroying an adjacent system near Belsavis and fulfilling the genocide plan of the Sith Emperor. This goal was stopped by the Hero of Tython, saving the cold planet of Belsavis. Later on in the year 88 BBY, a community by the name of Pletts Well would be established. This community was created by Jedi Master Plett, and it was then later nicknamed Plawal.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Republic would enter its era of colonization in the year 20 BBY. The planet would be the importer of various plants and animals from the planet of Ithor for colonization. Jedi Master Plett has hidden himself and a few younglings in Pletts Well as protection from the Great Jedi Purge. The “Eye of Palpatine” was sent to bombard and wipe out the town. This was stopped by Jedi Knights Callisto Ming and Geith Eris, who managed to sabotage the Eye. While this did save some of the younglings and the Jedi Master, they were forced to move to another hideout. Sadly not all of them escaped. A few younglings such as Rogando Ismaren for example were captured by Inquisitorius that pursued them. Belsavis later entered an era of political and economic events years after the fall of the republic. It included the tariff police that were installed on Belsavis to crack down on smuggler activity in 6 BBY. Then a little over five years later, the Brathflen Corporation and other fruit companies established domes around Belsavis for harvest.\n\n# Section 3\nThe political situation did not end there. As of twelve years after the battle of Yavin IV, a large shipment of Tenloss Disintegrator rifles were stolen on Nar Shaddaa. While it was known Belsavis had chosen the path of independence over joining the New Republic, they  were later assisted by Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa Solo and Callisto. The reason being that Rogonda Ismaren had staged a coup on Belsavis as she used her son Irek Ismaren force-sensitive powers to control the Eye and become the new Emperor.

The soil in the badlands was unique – an electrostatic compound with photosensitive properties.\nDespite the barren nature of the badlands, Moorja's surface was predominantly fertile, although poor crop management strained its productivity. The planet relied on artificial fertilizers to sustain its agricultural output. Notably, Moorja was devoid of native sentient species, but it was home to the bruwoses, immense lizards that inhabited the badlands. These reptiles relied on heat, sound, and smell rather than eyesight for navigation, possessing large fore-paw talons for burrowing and capturing prey.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems established a base on Moorja to gather soil from the badlands, later utilizing it during the assault on Ukio. The planet fell under Confederate control, with organic forces deployed for defense, a rare occurrence for the battle droid-focused government. The ensuing Battle of Moorja witnessed clashes between the Confederacy and the Galactic Republic.\nWith the rise of the Galactic Empire, Moorja came under Imperial control and became a hub for advanced scout training. The planet hosted a clandestine scout trooper training facility, which also served as a political favor to an Imperial Navy officer hailing from Moorja. However, the planet experienced a skirmish during the Galactic Civil War as Imperial forces and Moff Utoxx Prentioch vied for access to a New Republic reconnaissance report prepared by the Black Curs.\nIn subsequent years, the New Republic gained control of Moorja, establishing a permanent base and utilizing it as a strategic launching point against Imperial forces. The planet remained relatively unaffected by the Yuuzhan Vong War due to its location outside the invasion vector. Over a century later, it fell under Darth Krayt's Sith Empire.\n\n# Section 3\nMoorja hosted a diverse population. The Salliche Agricultural Corporation attracted settlers from various species, including Arcona, who worked in salt mines; Ithorians, who harvested specialty fruits and crops; and Humans, who constituted the majority of the permanent population.\nKey locations on Moorja included the Confederate base, situated in the mountains overlooking the badlands, which served as the operational center for the Confederacy during the Clone Wars. Moorjay, the planet's primary spaceport and major settlement, provided a hub for trade and was surrounded by expansive farmland and smaller agrarian settlements like Avisio. The Moorja Training Installation, located on the edge of the crumbling badlands, served as a refresher course facility for Imperial scout troopers.\n\n","meta":{"index":27,"author":"DioneSenko","name":"Moorja","release_year":2021}},"Kiffu-Kiffex":{"content":"# Introduction\nKiffu was a planet that was in the Inner Rim inside of the galaxy.

The two types of fauna on the planet were a spark-dragon and a static tree. The people of the planet spoke the galactic basic standard. \n\nThe world of Kiffu was a larger world compared to Kiffex. When both of the worlds got near each other, large lightning storms occurred around Kiffu’s atmosphere. The natives learned to control the lightning, so they could utilize the electrical energy from the storms.\n\nDuring 3663 BBY the planet was taken and turned into a place for the Sith Empire to abide in. The planet was required to be withdrawn by the Galactic Republic due to the Treaty of Coruscant. Once the Cold War ended, Kiffu joined the Galactic Republic.

It has three moons and only has one major city; the Yorn Skot mining station, which is responsible for the extraction and selling of the planet’s tibanna gas. The settlement itself had a wide variety of species, all under the employ of a man known as Clode Rhoden. These species included but were not limited to the Duros, Given, and Humans. Clode Rhoden also used his luxury cruise liner, the Aurorient Express, to attract many other and more prominent species, such as various Hutts.\n\n# Section 2\nYorn Skot was originally governed and owned by a man known as Clode Rhoden whose wealth was attributed to the mining of tibanna gas found in the planet’s atmosphere. Due to his lack of ecological concern, Clode Rhoden was always a target for various eco-terrorists, most notably the group known as the Green Forge. During the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Treetower was sent to Yorn Skot to disrupt a smuggling operation being done by the Trade Federation, the goods of which were Ugnaughts. Following the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Admiral Coy’s ship, the Mathayus, intercepted a Rebel Alliance distress call from Yorn Skot. The Admiral decided to investigate, sending First Officer Atali and a detachment of stormtroopers to board the ship that had sent the distress call.

Being that close allowed some creatures to fly between the planet and the moon. These creatures made life hard for the native humans to the point a huge walled city was made.# Section 1\nHumans were first brought to Onderon by a colony ship sometime around 5200 to 4600 BBY. Due to the fauna around the world the early settlements soon expanded into what became the only city of the planet, Iziz. The early Onderonians are described as peaceful before the best and soon learned to hunt and kill them.

The Zeltrons were the ones responsible for encouraging a hedonistic doctrine, making the planet go through what seemed to be an endless state of revelry. It is believed that many of those who visited the planet were so taken in by the celebratory atmosphere of Zeltros and its population that they found it very difficult to leave the planet.\n\nSection I: The Luxurious Nature of Zeltros\nThe Zeltron race was very appreciative of beauty and luxury, which eventually led to the creation of numerous pieces of luxurious art and architecture that covered the planet’s surface. Living beings who visited the planet could find a large variety of entertainment sources, such as clubs, amusement parks, theaters, parties, etc. A well known fact about Zeltros is that the inhabitants of the planet are extremely obsessed with leisure and pleasure, even leading to the point where there are almost always planetary parties happening at Zeltros, and if there aren’t any parties occurring, the Zeltrons would focus their efforts on throwing one.\n\nSection II: Planetary Invasions\nDespite their leisure, the Zeltrons managed to establish and maintain a considerable defense force, although it lacked planetary shielding and was vulnerable to orbital bombardments. However, every invasion against the planet ended up being a failure, due to the celebratory atmosphere and the powerful pheromones of the Zeltrons.

Their support went as far as to willingly hand over their Force-sensitive newborns to the Jedi Order, as the people felt they could live a better life, away from the misfortunes of Vaklin. Vaklin respected the Jedi Order greatly, due to their assistance in multiple crises that occurred over time.

Obroa-skai’s expansive library and galactic knowledge, along with their numerous institutions, led Grand Admiral Thrawn to raid its central computer system, in order to receive the hidden location of Wayland, to claim the cloaking shield technology and thousands of Spaarti cloning cylinders that he would eventually use in his war against the New Republic, a galactic government established by the Alliance to Restore the Republic and replace the Galactic Empire after the Battle of Endor. The raid also was a distraction used on the New Republic’s forces prior to the Battle of Sluis Van, the first major military conflict of the Thrawn campaign orchestrated to steal a plethora of New Republic ships.\n\nObroa-skai was then captured by the Yuuzhan Vong in the First Battle of Obroa-skai, during their invasion of the Galaxy, where they installed yammosk into the planet’s mantle. Yammosk were war coordinators during battles who would transmit orders to other spacecraft to optimize their operations. Because of the Fire Battle of Obra-skai, much was lost from the archives, luckily hardcopies were saved prior to the assault. The Yuuzhan Vong were able to keep many of the hardcopies unsevered until they could fully translate them, along with the planet’s structures which were also kept unharmed, despite heavy Vonforming, otherwise known as terraforming, on other areas of the world.\n\nIn the Second Battle of Obroa-skai, the world was taken from the Vong by the New Republic, and the yammosk was destroyed. In 43 ABY, Obroa-skai was finally recovered from the Yuuzhan Vong War, along with the terraforming on its surface.

Throughout the Clone Wars, the planet was the base of operations for the manufacturing company known as the Colicoid Creation Nest, which designed several droids and ships for the Confederacy of Independent Systems. It notably produced the droideka, which was engineered in the likeness of their inventors, as well as the droid tri-fighter, whose design imitated the skulls of a native predator.# Section 1\nThe planet had become a battleground during the Clone Wars and was later transformed into an Imperial Fortress world by 4 ABY. In 5 ABY, the New Republic celebrated its victory after liberating the planet from Imperial control. Within 20 years, the planet’s population numbered over 100 million, with estimates reaching up to 500 million.

This system served as a home for Kage and Belugans. Quarzite had a high atmospheric pressure rendering its surface, nothing was capable of living there. However, there was a huge crystallized cave system beyond the planet’s surface, capable of supporting life. Apart from beautiful purple glowing crystals, these caverns also included its own water basins, huge lakes, fungal growth, and lichens. Viewed from space, Quarzite appeared as a dull greyish world along with layers of clouds and violet flashes.# Section 1\nBelugans were an aquatic species, yet humanoid, and native to Quarzite. Belugans mostly seized control over the planet with their advanced technology. With this superior advantage, Belugans were able to construct strongholds, outposts, and subtrams. Subtram was a vehicle similar to hovertrain and was supported by large rings that were attached to its tracks. During the Clone Wars, Lord Otua Blank, the tyrannical leader of Belugans led both Kage and Belugans to a long-lasting conflict by using his own people to capture Pluma Sodi. Blank had developed a craving interest for this Kage female. Desiring her to be his bride. \nThis act did not go unseen and Pluma was eventually rescued with the help of Asajj Ventress.\n\n# Section 2\nApart from Belugans, Kage were the other living species native to the planet Quarzite. They were near-human species, despite resembling humans, their striking eyes and pale skin set them apart from humans. Kage had to form a warrior team to fight against the tyrannical leader of Belugans. Since a head to head on fight was not possible due to Belugans having far more superior technology compared to them, they began infiltrating subtrams for supplies and equipment. When Pluma Sodi was captured, his brother Krismo Sodi who was also the leader of the Kage Warriors, sent their whole strike team to rescue her. The Belugans hired Bounty Hunters to escort Pluma to Lord Otua Blank’s Stronghold in a substram. It did not take long until the rescue arrived and caught the substram. After Krismo’s attack failed, Pluma was able to develop an understanding with Ventress that allowed her and Krismo to escape.\n\n","meta":{"index":15,"author":"AnkCheddar","name":"Quarzite","release_year":2021}},"Imperial Center Oversector":{"content":"# Introduction\nAfter the Declaration of a New Order, what used to be known as the Coruscant Oversector, was now the Imperial Center Oversector. Among those official names, many pilots also referred to it as Sector Zero or Sector 1. It covered every system with positive galactic coordinates which began with 0 - hence its alternate name stated previously. On the Galactic Map, it resembled the shape of a wedge roughly a third of a circle in size to the galactic “southeast” of Coruscant. It was named “oversector” because it also covered the Azure Sector and the planet Kiribi (5000 LY away from the Colonies Region).\n\nIn the age of the Galactic Republic, during the Clone Wars, it served as the theatre of operations for the 1st Sector Army (1 of 20). Due to its nature, it saw very little action for most of the war when compared to the rest of the Systems armies - with the only major conflict arising in the Battle of Anaxes in 19 BBY in the Axum system. Other smaller outposts were attacked and destroyed in 20 BBY by Dua Ningo’s Bulwark Fleet which consequently caused the deployment of the Republic’s first Victory-class Star Destroyer. Anaxes - known as the Defender of the Core - was the oversector’s capital planet and remained as such during Imperial rule.\n\nIn the age of the Galactic Empire, the oversector remained relatively unchanged in comparison to its Republic era counterpart. At the height of Imperial authority within the oversector, it was home to the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Whelm and 57 other Imperial capital ships.

The planet is mainly covered by forests, consisting of unique trees with high metal content, and low mountains. The Neti left Myrkr at some time before 4000 BBY and initiated a colony on planet Ryyk. Other native species can also be found such as the non-sentient Ysalamiri and Vornskr, which are both known to have the ability to control the Force.\n\nIn the capital city of Myrkr, a small town called Hyllyard City served as the biggest urban settlement and commercial hub of the planet. Smugglers, malcontents, and fugitives from other star systems mainly settled on the planet to perform smuggling operations and illegal activities.# Section 1\nIn 3963 BBY during the Mandalorian Wars, a battle occurred. The Republic Forces and the Mandalorians fought to the brim, experiencing casualties of over 2,000 in one night. As a result, the Republic managed to acquire a Neo-Crusader shock armor, a Mandalorian armor worn by the Shock Troopers, and studied it.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, pirates, criminals, and bounty hunters mostly hid from the Jedi on Myrkr since the Order usually stayed away from the Ysalamiri. Due to the high metal content present on the planet, they used it as a place for a base of operations. Although the planet may be an interesting planet, people usually ignore it.\n\nSince Ysalamiri are known to have the ability to repel and suppress the Force, a crime syndicate, Zann Consortium, infiltrated the planet during the Galactic Civil War. They utilized the Ysalamiri’s interesting way of controlling the Force by training Vornskrs and building cages for them and using it for their Mobile Defense Units–a vehicle capable of doing a variety of tasks.\n\nIn 9 ABY, a smuggling base called “Myrkr Base” was built by Talon Karrde–a male smuggler– that served as a base of operations for Karrde’s organization. Imperial forces moved on to the planet to acquire more of the Ysalamiri during Grand Admiral Thrawn’s campaign.\n\nThe sentient species, Yuuzhang Vong, also conquered the planet and utilized Vornskrs and Xyn to create the Voxyn which were a hybrid of the two species. They were designed to hunt every Force-sensitive they see. The Baanu Rass worldship, manufactured by the Yuuzhan Vong Empire, was orbiting around Myrkr and cloned the Voxyn. Later, the Myrkr Strike Team–a team of Jedi led by Anakin Solo–infiltrated the worldship to eliminate the Voxyn. Anakin Solo was killed and Baanu Rass was successfully demolished. The Domain Lah worldship then orbited around the planet.\n\nDuring the Second Galactic Civil War, Jacen Solo, together with Tahiri Veila, used a Force ability known as the flow-walking–an ability that allows the user to see and alter the past and the future–to recall the Myrkr mission. Jacen only used this power not to see the past but to manipulate Tahiri to be loyal to him. They were able to revisit the mission and Tahiri managed to kiss Anakin one last time before his death.\n\n","meta":{"index":19,"author":"kurtnicolo","name":"Myrkr","release_year":2020}},"Kooriva":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe planet Kooriva (M-14 on galactic coordinates) was a terrestrial tropical planet.

The Koorivar would maintain hold of the planet for several millennia, but would eventually be kicked out by the native species of the planet with the help of the Galactic Republic, forced to wander in space for a few centuries. Despite that, the Koorivar eventually managed to gain enough support to buy back the planet and settled on it once more to thrive financially.\n\n# Section 2\nThe planet became involved in galactic politics, gaining a representation in the Galactic Senate, with its senator Passel Argente becoming a pawn of  Darth Sidious (AKA Sheev Palpatine).

It was formed as a rejection of centralized power, and as a result, there was no government in the region beyond that of the noble houses. Senex-Juvex developed into a zone of huge, aristocrat-ruled farming worlds, leisure planets, and wilderness worlds designated for nobles' safaris. The native species of the region were almost totally subjugated to the Human aristocrats. The Senex-Juvex bordered the Ninth Quadrant, the Agarix sector, the D'Aelgoth sector, and the Hadar sector.# Section 1\nThull Vandron, a hero of the New Sith Wars and a hyperspace explorer, was chosen to serve in the Galactic Senate when the Brotherhood of Darkness was vanquished during the war. Vandron was a great opponent of centralized government power and headed into the outer reaches of the galaxy with a group of like-minded wealthy Core World families. The settlers' technology was far ahead of the region's native species, and by 900 BBY, the settlers had taken control of all the habitable planets they could reach, making them the unquestioned masters of the region.\n\n# Section 2\nFor nearly 200 years after the settlement of the Senex and Juvex Lords in the region, they lived in peace and prosperity on their plantation worlds. The settlers' advanced technology allowed them to establish dominance over the native species and become the unquestioned masters of the region. However, with the expansion of the Galactic Republic into the Mid and Outer Rims, the Senex-Juvex Lords faced a new challenge in the form of the powerful Eriadu. To protect themselves against this new rival, the Houses annexed a group of adjacent systems and established the Ninth Quadrant as a buffer zone. Despite their attempts to maintain independence, the Senex-Juvex Lords and the Galactic Republic were forced to coexist in a state of uneasy peace. The Houses were known to reject the Republic's attempts at diplomacy and sometimes went so far as to mine the hyperspace routes that led into their territory. This meant that travel into and out of the region was made difficult and hazardous, allowing the Lords to maintain control over their territory.\n\n# Section 3\nAs the Galactic Empire solidified its grip on the galaxy, the Senex-Juvex region was not immune to its influence. Despite the region's long-standing opposition to centralized government power and the principles of the Republic, the noble houses of the Senex-Juvex were forced to bow to the authority of the Empire. During this time, the region gained a reputation for its insular, aristocratic nature and strict social hierarchy. The noble houses maintained their power and control over the commoners and non-human species that lived within their borders. With the Empire's resources and military might backing them, the Senex-Juvex lords were able to maintain their grip on their domain.\nHowever, the region's isolation and elitism also made it a subject of fascination and speculation among the wider galaxy. Tales of the region's aristocracy and their luxurious lifestyles were popular among spacers and other travelers. Some of these stories also involved daring adventures and escapades, with characters navigating the treacherous political landscape of the Senex-Juvex and outwitting the powerful lords.\n\n# Section 4\nEach of the major planets in the Senex and Juvex sectors had unique characteristics and played a significant role in the region's economy and society.\nKarfeddion, the homeworld of House Vandron, was primarily an agricultural world, renowned for its fertile land and vast fields of crops. The planet's large agribusinesses were controlled by House Vandron, making them one of the most powerful and wealthy noble houses in the sector. Atron, controlled by House Garonnin, was a bustling urban center and the hub of the region's industrial and commercial activity. The planet was known for its towering skyscrapers, busy spaceports, and high-tech manufacturing facilities, making it an important hub for the sector's trade and commerce.\nIn the Juvex sector, Kassido was a hub for commerce, with a grip on Coreward trade. Its bustling markets, active spaceports, and sprawling financial district contributed to its status as one of the richest and most heavily populated planets in the area. Deminol was a port world - renowned for its universities, which attracted students and scholars from across the sector. The planet was home to some of the most prestigious educational institutions in the region, offering advanced degrees in a variety of subjects, including engineering, medicine, and the arts. Loovria, on the other hand, was infamous for its brutal gladiatorial games. The planet was a major center for the sport, attracting fans and participants from across the sector.

A lot of credits were needed to keep up the tight security around these farms due to Gurlanins continuously trying to get rid of these outsiders. For Ankkit to keep a larger amount from the profit to himself, he ordered part of his security force to hunt down merlies to provide food for these farmers. It was said that these farmers would sell information for mercenaries and bounty hunters who visited the farm just to get a couple of credits or a bottle of urrqal.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter the Republic successfully managed to get past the Trade Federation blockade, a deal was made between the Republic and Gurlanins to remove the human colony from the planet. \nAccording to the deal, Gurlanins had to act as spies for the Republic and the farms would be shut down by the Republic Forces. This meant that the merlie species would once again live in peace and reach the previous numbers in the wild. However, Gurlanins failed to fill their part, which meant that the deal was off. A Republic garrison, led by General Arligan Zey and Commander Etain Tur-Murkan, had an objective to train these farmers to fight forthemselves in case of an invasion by the Separatist, or an attack by the Gurlanins. However, since Separatist had no interest in controlling the planet, the Trade Federation had to leave the system and remove their blockade. All the training and equipment the Republic provided for these farmers were used to expand their farms and pull back Gurlanin forces. Shortly after, the Republic forces returned to Coruscant, unaware that a small highly skilled Gurlanin infiltration team had boarded their Star Cruiser. The Senate Committee on Refugees was informed by Republic Intelligence of the significant damage Gurlanins had done on Coruscant and their demands to remove human colonization from their planet.  After clone casualties began rising too high, the Republic had to accept their demands. Another Republic occupation was sent to Qiilura led by Tur-Markan, who had achieved the rank of General, regretfully gave the order to use lethal force, due to farmers refusing to abandon their homes. After the Clone War ended, Qiilura fell to the Empire by Imperial stormtroopers.\n\n","meta":{"index":22,"author":"AnkCheddar","name":"Qiilura","release_year":2021}},"Pelagon":{"content":"# Introduction\nPelagon was a planet located in the Pelagia Province of the Tapani Sector, controlled by the House Pelagia.

Due to the endless ocean of the planet, the colonists had to gather large amounts of raw materials from nearby worlds to construct huge platforms above the ocean where eventually great cities, also known as seascapes, were built. With the resources they had gathered over generations, these colonists were able to construct over 20 massive platforms with a large amount of population on each one.

The planet itself is found in Mid Rim regions of space, located in the Mytaranor sector’s Kashyyyk system. Kashyyk has three unnamed but identified moons visibly orbiting the planet, and orbits its sun in a perfect circle - negating seasons entirely. It was a member of the Galactic Republic until the end of the Clone Wars era, where the Wookiee population was largely enslaved and shipped for labor work on Kashyyyk and other planets owned by the Galactic Empire.# Section 1\nProperties:\nKashyyyk’s surface is mostly mountainous and separated by islands, covered entirely by forests and jungles of the Kashyyyk’s own wroshyr trees. These trees were huge - sometimes reaching up to several kilometers, visible much deeper into the jungles. They could live as long as 50,000 years, and thousands of different species of trees existed, e.g. some found the Wawaatt Archipelago.\n\nThe Wawaatt Archipelago was a series of islands that were a shocking contrast to the planet’s large jungles. This outpost consisted of a more tropical wroshyr tree that could be seen only growing a few hundred feet in height. Wookiees could also be seen inhabiting these islands and constructing the city Kachirho - a settlement that served at the planet’s Capital. The rest of the Kashyyykian wilds were inhabited by extremely diverse and predatory creatures, and many species of carnivorous plants. Such locations like the Black Forest were so dense with trees and danger, convincing the Wookiee population that the forest was haunted by evil dark spirits.\n\n# Section 2\nHistory:\nKashyyyk and the Wookiees have an expansive history of being enslaved for the benefit of other organisations. The first discovered example of this is the Czerka Corporation occupying the planet and using the Wookiee population using much superior technology. Eventually the Wookiees would start an uprising that would ultimately result in the evacuation of the invaders.\n\nFurthermore, after the Clone Wars was concluded, the Wookiees would find themselves in a similar situation with the Galactic Empire despite their unwavering loyalty to the Republic beforehand. The Empire’s presence on Kashyyyk was so destructive and overwhelming that the planet itself was redesignated as ‘G5-623’ and used for extreme mining operations, deforestation and Wookiee slave labor. The planet itself would even experience an entire Imperial blockade when the Empire took control over Kashyyyk. At some point the Wookiees enslaved would attempt another uprising similar to the Czerka Corporation, however it was quickly and easily extinguished by General Kahdah and the Imperial 212th Attack Battalion.\n\nSome time before the Battle of Endor a massacre was ordered by the Empire, ending the lives of several innocent Wookiee slave lives and impacting the views of Alliance diplomatic perspectives in the case of Mon Mothma, Chancellor of the Alliance. Even when the Emperor ultimately fell after the events of the Battle of Endor, Kashyyyk was still under the jurisdiction of the Galactic Empire under Grand Moff Lozen Tolruck’s ownership of G5-623 Imperial territory.

Because of two factors, the Lorahns Cavity and Lesser Sloo Gas Cloud, navigation to Vandor was difficult, proving that settlement was difficult as well. However, a settlement was established by the ambitious Yspobay Trading Company, which also built the primary settlement on the planet, Fort Yspo. However, due to the planet’s isolation from any main hyperlane used for trading, the planet did not prosper. After a few generations of settlement, many settlers moved off-world.\n\n# Section 2\nBefore the start of the Clone Wars, a scout from the Commerce Guild named Tipps Ospe rediscovered the planet from Arhul Corubalni’s notes.

This animal was very tribal and aggressive and would try to deter or kill off-worlders to try and attain advanced blaster systems. Not long before the Galactic Civil War, Joralla was also home to the humanoids known by the name of the Wasilsi. Both the Wasilsi and Tikiarri were very territorial over the land that they had on the planet and often got into quarrels that led them to become extinct. Beyorth Gommdora, a sentientologist, formed a theory about the Wasilsi originating from somewhere outside Joralla.\n\n# Section 2\nThe atmosphere of Joralla was considered to be Type I, which meant it was okay for life forms to live there. Its climate was dependent on geographic latitude; this resulted in hot and tropical weather in zones closer to the equator while the more northern and southern poles of the planet were colder. While there were colder conditions in the more northern and southern poles of the planet. At the height of summer, the temperature in equatorial zones could reach up to 50 degrees celsius. In the polar regions, there was a complete contrast in temperature which was seen to drop to lows of -35 degrees celsius during the coldest points of the year.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring the reign of the Galactic Empire, the neighboring star systems had problems containing the Tikiarri. Any starship crew that mentioned these creatures had usually visited Joralla since they knew of the unruly nature of these creatures. The Empire had refused to quarantine Joralla, so Moff Debin Seylas had chosen to appease the local systems and put the planet under an unofficial quarantine. Soldiers piloting GAT-12 Skipray Blastboats did regular patrols of the planet. Adriav Kavos stole a Rebel Alliance data disk while attacking some agents in the Mektrun sector. He agreed to meet an interested buyer on Joralla, that turned out to be an Imperial spy who planned to acquire the disk and  capture Kavos’ freighter. The freighter then traveled to the system but was forced to land in the jungle near the ruins of an old Wasilsi Temple.\n\n","meta":{"index":15,"author":"ArchiveGreeterCannon","name":"Joralla","release_year":2020}},"Malador":{"content":"# Introduction\nMalador, a once-beautiful urban planet located in the Mid Rim's Juvex sector, was home to the aristocratic House Kellermin and the native cappabellor beetles.

The planet had many moons and the surface of the planet contains a variety of plants, such as the bafforr tree, a tree that possessed telepathic capabilities. There were Ithorians on the planet, also known as Hammerheads, who built great floating cities on the planet, but that did not touch the surface of Ithor. The surface of Ithor existed mostly out of the jungle. Most Ithorians never even walked on the surface.# Section 1\nIn 439 BBY, scientists tried to combine the bafforr tree with other plants on the surface, it did work, but the scientists made a new parasitic form of life and they named it Spore. The Spore became hostile and eventually was sent to an asteroid in 300 BBY. In 19 BBY Jedi Grand Master Yoda was reported dead in an incident on Ithor and the cause of his death was unclear. Sometime before the Battle of Yavin, Ithor was under blockade by the Galactic Empire. They ordered access to Ithorian farming techniques and technology, in a venture to find biotech for military appeals. Even after the Battle of Yavin, the Galactic Empire planned to destroy Ithor.

The Mandalorians from their earliest days of taking to the stars have always taken pride in their appearance and identity as a way to spread their name throughout the galaxy and be easily identifiable as some of the fiercest warriors in history. \n\nOf all the Mandalorian relics and trophies in existence, few are as remarkable and memorable as the mask worn by the earliest Mand’alors during the days of their initial conquests and invasions against the Galactic Republic. \n\nThe Mand’alor serves as the sole ruler of the Mandalorian warrior culture and has been a traditional position held by all Mandalorians who follow the way of the ancestors since the initial establishment of Mandalorian society. As such, only the mightiest of Mandalorian warlords has ever had the privilege of donning their hallmark of Mandalorian intimidation.# Section 1\nThe mask would be crafted by Mand’alor the First, after he spearheaded the extinction of the mythosaur species, an act so difficult and mighty that the planet the extinction took place on would be named after Mand’alor the First, Mandalore. He would craft this mask from the bones of a fallen Mythosaur and as a result the mythosaur would forever become the most notable symbol of Mandalorian warrior society. \n\nThe mask would be traditionally passed down from Mand’alor to the next worthiest candidate, and this ceremony would usually take place through combat. Only the most capable of Mandalorian warriors would be granted the right to wear the mask, it was not only enough to defeat the current Mand’alor, but one must then earn and maintain the respect of the various Mandalorian Clans in order to be deemed worthy of the mask. \n\nThis tradition would change slightly during the era of Mand’alor the Indomitable. Where once a warrior would have to defeat the current Mand’alor and overthrow him, the tradition would now allow any Mandalorian who found the mask or was the first to come across it after the death of a Mand’alor to officially don the title. However, this made the task of uniting and keeping the various Mandalorian Clans in line no less difficult. This altered tradition would become most notable when Mand’alor the Ultimate, initially a Mandalorian Crusader under the command of Mand’alor the Indomitable, would stumble upon the mask when searching for Mand’alor the Indomitable who had just been shot down over the jungles of Onderon.\n\nAfter an almost crippling defeat for the Mandalorian Crusaders, Mand’alor the Ultimate took the time to utilize the authority of the mask to rebuild Mandalorian society under a far more unified and traditional military system, and before long, the mask would once again be a symbol of fear across the galaxy.\n\nMand’alor the Ultimate would don the mask for the entirety of the Mandalorian Wars and the Republic quickly grew to understand the mask’s cultural significance. When Mand’alor the Ultimate was slain in single combat by the Jedi General Revan, Revan would take the mask into hiding for fear of allowing it to fall into enemy hands. Such was the importance of this mask that the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders would fall into disarray and be unable to decide upon a new leader, resulting in the Neo-Crusaders disbanding into various Clans and organisations.\n\nThe mask wouldn’t be seen again until Revan, after defeating the Sith Lord Malak with the assistance of his good friend and Mandalorian, Canderous Ordo, felt that Canderous Ordo was worthy enough to take the mask and refrain from making the same mistakes his predecessors did. Canderous Ordo would willingly take the mask of Mand’alor and unite many of the lost Neo-Crusaders and their Clans into a unified organisation under his rule. These Mandalorians would go on to become instrumental in defeating the Sith Triumvirate, and it was the mask of Mand’alor that allowed Canderous Ordo to do this. \n\nAfter the defeat of the Sith Triumvirate it was unclear of what became of Canderous Ordo and the mask, we know that in modern Mandalorian society the symbol of rulership changed to the Darksaber, this may be because the mask was lost to history, or potentially destroyed during one of the many Mandalorian conflicts throughout history.\n\n# Section 2\nThe mask would undergo various changes by its wearers. Mand’alors would typically feel as if they needed to alter the mask to suit themselves so that they could stand out from their predecessors. Most notably the mask would be changed by Canderous Ordo, who would paint it black when it was once various shades of gold and bronze. The original design would be based upon the features of the Taung, and be of a circular shape however Canderous Ordo’s design would be much more human-like and be altered to be almost cube in shape.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring Canderous Ordo’s initial claim to the title of Mand’alor he was forced to unite the Mandalorian Clans like his predecessors had done before him. During this quest he met one of the last of the Taung species, a dying warrior who disputed the authenticity of Ordo’s mask and denounced Mand’alor the Ultimate as a pretender to the title. This Taung claimed to be the true Mand’alor and that he was in possession of the true mask, but this was never proven nor discredited. Canderous would honour the dying Taung by wearing his armour as his own and modifying the mask to fit the Taung’s armour.\n\n","meta":{"index":19,"author":"seko1111","name":"The Mask of Mand'alor","release_year":2021}},"The Grand Hypergate":{"content":"# Introduction\nArchways located in the ruins outside the city of Satikan on the planet Asation were called hypergates.

The crystal was able to emit a blade of plasma when a laser is projected through it. These blades are what we call Lightsabers. The crystal itself is attuned in the force and displays many characteristics of living organisms. The attunement with the force is what gives the crystal its life-like appearance; being able to produce ressonations that “call” or “sing” to specific individuals. The crystals are inherently aligned with the light side of the force and have a will of their own. If a crystal is used by a dark side user - or simply used for the dark side - it will attempt to escape or resist its use. This characteristic led to those dark side users who sought out kyber crystals as weapons needed some way to bend them to their own will. This desire led to the practice of “bleeding” the kyber crystal. Upon being corrupted, the kyber crystal will turn a shade of red or crimson and thus giving the name to the ritual as “bleeding”. This colouration became synonymous with the Sith and their lightsabers. Later in galactic history, the creation of synthetic kyber crystals became a more viable option for dark side users to obtain usable crystals.# Section 1\nA kyber crystal can be found on an array of different planets, almost anywhere in the galaxy could be a potential location for kyber crystal formation. However, the formation and location of kyber crystals are extremely rare. The crystals are made from organic and inorganic matter, some being able to be found in the cores of stars. The formation of kyber crystals requires a specific vein of material to be present, this being pure veins of “Kyberite”. Any impurities whatsoever would render the Kyber Crystal to be considered “False Kyber”. Typically, the veins of Kyberite would be brought to the surface of planets through tectonic plate movements. One of the most famed kyber crystal locations was the frozen planet of Ilum. This planet was rich with caverns of kyber crystals, enough to be kept a secret of the Jedi upon its discovery.\n\n# Section 2\nThe kyber crystal will remain colourless in its natural state, awaiting a force sensitive being for it to “choose”. Once the crystal has been found by means of the Crystal Gathering Ceremony or by chance of stumbling across it, the colour will change to suit the finder. The most common of these colours being Blue and Green, although many other colours could be chosen. The only known natural colours are: Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Purple, Cyan, Magenta, Indigo and the extremely rare case of Black. Shades and hues may vary slightly depending on the owner.\n\n# Section 3\nThe colour of the crystal has significant meaning, and will portray the type of Jedi the owner is. Blue means they are a guardian, a defender and a peacekeeper. Green means they are a diplomat, a negotiator and a learner. Yellow means they are a balance between Blue and Green, typically used by temple guards. Orange is unique in the way it represents a strong pull to the dark side but chose the light side, some also say orange can come from a partially purified crystal. Purple represents an owner who uses the slight darkness inside them, and is said to be a blue crystal that bled itself a small amount. Cyan is a variant of Blue, not much is known about the differences. Magenta and Indigo have no known meaning. Alongside the natural colours, other colours have been seen to exist. White and Red have been observed, but have never been found naturally. Red comes from the aforementioned Bleeding Ritual or synthetic crystals developed by the Sith, and White is created by a separate ritual known as ‘Purifying”. The purification process is generally used on kyber crystals that have previously been bled, as a form of bringing them back to the light. This process is known to be extremely difficult, and requires a strong connection to the light side of the force.\n\n# Section 4\nLarger forms of kyber crystals have been found to exist, and the use of kyber crystals in weapons other than lightsabers has been achieved. The ancient Sith empires had been known to create vast super weapons, all at heart contained a kyber crystal. Such weapons had extreme destructive capabilities and powerful uses, however, experimenting and working with crystals against their will led to certain side effects. As mentioned, the crystals have their own will, and will resist any means that are against its will. This can cause headaches, visions, loss of sleep and insanity in those working closely to the crystals. Such experimentations led to the creation of the DS-1 Battlestation, the unknown superweapon on Malachor as well as planetary development tools used by the Jedi. The power behind these large crystals is unstable, and working with them is dangerous to all parties involved, therefore the use of them by the Jedi was ceased and remained a practice of the Sith.\n\n# Section 5\nA kyber crystals resilience to the elements led to them being worshipped by species before the Jedi and Sith. They have a natural resistance to fire and extreme pressure, their intricate structures were seen as mesmerizing and their near impermeability made them appear otherworldly or ethereal. The Jedi amassed a near exclusive right to all kyber crystals, as their affiliation with the light made them the perfect match. Some saw this as greed, and lost trust in the Jedi. Others saw it as the protection of the Galaxy and preservation of the crystals, keeping them from sinister and dark uses.\n\n","meta":{"index":3,"author":"Kraa_Plantte","name":"Kyber Crystals","release_year":2020}},"Jedi Credit":{"content":"# Introduction\nJedi credits were metal tokens.

Jedi Credit was usually made of metal and had the Jedi Order logo imprinted on it. The credit itself was not massive. It reached the size of a regular coin. When a Jedi knight reached the rank of Jedi Master, not only would they receive a Jedi credit, but his close family members, his students, as well as his master would receive said credits.\n\n# Section 2\nIt would appear as if most Jedi did not acknowledge their Jedi Credit. It seemed like Jedi Credit was only a badge of recognition, which served no function at all. Jedi Thame Cerunial placed his Jedi Credit in a copy of the Jedi training manual, “The Jedi Path,” to keep his credit safe and undamaged.\n\nThe Jedi Credit was not completely useless as a Corelian pilot Corran Horn received it from his father, Valin Horn, who inherited it from his father, Nejaa Halcyon. Corran was unaware of his grandfather's legacy. Corran wore the Jedi Credit on a golden chain. Later on, Corran used his Jedi Credit to propose to Mirax. That same Jedi Credit later became an important heirloom in the Horn family.

The letter explained in detail Tarkin’s view on how order must be maintained through fear and terror through the galaxy.# Section 1\nThe Doctrine consisted of three primary principles: Territorial Consolidation, Rapid Communication and the Rule of Fear. Territorial Consolidation focused on the reorganization of local governing into “Oversectors” that could perform much more flexibly, assigning more forces to rebellious sectors, so that rebellions would vanish before they even started.\n\n# Section 2\nRapid Communications focused on reorganizing the HoloNet into a military-used system. Taking the HoloNet for government use would both prevent “Sector Groups” of rebels from forming, and at the same time let ships be connected by a transceiver to Sector Command, while Sector Command is connected to the High Command in Coruscant, improving the military’s capabilities.\n\n# Section 3\nSECTION FOUR:\nThe Rule of Fear is pretty much self explanatory, but it focused on “Rule through fear of force, rather than through force itself.”. It focused on creating fear using massive superweapons and displays of power, while not even needing to use it.\n\n# Section 4\nThe idea that eventually led to the Doctrine was rooted in 29 BBY when Raith Sienar presented to Tarkin (Then a Commander in the Republic’s Outland Regions Security Force) the plans for the Expeditionary Battle Planetoid (A massive superweapon). Tarkin was very intrigued by this, since he had seen the chaos in the Outer Rim due to a lack of governing authority.\n\n# Section 5\nTarkin first presented the general idea to then Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, which prompted Palpatine to order research that would result in the Death Star Project. Tarkin presented the complete concept to, by then Emperor, Palpatine, who was very much impressed with the then Moff, not only implementing all of Tarkin’s suggestions, but even rewarding him with the rank of Grand Moff (The first of his kind).\n\n# Section 6\nWith his rank, Tarkin was given control of most of the Outer Rim territories, more troops under his command to crush resistance and his own superweapon project, the Death Star. Ironically his doctrine was published in an Imperial book called: “Imperial Handbook: A Commander’s Guide” right before the Death Star, a cornerstone of his Doctrine, along with Tarkin himself were blown up in Yavin 4’s orbit.\n\n# Section 7\nAside from flaws in the Rule of Fear (That let the Rebel Alliance form) there were flaws in the other principles. According to Wedge Antilles (Rebel Ace), the rebels changed their strategy to raiding on sector borders, thus making two Grand Moffs (Who controlled sectors) start a turf war. Additionally, Han Solo remarked that bootleg transceivers could be bought from any hustler on Nar Shaddaa, defeating the purpose of the second principle.\n\n","meta":{"index":39,"author":"therussiancup","name":"Tarkin Doctrine","release_year":2020}},"Holocron":{"content":"# Introduction\nA Holocron is a storage device used to store information in holographic form, many contain Jedi and Sith teachings and location of certain individuals and unknown planets.

Quenelle and Obi-Wan Kenobi were on the search for three power gems named “Lost Stars of Nallastia.” The two searched for the Lost Stars on Nallastia’s moon. Upon finding them, they used their frequency to destroy an energy field.# Section 1\nJust one year later, in 22 BBY, the pirates of Iridium would use Power Gem shards to get the upper hand when engaging in a battle. With the shield disturbing ability of the gems, the pirates were able to easily get the upper hand on enemy space freighters. For a time, it was believed that nearly all power gems in the galaxy were either lost or lost their ability.

It was also the throne world of Sidious and housed the Imperial citadel. The reason why it housed such important buildings for the Galactic Empire was that it was nearly impossible to reach. It was located at the end of the Byss run, which was heavily guarded and connected Byss to the Core Worlds.# Section 1\nOriginally, Byss was a fertile world that also acted as a natural conduit for the Force. However, it was flooded with the energy of the dark side of the Force when Emperor Palpatine decided to make Byss his retreat.

It intersected the Rimma Trade Route at Yag’Dhul, before passing the Greater Javin region and intersecting the Hydian Way near Terminus.

It would be located near the Giju Run hyperlane and the Atrisi system. In their mythology, a creature known as Wapoe was the demi-god of disguise. The planet was mostly known as the homeworld for the Shredder Bat. This creature was non-sentient and had highly sensitive hearing, meaning it could occasionally be hunted. Shredder Bats had no eyes so they would focus on their ears and hearing for survival. At the end of their head, were their fangs which could extend. A variation of the bat would be the Snow Shredder Bat. Apart from that species, the planet was inhabited by humans. The inhabitants of the system numbered to a hundred million to five-hundred million in 25 BBY. This would help lead Atrisia to form seven nations in its ancient history. An example of one of the nations would be the Atrisian Empire, one of the first well-known factions that would actively engage into many worthy but bloody conquests. It would be led by Uuch Tching, the fifty-fourth Emperor, who would unify the planet. Tching was the kind of man who enjoyed his victories and discovered more continents on his homeworld. As he tried to gain success from all continents, he expanded the Atrisian Empire for one purpose, which was to rule the whole of Atrisia. He didn’t care if it was directly or indirectly, he only wanted to lead. One of the reasons he became so popular is due to how he ruled, it was tyrannical and full of suffering.# Section 1\nHowever, his strategy with the near opposite, his insight was very smart and would usually focus on spies or diplomacy. Tching was able to subvert more than around thirty different rebellions against his Empire. Another reason would be because he was also an author to many parables and analogies, which were to be known as the Sayings. With time and success, this Emperor was one of the most legendary rules in the galaxy and in his time. To remember him, people would nickname the planet, “Kitel Phard”. Eventually, one of the Emperors of the new time would order a couple of prints of the Emperor Uueg Tching’s Sayings due to how limited they were in 539 BBY. The Parliment of the planet who argued for the power that the throne has, would make “Sayings” available in two different copies. One that was specially printed and the other in a database form. By the time of 24,500 BBY, the Yovshin Swordsmen of the planet would develop a pair of swords for duelling in Atrisia’s main city.\n\n# Section 2\nThey would decide to name the weapons after their settlement, which was Jar’Kai. Along with it, they would craft a style for it to match which was a dual technique that relied much on speed and agility. In the same year, the leader of the Legions of Lettow, Xendor, would come by to discover mysteries related to the hyperlane between Atrisia and a few other planets. Near the aftermath of the First Great Schism, several legionnaires of the legion would flee to the borders of the Galactic Republic and soon leave them. Though Arden Lyn, a member of the Legions of Lettow and former lover of Xendor, would travel beyond the world instead in a chance to flee the Jedi Order. But in this attempt, would fail and be caught by the Jedi on the planet Irkalla.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Atrisians would eventually overtime decide to leave their homeworld and would become a part of something known as the Atrisan Commonwealth. During this, the places that surrounded Atrisia would be explored by the Galactic Republic between 5000 and 3996 BBY. The Republic would call this “the civilised galaxy”. Sometime in 3638 BBY, the Jar’Kai swords were claimed to be discovered by an unnamed treasure hunter, who said they belonged to one of the Yovshin swordsmen. An interested organization wanted to see if it was true or false so they would send a companion over to them and with the results, it was confirmed genuine. Eight years later from the finding, Atrisia weapon masters would test their students by having them fight strong opponents, who were skilled in this technique. The Eternal Alliance commander would usually dispatch a companion to the world for one purpose, this purpose was to recruit skilled warriors, ready to be challenged. While doing so, they would find a group of warriors, who were captured by the Morgukai Order, and bring them to the Sith-filled world of Korriban. 500 years after Parliment making “Sayings” into two different copies, the Empire would mark its history in studies within the University of Coruscant.\n\n# Section 4\nBy 1000 BBY, Atrisia had fallen into the grasp of the Galactic Republic during the active days of the Clone Wars. One of the Republic’s first campaigns was to send its twentieth army of the Republic military to protect the world’s vicinity from the rival Confederacy of Independent Systems. As the Republic fell and the Galactic Empire rose, The Kitel Phard Dynasty of Atrisia decided to serve as an “inspiration” for the new Empire. Darth Sidious, also known as Emperor Palpatine, would promise to bring them a golden age akin due to the achievements of their ancient ancestors, but it would not happen due to him being a trickster and liar. In 17 BBY, the whole planet lay in the hands of the Galactic Empire and most parts of the Imperial Military would be named after the ancient rulers of Atrisia, such as the Atrisian corps and the highest military title, “Warlord of the Empire”. After the death of Palpatine, a Rebel Alliance historian would note the history of Atrisia along with some Imperial documents. The planet would also finally decide to declare its independence from the Empire and instead, ally with the New Republic.\n\n# Section 5\nSeven years later, the xenoarchaeologist Doctor Corellia Antilles would discuss Atrisia at the Galaxy Museum in a lecture on the planet Coruscant.

To counter the size of the ocean, Selonians created tunnels under the surface to allow communication with their people. The planet’s oceans were rumored to house many sea monsters since Selonia’s ocean was the only ocean large enough to compensate for these monsters.# Section 1\nSelonians had created a system of tunnels to allow communication and housing. They were called “dens” and were located under much of the planet’s crust and mantle. Orbital shipyards operated above the surface and produced many vessels for use within the Corellian system. The Selonians species lived within these dens and created hives revolving around a fertile female for breeding.\n\n# Section 2\nThe history of Selonia was believed to be the work of Celestials.

Its diverse and lively sea creatures are pleasant to the eye and near its northern continent can be seen beautiful and intricate coral reefs that can easily draw in a crowd. From this, you can probably guess their most profitable business, toursim. The system as a whole acts  as a resort for travellers, but all of it combined could not compare to Pantolomin. Every building, transport or scenery is meant to please the eye - even the very water started to exist for this very purpose, with luxury casinos operating in submarines to take full advantage of the stunning underwater sights. All of this worked and tourists couldn't help but gravitate to it - whether that be due to its beauty or the fact that the Namadii Corridor is so close by. Such business would be hard to maintain if the two species, the Lomin and Tolo, native to the system did not work together to keep the resorts in check. At this point, the very planet starts to seemingly exist for the sole purpose to entertain.

Relentless in the pursuit of his desires, the Admiral bombed the many serene oceans of the planet to “persuade” the Coral Vanda to surface. As a consequence, many habitats and reefs were destroyed in the process, even the Grand Admiral lamented this loss. We know this because of what he said to Captain Pellaeon as the bombardment began : \"A pity, though, to have to damage any of these reefs. They're genuine works of art.

The Humbarine capital was heavily focused on industrial life and would serve as the whole capital for the rest of the sector. The use of it was mostly for the Trellen Trade Route. This trade route would link this planet to the east of the galaxy and also the Commenor. Inhabitants were known as Humbariners and the Senator at the time of the Clone Wars was Bana Breenu. Barrow Oicunn, a Lieutenant from the world, would serve for the Clone Wars defense fleet and was transferred later in his work to the Coruscant Home Fleet. This was due to the downfall of the planet and the loss of his family. Oicunn served as an Admiral in his life and was titled as the “Hero of Humbarine”. As he got older, he would be targeted by bounty hunters. By 26,000 BBY, the crew of the ship known as the Human sleeper, people who originated from Kuat, had discovered the planet and later colonized it but would be resolved. Near this time, Humbarine would be titled “The capital of manufacturing” and “The Humbarian Rule” with starting to become a hub like mentioned before. As it became one of the founders of the Republic, itself and the other Core Worlds would work together and send colony ships of every individual region, which would be called The Slice. However, there would be slow travel and communication due to most natives either being Balmorran and Commenorian.

At the time of the Tionese War, the planet would develop warships to assist the Republic’s counterattack against a rival, the Union of Desevro and Tion. During the Great Sith War, their Swift Fleet which belonged to the Republic would launch near Humbarine and would travel throughout the system before arriving at the location of the Brotherhood of the Sith, dealing mighty blows. The world would soon be protected by large warships that they had control over so they could not get involved in any galactic wars. They would do this until the arrival of the Clone Wars. When the Clone Wars did break out, the whole sector would lose its local defense fleet as it went under the grasp of the Republic War Council. The Council would make the decision of making it a part of the Republic military. As the war went on and on, several attacks by the Confederacy of Independent System were made.

While Buryn chose to stay on the planet and wait for Fortris, Master Orgus Din would soon arrive and ask him if they would leave the planet to try and prevent any further confrontations with the Sith, to not disobey the terms of the treaty.\n\n# Section 3\nSome time passed and the beginning of a new confrontation known as the Cold War was underway. This caused the Republic to end its support for Balmorra. However, there was a small group of Republic members that were left on the planet to help with the resistance against the Sith Empire. A few years after the treaty was signed, the peace with the Sith Empire held true. Convincing the Republic to redeploy forces to Balmorra. The Sith Empire attempted to make its presence known to hasten their attempt to retrieve the planet’s weaponry and droids. Years passed and the time of the Sith had moved on and the Eternal Empire began to take over the galaxy. Princes Arcann and Thexan led the assault on Balmorra that knocked out the planet’s defense system. Then they placed a Star Fortress around the planet, who later got kidnapped by a spy known by the name of the Shroud. He then went to destroy the Star Fortress which left the planet free from the Eternal Empire’s control temporarily.\n\n# Section 4\nBy 4 ABY, the planet became an Imperial Fortress and remained under Imperial control until 6 ABY. A few years later, the planet was freed by the New Republic after the Battle of Endor. Although, Balmorra was brought back under Imperial control during the Emperor’s reappearance. Not long after, the Balmorrans started providing weapons for the New Republic. In response, the planet was attacked under the command of Military Executor Sedriss QL. The army that attacked the planet was made up of Shadow Droids and SD-9-series battle droids. After a long and hard-fought battle, Sedriss decided to retreat and called off his attack in exchange for a shipment of the droids that the Balmorrans possessed.\n\n","meta":{"index":27,"author":"CaelestisThunder","name":"Balmorra","release_year":2021}},"Neral":{"content":"# Introduction\nNeral was a Core World planet that was located in the Corellian sector.

This environment would lead most species that lived there to turn into criminals and smugglers. Most of Balosar was industrialized meaning that the buildings would go so far into the sky, the sun could not penetrate it enough to reach the full surface. The air was barely breathable and could even suffocate some to death so it would force the Balosar species to adapt to more poisonous gas than before. When the Clone Wars erupted into battle, the planet would remain with the Republic and the 20th Sector Army within the Grand Army of the Republic would guard it from any harm for it was their duty. When the Republic fell and the new Galactic Empire rose to power, they would have no other option but to declare loyalty to the Emperor, who is also known as Darth Sidious. Belosar would try their best to avoid any contact with the Galactic Civil War so no attention would be brought to themselves. Around the time of the New Republic, it would suffer major issues such as air pollution and crop poisoning. They would join Twi’lek dealers as their economy fell for support. With their help, Belosar would avoid the war that was coming by Yuuzhan Vong.

Once, the planet was home to a variety of animals and plant life, yet this all changed over a millennium as it transformed into a polluted world filled with waste and factories. The planet is also home to the sentient Vulpteeren species. While being quite near the centre of the galaxy, it was often disregarded by organisations across the galaxy as insignificant, even excluding the planet from their maps. Vulpter does possess a breathable atmosphere by most species, however, it is polluted due to the planet's conditions, and with a range of temperatures from very cold to temperate.# Section 1\nThe planet Vulpter was once covered by large wildlife, grassy plains, and great forests yet this changed over millennia due to the harsh industrialisation of the planet, almost eradicating all life on the planet. This resulted in Vulpter becoming a wasteland, dominated by factories and machines. A thick smog would wrap itself around the planet as a result of the air pollution being so bad that it is visible. Agriculture on this planet was unsustainable and encouraged farmers to migrate off-world further isolating the planet. This situation would only get worse as the Vulpteeren species would play a part in founding the Trade Federation which would seize control of the planet. This resulted in the planet’s conditions progressing into something even worse. The planet was converted into a dumping ground further intoxicating the planet. The Trade Federation would begin to use driller machines to dig underground caverns causing the water supply and the air to become toxic.\n\n# Section 2\nFollowing the rise of the New Empire, under the leadership of Emperor Palpatine, this resulted in the deterioration of the Trade Federation’s rulership over the planet. The planet was then ruled by a locally formed government that possessed limited resources such as a police force and navy. The Empire established strict rules about hyperspace usage into the Deep Core region by ships unless authorised only. The planet was also disregarded by the Empire due to its lack of resources as “usage” to the Empire. Many Vulpteeren individuals were enslaved by the Empire and forced into labour. However, the lack of attention the planet received from the Empire allowed the Rebellion Alliance to utilise the planet as one of its secret operative bases. After the destruction of the Galactic Empire, the New Republic was established and Vulpter was once restored as a planet of the Galactic community. As the Vulpteerens regained control of their planet, they would strive to transform it back to its former beauty. A team of scientists was also dispatched by the republic to analyse the ecosystem and begin purification of the planet to mend its broken ecology.

More importantly, however, Coruscant was home to the Jedi Temple. Along with the Temple was also the Senate Building, which played a very important role during several different galactic wars.# Section 1\nCoruscant has served as the capital planet of the Republic, and of the entirety of the galaxy, since the old Galactic Republic. At one point during Coruscant’s time, it was renowned by the Sith Empire, but would later be taken back by the Republic and the Jedi Order. Coruscant played an important role for the Galactic Republic. Not only did it house their politics, but it also housed the Jedi Temple, which were both important branches to the Republic, especially during several different critical wars. A lot of the Republic’s important assets belonged on the planet.\n\n# Section 2\nOne of the more important stations in Coruscant was the Republic Center. This space housed some of the Republic’s military during the Clone Wars. The Center consisted of a large jail space and several other security measures. The base also would contain different machines, such as the HAVw A6 Juggernaut and LAAT ships. The military base consisted of mostly Shock Troopers, also known as the Coruscant Guards. Security measures such as key cards, computer scanners, and more were used to ensure security inside of the base.\n\n# Section 3\nThe underworld was a low-lit, low atmosphere area. The underworld was where those with little to no money would live on Coruscant. A majority of Coruscant’s population lived in the underworld. This area was crime-riddled, as most of the lower levels consisted of smugglers, criminals, and was even home to several different criminal empires. The only light that these lowly areas would get was from street lights.  While there was security, it was limited. The Coruscant Security Force, were in-charge of patrolling the lower levels. However, this security force was not enough to prevent major amounts of crime.\n\n# Section 4\nCoruscant was a planet that, although looked like a progressive city from the top, there is a darker side the further down you go.

Palpatine announced his New Order and immediately sent troops to Salliche to ensure that the crops were in abundance to support his endeavors. The planet’s proximity to other Core Worlds, access to easy space travel, and a working population prone to discontent makes it a good place for potential activities that went against the new galactic government.\n\nSection Two: \nThe Salliche Agricultural Corporation was fully compliant with the Empire, by sending out their own forces at the disposal of the Imperial Military and Imperial Security Bureau officers. Imperials established a base within the capital of Netassa. This base had fortified outposts at all major points of the exterior. The ISB conducted undercover purges to prevent possible trouble makers or traitors within the population, which spiked a recruitment campaign to bring in other workers from other systems to join their operation. During that time, Moff Gegren Throsen manipulated the planet’s corporate bodies to impose his own will and that of the Emperor. However, the people of the planet remained loyal to House Harbright. \n\nSection Three:\nThe parliament of Salliche elected Selnia Harbright to the Imperial Senate, which placed her in a reasonably ineffective position within galactic politics. This was done mostly to remove her presence from the inner workings of the planet’s hierarchy.

One of those planets, Axum, was very similar to Anaxes, but with higher industrial power and speed. The planet consisted mainly of plains and forests, as well as mountains. Anaxes also had a Citadel and contained many necessities.# Section 1\nEarly humans first colonized Anaxes and Axum around 27,500 BBY. These two planets were both some of the earliest planets to contribute towards the Republic. By 25,000 BBY, the Azure Imperium was created, and Anaxes became the location of the main fleet for the Republic. Soon, the Anaxes War College would be established, which prepared Naval students after their arrival from Prefsbelt IV. Anaxes was in the Perlemian Trade Route, placing it in the route towards Coruscant. This became an efficient strategy for defense, as in the Great Hyperspace War, the fleet defended Coruscant and prevented most of the Sith from arriving there. Anaxes formed many naval Admirals that would prove to be competent, thus gaining the name “The Defender of the Core”.\n\n# Section 2\nLater in the Clone Wars, Anaxes was the base of the Azure Hammer Command. The fleet would come out victorious in many battles with the CIS, with the CIS commander being executed in the Battle of Anaxes.

Because of its length, it was one of the most popular travelling choices for merchants, engineers, and warriors who needed a legitimate path throughout the countless planetary systems.# Section 1\nThe Rimma Trade Route started in the Core Worlds on the planet Abregado-rae near the Fondor system, known for its chain of vicious space battles during the Great Galactic War, during which the fleets of the Republic and the Sith would continuously launch attacks on important enemy shuttles. The Route would then direct towards the Mid Rim and meet the Hydian Way and the Corellian Trade Spine in the Western Reaches, containing many Imperial planets often classified as the Imperial Space. In the Mid Rim, Rimma Trade Route would become crucial for many developed species, such as the Sullustan, who were able to expand their technical skill and establish many beneficial trade connections with various planets. It was one of the main factors that conditioned the Sullust’s importance in that region. After exiting the Mid Rim, the Rimma Trade Route would continue to lead towards the Outer Rim. The hyperspace route would meet its end in the world of Karideph, nearby planets Utapau and Dagobah known for their appearance in the history of the Clone Wars.\n\n# Section 2\nAs one of the major travel paths in the galaxy, the Rimma Trade Route often played a great role in many wars that took place in its neighbourhood. The longest and the most impactable of those, the Great Galactic War, began around 3681 BBY when the Sith Empire blocked the Rimma Trade Route to sabotage the Republic worlds after the Sacking of Coruscant. The Route was also utilised during the Stark Hyperspace War, a mediocre conflict that escalated around 40 years before the Battle of Yavin. At this time, the Rimma Trade Route was used as a transportation method by the fighters. 10 years later, the same hyperspace lane was used to cut off Naboo from supplies during the Invasion of Naboo- another notable event in galactic history.\n\n","meta":{"index":33,"author":"Username: abc_5329","name":"Rimma Trade Route","release_year":2021}},"Diatia Major":{"content":"# Introduction\nThere is nothing particularly notable about this planet, and therefore there is little to uncover or document about it, however there is some.\n\nThis was a star positioned within the Southern Core “Diatia Major”.

The shipyards orbit the planet along its equator, creating a ring around the planet. The Kuat Drive Yards had built ships for the Galactic Republic and later the Galactic Empire alike, creating ships such as the Venator class Star Destroyer and the Imperial-class Star Destroyer lines. As being located in the Core Worlds, Kuat was one of the earliest members of the fledgling Galactic Republic.# Section 1\nAs the fourth planet located in the Kuat system, the planet was a lush planet filled with lush forests and plains alike, with three main continents. As well as scattered islands in the planet’s oceans. With relatively mild wet winters and warm summers, the planet was relatively calm. Hostile fauna was nonexistent, as the planet was terraformed with animals that were not hostile and herbivores. The planet also hosted beautiful and carefully-groomed gardens, thanks to drebin, a herbivore that provided the compost for these gardens. It had two orbiting moons, Bador and Ronay, with an orbital period around its home star of 322 days. As well as the artificially made Kuat Drive Yards, the orbital shipyards that encircled the planet.\n\n# Section 2\nKuat was a planet chosen by a consortium of the wealthiest merchant families who are simply known as The Ten to be terraformed into the lush paradise that it is today. The Ten hired the best ecologists, terraformers, and animal breeders to terraform, which lasted for 20 years. Then, Coruscanti Humans settled Kuat by sleeper ship in 27,500 which had formed an aristocratic society in the world, with the wealthiest families taking claim to the starship industry above. In 26,000 BBY, Kuat had repeated the process of Coruscant and built its own colony ships, having colonized Axum, Tepasi, and Humbarine. A thousand years later in 25,000 BBY, Kuat had gained political power within the greater galaxy and had become a founding member of the then-fledgling Galactic Republic.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring the planet’s time within the Republic, Kuat sent its representatives for the Galactic Republic on the behalf of Kuat. However, they were selected with the greater reason of benefiting the Kuat Drive Yards interests rather than the planet itself. This continued up to the end of the Clone Wars. As Kuat was an important planet strategically, the Kuat was well protected by the Republic during the Clone Wars and even by the Empire when the regime change occurred. Protected by three Star Dreadnaughts during the Clone Wars, as well as the Fourth Outer Rim Army during the early years of the war. Kuat remained loyal to the Republic during this time, rather than turning to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, as many members of Kuat’s upper aristocracy had gained favor with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Kuat had taken many steps to help the war effort outside of producing war materials. One such example was an attempt to infiltrate Neimoidia with modified worker droids. These droids had been equipped with spyware. Another example is refusing to continue production of its heavy vehicles and walkers on the Separatist-controlled world of Balmorra when the planet seceded.\n\n# Section 4\nAfter the fall of the Galactic Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Kuat was a very valuable world for the Empire. Being one of the first worlds under Imperial administration, allowing for a smooth transition to the new galactic power. Kuat’s power structure also changed, with Moff Thichis Kuras, who was native to Kuat and a member of its nobility, taking power of the entire system, with Senator Giddean Danu serving as Kuat’s delegation to the newly formed Imperial Senate. With Captain Anton Kale lobbying his way to be assigned control of Imperial forces on the planet. The Bureau of Ships and Services restricted much of the orbital shipyards as well as the planet itself, with most of the shipyards falling under military supervision. However, even with the military oversight, the shipyards were still considered civilian-operated by 4 ABY. The Imperial Navy and Army’s demand for military hardware was always in high demand, from AT-ST walkers to Super Star Destroyers alike. Even designing the foreboding Eclipse-class Super Star Destroyer as well as the building of it. Kuat had been attacked several times throughout the Galactic Civil War, however with the planetary defense force being equivalent to that over Coruscant itself, it took until 8 ABY, after the fall of the Empire for the planet to be taken by the New Republic.\n\n# Section 5\nAfter the New Republic had captured Kuat through a wistful play conceived by Wedge Antilles, Airen Cracken, and Ral’Rai Muvunic to have Kuat surrender to the New Republic, the shipyards were still put in use and the planet was still considered a fortress world, especially during Thrawn’s campaign to reunite the Galaxy under a new Empire in 9 ABY. It was also a target during Operation Shadow Hand by Executor Sedriss QL. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, the New Republic Defense Force’s commanders had been hosted by Kuat during briefings, as well as continued supplying the New Republic with new ships, which were under the design of the New Class program. After the fall of Fondor to the Yuuzhan Vong, the importance of Kuat was catapulted, with additional warships dispatched to safeguard the planet as well as the shipyards above. However, even with the additional forces the planet was lost to the Yuuzhan Vong but was eventually returned to the Kuati after the Battle of Yuuzhan’tar. The planet and system were still significant afterward. Within the early stages of the Second Galactic Civil War negotiated peace between Prime Minister Aidel Saxan and Supreme Commander Gilad Palleon. Later during the war, a large battle took place above the planet’s atmosphere, a battle between Alliance and Confederation forces that took over a week to conclude, with massive casualties on both sides of the battle. The fighting eventually came to a draw.

Located in the Core Worlds region, Corellia was known for its advanced technology and thriving economy, making it a center for trade and commerce. The planet was also known for its shipyards, which have produced many of the galaxy's most famous vessels. It was the homeworld of many famous figures in galactic history, including Han Solo, Wedge Antilles, and Garm Bel Iblis.# Section 1\nCorellia's culture was heavily influenced by the diversity of its population, including Humans, Drall, and Selonians. Despite their differing origins, the people of Corellia shared a strong sense of individualism and love for adventure, which was reflected in their affinity for starships and space travel. Galactic Basic Standard was the primary language spoken on Corellia, allowing for communication between its inhabitants. The majority of Corellia's population lived on farms or in small towns, but its cities were characterized by bustling streets, towering skyscrapers, and advanced technology. Corellians valued hard work and entrepreneurship, with many starting their businesses in the planet's thriving markets. \n\nThe planet's economy was heavily influenced by piracy and smuggling, which led to the development of a strong and modernized navy capable of combating such activities. The navy also specialized in the development of powerful starships, such as the CR90 Corvette, the Corellian Gunship, and the Corellian Dreadnaught. The Corellian people were known for their exceptional skills in starship construction and piloting, possessing a reputation for being some of the best pilots in the galaxy, due in part to their rigorous training and hands-on experience with starships.\n\n# Section 2\nOne of the most famous locations on Corellia was Coronet City, the planet's capital and largest city. The Corellian Museum of Heritage, located in Coronet City, was a popular attraction for visitors, showcasing the planet's rich history and culture. Another notable location was the Shipyards of Corellia, which produced some of the most iconic starships in galactic history. Other notable locations included the Northern Range, a vast mountainous region that is home to many species of wildlife; and the Port Towns, a network of coastal settlements known for their thriving fishing industry.\n\n# Section 3\nCorellia has played an important role in galactic politics since its early days as one of the founding members of the Galactic Republic. As a result of its position as a major economic and industrial power in the galaxy, Corellia was a major contributor to the Republic's early growth and expansion. Over time, however, the planet became increasingly independent and self-reliant, leading to a long-standing tradition of political involvement and activism. During the Galactic Civil War, Corellia supported the Rebel Alliance in its fight against the Empire. Corellian pilots, in particular, played a vital role in the Alliance's fight against the Imperial Navy, with notable figures such as Wedge Antilles and Han Solo becoming celebrated heroes of the rebellion.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, Corellia played an important role in the formation of the New Republic, with several Corellians serving as prominent members of the new government. Garm Bel Iblis, a former Senator and resistance leader during the Galactic Civil War, played a key role in the formation of the New Republic and was a close ally of Leia Organa, one of the new government's most prominent figures. However, tensions between Corellia and the New Republic began to rise in the years following the war. Corellia had always been fiercely independent, and many Corellians chafed under what they saw as the New Republic's overbearing control. This tension eventually led to a full-blown political crisis when Corellia attempted to secede from the New Republic, sparking a brutal civil war that lasted for several years.\n\nUltimately, Corellia was forced to back down and accept the authority of the New Republic, but the scars of the conflict would linger for many years. In the decades that followed, Corellia remained an important member of the galactic community but maintained a wary distance from the new government, with many Corellians continuing to harbor deep-seated grievances and resentment towards the Republic.\n\n","meta":{"index":3,"author":"DioneSenko","name":"Corellia","release_year":2020}},"Chandrila":{"content":"# Introduction\nChandrila was a Core World planet that lurked within the Bormea sector.

The early rebellion of the newly founded Galactic Empire would list Chandrila as an Alliance planet. It was one of the planets chosen to be destroyed by Palpatine. His plan was to use his superweapon and shatter the planet, like he did with Alderaan; to end the Rebellion through fear.

The house would have none of this as they formed Dentaal Independence party which they used to assassinate the Imperial Governor Taliff. Crix Madine's storm commandos wanted to come up with a quick and easy tactic to destroy the Dentaal people, so they implemented the Candonian plague which first started to spread itself in Calif city before eventually passing over the Kindelian continent where it eradicated 10 billion people and left no survivors on the planet.

The diameters of Caamas measured 15,540 kilometers. It had a breathable atmosphere with jungles, hills, and steppes. The water on Caamas was quite marshy and had numerous swamps. Caamas Flora and fauna were the Thornsniper plants and the Behemoth. Caamas was ruled by a democratic government and was loyal to the Galactic Republic and Corellian Empire and one of the first planets to be under Imperial rule, remaining loyal to the Empire.# Section 1\nAfter the Battle of Endor, Caamas joined the New Republic and served them as a loyal ally for decades. Caamas was a Core Founder of the Galactic Republic in 25,053 BBY. In 19 BBY, the new Galactic Empire, Sheev Palpatine, ordered Caamas to suffer planetary bombardment as they still followed the Old  Republic’s principles. The Empire fired violently down upon the planet, destroying the Jedi Temple on the planet and killing millions of citizens. Those lucky 250 citizens who survived fled to other planets as the atmosphere had become toxic and the once lush forests had become a bare, barren, and desolate rocky wasteland where nothing could thrive and prosper. All former cities became refugee settlements, in which the people living there only sought a ship off the now barren rock that is Caamas. After the destruction of Caamas, the planet was hit by a meteor, creating a massive divot on the planet’s surface. In the years between 2 BBY and 0 BBY, Princess Leia led numerous missions named “mercy missions” to Caamas, assisting the refugees in need. The New Republic generously built a city in Caamas named the “Refuge City,” assisted by the Ithorians. The Bothans kindly offered to the divot caused by the meteor as a dumping ground, offering 50,00 credits per year, which went to decontaminating the toxic atmosphere.

A few years before in 27,500 BBY, the planet was colonized by sleeper ships, an interstar vessel. With the start of the Clone Wars at the First Battle of Geonosis, the Arch-Provost called Bengila Urlan had ordered many industrial spies and designers so they could create and plan starships, which could eventually best those of the Kuat. This would give Rendili and its StarDrive the ability to gain temporary ascendancy. However, they would later become less aggressive towards each other and work on a project known as the “Victor Initiative Project”. At the end of the project, they would produce the start of the Victory I-class Star Destroyers. In 20 BBY, Rendili would be taken control over by the Independent Provisional Government, a group under the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Republic did not like this and would send a task force that would capture and secure the world’s Defense Fleet. They would also retake the whole of Rendili later in the war.

They lived in the undercity for thousands of years, the darkness genetically morphing them into frightening creatures. They were known to use electroshock nets to catch their food, and were thought to have possibly been related to the Corridor ghouls of the undercity.

Exogorth had an average lifespan of 30,000 years, making them one of the longest living species.# Section 1\nMany Exogorth had different appearances, or variants, for example Cularin slugs or the Crimson slugs. Crimson slugs had a dark red line outside their body that went from top to bottom, therefore establishing their name. Another variation, the Giant slugs were space slugs that grew much more than the regular Exogorth, up to 900 meters. Many of these large Exogorth were found throughout the Algunnis system. Exogorth, being space slugs that would eat almost anything it could find, were also used as a defense, by plotting many Exogorth around a certain planet or location. By doing this, it was extremely rigorous to get through, being an excellent defense for those who managed to do it. Some also figured out how to control many features of the Exogorth, such as its hunger and size.\n\n# Section 2\nIn reproduction, an Exogorth would split into two more similar slugs. Once being split into two, unlike other species, the Exogorth would go off and find an asteroid to make a home in. Rarely, once an Exogorth starts to molt, it would grow to extreme sizes, becoming a Giant slug. However in most cases, the Exogorth would grow up to be around the size of the previous Exogorth that it split from.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Exogorth used their sense of smell, or its ganglioni to hunt for prey. It used the friction of the asteroids and launched themselves from the asteroid for transportation. Exogorth also had 4 hearts, as well as an esophagus. Space slugs’ main predator was the Colossus wasps, which grew to 1000 meters in size. In some extremely rare cases, an Exogorth would have a mutation that allowed it to grow to a kilometer.

Vors’ wings and hollow bones are adapted to the strong gales of their homeworld, allowing them to easily manoeuvre through the air even better than that of someone piloting a ship in the atmosphere. Through evolution, the Vor species has adapted to the clean-pollution free air of Vortex. This unfortunately gives the Vors a weakness to respiratory diseases in polluted environments outside of their homeworld.# Section 1\nThey are typically seen as callous and emotionless by humans despite their ability to create music that is seen as beautiful by not only the Vors but other species too. This musical talent is engraved into the creative, hard-working culture of the Vor species; their ‘Cathedral of Winds’ is famous for the beautiful music it plays as Vors fly through the doors and windows, playing the colossal building like an oversized organ. The complicated structure of the cathedral is a compliment to the species intelligence; often compared to the Cerean’s level of reasoning.\n\n# Section 2\nOriginally, the Cathedral of Winds was seen as a myth across the galaxy.

Despite their lack of attacking humans, some able-bodied men have been known to be killed by the beasts, using their sharp-teeth bottomed lips to bite into their prey. They also survived the Mandalorian wars and even became quite an annoyance to numerous Mandalorian outposts in the area. Many Mandalorians hunted the beasts down and killed them, but the Cannoks in the area never diminished due to being a quickly-reproducing species.\n\n# Section 2\nCannoks, like most species on Dxun, were omnivorous. This resulted in them eating anything they possibly could find. Most sentients considered them pests, due to their tendency of eating tools or even eating components to ships, including phase-pulse converters.

Most Force abilities do not affect the Yuuzhan Vong, which strategically undermined the Jedi across many battles which occurred when the Yuuzhan Vong reigned down hell upon us.\n\nThey had an inherent love for war. Those who sought out pain, and conquest often rose to the highest ranks, and this combined with them being religious zealots made them one of the strongest war machines in the entire galaxy. The Yuuzhan Vong’s beliefs could not be negotiated with or broken, and they could not be deterred by casualties or pain.\n\nThe only thing they hated was technology, for some reason, they saw it as blasphemy within their religion and thus all their technology stemmed from organic and genetic engineering. This also made their war tactics new and unconventional for the Republic.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Yuuzhan Vong, despite being completely different in nature, resembled humans to a partial extent. They had (2) arms, and (2) legs, but the similarities end there. Most Yuuzhan Vong lacked kidneys, and were physically more evolved than humans.\n\nThey stood much taller, and thus by extension were stronger and heavier. They also lived much longer than Humans, surpassing them by several decades. Due to their religious beliefs, the Yuuzhan Vong utilised organ grafting (whereas parts of one's body were replaced with biological and ecological improvements found in nature) leaving them horribly disfigured with terribly pale skin textures.\n\nTheir faces were almost as if a Human had simply peeled off their skin, and sliced off their noses leaving a barren and hard skull. In terms of hair coverage, some had long black hair whilst others were bold.\n\nDistinct features included small blue sacks that would form under the eyes of a Yuuzhan Vong - in their culture this was regarded as beauty. Furthermore, they had functionality whereas the sacks would expand or contract depending on the particular Yuuzhan Vong’s mood. This made them frightening however, since the rest of their face showed no emotion nor changes.\n\nYuuzhan Vongs were commonly gray or yellow in skin tone, and notably bled a dark obsidian black which was often hidden by their black armor.\n\n# Section 3\nOn top of all these factors, what made Yuuzhan Vong even more intimidating is that their nervous system through evolution evolved to ensure that Yuuzhan Vong could feel pain more than that of a Human or most other species. It was incredibly sensitive and yet, Yuuzhan Vong’s still had a thirst for pain.\n\nAs previously mentioned, and one final note with regard to their biology, they had no connection to the Force. Their intentions and desires could not be ascertained, intimidating even the most veteran of Jedi. They could however be harmed indirectly if objects were hurled at them using the Force, and other means. There is one exception though, being that of Force lightning and Force net, which (hypothetically) were on par with the evil of the Yuuzhan Vong and thus affected them greatly.\n\nSome Jedi well versed in encountering the Yuuzhan Vong later developed the ability to telepathically sense the Yuuzhan Vong. It was called Vongsense.\n\n# Section 4\nIf one is still not convinced of the Yuuzhan Vong’s immense power, and lust for pain - they will simply by looking at the Yuuzhan Vong’s choice of weaponry and technology.\n\nThe Yuuzhan Vong due to their religious beliefs and certain superstitions chose not to use any sort of mechanical or electrical technology. Furthermore, they absolutely opposed pollution of the natural environment and this sought after other methods. They saw technology almost as their opponent, and not the actual people who made them. The Yuuzhan Vong believed strongly in the natural cycle of life and death, the strong versus the weak. Technology did not die, and thus simply by existing violated the beliefs of the Yuuzhan Vong who took this to heart.\n\nThese methods manifested in the creation of bioengineering, which is arguably more cruel than using traditional droids or spaceships in war. The Yuuzhan Vong have become masters in this field, especially with their creation of biots.\n\nBiots do and perform the same tasks any service droid would, but they are biological and bred to be slaves. Biots could be any species, ranging from Wookiees to Humans and so forth. The benefits of this choice were immense as biological beings were more resistant to work and had the ability to think and adapt. Biots fueled their armies by manufacturing the countless weapons and war utilities that the Yuuzhan Vong required.\n\n# Section 5\nTheir technology also included the Yammosks, a terrifying creature that resembled a human brain but was much bigger. These bioengineered species acted as strategic planners for the Yuuzhan Vong. Due to them being born solely to coordinate war, they were absolute prodigies. Able to issue hundreds of commands to different battles simultaneously made them the brain behind the sledgehammer of the Yuuzhan Vong ground troops.\n\nThis strategy was further supplemented by Yorik Coral antennas the Yuuzhan Vong had placed on multiple worlds. This created a telecommunication system that was arguably better than the galactic HoloNet.\n\nIn terms of physical combat weaponry, the Yuuzhan Vong used a wide range of bioengineered utilities. Due to the nature of biological weapons, they were often able to adapt, change form and were tremendously volatile in combat. It made fighting an average Yuuzhan Vong a very unpredictable task.\n\nExamples include the serpentine amphistaff which changed form to resemble a spear, or whip at any given time. This in conjunction with their Vondunn Skerr Kyrric armor which was immune to lightsaber strikes made Yuuzhan Vong a fearsome foe.\n\nLess notable weapons included the ranged Plasma Eel, and Razor Bug alongside the melee Coufee and Tsaisi.\n\n# Section 6\nThe transportation that the Yuuzhan Vong used to move their hundred thousand strong armies were also biologically engineered. How they worked was quite complicated and hard to document, however in summary; the outer layer of their vessels (called Coralskippers)  protected the craft from normal gunfire, they had Yaret-Kor plasma weapons which melted away most of the defences of an average cruiser, their hull could generate anomalies that would not only break the shields of a ship but also pull them out of hyperspace leaving their pilots unconscious. These factors made the Yuuzhan Vong deadly in space warfare, even against the most veteran of strategists or biggest of armadas.\n\nIt’s been well documented that with this immunity, the Yuuzhan Vong could travel safely throughout space without much interference and thus in their conquest, they sometimes left horrible plagues on several worlds. These plagues, being engineered in a lab by the Yuuzhan Vong would decimate the inhabiting populace in the most painful of ways.\n\nThese ships due to being living beings essentially, had cognition hoods which would telekinetically bind a pilot to the craft. A Yuuzhan Vong would place the hood on their head and they would become the ship until they took it off. The pilot would even experience the memories of the ship and it’s feelings to some extent.\n\n# Section 7\nOne challenge however was that the ships spoke a different language to the Yuuzhan Vong which left some complications for pilots when attempting to move the ships through complicated maneuvers.\n\nIn conclusion however, they overcame the barrier by simply communicating through images that both the pilot and the ship saw. This connection usually overpowered industrial cruisers that were commanded by hundreds of pilots operating different tasks.\n\n# Section 8\nThe Yuuzhan Vong’s were religious zealots. This poured into all aspects of their culture and it cannot be emphasized enough. They believed that their Gods had sacrificed themselves to create the universe whereas parts of their body became the planets and the stars.\n\nWithin this belief, the Yuuzhan Vong’s praised and worshipped these Gods to such an extent that they believed sacrificing their own bodies through organ grafting and glorifying pain in war honoured their Gods. They saw the philosophy of embodying pain in every aspect of life as something that a Yuuzhan Vong should destine their life to.\n\nThis left many of the higher ranking Yuuzhan Vong permanently scarred and horribly scorched. The Yuuzhan Vong who failed this ceremony of enduring pain in a lifelong task were given the name the “Shamed Ones”. Rarely, some Yuuzhan Vong’s bodies reject organ grafting or physically couldn’t handle the pain. They were consequently exiled for their perceived ‘failure’ and sent out into the galaxy. This method of filtering their armies left only the strongest of Yuuzhan Vong left in their ranks.\n\nFurthermore, the pain never stopped - it gradually got worse as a Yuuzhan Vong was promoted. High ranking officials were expected to sever body parts and transplant them with the biology of other species to make them stronger, and closer to their Gods.\n\n# Section 9\nThese operations often led to the death of higher ranking officials or as previously mentioned, they were sent into exile. \n\nYuuzhan Vong’s despite being ruthless with regards to this ceremony, held the concept of family close to their culture. They resided in ‘domains’ which were groups of Yuuzhan Vongs that were related in some way. Each Yuuzhan Vong served a different role in this organization and the domains created a hierarchy similar to a Human aristocracy. \n\nYuuzhan Vong were restricted to marry within their own domain, to marry outside was prohibited and would result in severe punishment. This domain was a lifelong commitment, and required rituals and sacrifices to enter into.\n\nThe young members of their society such as Yuuzhan Vong children were forced to be raised in tight circles whereas they would not see their parents until much, much later. Interesting phenomena occurred with regards to these children, deformed children were killed at birth, and when twins were born they were forced to fight each other whereas the winner of the two would live.\n\nYuuzhan Vong’s further established ceremonies in their way of life whereas the dead were simply sacrificed to the Gods. They were either severed beyond recognition or burned to a crisp.\n\n# Section 10\nWith these factors of their culture in mind, it is of no surprise that the reason they conquered much of the galaxy is not simply due to their desire for pain and honouring of their Gods but also to remove the technology from the galaxy.\n\nThey hated generic technology to such an extent that their ultimate goal in life was to wipe out civilizations that embedded it in their society.\n\nIn war, this belief was so strongly indoctrinated into every member that no foot soldier would ever disrespect his superiors and mutually a superior towards his inferiors. This worked in their favour in combat, as this coupled with the fear of their Gods meant that they never retreated from battle. If the indoctrination was not strong enough, those who ran would simply become ‘Shamed Ones’.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Yuuzhan Vongs, as previously explained, were in constant pain their entire lives. Suffering was infinite and death would be the only saving grace, thus to die would be honourable and sweet. This mentality made them absolute savages in open combat, they were fighting to die because they craved it so severely.\n\n# Section 11\nThe Yuuzhan Vongs, even in battles they lost - which was tremendously rare - did not assist their opponents. The Yuuzhan Vong would drag their dead away and sacrifice them to the Gods before their biology or technology could be studied and learned from. This left them as mysterious as they were when they first entered the galaxy.\n\nIn times of great challenge, the Yuuzhan Vongs would literally institute mass suicide attacks. They would send in hundreds of soldiers to enter into a fury of anger against enemy soldiers simply to tire out and wither away the enemy front lines. These tired frontlines would later be decimated by elite Yuuzhan Vongs who used the strategic factors mentioned all throughout this article.\n\nIn rare occasions, some species were spared the wrath of the Yuuzhan Vong simply because the species had not affiliated themselves with technology. This included the Ho-Din who’s biology naturally prevented them from ever creating technology. This was the only solace that a society could have, to abandon technology or die at the hands of a Yuuzhan Vong brute.\n\n# Section 12\nThe Yuuzhan Vong society was broken up into systems called Castes which were essentially roles allocated to each member of the Yuuzhan Vong. They would perform these roles for the entirety of their lives, making them masters of their craft.\n\nThey had a king of sorts who fronted the society, and was referred to as the Supreme Overlord who spoke on behalf of their most powerful deity, Yun-Yuuzhan.\n\nThe Supreme Overlord oversaw the functioning of all the castes as he was the only Yuuzhan Vong who could directly contact and communicate with the God.\n\nThe Castes each had unique functions, firstly, there was the ‘Shaper’ caste. These were the brains of the society, who facilitated the invention, construction and implementation of all Yuuzhan Vong biotechnology. It broke into many sub branches, but it consisted of the engineers, the artists, ceremony hosts and so on. The Shapers were one of the Castes that ranked higher in the theocracy and had its own ranks such as the Master Shaper, Adept and Initiate.\n\nSecondly, the ‘Priest’ caste broke into sub branches as well and performed the religious tasks of the society. Each branch focused on a different deity, and would spread the faith in different ways. Their ranks divided into a ‘Mosthigh’ priest, a High priest, a priest, a seer and finally, a novice.\n\n# Section 13\nThirdly, the warrior caste which was the strongest out of all the castes. They obviously served the military functions of the society,  and trained members at a very young age. Due to them beginning organ grafting and pain ceremonies longer and earlier than other Yuuzhan Vong, they were the most aggressive of the Castes. Their ranks were made up of warmasters, supreme commanders, commanders, subalterns and warriors.\n\nFourthly, the intendant caste were essentially the accounts of the society. They managed the logistics and economic operations which fueled the wars, construction, and moving of the society as a whole. Warrior and Shaper castes could become intendant castes with time, experience and selection. It broke into the High Prefect, prefect, consul, executor and attendant.\n\nLastly, the lowest and largest of the Castes were the workers. They were made up of Shamed ones, boots and slaves. Even children of the shamed ones were forced into slavery from the beginning and until the end.\n\n# Section 14\nAn important part of the Yuuzhan Vong - their Gods. The religion itself was referred to as the ‘True Way’ and it’s speculated that if this religion had never materialised, the Yuuzhan Vong would never have become the race of war-mongering demons that they did.\n\nFirstly, Yun-Yuuzhan was at the top of the God hierarchy and was the God who supposedly split his body into pieces which created the other Gods, and the galaxies. His will was communicated through the Supreme Overlord.\n\nSecondly, Yun-Harla was essentially the devil. She was a Goddess of trickery, deception and cunning. She was the symbol of politics and thus many Yuuzhan Vong politicians sought her for guidance in times of strife. An interesting strategy that the New Republic applied against the Yuuzhan Vong was naming Jaina Solo, a great pilot, the ‘Trickster’ in Order to manipulate the Yuuzhan Vong she fought against. They would naturally believe they were fighting against their own God.\n\nThirdly, Yun-Yammka. The pinnacle of war, and praised relentlessly by the warrior caste. Not surprisingly, the priest caste actually made this God up in an attempt to improve the morale and further indoctrinate the forces of the Yuuzhan Vong before entering into war.\n\n# Section 15\nFourthly, Yun-Ne’Shel was the Gaia of the Yuuzhan Vong overseeing the natural cycle of life and death across the Yuuzhan Vong worlds. She inspired the hatred that the Yuuzhan had towards the immortality of machinery.\n\nFifthly, Yun-Txiin and Yun-Q’aah were twins who manifested the cultural concept of only loving within one's own caste. This ensured that the Yuuzhan Vong would remain within their caste and domain, fearing the wrath of these lover Gods if they disobeyed.\n\nLastly, and at the bottom of the hierarchy was Yun-Shuno. The Shamed Ones were only allowed to look for guidance from this deity, and she acted as the forgiver. Physically, she had (1000) eyes and acted to keep the Shamed Ones in check as she saw all the sins they committed.\n\n# Section 16\nDespite being as powerful as they are, the Yuuzhan Vong were originally just the product of a war between (2) droid civilizations called the Silentium and the Abominor. It’s speculated that the collateral damage of these battles tore apart a once peaceful Yuuzhan Vong civilization. In an attempt to survive, and an overcompensation of violence, a horrible concoction of the Yuuzhan Vong that the Republic sees today was created.\n\nTheir original homeworld, the Yuuzhan-tar was left in the dust and out of the ashes arose violent brutes who absolutely hated technology and droids. Their conquest of the (2) droid civilizations did not end there however, as once they had tasted revenge, they moved onto the Chazrach and countless other species.\n\nThroughout this conquest, their unified forces were often divided internally through Domain conflicts which led to abhorrent civil wars. One of the biggest was the Cremlevian War which vaporized much of the Yuuzhan Vong’s own territory.\n\nThe Yuuzhan’tar, before it’s death, biologically implacted a seed into another world leading to the creation of the sentient planet known as Zonama Sekot. These tribulations created a Yuuzhan Vong civilization forged in pain, which overtime severed them from the connection of the Force.\n\n# Section 17\nA power struggle which moulded the Yuuzhan Vong forever, formed within a civil war between a Yuuzhan Vong named Yo’gand and Steng. The two battled for supremacy, and Yo-Gand succeeded, later becoming the Supreme Overlord.\n\nTheir decimated galaxy left in thousands of shards of debri forced them to construct world ships and move as refugees throughout the vast vacuum of space. They travelled in the millions and eventually entered into our known galaxy. Due to their religious tendencies and already aggressive nature bottling up in these ships, the outcome was the invasions of the Yuuzhan Vong that decimated trillions upon entry.\n\n","meta":{"index":27,"author":"Souleth","name":"Yuuzhan Vong","release_year":2021}},"Zeltron":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Zeltrons, native to the planet Zeltros, are a humanoid species being almost considered a subspecies of humans though different enough to be considered their own with distinctive differences from humans being their pink to deep red skin and red or blue hair. Almost all Zeltrons are considered highly attractive by other humanoids and even some non-humanoid species. Other than their distinctive physical appearances, Zeltrons are considered to be very gullible.# Section 1\nZeltrons have few notable biological differences from humans. Firstly, like the Falleen species, the Zeltrons produce pheromones that make them more attractive and likeable to those around them. Secondly, the Zeltrons possess a telepathic ability to project their emotions into those they wish to and are able to feel the emotions of others as well. This ability is especially marketable for Zeltrons. Due to their ability to feel and project emotions, positive emotions are treasured to them while negative emotions are shut out. The third notable difference between the Zeltrons and humans are their biological makeup including a second liver, allowing them to drink more than others. Their fourth distinction is an extremely fast metabolism allowing for the Zeltrons to all be in near-perfect physical shape while being able to indulge themselves with the most rich foods of the galaxy.\n\n# Section 2\nIn Zeltrons society, due to their abilities in affecting the emotions of those around them positively, their planet, Zeltros, is in a seemingly-endless party. Zeltrons are seen as thrill-seeking and hedonistic. If anyone isn’t having the best possible time on Zeltros, the Zeltrons would feel it and help them in any way possible.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring the last years of the Galactic Republic and the Clone War, a Zeltron boy served in the Jedi Order as a youngling.

Their unique physical and psychological characteristics made them fascinating creatures. These beings had a pudgy body, tough skin, and two pairs of lungs that allowed them to survive in the harsh desert environment of their home planet. They were known for their extreme patience, musical talents, and nomadic lifestyle.# Section 1\nKitonaks were little, stocky beings with two-toed feet on one leg and three fingers on both arms on the other. Their skin color varied from off-white to pinkish. They had thick skin that could fold to close weak gaps, keeping them safe from the harsh environment of Kirdo III's deserts. Their twin lungs could hold oxygen for up to four hours, allowing them to hold their breath for extended periods of time. Their mouths, ears, and eyes could all be closed, and they were all incredibly small to be seen with untrained eyes. Kitonaks walked slowly, either by contracting and stretching their foot muscles or slithering slowly in a prone position. They had a keen sense of smell, which was centered in sensory organs in their feet, allowing them to sniff their prey through the sands without being affected by the desert winds.\n\n# Section 2\nKitonaks were very patient and never rushed. This was due to the fact that they fed on creatures known as chooba, and they had to remain motionless for an extended period of time until a chooba approached them. They lived in nomadic bands of approximately a hundred Kitonaks, following chooba herds as they migrated. Kitonak technology was limited to crude, temporary tools and musical instruments due to their nomadic lifestyle and the tendency for their possessions to blow away in windstorms. Their tribes were joined in a global participatory democracy; however, slow communications and meticulous thought processes meant that choices took years.\nThe \"Telling of the Story\" was the highlight of a Kitonak tribe's day. Each night, the members of the tribe would take turns at storytelling, with each Kitonak adding their own details and plot twists. A single story could take several nights to come to a conclusion. These legends instilled in young Kitonaks the importance of patience. \nRain came once every ten years to their land. Kitonaks went to the suddenly filled riverbeds for the \"Great Festival of Life,\" leaping into the riverbeds for the \"Dancing of Love\" when this happened. Females would emerge with newborn infants at the completion of this mating rite. For the first year of their lives, Kitonaks clung to their mothers, later becoming strong enough to stand on their own, even during windstorms. Kitonaks would reach full adulthood by the age of nine. More daring nine-year-olds would flee overcrowded tribes to roam the desert in quest of less crowded tribes.\n\n# Section 3\nKitonaks followed a deity called the Cosmic Egg. Caves were thought to be portals to their fabled underworld, and no Kitonak was supposed to have returned from them. The only other thing that upset them besides caves was quicksands, a more tangible danger on their homeworld, since predatory creatures able to swallow a Kitonak whole lurked within. Kitonaks stuck in quicksand would easily wait patiently until help arrived, but the help was usually slow to arrive.\n\n# Section 4\nKitonaks were noted for their talent as musicians. Their musical instruments were often crude and temporary, made from materials found in their desert environment. The Kitonaks used a musical language called H'nemthe that was based on their own unique tonal system. They were capable of producing a variety of sounds and rhythms with their instruments, which included drums, flutes, and stringed instruments.\n\nThe Kitonaks were also known for their love of dancing, and their music often played a central role in their celebrations and festivals. One of the most famous Kitonak musicians was Droopy McCool, who played the red ball organ and led the Max Rebo Band.\n\n","meta":{"index":38,"author":"DioneSenko","name":"Kitonak","release_year":2021}},"Revwien":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Revwien were a sentient plant-like species that originated from the jungle planet of Revyia which was located in the Veragi Sector of The Outer Rim. They got their mobility from the large leaves sprouting from their cylindrical shaped body which also gave them the senses of touch and smell.. They were heavily nomadic and believed in the philosophy of Tyia which said that all species had a spiritual bond with each other and was also the Revwien word for breath. The Revwien had good reputation with them even helping Jedi after Order 66 had struck the Galaxy. There were some force sensitives in their species who all seemed to heavily believe in Tyia. They were a very colorful species as they had many color variations including but not limited to red, yellow, blue and green. Where most species head would be located, the Revwien had a large seed cluster which is presumably how they reproduce.# Section 1\nRevwiens believed heavily in honor and were a friendly species with them usually helping everyone in need. Most Revwiens also had their truthfulness as their weakness as well with them being brutally honest with answers to questions or statements. They were very unsettled by the idea of death being eternal and usually were stressful in violent situations. Due to the Revwiens being so plant like they were often hunted by the Herbivores of their homeworld who mistaken them for being plants making them have to be semi-nomadic so they can get away in dire situations where their life is on the line. Most of the time to get out of these attacks the species tamed wild carnivorous animals to protect their camps like a large wolf like species native to their land named the Urpine.\n\n# Section 2\nOnce the Revwiens made contact with outside worlds they were fascinated by their technology like blasters and ships as they usually used other plants in their civilisation. They used them for light sources and other things including even weapons with an example being seed pods that they threw similarly to a grenade. Even though they were very excited by the thought of heavily advanced technology they didn’t feel very safe when seeing ships flying in the orbit of their homeworld due to it being able to kill many of them effortlessly. Eventually the Revwien expanded all over the galaxy to spread the word of Tyia to people and to help Jedi who they believed were given their power by the being who created all. Eventually Tyia was one of the only Force beliefs that was openly practiced under the empire with the empire not enforcing its downfall.\n\n","meta":{"index":84,"author":"Bloopboy786","name":"Revwien","release_year":2021}},"Nevoota":{"content":"# Introduction\nINTRODUCTION\nStemming from the planet Nevoota, the Nevoota species were insectoids. In contrast to most insectoid species within the galaxy, these were not hiveminds and for some undocumented reason were considered to be the most dangerous, and fearsome in the entire galaxy.\n\nThis unfortunately attracted the warmongering Mandalorians who engaged in war with the entities for a very trivial reason of simply testing their forces.\n\nThis (3) year war ended in the outright extinction of the Nevoota.# Section 1\nBIOLOGY & APPEARANCE\nWithin the insectoid species category, it is further divided into classifications, of which, the Nevoota were Vespid. This means they were characterised by a set of (2) wings, a single stinger on the abdomen, and angled arms and legs that ended in dual grips with (2) talons each.\n\nThe colour of the species is undocumented, but it can be assumed that they were gray in colour.\n\nTheir stature and height was similar to that of an average human when taking into account their war with the Mandalorians.\n\n# Section 2\nHISTORY\nDeriving from the Balmorra system of the Colonies Regions, these species were originally rumoured to be the most deadly in the galaxy. This rumour originated from the Old Sith Wars, and little else has been documented as to why.\n\nIn 4024 BBY, the Mandalorians crusaded across the Nevoota homeworld to test the battle prowess of their Mandalorian Crusader corps. This was to firstly, test the rumours of the Nevoota, and secondly, hone the skills of their own armies.\n\nThe Nevoota were led by Itchcharaka for (4) years, and he was regarded as strategic and intelligent. Despite outnumbering the Mandalorians, and not fearing death, the Nevoota simply chose to evade and feign the Mandalorians right until they were hunted into extinction in 4021 BBY.\n\nThis war strangely defined the Mandalorians who marked the momentous occasion as historical in their culture. It led to them glorifying the idea of death, and it now makes them famous for not fearing death either, but desiring it in a glorious way.\n\nAn Acclamator-class assault ship was once named the “Nevoota Bee” during the clone wars, and probably was attributed to the concept of not fearing death.\n\nSouleth’s author note: “eponymous” is the term you use to explain the phenomenon of naming planets the exact name as their species.

The Crown of Silk was a predator despite its elegant looks, the being attached onto its prey like a crown would sit on a person, however it paralyses them and feeds on their energies for hours and hours. Although it would not kill the victim, it would leave them dizzy for a couple of days, even up to a week. The Crown itself was extremely vulnerable to anything, however the only known way that it would stop feasting upon its prey would be to use either fire or water.

By the time of the First Galactic Empire, several Abyssin resided on the planets Phaeda and Dubrava. Scaling up to around 2 metres, they exhibited a greenish-tan skin colour topped with brown or white hair and a distinctive singular eye. The cycloptic species were normally seen as strong and are known for fast regeneration. Due to these adaptations, an individual of the species was able to live up to 300 years. The species was viewed as tribal, often reverting to the primitive ways of brute and violence, so was avoided by other species in the galaxy. The Abyssin was known to have one name, such as Mador or Polcyc, rather than keep an additional family name like other species. Communication between members of the species using the Abyssin language would be through the use of grunts and growls, though they were able to use symbols for written communication. Nomadic tribes of Abyssin existed, and with the unstable resources on arid Byss, it didn't allow for a central governmental system to be established. Tribes often clashed against each other in a fight for resources, called the Brooding - a fight that would involve warriors from each tribe fighting against each other. The tradition was that the victorious tribe would claim the warriors of the losing tribe.# Section 1\nThe Brooding often led to violent encounters with space-faring species, especially at times of scarce resources. Even though this showcases the aggressive nature of the species, Abyssin tribes did collaborate peacefully through trade, if both parties had enough resources. When Abyssin individuals became elderly and lost their regenerative power, they would either volunteer themselves to die in the desert or by their tribe. First discovered between 15000 and 9000 BBY, the Abyssin were highly cautious with explorers like Arconan scouts when they tried to communicate. To create relations and trust with the Abyssin, the Arcona shared their desert survival skills. Hearing of the strong primitive species that inhabited Byss, travelers soon came to export Abyssin individuals off the planet as slaves. Some were able to escape slavery, becoming bodyguards or mercenaries to survive in the galaxy. Due to their brutish strength, some Abyssin were often deployed in several battles.\n\n","meta":{"index":43,"author":"AnimatedEcrux","name":"Abyssin","release_year":2021}},"Ergesh":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Ergesh were a sentient species indigenous to the planet Ergeshui.# Section 1\nThe Ergesh were two meters tall and made up of plant materials. Their sentient species were one of the few that evolved from plant-based organisms on their swampy homeworld Ergeshui. Ergesh had unique ways of telling how old they were based on color. For instance, the younger the Egresh, the greener it was, whereas the elder Egresh were browner. The average lifespan of an Ergesh was 200 years, and a fully grown Ergesh could way up to half of a metric ton. Ergesh would mate by planting a seed from their bodies into the Shoolbloorp Swamp during a special mating ceremony. Ergesh had no concept of gender, meaning both Ergesh could produce one seed every two ergeshui years.\n\n# Section 2\nEven though Ergesh were bulky and heavy, their species could still float above water. Not just this, but because of their physiology, they could breathe underwater, though they preferred dry land. Ergesh had a thick layer of skin that acted as a strong protective layer against weapons. Ergesh did not have faces. They relied on sound waves for their sight. These species could not be intoxicated or poisoned by most substances. Their immune systems broke down such substances very quickly.\n\n# Section 3\nErgesh were curious, intelligent, and gentle beings. Their native language was basic. It was said to sound like thick mud coming out of a rapid boil. Ergesh personal names were long affairs. As a species, they would be given nicknames that they would tolerate by off-worlders when dealing with them.\n\n# Section 4\nEvery year on Ergeshui both moons would align on one day, making Ergesh act irrationally, violently, and even insane. Ergesh was soon divided into 80 total clans, with each clan holding about 10,000 members. Each of the eldest Ergesh from each clan would be a part of the governing body. The Ergesh government met monthly in the communal pool. Ergesh also kept in contact with the leaders of the New Republic to support the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.

They acted as gaseous black clouds that could move in between and around large objects in an incredibly stealthy manner.\n\nThese factors, alongside their fearsome appearance, made them ideal for spying, espionage and sabotage. Other interesting features included their eyes being the opposite colour of their fog. If the Filar-Nitzan was green, he would have red eyes; blue, he would have orange eyes and so forth.\n\nThey were fairly slow creatures but still had the ability to mould their shapes to dodge blaster bolts if they had, had rigorous training beforehand. The only downside is that these creatures are unable to interact with solid objects unless they have immense physical strength, and even then they can only lift a small blaster.\n\nDue to their nature, many consider the Filar-Nitzan to be simply myths, relegated to the Space planet DNX-N1. Their names of “cloud demons” and “gas devils” are just that, names. However, Xenobiologists and the rebel alliance who have personally encountered these species either as infiltrators or onlookers, have a much different opinion.# Section 1\nThese beings are gaseous and sentient. Their appearance can be described with a wide range of vocabulary but it ultimately boils down to them being shards of air and smoke.\n\nTheir shape-shifting worked by controlling their density which could be shrunk down to fit through vents or expanded to avoid strikes or blasters. Melee attacks and frontal assaults has on effect on these creatures, but energy-based assaults are deadly.\n\nSome Filar-Nitzan were taught a skill called energy diffusion which lessened the effects that blaster bolts had on their being.\n\nThe creatures are limited in number, and have no known reproductive abilities. Interestingly enough, the Kaminoans have managed to clone a few before.\n\n# Section 2\nFilar-Nitzan exclusively expressive emotions with their eyes and had no other means to do so. Vacander was the only known Filar-Nitzan with a name and known characteristics. He was a free-spirited and calm individual according to reports.\n\nThe Xenobiologists have recorded only (400) Filar-Nitzan thus far. It is unknown whether this is because of their inherent ability to remain in hiding, or because they have no reproductive capabilities.\n\nVacander was a well known Galactic Republic spy who consistently pried into Rebel Alliance operations. Interactions with this Filar-Nitzan specifically, and others found in the galaxy are always described as horrific and traumatic.\n\nThis stereotype has not actually been confirmed since the very appearance of a Filar-Nitzan is scary, but it’s not proven whether or not they’re actually violent creatures.\n\nIn later years, many Filar-Nitzan could be found on Keyorin in the Outer Rim Territories.\n\n# Section 3\nIn conclusion, these are a very rare and very misunderstood species. We have much to learn and study before we can understand their true nature. The Jedi should consider contacting one and discovering if they can be force-sensitive, since this would make an exceedingly powerful Jedi and a notable asset to the Republic.\n\n","meta":{"index":4,"author":"Souleth","name":"Filar-Nitzan","release_year":2020}},"Sullustan":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Sullustan are a humanoid species inhabiting the Sullust System in the Western Reaches of the Outer Rim. They are commonly known for their wide jowls,  round chins, and large, dark eyes. Sullustans are also famous for their engineering skills, many served as rebel fighters, pilots and officers during the Galactic Civil War and the New Republic era that would begin after the Battle of Jakku. Many of them are professional engineers and designers. Interestingly, the profession of Sullustan barbers is also respected for their famous skills.# Section 1\nSullust, the natural environment of the Sullustan, was a volcanic planet located on the crossing of many important trade routes such as the Rimma Trade Route, Hydian Way and Nothoiin Corridor. The atmosphere of Sullust was highly toxic and barely breathable for humans, which could be seen taking effect of the Sullustan natives, enhancing their ability to see without light. Despite the planet’s dangerous nature, it was abundant in various mining resources. The surface of Sullust would also be rich in natural caverns, later  utilised as a home to the natives.\n\n# Section 2\nBecause of the mentioned harsh environmental conditions in which the Sullustan would live, members of this species have developed an underground network of tunnels serving as their civilisation’s foundation. The state of Sullust’s atmosphere impacted its natives’ facial features, and living in the darkness improved their hearing and vision. Because of the evolution, the Sullustan would develop defections during their first contact with sunlight. It caused many of them to wear special goggles in order to protect themselves from these harming effects. Because of their life in the tunnels, they became especially skilled at crafting arts, and especially mining. The skills of orientation and improved hearing were also used by many Sullustan pilots who served in the Rebel Alliance. The skin colour of Sullustans ranged between pink and pale, with only certain members of the species, mostly females, possessing hair. It is important to note that the Sullustans’ first contact with the galaxy was said to have happened during their early collaboration with the Jedi.\n\n# Section 3\nIts placement near the planets Eriadu and Ord Ibanna allowed the planet’s economy to grow quickly. Additional skills in crafting, tunnelling, mining, and engineering would soon turn Sullust into a capitalist society and caused Sullustans to earn a reputation as renowned merchants in the galaxy quickly. Although the Sullustans would not travel away from their homeworld often, a few who did were respected for their adaptability and intelligence. Two great examples of such individuals are Nien Nunb and Mayjeln. A traditional Sullustan Warren-clan would consist of a female head of the family, a few husbands, and fathers, and their children. Female members of the society were privileged to choose a mate, with whom they would create a new generation of Warren-clans. Another important aspect of Sullustan culture was the concept of death. Sullust, because of its cave systems across the globe, was said to have had a giant impact on the natives’ perspective of death, which resulted in almost all Sullustan tombs being dug and placed underground. Such a procedure, called the tomb-walling ceremony, involved gathering the dead Sullustan’s relatives and organising every family member to place a stone block in the tomb’s foundations. The youngest children would be the first ones to commit to the project, while the oldest members were tasked with finishing the tomb with their bricks.\n\n","meta":{"index":104,"author":"abc_5329","name":"Sullustan","release_year":2021}},"Chiss":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Chiss were a human-like sentient species.

The Chiss Ascendancy, their governing body, was located in the Unknown Regions and had very little contact with the rest of the galaxy until Grand Admiral Thrawn rose in the Galactic Empire. Before that, they were considered a legendary and mysterious civilization within the Unknown Regions.# Section 1\nThey were often mistaken for Pantorans, though they had distinct features like red eyes. Chiss possessed enhanced senses compared to humans, with sharper hearing and faster reflexes. Force-sensitivity, known as Sight, is very rare among them, mainly manifesting as precognition (Third Sight) and telepathy (Second Sight), which is almost exclusive to females. When Chiss age, their Force abilities usually lessen and in the end, disappear. The secrets of Second and Third Sights are well-kept within the Chiss Ascendancy, with many Chiss unaware of their full extent. Force-sensitive Chiss girls are trained as navigators for their fleet in the Unknown Regions, known as ozyly-esehembo or “sky-walkers” in Cheunh.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Chiss Ascendancy’s ruling class was known as the Aristocra, with the Chiss Syndicure serving as the supreme parliamentary and executive body. Their military consisted of the Chiss Defense Force and the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet. The Chiss were renowned for their military might and doctrine in the Unknown Regions, leading to legends of them as noble blue-skinned warriors among species with no direct contact. The primary Chiss language was Cheunh, but they used trade languages like Meese Caulf, Taarja, Sy Bisti, and Minnisiat in rare contact with outsiders. Chiss names were multisyllabic, consisting of three parts, with shortened variants used for convenience. Chiss were omnivorous and consumed foods like yubal, cheese, and plant products.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Chiss hailed from the planet Csilla in the Unknown Regions. They were called “The Chaos” because of the region’s hazardous navigation. In the past, the Chiss had contact with the greater galaxy and were involved in ancient wars between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Eventually, they withdrew from the galaxy and sealed their borders. They were ruled by the Chiss Ascendancy during the Republic and Imperial Eras. Even with their secrecy, one Chiss named Mitth’raw’nuruodo, or Thrawn, became a Grand Admiral in the Galactic Empire and participated in combating the early rebellion.

They were not able to speak the normal Galactic language, but their language was what they could speak instead. Most Aloxians were very naturally violent and were born with amazing physical strength within them.

The Noghri made exceptional trackers due to their amazing sense of smell.# Section 1\nDue to their excellent tracking skills and traversal, the Noghri were skilled assassins. Skilled in both stealth and hand-to-hand combat. The Noghri were vicious killing machines, incredibly strong, with razor-sharp claws and a sense of smell so strong they were said to be able to smell which family you hailed from.\n\nThe Noghri were notably smaller than most other species; however, this lack of height only improved their ability to stay hidden or move around faster.

At the age of 15, P’w’eck would undergo a process of “ Enteched '', where their minds would be transferred into machines such as a  Ssi-ruuvi Battle Droid.# Section 1\nHowever, due to their religion, the P’w’eck thought that it was their duty to serve the Ssi-ruuvi, as in a few of their myths it was believed that the galaxy was founded by 4 eggs, and 1 of the eggs hatched into the god of the P’w’eck “P’w’itthki” and another into the god of the Ssi-ruuvi “Ssi”.

Most notable for founding the culture and religion we know today as ‘’Mandalorians’’, the Taungs were predominantly a tribal based culture who held dual control over the planet of Coruscant almost 200,000 years before the founding of the Galactic Republic. \n\nThey were extremely skilled hunters, warriors and gatherers who placed a religious view on combat and martial skill and consistently sought out warfare not for malicious or territorial gain, but more often simply to prove who could fight better. Subsequently, honour, courage, strength, persistence and skill were the basis of Taung society.# Section 1\nPart II: Physiology \n\nThe Taungs were an intimidating species, standing at an average height of 2 metres with gray and greenish skin as well as brightly glowing yellow eyes. Their bodies moulded over decades of training and labour to become walking weapons, the Taungs were far more physically daunting and capable than the average human of the era. \n\nThey maintained sharp nail-like claws that we can only presume were utilized as a form of weapon in hand-to-hand combat as well as a bony structure to their bodies that likely evolved as a result of their physical hardiness. \n\nTaungs were extremely resilient, comparable to that of the Zabrak species they could withstand blows that humans and other humanoid species could not, as well as endure physical activities such as running, climbing and fighting for far longer, giving them a natural advantage when hunting. \n\nTheir eyes shine a bright yellow, it is unknown if it provided them any sight advantages though due to the consistency in their evolution as a warrior-hunter species it would be safe to assume that it provided them some form of benefit, if only at least the intimidation factor of it. \n\nThe Taungs did have some nature of tentacle-like hair that would form on the back of their heads and necks but it is also unknown if this provided any additional capabilities or served a similar purpose to that of human hair. Though it is known they would mimic these features on their helmets.\n\n# Section 2\nPart III: History \n\nTaung history dates back as early as the planet Coruscant itself, having evolved on the planet alongside the humans known as the ‘’Zhell’’ at the time. Little is known of their early history up until the point of their war with the Zhell. The Taungs and the Zhell would wage a great war on each other for centuries that would eventually result in the Taungs being forced offworld. It is not known as to why this war started though it was likely due to the tribal and war-like nature of both the Zhell and Taungs at the time, seeing each other as different and therefore a threat. \n\nThe Taungs would be united in their war against the Zhell, who would now be commonly known as the ‘’Battalions of Zhell’’ in their own unified effort against the Taungs. During this war a large volcano erupted on Coruscant’s surface that would decimate the Battalions of Zhell and provide a tremendous opportunity for the Taungs to take control of Coruscant. However for reasons unknown after the Taungs had used this advantage the Battalions of Zhell would somehow regain the advantage and eventually force the Taungs offworld, claiming Coruscant as their own.\n\n# Section 3\nUnder the rule of the newly found Mand’alor the First, the Taungs would colonise the world of Mandalore, naming it after their leader and rename themselves as Mandalorians. Their first militant act would be to hunt the native species known as the Mythosaurs in order to make the world of Mandalore safe for technological expansion. It should be noted that this species was hunted to extinction which is quite an extraordinary feat considering the size and deadliness of the Mythosaurs. \n\nThey would at this point adopt the Mythosaur as their cultural symbol and begin solidifying themselves as the Mandalorians, deciding to be ruled by the greatest Clan Chieftain and warrior at any given time, whom they would designate as ‘’Mand’alor’’. \n\nAfter reorganising themselves into the Mandalorians they would then seek out new worlds to conquer. In the earlier years of their conquests they would come up against little challenge and eventually turn warfare into a religious aspect of their society after their conquest and genocide of the Nevoota species, renaming their conquests as ‘’Crusades’’ and seeing themselves as holy warriors. It would not be until they came up against the Mandallian Giants of Mandallia that they would find their first real challenge.\n\n# Section 4\nThe Mandallian Giants were also a very tribal and militaristic society who would show cunning and skill when repelling the Mandalorian invasions. The Mandalorians found their knowledge of warfare and skill to be so impressive that they offered the Mandallian Giants a place in Mandalorian society and took them on their future Crusades. This began the Mandalorian trend of adopting new species and warriors into their ranks to bolster their combat capabilities and spread their religion and culture throughout the galaxy, eventually making the Mandalorians one of the largest and ferocious forces in galactic history.\n\nWhile Taung history technically does not end at this point in galactic history, it should be understood that at this point their society had taken such drastic reformations and filled with so many non-Taung members that it would now be known as Mandalorian history instead.\n\n# Section 5\nPart IV: Societal structure and culture\n\nTaung society was not particularly unique during the era of its existence. It placed importance on warfare and conducting warfare honourably. Those who could fight with immeasurable skill would often find themselves in leadership roles. Such as Clan Chieftains positions or eventually the position of Mand’alor. It is unknown if the species was inclusive of females in their warrior roles though judging by their liberal outlook on the inclusion of other societies and ability to unify their clans seemingly without difficulty suggests that female Taung would have little to no restrictions in comparison to the males. \n\nSociety was clan based but not medieval in nature, the Taungs knew the importance of technology and advancement and would mostly fight for sport or to prove martial dominance, instead of seeking to obliterate each other. Despite the importance of clans, it was not uncommon for Taungs to leave Coruscant in search of work as warriors or to seek out various technologies or species to battle. They were strongly nomadic and their clans would often relocate across Coruscant.\n\n# Section 6\nTaung culture was very individualistic, placing value on one's ability to be unique and to stand out. This was most notable when designing their armour, each Taung could design their armour in a fashion unique to them. This way of living would carry on into Mandalorian society for the rest of its existence. The Taung and eventually the Mandalorians were not unified by opinion or how they dressed but instead their ideology. The Taung valued honour above all else, founding the Canons of Honour, a list of guidelines similar to that of the Jedi Code in that it guided a Taung and eventually a Mandalorian on the right way to act in adherence to their societal expectations. These Canons of Honour stemmed from the original tenants of the ancient Taung during their time on Coruscant. Taung society was brutal in that an individual was essentially forced to be a warrior otherwise they had little place in the future of their clan. Individuals who insulted each other or had disputes would settle them through blood duels to the death, a tradition that would be carried on into the Mandalorian Crusaders and Neo-Crusaders but would eventually be somewhat abolished due to its animalistic nature. Despite their war-like ways the Taung did prove to be competent poets and even song writers.\n\n# Section 7\nMost notably the poem ‘’Dha Werda Verda’’ translated to ‘’Warriors of the Shadow’’ would become quite famous and was even used when training the Clone Army of the Galactic Republic. They spoke an ancient version of Mando’a that they would refine later when inducting new species into Mandalorian society, this language became fairly famous with many of its words and names being used by non-Mandalorian societies in the future.\n\n# Section 8\nPart V: Notable Taung\n\nMand’alor the Ultimate\n\nUndoubtedly the most notable of the Taungs is Mand’alor the Ultimate. The leader of the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders during the Mandalorian Wars. So ferocious, cunning and skilled was this individual Taung that he managed to carry out a full scale invasion of the Galactic Republic that would result in numerous genocidal campaigns, the subjugation of dozens of worlds as well as an economic and military loss for the Republic that would not allow them to recover for centuries after. Never in galactic history has a collection of wildly different societies united so swiftly and struck such a blow to the galaxy as seen by the Neo-Crusaders. It is safe to say that Mand’alor the Ultimate and his followers forever solidified the Mandalorians as some of the greatest warriors in the galaxy.  \n\n\nMand’alor the Indomitable\n\nMand’alor the Indomitable was another famous Taung who rose to prominence during the Great Sith War. It should be said that the names granted to Mand’alors were given through their actions, and to be titled Indomitable was by no means false when speaking of this Mand’alor. Mand’alor the Indomitable was responsible for the conquests of dozens of worlds and laid the foundations that allowed Mand’alor the Ultimate to rally such a large force against the Republic.\n\n# Section 9\nIf it had not been for Mand’alor the Indomitable’s overwhelming abilities when leading the Mandalorian Crusaders, then it is likely the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders would never have succeeded in striking such a massive blow against the Galactic Republic.\n\n\n\n\nPart VI: Legacy\n\nIt is theorised that the Taungs knew that the legacy they had created with the Mandalorians would outlive them and so they did as much as possible to ensure their legacy would live on. It could be argued that out of every species, of every society in galactic history, none created a stronger legacy than that of the Taungs. Every part of modern Mandalorian culture and society even 4000 years after the Taungs is a representation of them and what they created. The modern Mandalorian maintains an almost mythic status across the galaxy as a result of the teachings and history left behind by their forefathers. \n\nThe unique beskar’gam armour, the legendary fighting styles, the complex language, even the ironically peaceful poems and beautiful music of the Mandalorians all come together to represent the legacy of the Taungs.\n\n","meta":{"index":9,"author":"seko1111","name":"Taung","release_year":2021}},"Moappa":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Moappa is one of the most intelligent species that lives in the seas of Mon Calamari.

Apart from these two unique features, cereans were physically close to humans. \nCereans could usually be found inside the Jedi Order, however due to the low birth rates for this particular species, cerean Jedi were exempt from the Order’s pledge of non-attachment.# Section 1\nCereans preferred to live in isolation from the wider galaxy and in a low-tech society they had created. Cereans wanted to protect their planet’s nature from the overwhelming technological territory that was spreading throughout the galaxy. However, planet Cerea was a home to many outsiders that were only allowed to use technology they brought with them, but could only remain within the Citadels constructed by the Cereans.

The species consisted of pure-blooded individuals like most other species, but also included hybrid individuals. The possibility of breeding between Theelin and other near-human species gave every single Theelin unique characteristics such as different numbers of fingers/toes and differently shaped horns and was responsible for the diversity. The only feature that seemed constant was that they grew to about 1.7 metres as adults and that most spoke the Galactic Basic Standard.# Section 1\nDuring the First Galactic Empire, their colourful appearance and notable sense for fashion allowed the Theelin to be ideal performers, such as in the case of the female religious singing group called the Divas. However, Theelin hybrids faced discrimination even if they were loyal to the empire. The Theelin Shug Ninx is an example of someone who stopped working with the Empire because of this.\n\n# Section 2\nIn the subsequent years of the empire, mutations in the Theelin’s gene pool arose which caused individuals to become infertile. To crimelords like Ingoda the Hutt, the Theelin became more priced as commodities than individuals, leading to more enslaved Theelin. Even after several methods to save the species through breeding with other near-human species, more and more were unable to have children as time went by.

It has moulded and shaped the Bothan’s legacy both culturally and historically.\n\nThe Bothans had developed an extensive spynet that had its roots in most political areas ranging from the Galactic Empire to the New Republic. Their species favoured the side that gave them the most political influence or power. However, their Spynet aided in the defeat of the Death Star thus the New Republic has been in their debt.\n\nInterestingly, the Bothans have a survivalist state called “ar’krai” which is essentially a compulsory call to conscription.

The Gormak considered the Voss as an aberration to be eliminated.  The Voss society tries to survive their constant struggle against the Gormak, the main protectors of the Voss were the Voss commandos, they are trained as scouts and in hand-to-hand combat and were ready to sacrifice themselves to protect the peoples.

During the day, Barab I’s red dwarf star Barab emitted radiation across the surface, so Barabel and other native nocturnal species had to seek shelter underground. Growing up to 2.2 metres, they had a distinctive set of two-inch teeth and strong retractable claws, and their entire dark-coloured skin was covered in durable scales which could withstand a stun shot from a blaster. Unique with two stomachs, the Barabel could consume copious amounts of meat, which coupled with physical features, allowed them to be naturally strong. Led by a pack leader, Barabels lived in districts of up to 10,000 individuals. They were renowned for being fiercely loyal and aggressive, while biological adaptations proved useful in hunting. Individuals knew the language of Barabel, but most tried to learn other languages to communicate with the wider galaxy. They didn’t have a sense of virtue like Jedi or other species had, often finding other people’s pain funny. In the Barabel language, sounds for sadness and laughter had the same sissing sound.# Section 1\nSome time before the First Galactic Empire, Noga-ta and other Jedi Knights arrived at Barab I and settled a dangerous disagreement between the Barabel clans. With the dispute settled, they deeply respected the Jedi and told stories of skilled “great warriors from the sky” over the ages, and began to trust the judgement of Jedi. To many Barabel, this was the only contact with extraterrestrial species because most stayed on the planet, but some did choose to become mercenaries and brutes, while others chose to leave the planet and live on the swampy world of Abraxin at around 67 BBY. It was some centuries later when Barabel began trading with other worlds, especially wildlife, hunters and Barabel commodities for weapons and metal goods, but they were still quiet on the galactic stage.\n\n# Section 2\nIt wasn’t until the reign of the empire that conflict started to stir. The Planetary Safaris company, backed by the Galactic Empire, saw an opportunity to use Barab I to illegally host hunting trips. Captain Osted Alater was tasked to monitor the company’s investment in Barab I, and after discovering the Barabel to be sentient beings, the company was shut down. The Barabel named their underground capital city after the captain, Alater-ka. With attitudes of the species slowly changing, some Barabel were even taken in by the New Jedi Order, such as in the case of Saba Sebatyne who became a Jedi Master. Eventually when the invasion of the Yuuzhan Vong arrived at Barab I, the Barabel experienced near extinction upon the invasion of the Yuuzhan Vong; only a few escaped the fires that enveloped their underground districts.

The Houk had a short and fierce temper, second only to that of a Wookiee, and could be very violent when provoked.# Section 1\nDue to their heavy builds, they were a common sight in the spice mines of Kessel. Many others were gladiators, one of such being Borbig Drob, who fought during the early years of the Galactic Empire. This Houk came to win the Stormblade Bloodfest nine times, becoming a well-known champion.

Argazdans similarly to humans, followed a set religion. This was known as the Vianist faith which praised deities such as the Zhell of Coruscant and the goddess Via. This green-skinned species, under the guidance of Governor Myrial abandoned the Republic and created their own respective nation complete with a navy. Their reputation continued to soar downwards after they enslaved their neighbours and adopted a dictatorship that plagued the Kanz Sector. The Lorrdians specifically were the most brutalised by the Argazdans and even created a form of kinetic communication after being banned from verbally speaking to each other.# Section 1\nThe Lorrdians were subjected to harsh treatment, and were concentrated on the Slave Pits of Lorrd which also housed a biological superweapon. Fortunately, this was never utilised as a squadron of brave Jedi Knights led by a Lorddian Jedi named Mari-Elan Nora assaulted the structure in retaliation. This event prevented the weapon from ever being used, and also freed the Lorrdians from Argazdan tyranny. \n\nThe most infamous Argazdan under the name of Doctor Raygar was known throughout the Galactic Civil war. He continued to wear his Slave master cloak even after the liberation of the Lorrdians. This resulted in him often being criticised by his colleagues and passerbys. The eccentric man spent the rest of his days searching for hidden weapons such as the one on the Slave Pits of Lorrd, and the Sunstar kept by the Ewoks of Endor.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Argazdans differed very little from their Human counterparts. They had a head, two arms and two legs with Human forms and shapes. Their only notable differences included stark white head hair, light green or yellow-green skin, and yellow eyes. \n\nTheir choice of clothing also differed relatively from that of a humans choosing to adopt brightly coloured cloaks with heavy undercoated armour and red capes.\n\n# Section 3\nIronically, for the most part, the Argazdan species adopted a political approach of conservatism often explicitly condemning the actions of the Galactic Republic. Despite this, they were still known for their abhorrent moral values when it came to slavery. Furthermore, during the Kanz Disorders the species developed technologies of mass destruction on par with that of the droid army. \n\nAfter this period, many Argazdan’s were shameful of their past choices and history making efforts to negotiate peace with the Lorrdians, the former species they had subjugated.\n\nArgazdans were inherently religious individuals choosing to spread their Vianist faith amongst neighboring species and planets. They also had an extensive scientific network releasing expeditions into Yavin Prime. A shadow was however cast upon these expeditions after one of the scientists, Doctor Raygar sacrificed his accomplice in the depths of the Slave Pits which would supposedly unlock the super weapon. This actually awakened an ancient creature which is rumoured to have been a Zillo beast. Doctor Raygar however detonated an explosive caving in the surrounding area.\n\n# Section 4\nThe Argazdans descended from Core human colonists during the early period of the Galactic Republic. After many years, their characteristics changed and features developed to acclimatise to the jungled world of Argazda.\n\nThey quickly advanced in technology gaining space flight, and creating their own religion. The Argazdans also engaged in a diplomatic treaty with the Galactic Senate. The Republic even fought on the Argazdans behalf against the Ereesi who they were fighting at the time. The Republic, dismayed by the immorality presented by the Argazdan military, left upon completion of their duty.\n\nThe Argazda homeworld, flourishing in trade became a stop on the Veragi Trade Route further growing the economy of the Argazdans.\n\nThe species also participated in the Clone Wars but opted to ally with the Confederacy of Independent systems. During this time, the Argazdan’s history of enslaving the Lorrdians have become a distant memory as they had established positive relations with the species by this time. The population soared into the one hundred millions by the time the Galactic Empire came about, who they chose to ally with.\n\n# Section 5\nThe Argazdans are an interesting species with a long and fruitful history.

However, they would often export a healing fluid to both parties. This fluid known as Kolto can only be found on Manaan. Due to this, Selkath had a large business in the medical field. \n\nThis business would run perfectly with trades coming and going consistently until the discovery of Bacta. Bacta, similar to Kolto, was a much thicker fluid with stronger healing properties. This substance, available in the Hetzal system, was preferred by many of Selkath's previous traders. It was because of this competition between the two that the Selkath were often seen as responsible for the Great Hyperspace Disaster. \n\nThe Great Hyperspace Disaster was a catastrophic event resulting in the destruction of many moons within the Hetzal System. This suspicion turned out to be correct, as one Selkath by the name of Marchion Ro, had caused the disaster.\n\n# Section 2\nAfter the fall of the Galactic Republic and the spontaneous rise of the Galactic Empire, Selkath’s home planet of Manaan was one of the first to be targeted. The planet suffered a lot of damage from the Empire’s immense force. \n\nThe immediate threat forced the Selkath to take refuge in their cities underwater.

Although they were known as an aquatic species, they were able to survive on land. Iyra was governed by a rigid caste system, the more tentacles you have you will be at a higher position. If an Iyra was careless enough to lose a tentacle through an accident or combat, they have to destroy an eye which would put them in a lower caste.

Known for their distinct physical features and green skin pigment, the Rodians were infamous for their violent culture. The harsh living conditions in the jungles of their homeworld forced them to develop cunning hunting tactics, which eventually led to the development of a culture that revolved around violence and death. Despite their notorious reputation as bounty hunters or criminal henchmen in galactic society, Rodians produced artists, merchants, and politicians, some of whom were found even among the upper classes of the Core Worlds.# Section 1\nRodians were green-skinned reptilian humanoids with distinctive facial features. They had huge, round, multifaceted eyes, tapir-like snouts, and saucer-shaped antennas on the tops of their heads that detected vibrations. Their skin had a rough, pebbly texture, except on their hands and snouts. Their adaptable snouts collected and filtered the air, enhancing the Rodians' highly developed olfactory senses. They could see into the infrared section of the spectrum, allowing them to sense the body heat of their hiding prey emanating from within the darkness. Most Rodians kept in good condition due to their love of fighting and active lifestyles, while some became obese, typically those who could hire others to fight for them.\nRodians typically possessed green skin, but pigment variations were widespread, ranging from disfiguring birthmarks to coloring of the entire body. Rodians possessed long, dexterous, sucker-tipped fingers, which denoted an arboreal lifestyle, allowing them to grip trees and rocky inclines. Their skulls were crowned by a ridge of flexible spines that varied in volume, length, and even color. Some Rodians also grew hair, which was more common among females. Breasts and mammary glands served as other physical marker for females. Rodians emitted a pungent, musky odor, which was an oily pheromone discharge that moisturized the skin and attracted possible mates. The aroma defined identity, indicating to Rodians about a person's ancestry and breeding.\n\n# Section 2\nRodian culture was shaped by their harsh environment, which required them to be skilled hunters and fighters to survive. Their hunting practices and obsession with violence and death were ingrained in their ancestry, making the hunt central to their culture. Over time, Rodia was dominated by a few powerful clans that eliminated or enslaved their smaller neighbors. The leader of the most powerful clan proclaimed himself the Grand Protector of the Rodians, and subsequent Grand Protectors ruled all of Rodia as dictators. The title of Grand Protector transferred from clan to clan as power and loyalties shifted.\nNot all Rodians that made it off-world were bounty hunters or artists. Some were refugees from clan feuds who left Rodia illegally in search of asylum. Illegal immigrants and their descendants born off-world could travel the galaxy freely and work in various professions, from peaceful merchants and technicians to arms dealers and criminal henchmen. Rodian authorities treated off-world-born Rodians as alien galactic citizens, and illegal immigrants were generally not permitted to return to Rodia.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Grand Protector Navik the Red of the Chattza Clan governed the Rodians under the Galactic Empire. Navik tightened emigration limits and forged alliances with the Black Sun and the Galactic Empire after provoking an inter-clan war and capturing power. Navik brutally tormented his opponents, executing the entire Tetsu Clan. The genocide was not limited to Rodia; Chattza hunters pursued Tetsu refugees off-world.\nNavik’s reign came to an end when the Yuuzhan Vong invaded Rodia on their march to the Galactic Core, enslaving the population. Under the guidance of Master Shaper Taug Molou, the extraterrestrial invaders intended to form their Rodian captives into lethal war beasts. Molou disassembled his Rodian test subjects on a cellular level, reassembling their genetic code with parts from other organisms. The Vagh Rodiek, mindless warbeasts that moved on crab-like legs and had half-meter-long sharp bone scythes in place of arms, were the product of this experiment. Natural Rodian head-spines were modified into razor-sharp quills. Rodians who managed to flee Rodia became refugees from persecution.\n\n# Section 4\nRodians had a strong association with the criminal underworld, with many pursuing careers in off-world crime. Rodians like Hulas, Menndo, Hako Armado, and Slyder all made names for themselves as successful bounty hunters. The bounty hunter profession also led to the formation of many armament companies on Rodia, such as the Salus Corporation and Sancretti Arms & Munitions, which produced popular weapons like the N'Gant-Zarvel 9118 heavy carbine and the Repulsor throwing razor.\nApart from bounty hunting, Rodians were involved in other forms of criminal activities, such as piracy and organized crime. Some Rodians became very successful in this underworld, such as the Black Sun Vigos Dardo, Clezo, and Avaro Sookcool. Others, such as Reelo Baruk and Ne'Chak, formed their own criminal enterprises, frequently employing a large number of Rodians as lackeys.\nMany Rodians were Force-sensitive and were members of the Jedi Order. Dree Vandap participated in the New Sith Wars during the Old Republic. A Rodian Jedi also took part in the Yinchorri raid on the Jedi Temple, the Battle of Geonosis, and the First Battle of Kamino. Later, many Rodians like Kelbis Nu, Jovan Drark, Toile Senn, and Twool were all educated as Jedi Knights in the New Jedi Order.\n\n","meta":{"index":105,"author":"DioneSenko","name":"Rodian","release_year":2021}},"Kwa":{"content":"# Introduction\nTheir species would be known to be ancient, Kwa’s was bipedal, meaning their species only used two legs to move around.

Standing at a startling nineteen meters in height, these colossal predators weighed in at several thousands of kilograms in the larger specimens. While native to Dathomir, many adventurers found instances on various worlds ranging from Lehon in the Tempered Wastes to the core-world of Corulag. Rancors were also known to some cultures to provide a rare delicacy, raw rancor-beast liver. Rancors born on Dathomir were noted to have the ability to communicate amongst one another orally, providing a form of transmission of history from one matriarch to the next. After mating, Rancor eggs were usually produced in pairs, with each hatchling standing at three meters in height. These hatchlings would cling to the mother, one on the ventral and one on the dorsal until reaching maturity, in which case they'd go hunt on their own.# Section 1\nWhile it was notably seen as bipedal creatures, the Rancor was known to walk on all fours, especially while carrying their young. Rancor flesh was able to deflect blaster bolts, which made them a target for sport hunters who would turn their hide into vests and boots for commercial sale and personal trophies. Oddly enough, a symbiotic relationship between gibbit birds and Rancor exists, where the birds would clean the Rancor's teeth.\n\n# Section 2\nOne of the many subspecies of Rancor included the Bull Rancor, which was found most commonly on Felucia, with some instances found on Dathomir. While ordinarily solitary creatures that threatened even the mightiest of their native kin, they guarded the legendary \"Rancor Graveyard\" of Felucia communally. Denoted by their much more pale complexion, an elongated tale with males having massive horns, Bull Rancors are genuinely one of the apex predators of the galaxy.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Felucian Rancor was another subspecies of Rancor, which, while being of the same planet as the Bull Rancor, was usually the same size as the typical Dathomirian Rancor. These specimens possessed a single horn and a rigid set of spinal plates.\n\n# Section 4\nThe Jungle Rancor was another subspecies native to Teth and Felucia, possessing brightly colored flesh, sharp spines that run along with most of its body, and its webbed fingers and toes. One specimen was noted to be on Dathomir, although those present stated that it was not native to Dathomir.\n\n# Section 5\nThe Je'daii Order engineered a species of Rancor through alchemy at Anil Kesh on the world of Tython. This subspecies came to be known as the Rancor-Dragon, possessing large wings and head tendrils. There are no recorded sightings beyond that of ancient Tythonian scriptures.\n\n# Section 6\nFinally, there is the Tyrant Rancor, which was native to Dathomir and was noted as being of gargantuan proportions.

Because the humans controlled the planet, the H’drachi had absolutely no control over what happened on the planet, or what happened to them, the humans controlled everything that came on, and left the planet. This would lead the planet to be in the middle of multiple wars and conflicts such as, the Great Manifest Period, or the Clone Wars.

Another distinguishing characteristic was its enormous, black, lidless eyes with worm-like veins on the temples. However, their mental evolution impacted their physical bodies as their condition declined. As a result, their appendages' spindly arms and legs lost the ability to support their weight, including Columi's home world, which is a low-gravity environment. Their bodies were reduced to serve as storage spaces for their hearts, lungs, and other priceless organs. The evolutionary process brought up Columi's vital organs into their cerebral activity.# Section 1\nThe Columi were once herbivorous lizards that inhabited the marshes of Columus, a planet with low gravity. These species' ancestors used buoyant bellies to propel themselves on four webbed feet through the swamp. They later developed the ability to walk on their rear legs, which enabled them to gather fruit from trees. A few thousand years later, they experienced their next evolutionary stage and laid their eggs in trees, which offered them more protection from predators. As a result, they eventually evolved to live fully within the trees, where they started to get hands instead of claws. They also acquired prehensile tails as an alternative to the cumbersome caudal appendage they trailed around when they were quadrupeds. In a few centuries, they developed tools that led to a quick succession of evolutionary advances. Their transition to genuine sentience was characterized by losing their tails and the ability to walk on two legs. They eventually started extracting minerals and other raw materials from the bedrock, using them to build towns elevated above the mud and trees and supported by massive towers.\n\n# Section 2\nColumi of the modern era were highly specialized organisms with brains of four cerebrums and more than one hundred lobes, each of which had a distinct purpose. In addition to Columi’s highly developed brains, their eyes—the only link between them and the outside world—had become increasingly significant among their kind. They evolved beyond being only photoreceptors, since they could perceive all the electromagnetic spectrum's wavelengths. They could \"hear\" through their eyes by identifying and assessing the frequency of sound or radio waves.

Vader created many fake tapes that showed how the Jerni used the Eternity Crystal to reverse the war in order to gain peace. This attracted many rebels, including Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, to Jerne to use the power of the crystal to save Alderaan.# Section 1\nThe Jerni species were humanoid species, they were categorized as Sentient species because they could communicate, create tools, and many more stunning and intelligent creations. The Jerni species had a very charming way of constructing their buildings,  they would construct architectures in a variety of sizes, every construction was windowed with a unique and stunning domed roof. The appearance of the Jerni was human-like, with two arms and two legs, they were hairless, their skin color was maroon, and they also had a wider nose.  A noticeable feat of Jerni science was the Eternity crystal.\n\n","meta":{"index":25,"author":"xTribrid & Unite5000","name":"Jerni","release_year":2021}},"Zhell":{"content":"# Introduction\nZhell were speculated to be the ancestors of the humans in the galaxy, residing on Coruscant.

They nearly went extinct when a volcano erupted near the main city of the Zhell. Ash blanketed the skies of Coruscant for two years. The Taungs would call themselves Dha Werda Verda or in Galactic Basic, The Warriors of Shadow, after this event. The battle that took place after the eruption would eventually become a poem of the same name. Once the Zhell recovered from the volcanic eruption, they fought off the Taungs and rooted out the Taung for good.

Because of their small stature and humor, the kowakian monkey-lizards were used sometimes as pets. They are laughing very often and have a high sense of humor.  They were used as jesters in captivity, but there were known Force Sensitive Kowakians and Koawakians that became bounty hunters. The Kowakian Monkey-Lizards are tiny, they have a long tail, big ears, one big beak without teeth, 4 limbs with long and sharp claws and a hair mane around their necks.# Section 1\nOn the other hand, the Kowakian Ape-Lizards were bigger, taller and stronger unevolved creatures that are guided only by their instinct, being unable to feel emotions like a human does. The Kowakian Ape-Lizards can be very dangerous and aggressive predators that can bite or even swallow their prey if hungry, disturbed or threatened. These Kowaikans are very bulky, having a very big muscular mass. Their legs are small, but enough to keep them on their feet. Their arms are strong, having a large muscular mass and are as long as their height of their body, using their hands to support their high weight.

This is a good foundation to understand when looking into and investigating the essence of the Esh-kha.\n\nThese alien species were parasitic in nature and eventually imprisoned on Belsavis a millennium ago to contain their violent nature.# Section 1\nThe Esh-Kha, alike to many species in the galaxy, are humanoid. They however exhibited features resembling a horse with rounded muzzles. They also walked exclusively on their toes. The species had gray-skinned and brown-skinned variants with muscular legs and harshly carved out foreheads.\n\n# Section 2\nSimilar to the Killik, the Esh-Kha embodied a hive society meaning that their thoughts, ideas, beliefs, and characteristics were replicated across every individual in their species. Females were used often for the sole function of breeding. The Esh-Kha were efficient in their functionality, often breeding individuals who grew up into roles that they fulfilled for their entire lives.\n\nThis included Force-sensitive savants, skilled warriors, and patriarchs who acted as leaders. The Esh-Kha were unique in the sense that names were not given at birth, but rather gifted to them once they exhibited special abilities. “Razer mind”, “Water Thinker” and “Swift blade” were examples of this. These names allowed Esh-Kha to mould into certain individuals who were recognised for their talents through their names.\n\nThe Esh-Kha are believed to have become violent simply for their distaste towards non-hive-like species and thus imposed their wrath on these “inferior” nations.\n\n# Section 3\nAt one point, and following on the quotes listed above, the Esh-Kha were seen as the most feared species in the galaxy. This is evident in the carved writings on the Belsavis prison walls.\n\nThe Esh-Kha in their history had wiped out countless civilisations, and campaigned ruthlessly into many unchartered territories. The species was eventually collectively led by the “Hallow Voice” , a united leader who encouraged the nation to adopt a more peaceful approach. This had its downfall though as a massive surge of population ensued.\n\nThe Hallow Voice responded by taking a large portion of his followers to settle on other worlds. Despite this move to peace, the Esh-Kha are still widely regarded as violent and aggressive individuals.\n\nThe Rakata, a feared species as well, angered by the Esh-Kha’s expansion, created a large invading force to stop the Esh-Kha. It was successful and drove them to close extinction, the remaining survivors were imprisoned as previously mentioned on Belsavis.\n\nA hologram was cruelly placed on Hoth that illustrated the thousands of Esh-Kha who were being punished on Belsavis.\n\n# Section 4\nDuring the Cold War, the Esh-Kha were freed from their stasis and consequently resumed their conquest of the galaxy. With this, they gained more fearsome technology and might which further amplified their campaigns.\n\nThe Sith also aided them in their escape, whereas the Esh-Kha gained Rakata technology and devastated neighboring systems. The Sith had a surprising interest in the Esh-Kha and Darth Synar had been noted as wanting to conscript force-sensitive Esh-Kha into her armada with a subjugation device.\n\n# Section 5\nThese species were immensely involved with the Rakata, Jedi, Sith and various other nations. They are ancient and worth studying in terms of strategy and how to deal with hive-like entities.

Devaronians had black-colored blood due to different chemical compositions and had two livers. They are known to be resistant to poisons and high temperatures. \nThere were only two genders of them male and female, males had horns and no hair; females had hair with no horns. Devaronians had a higher average force sensitive population than most sentient species.# Section 1\nOn the planet Devoran they lived in a matriarchal society. Females had most of the power and influence in society and in government. It was thought that males weren’t actually exempt from rising in power, they just preferred not to and were often nomads instead. They explored different places while staying loyal to their family at home. Though lots of them were force sensitive, the Jedi or Sith way never really applied to their society so there were very few that ended up trained in the force. Their passion for exploring was very strong as they were known to create their own hyperdrive systems without input from any outside populations.

These beings grew to up to five metres and like snakes, they had scales and frequently had different patterns of stripes or spots amongst the species. Their red eyes were protected by translucent eyelids that guarded their vision against the sandstorms that would occur on the moon. The Slith had limited vocal potential, only producing a few sounds due to moisture evaporation that occurred in their bodies. Therefore, they resorted to rubbing their jagged scales against the ground, which was called Slithese.# Section 1\nLiving in nomadic tribes of 8-15 individuals, it had a male-dominated structure. Tribes were led by an alpha male, who was assisted by the most senior male and female of the tribe after the alpha male, the \"Lieutenant male\" and \"First Mate\". Most females were carers and hunters, while males were protectors of their traditions and the young. The Slith were nocturnal hunters and would return to their tribes with their prey alive; venomous fangs paired with sidewinding movement allowed them to quickly paralyse their soon-to-be food. During the day, they would hide away from the heat in places of shelter, either digging deep into the sand or in the shade of large structures like giant cacti. Tribes had several ceremonies that included praying to spirits and worshipping gods, confirming the species’ sentience.\n\n# Section 2\nWhen the Elomin first settled in Elomin, they did not have any knowledge of the life forms living beneath them. The reason behind the Elom going underground was due to lack of water, therefore they had no choice but to go underground. After finding the Elom, the Elomin decided to imprison them, and act as if they were and fit to do labor. This was quickly established when the Galactic Republic found out. The Elom were freed soon afterwards, but the Elomin still were in power. In the Galactic Empire era, the Elomin were forced into slavery. The Elom made several attempts to liberate the enslaved Elomin, and were mostly successful. After the fall of the Galactic Empire, both the Elomin and Elom started living together, much differently than before.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Slith were largely unknown in the galaxy due to being many thousands of years behind other species, but even when contact was established, they preferred to stay isolated with their species. There were some conditions that made them come out of this segregation, namely with the native Gerb species for trading valuable goods such as twilight lizards. Eventually, a scouting team from the First Galactic Empire discovered both species on the moon, from which numbers of Slith were estimated to be around 19 million. The Rebel Alliance sent their own exploratory body to the moon but accidentally brought a plague with them which was harmful to the Gerb. When there was a chance that the plague mutated to harm humans, the Empire decided to demolish the moon’s surface to minimise the disease’s spread. The rebels sought to prevent this from happening. Crisis averted, the Slith stayed on the moon into the era of the Second Galactic Republic, with only a few knowing their existence, for example, Jedi Padawans on the neighbouring moon Yavin 4. Yet another crisis occurred when the war-mongering Yuuzhan Vong attempted to invade the system to eradicate the New Jedi Order, leading to the extinction of life on Yavin 4, 8 and 13, including the Slith.\n\n","meta":{"index":58,"author":"AnimatedEcrux","name":"Slith","release_year":2021}},"Gen'Dai":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Gen’Dai were a humanoid species that seemed to almost be immortal. They lived for millennia and their origins are unknown. However, it is known that they were deprived of all bones in their bodies so they wore heavy armor. It is also known that they were rarely seen in the galaxy and never participated in any big events such as wars. This was due to their lack of numbers and desire to remain alone.# Section 1\nThe Gen’Dai were supposedly a peaceful species and were heavily involved with a certain philosophy by the name of “perfection of permanence” which stated that change was merely an illusion. Due to this philosophy, the Gen’Dai wouldn’t take roles in anything. After the destruction of their unknown homeworld by the Sith Empire, the Gen’Dai were stripped of any governmental party, therefore they roamed the galaxy in utter isolation. Their numbers began to depopulate due to their independence and lack of reproduction. Before all this, the Gen’Dai were brutal and often became mercenaries or Bounty Hunters. Proceeding the Great Hyperspace War, the Sith Empire soon located and destroyed the Gen’Dai homeworld, which was why they began to depopulate and roam the galaxy in solitude. The Gen’Dai who were much older than others would often face mental issues and succumb to violence, taking roles as a Bounty Hunter or Syndicate leader. \n\nThe Gen’Dai never had a working heart system, so they relied on their circulatory system to provide blood through a series of capillaries and muscular contractions. When Gen’Dai received cuts in that area, they would regenerate instead of dying from loss of blood. However, if they took too many dangerous injuries, they would be forced into hibernation. During their hibernation, the Gen’Dai’s body mass that was lost would be replaced with regenerative abilities. Gen’Dai could only be killed via incineration or the physical destruction of their brain. The brain was the only part of their bodies that could not regenerate and over time it would break-down and could send some Gen’Dai into mental break because of their old age.\n\n","meta":{"index":1,"author":"AustinEcrux & jinqxd","name":"Gen'Dai","release_year":2020}},"Killik":{"content":"# Introduction\n“The Kind” as they referred to themselves were a sentient hive mind of insects who varied in size from that of a termite to the scale of a battleship. Their structures were largely constrained to tall hills and mounds with buried holes dug into the sides. These mounds, throughout their history, can be found in the Unknown Regions, and more notably, Alderaan and Alsakan. Their species disappeared long ago in the Killik Twilight, discussed later.# Section 1\nAs previously mentioned, their size was very diverse. Their species spread across many hives called nests whereas reproduction took place. Interestingly, each nest’s members displayed a unique set of physical characteristics specific to that nest. \n\nThe Killiks had a wide range of communicative techniques which did not include vocalisation. They utilised electromagnetic transmissions, chemical pheromones and telepathy that went over long distances. The chemical pheromones - it is unsure whether this is purposefully done or not - can alter the layer beneath the cerebral cortex of the brain of any species including humans. This process created “Joiners” or “Bughuggers” which were species absorbed into the hive mind of the Killik. This is a particularly interesting phenomenon exclusive to the Killik that will be mentioned later.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Killiks each had specific roles within the hives, some included the membrosia givers, the warriors, attendants and the assassins' bugs. This often determined what kind of Killiks could be force-sensitive, although - again, it is uncertain whether it was purposeful or not - the Killik knew how to breed the right type of Killik to ensure more force-sensitives were present in their species.\n\nTheir physical appearance revolved around a hard chitinous exoskeleton which allowed them to hibernate for long periods of time as it resisted erosion. Their body had spiracles which expanded to allow breathing. This was often exploited but enemies, as poison would close the spiracles and choke Killiks to death. Killiks had (4) arms with (3) claws on each and legs that were more than capable of carrying them long distances. The Killiks females had an important role and made up the majority of the species as males were only needed for breeding. Females were able to lay over (1000) eggs a month, and within a year they would be foot soldiers ready for battle making the Killiks a formidable force during attrition battles.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Killiks as a species were a hive mind making them all collectively one individual. They each utilised a palindromic name; the same backwards as it is forwards. This is evident in their name, the “Killiks”. Their telepathic abilities were gifted to Joiners who would eventually lose their own will if exposed to a high enough amount of pheromones. \n\nThe Killiks, due to their hive nature, had a terrible perspective of history as every single memory, thought, belief and perception were muddled into one tunnel. This meant that the memories of Joiners would also influence Killik history. \n\nThese aspects were exclusive to each nest. Different nests had to communicate to each other utilising normal language.\n\nIt is rumoured that UnuThul had immense power as he was able to impose the Dark Nest’s will on nests far across the galaxy which is simply impossible in biological terms. Most nests would not follow the will of another nest unless it’s Will was impossibly stronger.\n\n# Section 4\nKilliks had an infatuation with survival and thus reproduced at a high rate. It also meant they would engage in civil wars without question, which occured. Members from different nests often varied significantly as their physical traits adapted to their respective planet climates.\n\nInterestingly, Killiks despised liars and thus rarely allowed them to become Joiners and even attacked them at times. Killik nests would also differ in characteristics based on the Joiners that they had created. If they had absorbed many miners, they would resemble a mining clan. If they had adopted politicians, then they would begin to portray diplomatic traits which are present in the historical part of this case study later on.\n\nKilliks were an artistic species who created beautiful rituals, specifically during dance ceremonies. When needed, they acted as an unstoppable and unified family that would take the different talents of each hive and use it in war. The Kolosolok and Rekker hives produced juggernauts whilst the Aebea and Qeeq provided air assaulting Killik. At other times they could be cold creatures, abandoning injured or disabled Killik. When food could not be found, some of them simply chose to die without a fear of death or a love of life.\n\n# Section 5\nIt is hypothesised that their increase of the absorption of Joiners in the later years was due to some collective realisation that more Joiners would help them expand quicker. This idea was inspired by multiple species under one banner being able to do more.\n\n# Section 6\n“The Killiks are tied to the history of the galaxy in a way we don’t understand yet. They were living in cities before humans learned to build, and they were a civilization before the Sith were here when Centerpoint and the Maw were constructed and driven from Alderaan by the beings who did it.”\n\nThe Killiks were born on Alderaan and have survived the span of time. They shared the Pre-Republic era with species that include the Celestials, Gree, Kwa, Sharu, Columni, Taung and Humans. Their hives spontaneously spread around the stars before 35,000 BBY.\n\nThe Celestials were rumoured to have conscripted the Killiks as laborers due to their effectiveness in physical stature. Some time during this, the “Great Migration” occurred where some Killik stayed, and others spread to the stars. These star inhabitants were helped by the Son and the Daughter, the famous architects, who guided the Killiks towards building wonders such as the World Puller, Still Curtain and Chasm of Forever.\n\nThe Killiks are an ancient species, and it’s stated that in their collective memories, the Thuruht hive were aware of how the Corellian system was formed. This hive in particular, also was known to have imprisoned the “Abeloth” entity (refer to the respective case study to learn of this.) Furthermore, the Vulagool race seem to have a deep hatred for the species, though it is unknown why.\n\n# Section 7\nDuring the Killiks work in the Celestial slave camps, it is specified that the Killiks had done some unknown sin to anger them which caused the Celestials to kill most of the Killik laborers. \n\nThe Killiks later invaded Korriban and drove off the Sith, also for an unknown reason. Following this invasion, the majority of Killiks scattered across the Unknown Regions presumably due to criticism from the Celestials. It is rumoured that a Sith Killik was among them at this time. Luke Skywalker hypothesised that they had to leave anyways, having consumed the majority of their resources on respective planets considering the size of their population.\n\nA scientific study indicates that for some unknown reason, each generation of Killiks that were birthed, had less technological prowess and intelligence than the one before it. This essentially meant that some of the later generations were unable to act as a hive organism anymore rendering their civilisation chaotic and ineffective. This might also be attributed to too many Joiners having been absorbed into the hivemind.\n\n# Section 8\nTheir species in terms of architecture and industrial potential was undeniably and insurmountably powerful. When helped by the Architects they built massive space stations and mining industries. They created a furnace that was powered by Force lightning. The Killiks strangely enjoyed alcoholic beverages and used Ambrosia to do this.\n\nFinally, their language or at least the vocal one that they rarely expressed, was tremendously hard to learn. Touch and stress had varied meanings alongside (30) vowels that unfortunately all sounded like “U” to the human ear.\n\n# Section 9\nMany of the Killiks chose to remain in hibernation of Alderaan. The Castle Lands or the surface of Alderaan was filled with mounds and hills leaving traces of their existence. These Killiks would come up to the surface every few decades and be torn to shreds by the inhabiting humans who had an “Order of Extermination” which was an organisation dedicated to eliminating the emerging Killiks. \n\nThe Oroboro nests, as they were called, had a large number of inhabiting Killiks and emerged during the Cold War. They engaged in conflict with the humans but were driven back through very vile methods. House Ulgo of Alderaan used the “Pain Factory” to torture Killiks into leading swarms against enemies. Doctor Parren studied these species so that he could essentially make pets of them, and even created a volunteer Joiner. Weapons such as “Mother’s Milk poison” and the “Blood Boiler” were vile weapons used to break the spiracles of Killiks and were effective in killing them. The Brood Totem was created to be deployed on enemy armies which lured swarms out of the ground who would consequently attack them.\n\nAmbassador Hyllus, during this time, also attempted to create an alliance between the Sith Empire and the Killiks though they were already dwindling near extinction.\n\n# Section 10\n0 BBY their homeworld of Alderaan was destroyed but of no consequence to the Killiks since they had departed to their pocket of the Unknown Regions long before. There they began to expand at a moderate rate to the point where they were noticed by the Chiss. The Chiss, who had, had labour shortages following the Third Vagaari War and thus hired several nests to support their war efforts.\n\nThe Chiss were familiar with the Joiner phenomenon and thus imposed restrictions on their labourers to prevent contamination. However, it occurred anyway since rival Chiss families sabotaged each other. (2) entire families were absorbed, and to make matters worse, a starship named the Tachyon Flier carrying (3) Force Sensitives were absorbed into a Killik colony when they crash landed. These ultimately sparked force-sensitive Killiks as well as the desire for individual freedom which Raynar Thul influenced upon the Killik when he became a Joiner.\n\n# Section 11\nThe Killiks also began trade across the galaxy which solved the food shortages amongst them, this was also influenced by Raynar Thul who was now named UnuThul. The Killik now adopted a principle of a single Will, the desire to unify and have a single purpose.\nThis translated to the desire for conquest and expansion, which led to the conflict with the Chiss Ascendancy. The Killik began using hospitals for sick, and more advanced trade which were (2) previous issues that prevented their population from exploding. Now it did.\n\nBy the Galactic Alliance era in 35 ABY there were an unexpected (375) nests. These were guided by the Dark Nest who UnuThul controlled to begin invading the Chiss Ascendancy. The Joiners were able to introduce the Killik into the Galactic Alliance but despite this, the Jedi delegation sabotaged Raynar Thul. They made him think that the nests were aggressive and unnecessarily hostile out of instinctive traits. He then decided to listen to Leia Organa by moving the nests to the Utegetu Nebula. This fell under a peace agreement and cease-fire, concluded by the transport of the Killiks via Hapana Battle Dragons to these (14) planets.\n\n# Section 12\nTo the Killiks' surprise, these planets had an unfortunate defense system that would envelop unwanted inhabitants with a devastating nova that would wipe them out. This assaulted the Killik every time they altered the ecosystem with Fizz. Fizz  consisted of nano-machines that melted down intruders on a molecular level.\n\nThis eroded the already tense peace agreement as the Killiks believed the Jedi had intended this to happen, but they were actually unaware of these defences. The Dark Nest propagandised this lie and used it to begin a war against the Galactic Alliance.\n\nMost famous of these battles occurred when the Victory-Class headed by Admiral Ackbar was captured. Attempts for peace by the Jedi were futile when Jacen Solo attacked the Chiss hoping to lure them into attacking the Killik. The Killik had many allies such as the Geonosians and Flakaxes, who also being insectoid species, were easier to absorb into the hive.\n\nThe Killiks eventually lost the war with Grand Master Luke Skywalker sealing their fate. They retreated back to the pocket of the Unknown Regions. The Jedi further guaranteed their submission by planting the Fizz nanotech all across the Killiks Colony planets. This would act as invisible barriers preventing the Killik from ever expanding.\n\n","meta":{"index":20,"author":"Souleth","name":"Killik","release_year":2020}},"Kintan Crusher":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Kintan Crushers were a species native to the planet Kintan. Similar to the Kintan Strider, the species was semi-sentient, however the Kintan Crushers were often more intelligent then the Kintan Striders. This is simply because the Crushers had the ability to follow orders and the Striders often did not. The Crushers had spikes down their spine, and their skin was mostly gray or brown. On top of that, they had enormous fists that they could use in combat and whatnot.# Section 1\nThe Crushers were mainly used for brute force, as their upper body was extremely strong, although they had smaller legs. Crushers came in many sizes, as some of them were taller than many humans combined. They also had 4 claws on each of their hands as well as 2 sharp teeth. When running, they combined both their legs and arms to propel themselves forwards. Some Kintan Crushers were even able to cause earthquakes, using their arms.\n\n# Section 2\nOn Kintan, the Crushers would often be in small groups, however, it was not rare to see a Crusher by itself. The Crushers would hunt for food, with the support of their aggressive traits. Many Kintan were used by the Hutt Cartel, for example, the palace of Kaggara, on Nal Hutta. They were used as enforcers, and they were trained by handlers. The Kintan Crushers also went by many names, such as the Kintan behemoth and Kintan warhounds. In battle, the Kintan Crushers used their fists to harm enemies, or knock them down and then proceed to stomp on them. Crushers also used rocks and boulders as a weapon that they could throw at a target.\n\n# Section 3\nWhen Kintan was showered with an extreme amount of radiation, it caused many mutations, creating species such as the Spine Dragon through evolution. The Nikto hunted the Spine Dragons into extinction, as well as the Kintan Striders, however a few striders were able to escape, as they had some defensive ability. In a war between the Hutts and Xim The Despot, the Hutts had convinced the Nikto to join their side. Soon after this, the Third Battle of Vontor occurred, and the Hutts gained victory, expanding the Hutt Space.\n\n# Section 4\nBeyond their home planet, on Nal Hutta, the Hutt Kaggara placed many Kintan Crushers as a defense. The most terrifying of all the Kintan Crushers of Nal Hutta, was the Foreman Crusher. The Foreman Crusher guarded a droid factory owned by Kaggara, but was taken down and chained by a few Twi’leks, until he was needed. Soon, some hostile infiltrators would successfully bypass the many Kintan Crushers, which led to the release of the Foreman Crusher.

Although having three fingers, most Gands were notable for being able to punch through Stormtrooper armor, which would then become known as “Piercing Touch.” Their eyes were concealed with a layer of a keratin substance that covered their eyes from floating debris, most prevalently useful in sandstorms. They were a species that was directly related to the Kel Dor and Tognath species, who also wore masks off of their homeworlds. A notable member of this species is a bounty hunter named Zuckuss, one of the original findsman to flee their home planet. The Findsmen was a mystic tradition that dates back centuries. For the people of their planet that were pristine trackers. They were also recognized for speaking a language of a similar name.","meta":{"index":23,"author":"Librarian's Assembly","name":"Gand","release_year":2021}},"Rakata":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Rakata were an ancient race of Force-sensitive humanoids, widely known for their technical advancements and conquests in the known galaxy. They were one of the first species in history to ever perform hyperspace travel, and some of their constructions have been an unsolved mystery to this day. Rakatans were also the pioneer race who connected the Dark Side of the Force with machines, making them by far the most powerful beings in the galaxy before their Infinite Empire’s fall.# Section 1\nThe Rakata originated from the planet Lehon in the Unknown Regions, often referred to as Rakata Prime. Initially, they were a barbaric, primitive and limited species, but under the guidance of Kwa, another much older, ancient race of Force-attuned builders, the Rakatan civilization flourished. Unfortunately, unlike Kwa, the Rakatans did not hesitate to utilise the corrupting Dark Side of the Force, which slowly led to many disagreements between these two races. Eventually, after establishing several colonies on planets with a strong resonance in the Force, the Rakata turned against Kwa and waged war on their former teachers, successfully overpowering them. At that time, the Rakatans also constructed the mythical Star Forge: a location capable of creating powerful star fleets by itself, which would later be sought by Revan himself. Soon after defeating the Kwa, Rakatans focused their efforts on purging the Celestials, the masters of Kwa and ultimate masters of the galaxy, and succeeded, despite the Celestials’ determination to shield the galaxy from them. Finally ready, the Rakatan Infinite Empire spread to the rest of the galaxy to dominate and conquer everything that stood in their way.\n\n# Section 2\nEven when united under one banner, the Rakata were still divided into hundreds of different tribes and factions, each of which shared a slightly different history and cultural heritage. Both slavery and intense usage of the Force were important for the Rakata, for they believed that dominance and conquest were the only just methods of development. Anger, rage and strength were dominant characteristics of any pieces of culture left by them. The two dominant social classes of the Infinite Empire, the ruling priests and the physically stronger, but less important warriors, cooperated but did not trust each other more than was required of them. It is worth mentioning that many Rakata became slave masters and successfully gained respect and power among their people during their service. Nevertheless, as in every other empire, the Rakata also pledged their allegiance to Predors, an equivalent of lords in their society. Predors, especially the supreme Over-Predor among them, managed the whole Empire’s needs, reigned the conquered worlds and often rivalled against one another. Another important group in the Rakatan society were the Force Hounds, a cast of Force-sensitive warriors and servants who were talented enough to sense, track down and seek out new, Force-sensitive populations for the Infinite Empire to conquer. One of the most important encounters of Force Hounds with other Force-sensitive species happened when Xesh, one of the Predor’s personal Force Hounds, arrived on Tython and was stuck there after causing a planet-wide storm, during which he lost the memory of his past. After encountering, and being defeated by, the Je’daii, Xesh was exiled to the Tython’s moon Bogan, where he cooperated with another exiled Force user and created a project of Forcesabers- one of the first predecessors of what we today know as lightsabers, and later one of the weapons used by the Force Hounds. After realising the error of his dark ways, Xesh turned to the Light Side of the Force and helped the Je’daii defeat the Rakata, initiating the beginning of their domination’s end.\n\n# Section 3\nEven though the Rakata conquered thousands of worlds across the galaxy, their preferences lay in the Force-sensitive worlds, which would serve them as both slave sources and potential Force energy banks. They took hundreds of thousands of slaves from planets such as Kashyyk, Coruscant and Tatooine, and established many outposts on these controlled planets. Interestingly enough, when Rakata encountered Dathomir, the homeworld of the Kwa, they butchered the world’s inhabitants and landscape in revenge for their suffering in the past. The Kwa themselves have devolved into an anima, an unintelligent subspecies named Kwi. Nevertheless, Dathomir proved to be an interesting planet to the Rakata, for example, because of the Rancor species that lived there. \nBelsavis, another planet captured by them, served as a planetary prison that was later claimed by the Galactic Republic for the same purpose. There were, however, certain species that challenged the Rakata’s claim to their native worlds and waged war on them, successfully reclaiming their land despite the technical and physical disadvantages. The most famous attempts were those of the Sith species of Korriban, the Je’daii of Tython, and Kumumgah of Tatooine. All of these races led an aggressive revolt against the Rakata and drove them away from their planets. Unlike the Force-sensitive Je’daii and Sith, the planet belonging to Kumumgah was scourged and turned into ashes as an act of revengebyf the losing conquerors before their final retreat.\nThe Infinite Empire’s fall came with a sudden, mysterious plague that infected the race of Builders, killing hundreds of thousands of Rakatans and causing the survivors to slowly lose their connection to the Force. Tragically, their shattered bond with the Force also disabled them from operating most of their own inventions and slowly turned back into the barbaric, primitive species they had originated as. Along with many political plays, wars lost to the Sith and Je’daii and violent slave uprisings across the whole galaxy, the remaining Rakata slowly vanished, exiled themselves into the Wild Space, or returned to their first homeworld only to live in poverty and ignorance. The former slaves soon developed their own cultures, freed themselves from the Rakatan influence, and erased all mentions of those events from the public memory.\n\n# Section 4\nEven extinct, the Rakata have been certainly one of the most powerful and impactful races to ever live in the Known Galaxy, having left many traces on almost every culture, and planet. Their conquests granted various civilisations the technical foundation they needed. A sense of nationality and community they wouldn’t have maintained during their slavery. Many planets such as Tatooine, Belsavis or Kashyyyk have been irreversibly altered by the race of Builders. To this day they remain an object of interest to governments, corporations and researchers. Many dark, corrupting inventions of Rakata have been forgotten thanks to the Order of Je’daii and others, such as the Belsavis prison, supporting the enslaved races in their pursuit of safety and knowledge. A certain group of Rakatan inventions that have been wreaking mayhem years after the Rakata’s demise, such as the Star Forge, have been destroyed or hidden forever. They will certainly never be fully forgotten as one of the most powerful and evil forces in the galaxy.\n\n","meta":{"index":57,"author":"abc_5329","name":"Rakata","release_year":2023}},"Drengir":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Drengir were sentient species coming from a marsh planet.

Later on they produced deadly poisons where it could kill a Jedi, and the bare presence of the Drengir inspired fear.

Similar to the Zabrak and Dathomirian, the Elomin had horns around the top of their head, as well as tusks in the nose. They grew to 1.6 meters and lived for about 110 ten years on average.# Section 1\nElomin had quite a different anatomy than the regular human. It consisted of 4 stomachs and 6 hearts, plus pointed ears and spanchons. Elomin were an advocate of personal hygiene, as they cleaned themselves a countless amount of times. On top of that, Elomin were near perfectionists, as they tried to put order into anything they could, which often led to many mistakes.\n\n# Section 2\nWhen the Elomin first settled in Elomin, they did not have any knowledge of the life forms living beneath them. The reason behind the Elom going underground was due to lack of water, therefore they had no choice but to go underground. After finding the Elom, the Elomin decided to imprison them, and act as if they were and fit to do labor. This was quickly established when the Galactic Republic found out. The Elom were freed soon afterwards, but the Elomin still were in power. In the Galactic Empire era, the Elomin were forced into slavery. The Elom made several attempts to liberate the enslaved Elomin, and were mostly successful.

Like humans, Mikkians had two arms with five fingered hands, including an opposable thumb, two legs and two front facing eyes. The skin was known to be green, pink, red, yellow and blue while their irises could be blue or red. A Mikkian’s colour could vary greatly even among close relatives like twins, parents and children. Twins for example, could be yellow and green or even red and blue. Mikkian’s tendrils were able to move independently while the number, form and pattern would vary from person to person. They served as the sensory organ replacement of ears, though some Mikkians did possess ears as well. The tendrils, however, were able to detect other information too, like humidity, temperature and radiation. The Radiation detection was sensitive to the point they could almost see light and dark. Their eyes was still their main visual organ despite this. Some Mikkians were Force Sensitive and as such able to become Jedi or Sith with some training. Notable force sensitive Mikkians are Jedi Master Twins Tiplar and Tiplee who fought and died during the Clone wars. The twins were sisters and shared a blue mark on their forehead, while having red and yellow pigmented skin.# Section 1\nIn Society Mikkians placed kinship and integrity above anything else, with their honesty sometimes coming off as blunt or rude to others. They would often have a hard time adjusting to the more flexible views the other races had, with their complex code of honor enveloping all things in life. The Mikkians did respect warrior traditions though they valued honor and discipline over things like victory and physical might. The language Mikkian was a rather melodic flowing tongue made up from  multiple ancient dialects. Many Mikkians were proud of this language, however, had no problems with learning Galactic Basic. The Mikkian’s belief in the Force played a large role within the different religious traditions. Due to this, they were quick to question the Empire when the Jedi Order was marked as traitors. On top of this their tendrils had an important cultural meaning to them in their society. Mikkian mythics as such used Tendril-readings to predict the future and every facet of them contributed to that meaning. The Mikkian species come from the planet Mikkia, which has been a part of the Galactic Republic for thousands of years. In fact they joined the Galactic Republic before the Galactic Civil War. Being a secretive species, there is a lot of mystery with the Mikkians and such not much is known about their history itself.\n\n","meta":{"index":18,"author":"Blazey_Kitsune","name":"Mikkians","release_year":2021}},"Draethos":{"content":"# Introduction\nINTRODUCTION\n“The Millenia Species” often lived to over (1000) years old.

These relatively tall creatures have little documented about them, but the most famous of their species was Odan-Urr who essentially placed them on the roadmap.\n\nHe founded the Great Library of Ossus and is a symbolic token of the kind of culture and society that the Draethos have.# Section 1\nBIOLOGY & APPEARANCE\nCarnivorous and predatory in nature, these species could be blue, purple black and in rare cases, even pink in colour. They had a thick leathery skin that related to their reptilian ancestors. Furthermore, due to having inherited the characteristics of many other species that lived underground, they have intensely trained night vision.\n\nThey had four-fingered hands that were connected by amphibian webs. The same could be said about their feet, as they were bipedal creatures.\n\nThe Draethos had remarkably long lifespans, reaching adulthood at the standard age of (18) but only being considered “middle-aged” at (400) years old. Another (300) years and they began their elderly journey as an “old” member of society.\n\nThe species, and their constituents are characterised by war and strategic intellect. On top of this, the species prided itself on partial telepathy whereas they could communicate with individuals from far distances but could not actually read their thoughts.\n\n# Section 2\nSOCIETY & CULTURE\nLong living Draethos established a society that took millenia to transcend to new ideas, and grow out of old generations. This meant that the ideas and traditions of elders remained in usage for hundreds of years.\n\nMost members of society were expected to engage in training, conflict, and hunting. Many evolved from this, but became entitled and egotistical elitists who centralised around their social score. Primitive concepts such as gladiators, and mercenaries were prominent in this society. To further attribute to this, pacifist and peaceful ideologies were ridiculed by the Draethos.\n\nThis was to such a significant extent, that Draethos who wandered from the warlike mentalities were exiled from the world as a whole.\n\nThis ultimately meant that Draethos encountered outside of their homeworld demonstrated much intelligence, calm and the desire to pursue peace.\n\nSouleth’s author note: Odan-Urr was one of these exiles, and despite this he built a magnificent library. He is a perfect example of the concept that you do not have to be a product of a failed homeworld or society.

They were large humanoids with honed teeth, utilized for emptying the bones of prey. They possessed eight tiny nasal slits above their mouth, along with two squat eye stalks jutting out of the sides of their head. The species, bearing an uncanny resemblance to their relatives, were only known to be found on Tython following the fall of the Infinite Empire.# Section 1\nHaving been forsaken by the Infinite Empire after the Force Wars on the planet Tython, not much was known or recorded about the past of the Flesh Raiders. However, there were two prevailing theories that the Jedi Order came up with during the Cold War. One was that they had once been cultured, though met their downfall as other settlers disappeared. The other was that Sith alchemy brought upon their primitive state.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Flesh Raiders were in control of Tythos Ridge just as the Jedi Order made their arrival following the Great Galactic War. Their oafish nature led to the land being tarnished; with a prolific amount of bones covering the little pathways in the area. This prevented a Jedi meditative retreat from being built in Tythos Ridge. By the year 3643 BBY, the Flesh Raiders had established outposts in the area. These consisted of crude structures where they would carry out a form of religious worship. They had also developed a higher level of intellect, being able to use weapons such as vibroblades. Moreover, they would use fire as a form of long-distance communication. At this point, they had begun to be dangerous to outsiders, as they held the path connecting the ruins of Kaleth to the west.\n\n# Section 3\nDespite being meager in number, the Flesh Raiders were treated as a threat to the Jedi on Tython throughout the Cold War.

This angel-like species lived on a planet named Iego, which resided on the fringes of the known galaxy. In the surroundings of the planet were thousands of moons, and living on these moons was the Diathim. They specifically lived on the moon Millius Prime. Eventually, the planet and the moons were destroyed by a LaserWeb Defense Station, which was deserted by the Separatists.# Section 1\nThese mysterious species, who lived alongside the Maelibi, have a bright blazing white with a yellow tint aura. They were thought to be made of pure energy due to their bright aura. However, due to their intense radiance, it would become a challenge to write out their biological details. From the many accounts who have seen them, they were thought to be two to three meters tall, slender, with six beautiful white wings protruding from their backside. An example of a Diathim, seen by Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and two other Jedi, described her with wings, milky white skin, blond hair, light blue eyes, a tiny nose, and long limbs. Though many have different observations of the species, it was no doubt that they could fly and glide through the air. Their capabilities allowed them to even go out as far as space without using protective gear.\n\n# Section 2\nAlthough the Diathim were described to have an aura of kindness, they were very infatuated with spacecrafts. This prompted them to occasionally mob those who came by and hypnotize the pilots of these spacecrafts that came around their planets and crash them. For this sole reason, they were regarded as dangerous creatures. Because of this reason, not many came by, so their planet's habitat was unknown. It was believed that they had no language of their own; however, they were aware of the Galactic Basic Standard.\n\n# Section 3\nLong ago, when the Diathim evolved on the planet of Iego, they began to inhabit their 42 moons. There they lived alongside the Maelibi, tall burrowing beings that ate castaways. They have been known since 25,793 BBY. At this time. the Galactic Basic had yet to be normal. and so with the language at the time, a “space angel” referred to an innocent and selfless person. Millennia later, in the Clone Wars, some Diathim were forced to leave as the Separatists installed a laser grid system onto the planet, forcing people to stay on the planet. However, this contraption was deactivated by the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, as requested by Diathim refugees.\n\n# Section 4\nOn the planet Tatooine, young Anakin Skywalker had mentioned the Diathim before.

The weapon was also capable of shooting pure bolts that were not engulfed in energy, some of which had poison or explosive tips.\n\n# Section 2\nThe bowcaster had a polarizing orb at each end of the bow, which generated a magnetic field used to accelerate the quarrels. After cocking the weapon, a simple trigger sped the quarrel forward and charged it in an envelope of plasma. The weapon required the strength of a Wookiee to draw back the cocking spring, although some modern bowcasters featured automatic cocking mechanisms for use by other species. While decreasingly effective beyond 30 meters, the bowcaster was more powerful and accurate than typical blaster weapons.

In 4 ABY, it was planted in the control and generator rooms of the Endor shield generator bunker, which was protecting the Death Star II, by the Rebel Alliance strike team. Activation of such a device required the use of a twistable primer to set a delay time and an activation plunger to commence the countdown, ensuring that no accidental detonations were made. Once activated, the grenade wasn’t easy to disarm and needed force to twist the activation plunger in the opposite direction. However, smugglers were known to degrade the bottom of the grenade to diminish the chances of a successful de-arming procedure. The power of this proton grenade was comparable to an unstable thermal grenade but was focussed in one direction, and had the added benefit of being an Electro-Magnetic Pulse emitter with a range of up to 20 metres away. Similarly to the workings of proton torpedoes on larger starfighters, proton grenades had a proton core, making them very powerful explosives that could be held. It detonated and disabled the deflector shields over the Death Star, allowing Rebel starfighters to get into the insides of the orbital station and take out its power generator.","meta":{"index":8,"author":"AnimatedEcrux","name":"7-PrG Proton Grenade","release_year":2021}},"Trauger Gas":{"content":"# Introduction\nTrauger gas was first discovered on planet Socorro, it was a toxin created by volcanic activity.

The lightsaber was used on Telos IV, Coruscant, and Bandomeer where he would spar with his previous master Jinn and his current student Obi-Wan Kenobi. His lightsaber crystal would later turn synthetic red after he turned to the dark side when witnessing his father’s execution by his Jedi Master. In 43 BBY, the lightsaber would disintegrate in a pool of acid with its then twenty-five-year-old wielder, Xanatos.# Section 1\nAs the lightsaber owner’s last test before becoming a Jedi Knight, Yoda would send both Xanatos and his master Qui-Gon to Telos IV to meet his father, Governor Crion, after he secretly orchestrated the murder of one of the Telos priestesses, Liora. While Qui-Gon was trying to investigate the incident, Crion would convince the lightsaber owner to side with him. Xanatos decided to side with his father during the civil war, thus failing his final trial.

As Jinn tried to apologize, the wielder’s fury at the death of his father caused him to turn to the dark side, the reason for the lightsaber’s later change to synthetic red.\n\nIn 44 BBY, the lightsaber wielder met up with Obi-Wan Kenobi, his former master’s then padawan, in Bandomeer after finding out about him being an unfit Jedi. He then talked the padawan down, telling him he was not going to make it as a Jedi Knight. Wanting to take Obi-Wan Kenobi’s lightsaber for his own, he then dueled him with his synthetic red lightsaber but was then intercepted by Jedi Master Qui-Gon, who remembered the lightsaber wielder’s fighting tendencies and who was able to outmatch him. After, the wielder then tricked his former master and his then padawan into a mine with hidden explosives scattered throughout. The lightsaber holder attacked them with his speeder bike’s laser cannon, forcing them deeper into the mine and closer to his trap. The wielder was then pushed back by Obi-Wan, who appeared stronger than he originally believed, while his master Qui-Gon also helped fight the rogue lightsaber wielder.

However, its distinct properties posed challenges to conventional defenses, making it a formidable threat.# Section 1\nThe ion paddle beamer featured a flat disc shape, designed specifically for the hands of the Ssi-ruuk. The weapon was lightweight and could be easily operated with one hand, utilizing a control stick on the underside for firing. Emitting a slender silver ion beam, the weapon targeted the nervous system of its victims. Even a glancing blow could render an extremity numb for an extended period, while a direct hit could induce unconsciousness. Its optimal range extended to eight meters, with a maximum range of twelve. Notably, the weapon possessed the unique ability to bypass conventional shields and armor, presenting a challenge to standard defensive measures.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring the Ssi-ruuk invasion of Bakura shortly after the Battle of Endor, the paddle beamer played a pivotal role. The Ssi-ruuk, driven by their quest for living specimens to power their battle fleet through entechment, relied heavily on these weapons.

Despite being one of the deadliest droids of its day, the HK-24 failed commercially because there was no considerable demand for an assassin droid. However, Arkoh Adasca, the CEO of Adascorp, later purchased the entire supply to aid him in his search for Arkanian Offshoot scientist Gorman Vandrayk.# Section 1\nThe HK-24 assassin droids wore red durasteel armor plating and had orange optical sensors. They appeared to be typical service droids, but they were engineered to be lethal with a blaster rifle, capable of quickly dispatching their targets. They also had a utility vibroblade, which allowed them to specialize in chopping off limbs, making them an effective hand-to-hand combatant. The HK-24's heuristic processor improved its learning and reasoning abilities, and its translation unit enabled it to comprehend millions of communication forms.\nThe HK-24's tough durasteel frame allowed it to withstand crushing blows from larger opponents, making it appropriate for security use. It was, nevertheless, fiercely autonomous and despised cooperating with other HK-24 droids. Infighting and insults occurred when several HK-24 units were gathered together, since each one thought itself to be superior to its fellow units.\n\n# Section 2\nThe HK-24, which was mass-produced in anticipation of the Mandalorian Wars, was expected to be in great demand from the Galactic Republic and planetary governments. Unfortunately, demand for assassin droids was much lower than expected, resulting in the HK-24's financial failure. As a result, Czerka abandoned and closed its manufacturing facilities.\nDespite their failure in the market, the HK-24 droids were purchased in bulk by Arkoh Adasca, CEO of Adascorp, and deployed in his search for Gorman Vandrayk. Vandrayk was a crucial figure whose expertise was key to Adasca's plot to sell the services of exogorths, an enormous slug species, to one of the factions fighting in the Mandalorian Wars. Vandrayk was discovered thirty years later by Adasca's Rodian aide, Eejee Vamm, and HK-24 droids were dispatched to track him down. Although HK-24 soldiers cornered Vandrayk on the planet Ralltiir, they were finally annihilated when Vandrayk \nunleashed a swarm of gigantic exogorth creatures on Adasca’s ship, the Arkanian Legacy.\n\n# Section 3\nHK-24 Assassin droids served a variety of purposes, including assassins and bounty hunters, though their deployment drew criticism from organic hunters during the Mandalorian Wars. They were also excellent for use as security because of their durable durasteel frame, which allowed them to withstand crushing blows from larger opponents.

His son, Arcann, succeeded him and launched the Eternal Conquest, an event that would make the super artificial intelligence SCORPIO aware of the existence of the GEMINI droids. SCORPIO allied with the Eternal Alliance to stop the Empire by installing itself into the GEMINI frequency, a trap that would free the droids from the Prime's control and gain free will. The Prime was what was used as the mold for new GEMINI droids as well as where all protocols could be over-ridden. This led to some droids choosing to explore other versions of freedom, while others stayed with the Eternal Fleet. SCORPIO surrendered the Eternal Throne to Vaylin after Arcann’s defeat, and it was now a possession of the Alliance.\n\n# Section 2\nThe GEMINI droids, having free will now, were hesitant to face their opponent without fea. In response to this, Vaylin rebooted the GEMINI Captain to its factory settings using a purifier drone. Vaylin used this purifier drone to later as well, revive the GEMINI droids to their default programming, thus eliminating their free will and returning them and the Eternal Fleet to the command of the Throne. Vaylin, in a turn of events, decided to use this to her advantage and destroy several Alliance strongholds. One of these assaults eventually led to her death, causing the GEMINI Captains to revert to their primary objective - to destroy all sentient life in the galaxy. The Alliance Commander was able to take hold of the Throne and have the droids under his control, further using them to find a hostile presence on Iokath.\n\n# Section 3\nHowever, a single droid, GEMINI 16, managed to avoid capture and still had free will. Becoming aware that it was vulnerable to outside control, it was determined to destroy the Eternal Fleet and the GEMINI network. With the use of another Iokath creation, Zildrog, it was able to gain control of the Gravestone, the only frigate that was able to destroy the Fleet. Though successful, GEMINI 16 and Zildrog were then destroyed by the Alliance, marking the end of the GEMINI droids.\n\n","meta":{"index":101,"author":"Librarian's Assembly","name":"GEMINI Droids","release_year":2021}},"Hovering Pram":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe hovering pram was a containment device that was used for the transportation of small, sentient beings such as Grogu.

The lightsaber was constructed how Jedi from many years ago constructed their lightsaber, the only difference being that the blade was powered by a Corusca Gem acquired from Lando Calrissian’s GemDiver Station. Later down the line Jacen fought in the Yuuzhan Vong War with his friends and family by his side. Jacen used his lightsaber against a Warmaster by the name of Tsavong Lah who was responsible for torturing his mother. During a mission Jacen’s lightsaber was taken by a mysterious Fosh Jedi Vergere.

The rifle could be disassembled and put into a specialized case. A downside of having the  X-45 sniper rifle was that it was fragile, this would mean only taking it out when you are at the time in point to use it, it also can compromise you for your target or targets to escape if they spot you setting the weapon up. To own an X-45 sniper rifle you would need anywhere from 750-1000 credits. This rifle was available from as early as the Clone Wars, the rifle was used throughout the rule of the Galactic Empire, and into the administration of the New Republic. The bolt was reported to be overfocused in the barrel, which made the bolt thinner than a normal bolt from a normal blaster, but the X-45 sniper rifle bolt was much more lethal. The weapon was initially marked as a civilian weapon called the Riflette. Eventually, the weapon was re-classified for military use this was because the weapon became popular with assassins.

The Particle Array Gun was more commonly used against organic targets instead of droids, because it was more effective against organic life. The gun was just as powerful as the ACP Repeater, but it had a more limited range and a lower rate of fire. Because of this, the ACP Array wasn’t built for outdoor combat, where long ranges come into play. It was mainly used for ship boarding or urban warfare, as well as against shielded targets.

A weapon created by the Morellian Weapons Conglomerate, and rarely wielded by others except the Morellian Enforcers. While the weapon is a rare and limited item, it also required an immense amount of training in order to use it properly.# Section 1\nThe Enforcer weighed in at just over two kilograms (About four and a half pounds), it carried an eight round capacity. The rounds however were .48 caliber slugs, meaning that the weapon had devastating stopping power behind each shot. The .48 caliber Enforcer pistol was able to pierce through heavy personnel armor, light-armor vehicles, and even once penetrated an XP-38 sport landspeeder in its history. The weapon did come with some downsides, one of them being that the pistol is extremely loud. The bullets of the Enforcer shot out with the sound of a cannon-like crack with every shot fired. Making the weapon a burden for sensitive hearing or indoor combat. Furthermore, along with its major stopping power being its major recoil, it needed to be gripped with a lot of strength or the weapon could fly out of the user's hand due to its power.

It’s a highly flammable and chemically reactive element that is ideal for waging war.# Section 1\nAlthough baradium is now mass-produced in factories across the galaxy for obvious reasons, it used to be discovered on normal planets through normal geological changes. Duro and Anobis were examples of these worlds. It is hypothesised however that upon their discovery and continued usage, a synthetic replacement was needed as the natural resources were stripped completely.\n\nThe baradium itself, being highly reactive, when detonated, created a gigantic swirl of pulsing energy that incinerated anything and everything in its radius. This was as a result of the intense heat that the fusion impulse created.\n\nDue to this chemical being so dangerous, mistakes could not be afforded. It was also expensive to reproduce and was often transported in only small quantities to prevent it from accidentally exploding during transportation.\n\n# Section 2\nBaradium as previously mentioned, was utilised in a multitude of devices. Thermal detonators were the most well known, and were called baradium charges. It could pierce through the hardest of materials and devastated enemy forces when used as mortar rounds. Bounty hunters often used these baradium charges in that sense.\n\nAnother was baradium missiles which were used to great success by the Jedi Order during the Yuuzhan Vong War. They tore apart even the biggest of capital droid ships, and melted away evenemy defences. The most notable of events included the Battle over Exodo II whereas they were applied to a significant extent to peel away enemy forces.\n\nAn even more well known use of baradium was the fission device which was a system embedded in Galactic Republic superweapons. These are present in the Deathstar and were used to destroy entire planets, shipyards and of course, rebellions.\n\nLesser known uses included detonator tape for blast doors, and seismic charges used for mining and other uses.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring the Old Republic, a more conservative time, baradium in itself was banned due to its highly unethical nature. The punishment of violation was death.\n\nHowever, this didn’t deter bounty hunters and other unethical organisations such as the Sith. They applied it to great use against the Jedi in their efforts to gain any advantage available to them.\n\nMore specifically, a Jedi team led by Vannar Treece attempted to erode the Daiman supply line who were supplying illegal baradium materials on Chelloa. This resulted in many casualties as Odion (a Sith lord) used baradium to incinerate some of the task force during the battle.\n\nDepa Billaba provided a very good argument with regards to Mace Windu’s decision to begin the Clone Wars on that infamous rescue attempt on Geonosis. She stated that if only a baradium bomb had been used to incinerate the entirety of the Geonosis colosseum, millions of lives would have been saved including hundreds of Jedi.\n\nHan Solo kept a couple baradium bombs on his Millenium falcon for exceptional circumstances.\n\nOther less notable events included baradium bombs, and throughout history a multitude of sizable explosions can be attributed to the presence of baradium.\n\n","meta":{"index":28,"author":"Souleth","name":"Baradium","release_year":2021}},"Z-95 Headhunter":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Z-95 Headhunter was a starfighter that was created by Incom and Subpro Corporation.

The first we see of this specific method of cloning however is in the experiments of the Sith Lord; Darth Sidious. \n\nDarth Sidious was obsessed with the idea of immortality, and so sought a wide variety of methods to preserve his own life. One of these methods was through the creation of Stand-Casts. Darth Sidious would attempt to clone his own genetic template so that he may pass on his consciousness and live forever.

Infinity Waves were pulses of incredible power that they could release anywhere in the galaxy. These waves were able to suck entire planets and all of their inhabitants into infinity. The Gates were located inside of Star Chambers, which were also inside of massive structures known as the Star Temples.# Section 1\nThe Infinity Gates were constructed by the Kwa during the Pre-Republic era. They enabled the Kwa to travel to other worlds in their region of space for the purpose of colonization. Their expansion brought them to conflict with the Gree Enclave, a region of space in the Outer Rim controlled by the Gree race. This conflict caused their power across the galaxy to shrink.

One of the first users of Tibanna gas was the Beldon, the native species of Bespin. The beldon were large creatures, some of them seen with an olive skin color, and some had a light orange skin tone as well. These creatures’ metabolism evolved the necessity to process Tibanna gas. Both Tibanna gas and liquid were very valuable because of its many uses in military operations. In its gaseous form, it was used as a power source for energy weapons and fuel for fleets. In liquid form, Tibanna gas was highly volatile and could be used in explosive manufacturing.# Section 1\nMost commonly, Tibanna gas was used as ammunition for blasters, turbo lasers, as well as fuel for many galactic naval fleets. One notable weapon of Tibanna gas was the Death star. The Galactic Empire had many supply platforms located in protected locations with the purpose of providing a steady supply of fuel to their fleets. During the Clone Wars, the Tibanna gas was used in its liquid form for clone troopers to heat their post on the Rishi moon, but the Tibanna liquid seemed to be explosive, because, when battle droids invaded the post, clone trooper CT-782, named Hevy, used the Tibanna liquid to engulf and destroy the outpost. We understand that TIbanna gas was very valuable and very expensive; during the Galactic Civil War, a criminal named Tyber Zann successfully stole an enormous amount of Tibanna gas from Bespin.

The significant part about the design was the resonance torpedo launchers. It could launch up to 11 torpedoes and travel to the system’s sun at light-speed velocity. When the torpedo would make an impact it would then implode within the system’s sun causing a release of energy. This energy created a chain reaction that forced stars within the system to burst into a supernova. The entirety of this process caused mass destruction of many lifeforms.\n\n# Section 2\nIn 11 ABY, Han Solo, Chewbacca and Kyp Durron found out about the secret imperial research base named Maw Installation.

Constructed by Holowan Mechanicals, these droids were designed specifically to battle and kill Jedi. They were equipped with advanced combat learning programs that allowed them to adapt to a highly diverse variety of tasks, ranging from melee and ranged combat to starfighter control. The MagnaGuards were partially plated with thick duranium armor, enhancing their purpose of murdering Jedi. They could speak and were trained to mock their opponents in a low, rumbling Basic.# Section 1\nMagnaGuards stood around two meters tall and had a humanoid body shape, but their mechanical anatomy was considerably greater, allowing them to perform superhuman acrobatics, speed, and warfare. Their faces were outfitted with two red or yellow photoreceptor \"eyes\" that were supplemented by a backup device located on the chest. The internal systems of the MagnaGuards were equipped with advanced warfare learning programs, allowing them to adapt to a wide range of activities, from melee and ranged combat to starfighter management.\nEach type of the IG-100 MagnaGuard had its own programming, training, and speciality. Many types existed, superficially distinguished by color: black, ivory, blue, and the anomalous gray. MagnaGuards belonged to the same Holowan Mechanicals line as the later IG-88 range. They also appeared to utilize audible droid language on occasion. They made yelping sounds when they were in danger, such as when they were trapped on the ground.\n\n# Section 2\nCount Dooku commissioned the development of the IG-100 MagnaGuard to suit General Grievous's requirements when the InterGalactic Banking Clan obtained Grievous's services as an enforcer and refused to recruit his Kaleesh. Grievous killed all the MagnaGuards present upon activation, releasing his rage at being treated like a droid. Grievous then personally trained the remainder of his bodyguards in the seven classic techniques of lightsaber combat, allowing them to engage and kill Jedi successfully. Grievous refused to allow routine repairs to the droids, claiming that their numerous scratches and battle scars made them more fearsome to opponents. Grievous used his bodyguards in practice bouts as part of his training, often injuring them.\nThe MagnaGuards were first employed in warfare during the Battle of Parein II 4, when one of Grievous' MagnaGuards killed Jedi Master Sannen by shoving its electrostaff through his throat. The MagnaGuards quickly proved to be fearsome, easily defeating Jedi and clone troopers and were viewed by some as more intimidating than droidekas. Despite their numerous advantages, however, they were not invincible; Boba Fett managed to destroy one using a strategically placed blaster bolt during the Battle of Florrum. Despite this, the MagnaGuards remained a major force throughout the Clone Wars.\n\n# Section 3\nMagnaGuards, being vessels of advanced technology and unparalleled combat expertise, carried with them a formidable assortment of weaponry that included electrostaffs capable of unleashing electrical surges upon their foes, and blasters for precise offensive strikes at varying distances. Their primary weapon was the electrostaff, a long-handled weapon that discharged an electrifying and deadly current upon hitting its mark. The electrostaff could also be split into two shorter weapons, allowing for increased versatility in combat.

The weapon was alternatively known as the FC11 flechette launcher, but in either case was used extensively by numerous governments and factions after the Galactic Civil War. Originally, was designed to launch numerous varieties of canisters containing razor sharp durasteel flechettes at close to medium range. Moreover, it's canisters would burst after a preset distance as determined by the weapon’s highly advanced range finder system. The weapon had four primary tubes which could all be fired in quick succession in addition to two reserve tubes closer to the rear of it. Furthermore, it usually detonated its canisters after approximately ten meters though settings existed which allowed it to detonate on impact at a cost in effectiveness. The anti-infantry canisters were filled with hundreds of individual projectiles, while the anti-vehicle variants contained far fewer projectiles which were capable of piercing the relatively thin armor used by most light vehicles in the time period which it was deployed in. The weapon was used most notably by the Imperial Remnant and its numerous mercenary contractors and saw extensive use by Wetland Assault Troopers during the Second Battle of the Jedi Praxeum.

Weighing around 7.2 kilograms (approximately 16 lbs) with a medium-sized body, the Tensor rifle was originally designed for use by squib hands. Although its optimal range was up to 45m between the weapon itself and the target, it was possible to affect a target from a range of up to 450 meters. The Tensor rifle could be armed with 15-50 charges/shots depending on the model used and its energy source. If a power pack was used as an energy source, the Tensor rifle could fire off 15 rounds before having to recharge, if the rifle’s energy source was a power generator, its available ammunition could reach up to 50 rounds. Due to its somewhat rarity and the tractor beam technology used as well as the energy source, its price bracket could be defined in the 10.000 to 15.000 credit range.# Section 1\nThe aforementioned tractor beam technology was used in a certainly unorthodox way compared to its normal use. Instead of being used to trap or move objects or starships, the weapon fired invisible but loud bursts of compressed tractor beam waves, on a level at which short term or extended periods of exposure to the weapon’s shots at a biological (non-artificial) target caused complete cell-destruction, eventually leading to death. As previously stated, firing the weapon caused large amounts of noise, more specifically a sort of din, possibly alerting the target(s). Furthermore, due to the shots being invisible to the naked eye, the rifle was particularly hard to aim.

Their eyes may appear a darker red if exposed to a significant amount of oxygen throughout their lifetime. The Chiss share a natural height of 1.8 meters and average lifespan of 70-80 years similarly to Humans, and largely inhabit two major cities on the planet - Csaplar, the planet's capital, and Ac’siel.\n\n# Section 2\nHumans first discovered Csilla between the years 27,500 BBY and 27,500 BBY, and colonized the planet. Upon colonization, they created a government, erected structures and began thriving as a species on this planet. These humans would exist on this planet for thousands of years and eventually develop to be the Chiss we know present day.

This unknown world was once the homeworld of the infamous Rakata species. They kept this planet hidden from their many foes, and it acted as the capital or base of operations for the duration of their existence. This makes the planet a remarkable treasure trove of Rakatan history and ruins.# Section 1\nDESCRIPTION\n“This planet’s a technological graveyard.” - Canderous Ordo\n\nBetween 35,000 - 25,200 BBY the Rakata used this as their homeworld. The Rakata, a species motivated by conquest and destruction, and characterised by extremely advanced technology, had enslaved hundreds of species during this period.\n\nThey had created the sentient Star Forge which fed into their massive armies as it acted as a super production facility.\n\nAlongside Rakata Prime, the infinite empire had over (500) planets, (11,000,000,000) Rakata and over (1,000,0000,0000,000) slaves. These numbers are not exaggerated, and hopefully this gives one the idea of the scale of this empire.\n\nThe Rakata were not even defeated by enemies but rather their own civil wars which led to mass slave uprisings and simply an over extension of resources. Furthermore, the Rakata were unfortunate enough to encounter a plague that rendered them non-force-sensitive. This is something that they had used to exploit other species, and without these abilities, they no longer held an edge in combat.\n\n# Section 2\nRampant cannibalism ensued on Rakata Prime and many of their other worlds which essentially devoured the planet. Now, it’s nothing other than an archaeological phenomenon covered in jagged ruins and scarred remains.\n\nThe remaining Rakata fled into the underground of Rakata Prime in an attempt to preserve themselves.\n\n# Section 3\nJEDI CIVIL WAR\nMany years later, during the Galactic Republic period, remnants of the Rakata resurfaced. This included clans such as “The One”. The Elders who resurfaced, who remembered their past history, constructed a guard to defend the Temple of the Ancients which held all of the Rakatan technology secrets.\n\nFurthermore, the planet interestingly enough, had a disruptor field. This EMP’d the ships that entered the atmosphere and sent them crashing into the surface which acted as defence. Overtime, species like rancors and gizka began breeding on the planet since ships with them in their cargo had left them on the planet.\n\nRevan visited the planet twice, the first time to steal technology and the second to disable the disruptor fleet and destroy the star forge.\n\nThe Republic and the Sith also engaged in large battles on the planet, and later the Jedi celebrated a victory with Revan and others being awarded the Cross of Glory.\n\n# Section 4\nPOST-CIVIL WAR\nThe planet was now littered with even more ruins and broken spaceships following these battles and the Republic decided to make Lehon and it’s system a historical site. This protected it from being part of civil wars ever again.\n\nAt first it was prohibited from the public to prevent Rakatan secrets from being stolen, but this hope was shattered when Revan returned for a third time in 3638 BBY. This time, he planned on using the Temple of the Ancients to create a Sith army. He was however defeated by Republic and Sith loyalists.\n\nLater on, Sterla, a Horizon Guard Scout Commander, ventured to Rakata prime to create a star fortress strong enough to erode the Eternal Alliance. However, they were defeated by the neighboring guards.\n\nEven further on, Darth Bane in 1000 BBY visited the planet to find Darth Revan’s Sith Holocron. He realised the planet was dripping in dark side energy, and surprisingly, even moreso than Korriban. He was one of the first to uncover this as much of Rakata Prime had been kept secret from the public by the Jedi.\n\n","meta":{"index":3,"author":"Souleth","name":"Lehon","release_year":2021}},"Morcanth":{"content":"# Introduction\nLocated within the Unknown Regions, Morcanth was a planet which was in a region that was disputed between three separate species for centuries; these three species didn’t like the idea of being neutral and therefore never accepted neutrality.

Several flowing rivers, lakes and small seas were present around the equator.# Section 1\nZonama Sekot was the successor of the Yuuzhan Vong’s homeworld, which was located in a foreign galaxy. The world was a seed produced from the living planet Yuuzhan’tar, immediately before it was destroyed in a conflict. Zonama Sekot ended up in the known galaxy and in 89 BBY, the planet was colonized by the Ferroan and Langhesi species. The Ferroans were adherents to a philosophy of the Force called the Potentium, viewing the Force as a whole rather than split into light and dark. At some point before the Clone Wars, the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker visited the planet to meet a fellow Jedi named Vergere as well as to purchase one of the planet’s living ships. Anakin Skywalker bonded with a record number of 12 seed-partners, thorn-covered organisms that evolved from a tree-like plant called a Bora. The seed-partners were the basis for all the organic spacecraft produced on Zonama Sekot. In 29 BBY, the then Republic security force commander Wilhuff Tarkin declared war on the sentient planet, which soon escaped into the Unknown Regions using its hyperdrive system built by the Langhesi.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Yuuzhan Vong War saw Zonama Sekot siding with the reformed New Republic, known as the Galactic Alliance. After the sentient world met Luke Skywalker and Jacen Solo, it offered its assistance against the galaxy’s invaders. Nearing the end of the war, Zonama Sekot participated in the Recapture of Coruscant alongside a Galactic Alliance fleet.  In the aftermath of the battle, the planet proposed the Sekot Accords, a peace treaty between the Galactic Alliance and the Yuuzhan Vong. The planet was revealed to be the heir of the Yuuzhan Vong’s ancient homeworld, and as part of the terms of peace, the remaining Yuuzhan Vong went into exile on Zonama Sekot.

Each day was about twenty-six hours, while each year was about four hundred and ten days.# Section 1\nA popular vacation company, Vekanda Leisure Colonies, had constructed a resort on the planet. Once the business collapsed, pirates and smugglers began to establish new hideouts for their covert operations. The freighter class ship, Nashuaga, wrecked on the planet with the notorious mask of Darth Nihilius. Throughout the history of Volik, multiple Force-sensitive groups have set foot on the planet. For example, Jedi Master Dorian Se’ol housed Force-sensitives on the planet but he was ultimately found by Darth Vader. Many years following, more Force-sensitives found the teachings of the Jedi Master.\n\n# Section 2\nOriginally, the planet was found by the Czerka Mining Corporation. The rights to colonization were then sold to the Vekanda Leisure Colonies. They built The Colony, which was a resort that would end up being an area of interest for generations to come. Following this construction, the company ran into financial problems. This led to gangs and crime lords essentially running the planet. For example, the Crimson Starks and the Ebon Strikers committed violent acts against each other. These kinds of pirate gangs would terrorize the planet for ages.\n\n# Section 3\nFollowing the crash of the Nashuaga, the relic remained onboard the ship. Eventually, Sando, a Rodian, stumbled upon a ship with his fellow smugglers. He was the leader of his smuggling gang that went by the name of Sando’s Boys. Sando searched the freighter and found a hint to the mask of Darth Nihilus in the cargo manifest. The Rodian desired to find the artifact and sell it for compensation.\n\n# Section 4\nAnother group of adventurers was set on a quest to find the mask. The group scaled Mount Vorena in hopes to reignite a travel beacon to find a ship. Unfortunately for them, they were ambushed by Collan Eislo. He was a leader of a sith cult. The group luckily emerged victoriously. They would continue their journey only to find Sando’s Boys at the wreck of the Nashuaga. Sando, and his gang, were ultimately defeated as they proved weak. Since the group won, they were the ones to stumble upon the treasure.\n\n# Section 5\nUpon the end of the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Dorin Se’ol arrived on the planet. He and his Force-sensitives eradicated smugglers from the planet. The Jedi Master was recently married, and he had a child. Upon the death of his spouse, the Jedi Master struggled with the dark side of the Force. Through his resilience, he ultimately was made a stronger Jedi. While living on the planet, he avoided the attention of The Galactic Empire. Unfortunately, Darth Vader ordered an invasion, and the Jedi Master was defeated. The Jedi he mentored managed to escape.\n\n# Section 6\nDuring the Yuuzhan Vong War, more Force-sensitives settled in the world. The group preferred pacifism and wanted no part in the war. They were able to obtain the Jedi Master’s Holocron with his teachings on it. They resided on the planet throughout the whole conflict.

These cities being Menelath, Haven and Shirkel. Haven was known as the capital city of Iol, as it was the first civilization made on the planet. The government of Iol was known as the Merchants’ Consortium, which consisted of many businesses that traded and sold goods to the citizens of the planet. The government was also under control by the Tangan Industries. The Tangan Industries tried to gain possession of a few mining cities throughout Iol, however they were mostly unsuccessful and the city workers would often resort to combat.\n\n# Section 2\nIn the Mandalorian Wars, Darth Revan encountered the planet along with the many ships he led. Revan made a trade with the administrator, trading some very advanced technology at that time, and in return Revan gained supplies as well as fuel for his ships.

However in this case, after gaining the advanced technology from Revan, they decided to ignore their rules.\n\n# Section 3\nAfter the trade with Darth Revan, many cities dropped in terms of goods and resources, hence making goods extremely high priced. Due to this, a group of rebels known as the Miners Union revolted against the Tangan Industries, which led to the administrator negotiation with the leader of the Miners Union. This resulted in the Tangan Industries lowering the prices of the goods.

Due to its vast forest-like terrain, the planet was often compared to the Endor moon, as well as the Wookiee home planet of Kashyyyk.# Section 1\nThe planet's native species, the Tempestro, were sentient reptilians. Like many other species in the galaxy, the Tempestro were Force-sensitive. Some of their most notable features included their long heads, razor-sharp claws, beaks, and their large wings. Despite their large mass, the Tempestro were still able to fly.\n\nThe Tempestro had quickly become a well-civilized species, masters of the Force. Because of their physical appearance, it was common to mistake the Tempestro for an aggressive and dominant race; this, however, was not the case, as the species was often very kind and gentle.\n\n# Section 2\nLiving unbothered and peaceful for thousands of years, the Tempestro species and the planet itself; had experienced a meteor strike that would devastate it. This natural disaster would disrupt the species' society, killing most of the planet's life forms.\n\nHaving survived near extinction, the Tempestro that had not died; became primitive, devolving into tribes that would build large stone buildings to separate the clans. After this disaster, Krin Koda, a scout from the Galactic Empire, would discover the planet and its now primitive species.\n\nHaving found out what had happened to the Tempest rock, Koda sought to help the species regain its once-advanced civilization. Koda helped cure a viral disease that had been plaguing the Tempestro for many years.\n\nDue to this, the Tempestro had decided to name their planet after their savior, Koda. They had even given the man the Eye of Koda, which was an amulet holding a bright gem within it. Koda strongly believed that the amulet contained a map leading to the Tempestro Temple on the planet.\n\n","meta":{"index":15,"author":"JowsDemici","name":"Koda’s World","release_year":2021}}},"meta":{"name":"Unknown Regions","index":18}},"General Knowledge":{"articles":{"Right of Denial":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Right of Denial gave members of the order the right to protest against any conclusion the Jedi High Council came up with.

Their right to authority was also taken away from them, leaving them with little to nothing.

Service Initiates are trained by Mentors as well as Service Corps Instructors.# Section 1\nThe main part of the curriculum consists of three classes, which can be done in any order. Those are the awareness class, combat class, and expansion class. The awareness class introduces new members to the idea of a Knight Trial and explains how to reach that point. The combat class serves to assess and improve a Service Initiate’s skill level to prepare them for their trial. Finally, the expansion class explains what to do after reaching Knighthood and introduces Service Initiates to specializations. Each of these classes also has its own assignment. For the combat class in particular, the assignment is an evaluation of one’s dueling skill. This phase is called the ACE program.\n\n# Section 2\nOnce Service Initiates pass all three classes and complete all of the assignments, they move on to the Evaluation Phase.

Existing for most of the Jedi Order’s history, they served until the Great Jedi Purge in which they were caught off guard by Order 66.# Section 1\nFive Jedi Masters were selected as members of the Council of First Knowledge, each sharing the task of managing the curriculum of the Jedi Temple and disseminating educational material to the rest of the Order. Members of the Council were authorized access into the highly secured Holocron Vaults in the archives.

The guards were believed to be Jedi Sentinels but had the possibility of being Jedi Guardians.# Section 1\nThe Jedi Temple Guards are said to date back as old as the Galactic War seen in the backgrounds of many conflicts. The guards were mostly seen guarding the Jedi Temple on Coruscant; the guards contained ancient traditions of the Jedi. The guards were supposed to be sentinels that had chosen the path of the Temple Guard. The Temple Guard had traditions and oaths that would refrain them from speaking or doing such actions a normal Jedi would not be able to. The guards traditionally would be bodyguards or temple protectors when the guards were protecting VIPs. Such VIPs would be the Grandmaster or the Head of Security like Battlemaster Cin Drallig in the clone wars.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Jedi Temple Guard was noticed mostly in the Clone Wars during the bombing of the Jedi Temple. The first major appearance the galaxy saw of the guards was when protesters surrounded the Jedi Temple in rage for answers about personal of the temple staff. At the Jedi Temple, the guards were the first to respond to the riots during the first investigation of the bombing with Battlemaster Cin Drallig. The next time the guards were seen was when Jedi Padawan Ashoka Tano was being escorted to the chambers of the Jedi High Council to receive trials for her accusations against the Jedi Order. Soon after, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker found the truth about the bomber of the temple, Jedi Padawan Barriss Offee. As Skywalker confronted Barriss, a lightsaber fight broke out between the two; the first to respond were the guards, igniting their double-bladed Pyke sabers. As the fight continued, the guards proceeded to assist Skywalker in apprehending Barriss. Soon after she was apprehended, she was escorted by the guards to the senate courts where Barriss confessed to her crimes against the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Jedi Temple Guard had various equipment from robes to the mask to the keys on their belt. The Temple Guard used double-bladed lightsaber pikes that were uniquely designed to fit the guard’s appearance and look. The lightsaber pike had a more thick construct than a normal pike to look more intimidating. The guards had robes that had layers of armor but looked ceremonial, as the armor was said to stop lightsabers and blaster bolts. The guards also had keys to give them access to different rooms and areas of the temple such as offices, combat rooms, and meditation rooms. The guards also wore a mask to cover emotions, as the guards had to focus on the task at hand and not what they thought was right.\n\n","meta":{"index":11,"author":"PoulsonMaethor","name":"Jedi Temple Guard","release_year":2021}},"Court of Justice":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Court of Justice was also recognized as the High Court.

The Courts would be active from the Republic era all the way to the Galactic Alliance era in the “Galactic Courts of Justice” building.# Section 1\nThe selection process of the courts was ultimately made by the Justice Council, which made judicial changes within the Republic. There were a total of twelve justices in the High Court. The head of the Court of Justice was labeled as the “First Justice,” and they would be designated into this position by other court members. This position would replace the formerly known “Chief Justice,” that was involved with the former Supreme Court. The First Justice had the same responsibilities that the Chief Justice had.\n\n# Section 2\nThe Court primarily did not focus on regular criminal cases or civil cases, leaving those instances to the regional courts to handle. They would primarily focus on lawbreakers of the highest of ranks, mostly government officials. The Galactic Alliance would hand more power to the Court, expanding what they could do.

While the Galactic Republic was in its late stages, Mace Windu and Yoda respectively led the Order. Those who held the office of Master of the Order differed from those who held the office of Grand Master, the leader of the Jedi Order.# Section 1\nFor most of the history of the Jedi Order, Master of the Order represented the elected leader of the Jedi High Council. This position was reserved for sitting members of the High Council, with unanimous approval required to name a new leader. The Jedi Grand Master was sometimes named leader of the High Council, although this was not always the case. Many Jedi Masters have held the title over the years, but only a few are remembered by historians. The first Master of the Order was Jenet Grand Master Fae Coven, who served as head of the Council for several centuries before meeting her successor, Yoda, before her death.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring the Republic's Golden Age, Master Mace Windu held the title until he stepped down following the Battle of Geonosis so he could become more involved in the Clone Wars. Grand Master Yoda took up the title in Windu's absence, as he remained on Coruscant to serve as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's chief military adviser.

Under the order of the Jedi High Council, the task force was dispatched to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi, his Padawan Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padmé Amidala from execution in the Petrananki arena on Geonosis. The task force was additionally commissioned to investigate reports that the Separatists were constructing an army on the planet. A section of the strike team, commanded by Master Adi Gallia, flew Jedi starfighters to provide air support. The space team suffered very few casualties, while most of the ground contingent was eliminated. Their operation was an overture to the Battle of Geonosis, marking the beginning of the Clone Wars.# Section 1\nUpon arriving on-world, the assault team penetrated Geonosian defenses using two TX-130s fighter tanks piloted by Mace Windu and fellow Jedi Master Luminara Unduli, carving a path for the convoy of transports that carried the rest of the task force. After quietly infiltrating the arena, the Jedi revealed themselves to Count Dooku and his Seperatist allies. In the ensuing battle, the droid army swarmed the arena by the hundreds while the Geonosian onlookers fled amidst the chaos. The onslaught immediately caused the deaths of a number of inexperienced Jedi Knights and Padawans. The Jedi Council member Coleman Trebor attempted to challenge Dooku in lightsaber combat, only to be gunned down by Jango Fett. Subsequently, the bounty hunter entered the arena to engage Mace Windu but was instead attacked by the reek, rendering his jetpack inoperable. Fett was swiftly beheaded by the Jedi Master after being unable to escape with his damaged jetpack. Towards the end of the battle, the remnants of the task force formed a defensive circle as they were being surrounded by the droids. Over a dozen Jedi were part of the ring, while the other survivors were either wounded, in hiding or outside of the arena. Dooku ordered a ceasefire to offer Mace Windu the chance of surrender, during which Kenobi checked the pulse of a fallen Jedi. The Geonosians brought forward the captured Masters Ki-Adi Mundi, Plo Koon and Aayla Secura. Windu refused to surrender with the intention of fighting to the end, resulting in the battle droids threatening to execute the remaining Jedi. Before the droids could open fire, the Jedi Grandmaster Yoda arrived with reinforcements from the newly formed Grand Army of the Republic, routing Seperatist forces.\n\n# Section 2\nAn estimated thirty of the 212 Jedi had survived the skirmish, with at least two more perishing in the Battle of Geonosis. Despite the successful rescue mission, the Jedi Order was considerably drained after the numerous casualties which included several Jedi Masters, most of whom left behind Padawans. With the exception of Coleman Trebor, all of the leaders of the task force had fortunately survived. The arena was abandoned and was only returned for clones and Jedi to collect the bodies of the dead.  The surviving members of the task force became Generals of the Grand Army of the Republic until the Great Jedi Purge.

Things came to a halt when the New Sith Wars broke out. \n\nLord Hoth was the official Battlemaster of the Jedi Order, but the lords and generals of the Army of Light were declaring themselves Battlemasters as they defeated the Brotherhood of Darkness. The Army disbanded after the war ended on Ruusan, and the war-weary Jedi returned to Coruscant. Others were sent out to satellite training facilities to lead instruction on the Outer Rim, while others revoked their titles and took on new roles as instructors. \n\nMaster Cin Drallig oversaw the Lightsaber Instruction of the Academy and taught master swordsmen such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker during the last few days of the Republic. There were also a select few who were either head of minor schools or served directly under the Battlemaster as lightsaber combat teachers. During the time of Master Cin Drallig, many notable people including Wookiee Master Kirlocca, Master Dooku, Weequay Master Sora Bulq, and Twi’lek Master Anoon Bondara were serving as lightsaber instructors of the Academy. Master Drallig was assassinated at the end of the Clone Wars by one of his most renowned students, Darth Vader. The death of Drallig halted the succession line of Battlemaster,s as the Order was dissolved not long after.\n\nAfter Jedi Master Luke Skywalker started to rebuild the Jedi Order, following the Great Jedi Purge and Galactic Civil War. Former Dark Side Elite, Kam Solusar, was appointed as the Head Combat Instructor on the Jedi Praxeum. In the years of Solusar's leadership, Solusar educated the initial Jedi Initiates by building the three rings of defense, the core precepts of the new order. It was till after the Dark Jedi Desann's defeat, when Master Kyle Katarn received the rank of Battlemaster, succeeding Solusar. Battlemaster Katarn also introduced three combat styles to the Order, the Fast, Medium, and Strong styles.","meta":{"index":40,"author":"bombersaki","name":"Jedi Battlemaster","release_year":2020}},"Jedi Praeceptors":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Jedi Praeceptors are a talented group of Jedi mentors within the Jedi Service Corps.

Being Jedi Consulars, they were under the supervision of the Council of First Knowledge.# Section 1\nThe Leader of the Librarian’s Assembly, the Chief Librarian, was tasked to be the overseer of the Jedi Archives and to preserve the knowledge stored within. The Chief Librarian, being a member of the Council of First Knowledge, worked closely with the Caretaker of First Knowledge in preserving the Jedi Archives.\n\n# Section 2\nBeing one of the oldest specialized paths in the Order, the Lore Keepers were first founded by Jedi High Councilor Rajivari. They were tasked to take care of the primary version of the Jedi Archives known as the Fount of Rajivari. Due to the Jedi Order’s rapid expansion, the Lore Keepers were divided into three distinct roles, each having a specialized function within the Order.\n\n# Section 3\nDuring the aftermath of the Ruusan Reformation, the Chief Librarian Master Restelly Quist, also held the title of Caretaker of First Knowledge. Gnost-Dural, a Kel Dor historian, controlled the retrieval of data within the Temple Archives of Tython following the Sacking of Coruscant before the time of Master Barra-Rona-Ban, Master Quist’s predecessor. When Darth Vader carried out Operation: Knightfall on behalf of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the final Chief Librarian, former Jedi High Council member Jocasta Nu, died amid her treasured books. Tionne Solusar took over as Chief Librarian after the Order was reformed under Grand Master Luke Skywalker, and she rebuilt the Stacks and added information missing from the Galactic Civil War. Master Solusar later stepped down from this position, and Master Markre Medjev was given the title.\n\n# Section 4\nThe Jedi Librarians who wandered the hallways of the library and Archives were the primary point of contact for the Temple's and satellite institutions' collection of knowledge. By interacting with visiting Jedi and supporting them using small droids, a librarian may help identify any resource at any moment. Some librarians, like Master Jocasta Nu, studied as historians as well.\n\n# Section 5\nThe arduous task of storing all text in the Archives and library was assigned to the Jedi Archivists. The archivists would translate the data into several common languages before storing and sorting it in one of the Archives' four halls. They would receive and archive knowledge so that everyone else can learn, and in the meanwhile improve their own awareness of the galaxy. They specialized in the storage, organization, and retrieval of knowledge. They rarely saw combat and were only sent on data-retrieval expeditions or to assist diplomats in need of a continuous flow of information, searching into many fields of study and allowing the Force to guide them to their areas of specialty.\n\n# Section 6\nJedi Historians, also known as chroniclers, were members of the Librarian's Assembly who specialized in the study into the history of the Jedi as well as the Republic's formative years. The historians, overseen by the Caretaker of First Knowledge, the Council of First Knowledge's leader, were in charge of overseeing and analyzing the Holocrons.

Several other members like Aayla Secura and Ahsoka Tano wore non-standard clothing.# Section 1\nSince the Jedi were more interested in learning the ways of the force, few Jedi paid attention to their apparel, and mostly dressed in plain clothes. Their clothing mostly consisted of an undertunic, an overtunic and a cloak over them. They also had utility belts tied around their waists. Despite their constrictive appearance, these clothes were comfortable and warm to wear, and did not disrupt the operations of a Jedi.\n\n# Section 2\nDuring times of war, Jedi armor would be added to the robes to provide an extra layer of defence.

They’re the sages of all knowledge not only on the Force but history it-self this making the most needed type of Jedi.# Section 1\nThe most common “Specialized Paths” within the Consulars are usually; “Jedi Researcher” which is the most common Consular, focus on the research and acknowledge all sort of information given or found through the pass of the years, they also are capable of restricting certain information if they’re given the approval of a Lore keeper or the Council of First Knowledge. Then there are the “Lore Keepers”, they technically are divided into multiple small sub-branches, such as Librarians, Archivist, and Historians. Most forms part of the “Librarian Assembly” all of them, are the ones to categorize and keep the collection of all sorts of subjects in date to make sure all of the information still accurate and correct.\n\n# Section 2\nThe rarest type of Specialization Classes was the “Jedi Seers” this class is extremely rare since the only Jedi who are gifted with the Force pre/post-cognition were task with finding disasters or enemies events that will happen or happened already, the most recognizable prediction was the “Prophecy of the Chosen One”, and the Second rarest in terms of rank was “Jedi Sages” who were exceptionally good gifted Force members who were capable of extraordinary force skills such as Force Shield, Force wave and other force abilities. This was only given to extremely good ambassadors, healers, seers, and Telekinetic force combatants.\n\n# Section 3\nLastly, the Specialized paths that were considered more exotic among the Jedi Consular, such as the “Jedi Healer” who work as Jedi who focus on the research of wounds and illness along with a better “above-average” force skills of “Force healing”, dedicated to preserving life in order to save as many lives as they can. Other class will be “Jedi Ambassadors and Jedi Diplomats”, both related to the political theme of course, but the difference between them is that the Diplomats were dedicated to the handle and defuse of external political issues or starting new relations with foreign parties/planets, and the Ambassadors were the ones who deal with the inside conflict such politics within the Republic, yet not doing any Major changes inside only keeping update the Republic Senate regarding the status of some systems.\n\n","meta":{"index":21,"author":"GatoMorningstar","name":"Jedi Consular","release_year":2020}},"Jedi Guardian":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Jedi Guardians are one of the main “branches” within the Jedi Order, this role is in short terms the Light-side mirror of a Sith Warrior, They’re mainly known for being extremely good at combat and as well been the first line of defense for any outside threats in term of the rings in the galaxy, working as peacekeepers in general even though this has their own category.# Section 1\nJust like any other branch, Jedi Guardians usually have “Specialized Paths”, from this point each Jedi Guardian starts their career as some sort of lifestyle until they, either way, retired or become an elder, some of the most common paths are; “Jedi Weapon Master/Weapon specialist”, these knights are the ones who decide to adapt with other weapon rarities beyond the common Lightsaber such as the PikeSaber/Double saber similar to the ones Temple Guard have, double handle Lightsaber, backhand users and even weapons or tools beyond the lightsaber like blasters and whips. The second most common specialized path was “Lightsaber Instructor” been a variant from the Jedi Instructor these Guardians were mainly for wanting to give additional knowledge regarding Lightsaber forms and overall combat experience, they were usually placed as the head of indoctrination groups of initiates before taking place in the Padawan season.\n\n# Section 2\nOther exotic specialized paths were classes like “Jedi Ace” and “Jedi Peacekeepers”, Jedi Ace, for example, was given to Jedi Guardians who ere exceptionally good at piloting and air combat with ships, they’re mainly known for being the best side-backup for any of the Navy or Starfighter Corps who they’re allied with. This left for the final the Jedi Peacekeepers, they’re not exactly rare although it is known as the hardest and most cruel job within the Guardian Path, as the Jedi in this category works as Law Enforcer and Diplomats of the outer rings, meaning they could take weeks or months before even giving any sort of report regarding their situation, this role is the more respected between Guardians as they could spend years without even touching the temple but making a great service to the Jedi Order.\n\n","meta":{"index":5,"author":"","name":"Jedi Guardian","release_year":2020}},"Jedi Archives":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe Jedi Archives is a collection of knowledge containing journalism and huge amounts of research. These findings date back to the Old Republic when the Jedi Order was founded. The Jedi Order's Librarian's Assembly was in charge of keeping and maintaining the Archives. Both the Assembly and the Archives were overseen by the Council of First Knowledge, which is a council in the Order that is in charge of all knowledge and teachings within the Order.The Archives were located in the First Knowledge Quarter in the Temple of Courscant. A majority of the archives were kept open to the public so research and studying could be done freely. It was strictly prohibited to take archived entries out of the archives.# Section 1\nThe Jedi Archives was a two-story chamber containing a vast variety of Holocrons, holobooks, artifacts, and data rooms with computers as far as the eye could see, as well as an outer area that surrounded the room with a vast collection of storage devices utilized by the Jedi Order. The room was organized into eight halls, four of them being the main halls. 4 more halls were added later. They functioned as the wings. In between the halls were tables filled with computer terminals for the purpose of mostly finding planets and studying for long periods of time. The fourth and the second halls housed Holocron Vaults, restricted to Jedi High Council members. Besides the rest of the main halls, there were hundreds of small rooms used as storage rooms for small data cards and datatypes that would be arranged and categorized later. With the addition of this, there were turbolifts seen in the Jedi temple for fast and easy travel from the Analysis Room to the other floors. In addition to this, there were also 20 busts of the famous 20 Jedi Masters who lost their way in the order and were a symbol of the failures of the Jedi.\n\n# Section 2\nThe First Hall was seen and known as the first entrance to the Archives, hence the name. It had massive wooden doors that were hand-carved by the founders of the Jedi Order. The First Hall contained journal entries from many famous Jedi Masters. These entries varied between topics like how they taught their padawans or how they bested ancient Sith lords. The famous Jedi, like Mace Windu, Quinlan Vos, and many others, would occasionally record the findings they made on their journeys and then later return them to the Archives for study. The findings, however, were restricted to the Jedi Masters and High Council, with the only exception being padawans with the Chief Librarian's permission to review these topics.\n\n# Section 3\nThe Rotunda found in the Archives was the access point to the Archives from the rest of the temple. It was seen as a part of the main entrance, with the most foot traffic entering in the First Hall, where it was located. The main terminal in the Rotunda allowed Jedi to access and see maps, and information regarding the Archives to find their destination. The large centerpiece was a database section utilized by the Chief Librarian of the Jedi Order to keep holo-books in order.\n\n# Section 4\nThe Second Hall was responsible for containing data relating to math, and science. These articles are comprised of studies relating to hyperspace, engines, blue-glowing stacks and various floor plans of Republic and Separatist government buildings, along with several designs for weapon systems. A different section in the hall had hallways leading towards the Holocron Vault. The Third Hall was a section of the archives dedicated to the purpose of the culture and geography of every available and known planet in the Republic. The star map includes core worlds, outer rim worlds, and many other systems and planets. Many members of the Service Corp in the ExplorCorps are often credited with submitting articles to this database. The Fourth Hall was dedicated to the research of sentient species, along with non-sentient species. as well as multiple sections filled with plants and shrubs. Around the year 990 BBY, a Sith Lord by the name of Darth Zannah raided the fourth hall disguised as Jedi Nalia Adollu and studied the crustaceous orbalisks, a species she sought to learn about in order to save the life of her master, Darth Bane. With the Chief Archivist not suspecting a Sith Lord in a disguise, the Archivist gave her a reference disk to discover the removal of a text written by a doctor by the name of Osaf Hamud.\n\n# Section 5\nThe Jedi Archives' staff was managed and overseen by the Council of First Knowledge, but the Archives itself was managed by the Chief Librarian. The Chief Librarian was responsible for organizing members of the Librarian’s Assembly in order to run the archives, update the archives, and keep them. Additional droid employees in the Archives were employed, such as JN-66 and SP-4, both droids being responsible for analysis. The droids, in a sense, mindlessly wandered the archives, assisting Jedi that were lost or in need of help. These droids were bought by the Jedi Order to assist with Jedi Temple matters, as there were various other SP-4 droids and JN-66 droids in the rest of the temple. The last Chief Librarian to manage the Archives was Madame Jocasta Nu, a former member of the Jedi High Council. She ran the Archives until the fateful night of Operation: Kightfall, where she called the last of her Padawans, a Jedi by the name of Jin-Lo Rayace, to take information regarding the future of the Jedi Order offworld, where he used this information to found the Agents of Ossus to protect the information until a remnant of the Order could be rebuilt. The quarters of the Chief Librarian was a separate office located in a section of the main halls. During the early stages of the Archives, Barra-Rona-Ban, who was the Chief Librarian at the time, had a tight, compact space with a desk overflowing with piles of notes. The office also contained a terminal with a large screen that allowed the Chief Librarian to view anything in the archives at will.\n\n# Section 6\nThe Archives contained many separate study rooms with dozens of desks and holo-terminals for research. Some of these rooms were meant to be used for days and didn’t require any sleep. The Chief Archivist would often give briefings to Jedi that were going on missions in these rooms. These rooms were designed to allow members of the Security Force to work without being noticed. During the Clone Wars, the security of the archives was changed in order to get a tighter grip on the security of the archives, with more Temple Security Force members patrolling the archives 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to preserve and protect the data. The direct reason for the security improvement was because a Dark Jedi by the name of Trenox attempted to steal a Holocron from the Archives. His attempt was unsuccessful, as Anakin Skywalker stopped him.\n\n","meta":{"index":10,"author":"CannonMalvern","name":"Jedi Archives","release_year":2021}},"Temple Security Force":{"content":"# Introduction\nFounded before 3656 BBY, the Temple Security Force or TSF for short was the policing force of the Jedi Temple and the surrounding precinct on Coruscant. The security force had non-Force-sensitive officers and soldiers, as well as Jedi Peacekeepers and Jedi Temple Guards among their ranks. The Peacekeepers, while outside of performing their normal duties, acted as snipers or brutes for the Temple Security Force. The non-Force-sensitive individuals in the security force provided protection to the Jedi Temple and policing services for citizens living in the Temple Precinct. During times of conflict, like the Great Galactic War in the Sacking of Coruscant, these non-force-sensitives and their Jedi counterparts took part in defending the Jedi temple, fighting side-by-side. The Temple Security Force was considered a threat and was neutralized by Order 66, as they had been associated with the Jedi, being destroyed at the time of Lord Vader and the 501st Legion attacked the temple during Operation: Knightfall.

As this specialization focuses more on knowledge and force, related aspects, it falls under the Consular path. Other than the general duty of healing and assisting, the Jedi Sages actively participate in many different areas of the order such as the Jedi Academy, actively hosting, as well as working within the Librarians Assembly and the Jedi Assault Team.

Like Guardians, a Jedi Shadow was always expecting a fight. Created at some point before, during, or after the Great Hyperspace War and existing until the Clone Wars, the Shadows performed their duties in secret. They usually did this often.# Section 1\nThe majority of the Jedi Shadows were veteran Sentinels. To understand why the Jedi Order chose the name of Shadow to describe its members, one must realize that the Order did not desire the duties of the Shadows. Because of this, Jedi Shadows are mainly described as the shadows of the Order. Because of their duties, Shadows are often trained to gain knowledge and use the Dark Side of the Force. Not being a fact the Order wanted to publicize, it is a closely guarded secret within the Order. They are also responsible for intelligence gathering and destroying any trace of the Sith Order and Empire left in the Galaxy. Their other Order members often classify them as \"loners,\" with a splitting personality. Often resulting in paranoia about other Shadows and members of the Order, they would not hesitate to betray their comrades if they believed they fell to the Dark Side. As a result of these risks, Jedi Shadows were deployed cautiously during times of peril. The Jedi Shadows disagreed on how to deal with the threat of the Dark Side. Some of them opted for more radical actions against the forces of evil. At the same time, some practiced temperness with their duties.\n\n# Section 2\nDue to the secretive nature of the Shadows, their founding date is unknown. We are aware that they were in existence around the time of the Great Hyperspace War because they were deployed to eliminate Sith artifacts. They continued to operate until the Great Jedi Purge at the end of the Clone Wars. Most Jedi Shadows were Jedi Consular's during the Great Galactic War and the Cold War. For the following millennia, the Shadows continue to execute their duties in the shadows; as a result, we may never know the details of their missions.

They are responsible for overseeing the teachings and missions of the Jedi Service Corps.# Section 1\nAn organization under the Council called the Jedi Service Corps was formed during the Old Republic. Those who failed the Initiate or Knight Trials, together with those who were unable to serve as an apprentice, were reassigned by the Council to the Service Corps and one of its branches–Agricultural Corps, Medical Corps, Educational Corps, and Exploration Corps.

The most common Specialized paths are; “Jedi Artisan” who are Jedi focus on a technical level for things such a Hilt crafting, Lightsaber crafting, and Holocrom creation, these Jedi were placed on small squads to help and research mainly on temples and small settlements. The other was “Jedi Recruiter” following the same ideals of a basic Sentinel, these Jedi were tasked on finding and possibly recruiting new Force Sensitive in both inner and outer rings of the galaxy, although their task sometimes could be somewhat cruel as they if needed, could take the Force Sensitive regardless of his opinion or the opinion of the parents/guardians of the child.\n\n# Section 2\nOther more “exclusive” specializations are smaller “sub-branches” such as the Shadow Jedi which is a small pack of Jedi that work directly for stealth and intelligence missions mainly connected to the Council of First Knowledge (CoFK) they were tasked often with the destruction of all traces of “Dark Side knowledge or artifacts” to keep safe and avoid future conflicts with anyone who seeks revenge with the Jedi using the Force. Another decently exotic role of the Sentinels was the “Jedi Watchman” been the second most rare type of Sentinel as these were task to the guarding or scout of planets in the outer rings alone, only communicating directly to the High Council when they spotted any outside threats, this role was only given to veteran sentinels through the pass of the years.\n\n# Section 3\nLastly, there are the specializations that are rare or don’t have their own role these last ones go for  “Temple Guard” and “Technical/demolition division”.

Soon once the core worlds were settled, came the first Galactic Republic with the renewed communication channels and trade.

Old Galactic Standard derived from an old language known as Old Coruscanti, the mother tongue of the Coruscant humans. Its vocabulary consisted of other languages such as Durese and Bothese. Then by Peshosloc, a holowright who lived between 15,762 BBY - 15,609 BBY the language evolved to be considered a historical division, the language being Mid-Galactic Standard. The language would be furthered even more by Dromnyr after the Vultans became a part of the Republic around 14,000 BBY which resulted in the now most used modern Galactic Standard Basic language. While under the Galactic Empire the language would be known as Imperial Basic which the Rebel Alliance used or adopted as many other Alliances or groups like the Alliance of Free Planets and the Fel or the Siths.\n\n# Section 2\nMost sentient species that had contact with the Galactic Republic were able to speak the Basic which they either used in their everyday living or just for speaking with visitors or merchants. Some did not have the organs to help them speak Basic and these species included the Wookies, Polis Massans, Ssi-ruuk, P’w’ecks, and tons of other insectoid species. Another dialect was High Galactic which was used for reverence and was to honor religious figures. With many different species and languages, there are also many distinct dialects with their own set of unique pronunciations. Examples are, the Barabel accent and the word “I” and any word associated with it like “am” were not in the language or their s would be pronounced like a /z/ or the Concord Dawn inflection which was an accent or dialect that was common among Mandalorians where they pronounce their e with an /I/ like “delta” pronounce with “dilta”. Another is the Neimoidian accent where they emphasize certain vowels and add a deep pitch ( particularly “a”, “e”, and “o”). Another accent is the Southeastern Naboo accent where they enunciate their consonants powerfully; while another dialect is spoken by Yoda’s species, they spoke in an object-subject-verb format. While there are these dialects and accents, there are also some who have speech impediments like the Wookies or the Rodians who have lisps.\n\n","meta":{"index":14,"author":"Vahndar","name":"Galactic Basic Standard","release_year":2021}},"High Jedi General":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe rank ‘High Jedi General’ was also sometimes labelled as ‘Jedi High General’.

These tests would later be changed into non-militaristic trials after the end of the Ruusan Reformations. Should an Initiate fail their trials, they may be sent away from the Order or assigned by the Council of Reassignment to one of the Jedi Service Corps.# Section 1\nThe Initiate Trials housed three tests that would challenge an initiate’s dedication to the Order. The first trial would test the initiate’s knowledge of the Jedi Code, as it was the guiding force of the entire Jedi Order. Failing to memorize the code would fail. The second trial was rarely ever consistent within the Jedi Order’s history, ranging from lightsaber construction, and mastering self-discipline to being tested on their connections to the Force through lightsaber combat while they are blindfolded or hooded. Finally, the third trial challenges the darkness within someone, some being tasked with confronting the darkness within themselves or other beings in the galaxy while others are to observe judicial cases.\n\n# Section 2\nUpon overcoming the challenges of the Initiate Trials, they may be selected to become a Padawan or to participate in the annual Apprentice Tournament within the Jedi Temple to gain the favor of a Jedi Knight and become their Padawan.

The Mantra has commonly been used by the Jedi to reassure themselves during times of strife and struggle and to remind themselves of the tenets by which they are bound. Obedience to the Code and to defending those in need can be challenging in the moment, and a need for such assurances is obvious, lest a Jedi be tempted by the Dark Side. The Mantra is however distinct from the Jedi Code in its wording, which takes on new meanings if one examines the wording closely.\n ‘Emotion, yet peace.’\n\tThe Mantra in this instance acknowledges that all beings have emotion, yet it is the Jedi way to not give oneself fully to their feelings, but rather become at peace with them. Through this understanding of the self, a Jedi may find strength in their training and their obedience to the Light Side of the Force.\n‘Ignorance, yet knowledge’\n\tThe Jedi Code claims there exists ‘no ignorance,’ instead there is only the opportunity for learning. The Mantra makes clear that ignorance is a choice, and one may choose to continue down the path of apathy towards this end, however there is always the opportunity to learn from these failings.\n‘Passion, yet serenity’\n\tPassion is distinct from emotion in that it is an impulsiveness, a base desire which is acted upon rashly and without regard to consequence. It is a part of chaos, yet not fully bereft of desire or direction. During training, many young Jedi may feel confused or angry at their lack of ability to grasp situations or get along with their peers, and may lash out. One must remember to step back and assess their passions before acting, lest something be done which cannot be taken back.\n‘Chaos, yet harmony’\n\tChaos is the directionless, aimless, and fueled recklessness of life and the universe itself. To many young Jedi and even full Jedi Knights, the world and universe may seem completely out of order, events occurring with seemingly random intent and affect. One must, however, realize in these words that chaos within the self is conquerable, and by this act harmony may be applied outward. When Jedi understand this fact, their potential as peace bringers and guardians of order is truly unlocked.\n\n‘Death, yet the Force’\n\tThe Force resides in all things, giving life and flowing like a rushing river through the living universe, sweeping away some and giving nourishment to others. Everything is connected by the Force, and death is no exception. This line of the Mantra is intended to conquer the fear all beings have - death - and assure them that there is existence beyond this event. Death is a cycle of the Force, and through it is replenished for new life elsewhere; death is not the end, it is simply the rotation of the wheel anew.","meta":{"index":39,"author":"WeaponizedStoners","name":"A Study of The Jedi Mantra","release_year":2021}}},"meta":{"name":"General Knowledge","index":7}},"Scientific Studies":{"articles":{"Carbon-freezing":{"content":"# Introduction\nCarbon-freezing is the process of encasing fragile and precious materials, including sentient beings,  in frozen carbonite in preparation for transportation.

Kamino was infamous for their renowned skill in cloning, later teaching their skills to the inhabitants of Polis Masa. The Kaminoans transformed their skill toward clone production into a large-scale commercial enterprise.   \n\nThe practice of cloning sentient specimens is an imperfect science and in spite of the Kaminoans’ drive to perfect it, it was still possible to develop a genetic or physical defect in specimens, producing unexpected and unwanted results. The Kaminoans were known to discard imperfect clones based off of the slightest defect, such as discolored eyes or difference in height. Hundreds of thousands of clones could be created off of a single genetic template, but over time the quality of the template would degrade, this is why cloners needed direct access to the original organism in order to extract new samples for a new genetic template.

There were many types of medical equipment that came with the bacta tanks that were only seen in hospitals, capital ships, and major military bases. With their large size, they weighed roughly 500 kilograms, big enough for people to be submerged into. To be healed, they were required to be fully submerged and had to wear clothes thin enough for the liquid to touch their wounds to heal them. The men wore white briefs while the women wore sleeveless tops with briefs, plus they wore breathing masks to not drown.

With carbonite, the need for generation ships became obsolete, and the Mining Guild established a stronghold in this thriving industry. The carbonite trade brought wealth and prosperity to Koros Major, transforming it into a boomworld.\n\n# Section 2\nThe inhabitants of Polus, a planet known for its frozen wastelands, played a crucial role in the carbonite industry.

Moruth Doole, a former warden, froze the body of a predecessor as a trophy. Force users imprisoned in carbonite found themselves unable to access the Force, making it a convenient method for Jedi containment. Even Imperial Knight Antares Draco fell victim to carbonite's grasp in 138 ABY.\nCarbonite encasement became a means of survival and artistry in the galaxy.

Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker utilized this method during the Clone Wars to discreetly reach distant planets. Carbonite also played a pivotal role in the infamous freezing of Han Solo on Darth Vader's orders, leading to his enthralling display as the \"Man in Carbonite\" and Boba Fett's lucrative negotiation with Jabba the Hutt.\n\n# Section 4\nCarbonite's versatility extended to military applications. Carbonite guns were developed to freeze and paralyze enemies, while the Galactic Empire employed Carbonite war droids to immobilize entire villages.

Bacta grenades were most notably used by the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War (2 BBY to 5 ABY). Although, they were sometimes used by Imperial and neutral medics after the Battle of Yavin in 0 ABY.\n\n# Section 2\nBacta was created by the insectoid Vatrix on the tropical planet Thyferra and was first introduced to the galaxy in 4100 BBY. Because of its great potential, there were several disputes over stores of bacta. The organic chemicals were used to heal patients by having the bacterial particles in the fluid seek out wounds to induce rapid tissue regeneration and prevent scarring. Used to treat all injuries and conditions across a wide range of species, it was thought of as a “miracle fluid”. Furthermore, it was used to replace the healing fluid of kolto as it was more potent.\n\n","meta":{"index":30,"author":"Librarian's Assembly","name":"Bacta Grenade","release_year":2021}},"Aerosol Inhaler":{"content":"# Introduction\nAn Aerosol inhaler was a very thin white tube, which had a golden ring and a protrusion halfway along it.

In spaceships, temperature can be controlled through technology equipment. For living organisms, higher temperatures were not suitable. It could cause dehydration, abnormally high body temperatures, mental health confusion, and in other cases, death.\n\n","meta":{"index":8,"author":"A1dok4","name":"Temperature","release_year":2021}},"Hypermatter":{"content":"# Introduction\nHypermatter was an exotic fuel type mainly used for Starships and large Battlestations. The matter would be used for hyperspace jumps and other energy-consuming systems. The fuel was able to create large amounts of energy. The substance would be found on ships after reverting back to real space. When the hyperdrive adjusted Hypermatter, the particles allowed the ship to jump to hyperspace without changing its complex mass and energy. Not only did it power hyperdrives but it also helped power the Death Star’s laser beam. The Death Star was outfitted with a hypermatter reactor that would help power itself.# Section 1\nThe building blocks of hypermatter were found in the inner planets of the Redhurne system, when cracked open, you would see toxic rays of the Redhurne Star. The main materials of hypermatter could be found when the solar radiation came into contact with the core of a planet, which was the case found in the Redhurne system. In addition, it was also found and used for hyperspace rings during the Clone Wars era. Hypermatter is a very sensitive material, on the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Battle Lance, there was hypermatter instability that led to the ship and crew being vaporized.\n\n","meta":{"index":4,"author":"TedMorningstar","name":"Hypermatter","release_year":2021}},"Hydrosphere":{"content":"# Introduction\nThe word hydrosphere refers to the quantity of moisture and forms of water in the atmosphere of a planet.

After it was removed from its tube, it would set extremely fast which would make it ideal for gluing broken bones back together. One downside to this paste was that it was specially made for insectoid species or species with an exoskeleton. The use of this product was extremely painful for the patient as it had to be injected directly into the site as opposed to being applied on top of it. Another risk of this paste was an overdose.

The molecular difference between a hydrogen atom and a deuterium atom (deuteron) is the existence of a singular neutron in the nucleus of the deuteron, whereas a hydrogen atom nucleus contains a proton and no neutron. Both atoms have an atomic number (number of protons) Z=1. It has no special physical characteristics. After the discovery of deuterium, it was used in the production of “heavy water”, also known as deuterium oxide (2H2O, D2O) essentially being water containing deuterium instead of the standard hydrogen-1 isotope that makes up most of the hydrogen in water. Deuterium oxide is commonly used in nuclear reactors and can affect the circadian oscillations of multiple species.# Section 1\nDeuterium possesses explosive properties, most commonly used as fuel stored in special canisters for safe and compact transport. It is also used in the production of volatile ammunition causing large amounts of damage to both biological and mechanical/artificial targets. Deuterium was also apparently used in an alcoholic drink called Deuterium-Pyro. Sources state that deuterium was definitely used as fuel for speeders and potentially small spacecraft, though it’s use as fuel for spacecraft has neither been confirmed nor denied.\n\n","meta":{"index":3,"author":"Nuggetonio","name":"Deuterium","release_year":2021}},"Bio Engineering":{"content":"# Introduction\nINTRODUCTION\n“Not made. Bioengineered. A living vonduun crab, and technology is a poor second to it.” - Boba Fett.\n\nAlso referred to as genetic engineering, this very interesting field of study focused on enhancing and upgrading physical components in an interactive manner. Normal materials cannot achieve what bioengineering can, as many have discovered.\n\nBiological or living materials were often altered in specific activities to create advanced armor, weapons, tools and other entities.\n\nGroups such as GeneSculpt, TheraGene and the Arkanian Dominion all used bioengineering to a significant extent to further their influence and power.# Section 1\nHISTORY\nBioengineering has a dark history originating from the much hated Yuuzhan Vong on one of their sentient worlds known as Yuuzhan-tar. The sentient planet altered it’s genetic inhabitants to fend off unwanted guests. \n\nThe Yuuzhan Vong in general often altered complicated species to complete difficult tasks that would usually require highly advanced technology. Yuuzhan Vong feared technology, the reason is unknown, and thus favoured bioengineering. The slaves they created were titled “Biots”.\n\nOther than the Yuuzhan, the Langhesi had also spent much time investing in this field. This species moved to Zonama Sekot at one point whereas they altered the inhabitants to create technology they could use.\n\nThe Qella used bioengineering to create the Teljikon Vagabond which revitalised their planet Brath Qella. It housed dozens of greenhouse systems and self producing food farms to keep it’s thousands of Qella alive before reaching the planet.\n\nThe Hapes Consortium used bioengineering to create the brilliant Rainbow gems, a beautiful species that glowed like treasure.\n\nThe Charon, another species, created living technology and had many bioscientists capable of replicating this process as they were veterans in the study.\n\n# Section 2\nThe most famous example of bioengineering is that of the Kaminoans who did it on a regular basis. They altered the clone troopers primal instincts and characteristics to fit that of the most incredible and ideal army ever.\n\nIn general, there are many examples spread across many systems, to name even more: the Ragithian Humans, the Gra, Shistavanen, Stone mites and so forth. It’s a field of study that is instrumental in many species cultures and has a rich history.\n\nSouleth’s author note: Bioengineering in my opinion is an unethical process, however; not many boundaries have not been crossed by the Jedi and this would be nothing new. Perhaps, an optional process could be used to make certain Jedi more sensitive to midichlorians at some point is a good idea that is worth looking into.\n\n","meta":{"index":18,"author":"Souleth","name":"Bio Engineering","release_year":2021}}},"meta":{"name":"Scientific Studies","index":8}}}}
