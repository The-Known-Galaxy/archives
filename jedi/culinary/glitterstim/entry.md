# Introduction

Glitterstim is a potent version of Spice that was mined on Kessel.
It gave users of glitterstim a brief pleasurable telepathic boost and heightened mental state, despite being addictive.
Spice was tightly controlled by the Empire.

# Section 1

Glitterstim was produced from the webs of spiders.
The spice was photactive which made it impossible to mine with light, resulting in the webs having to be mined in pitch-black conditions.
The webs had to be packaged in opaque paper so they would not activate, ruining the spice.

# Section 2

The effects of glitterstim vary with different accounts claiming the true effects of it.
However itâ€™s widely agreed that it gives a telepathic boost.
But many disagree, such as Corran Horn, who felt that the increased abilities were imaginations caused by the users.
With Han Solo disagreeing with Corran Horn, having dealt with its effects first hands.
Excessive use of glitterstim does have negative effects, such as degeneration of the nerves in the brain.
This results in many different neurological issues such as loss of sight, twitching, nervousness, and paranoia.
