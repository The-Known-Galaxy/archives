# Introduction

Brakkenback Stew was a thick stew dish often served at Dexter Jettster’s establishment, Dex’s Diner on Coruscant, being edible only to Besalisks, Mirialans, and Weequay.

Despite being a lovely dish, it also made a fine weapon when Weequay criminal Jarl and a crew took seven patrons of Dex’s diner hostage, demanding that one of the patrons, a Mirialan Servit, hand over an EX-droid as it had valuable information.
Jarl demanded Dexter give him a serving of Brakkenback stew, claiming it smelt good.
Dexter would supply him a serving and demonstrate the stew’s fine capability as a weapon by shoving Jarl’s face into it, as well as coating Jarl’s protocol droid in the stew.

Jarl would soon leave the diner with his crew to ensure the protocol droid was not extremely damaged, and Servit, thinking they were out of Brakkenback stew, instead ordered a dewback burger.
