# Introduction
Bantha Breakfast Biscuits, a popular choice among the Biscuit Baron food chain, were placed in an autochef alongside Bantha.
The combination of the Biscuit Baron preservatives and the Bantha genetic material created a creature made up of cells with the ability to morph and change shape.
This amorphous ability and the nature of the creature resulted in the death of the Chef who had carried out the recipe.

Bantha are mammals described as “quite cute” that resembled the shape of a bull.
They became a large part of many species food chains are they were easy to domesticate and tame.
Alongside this, they were often used for labour work and rides in battles.

After the unfortunate event of the “Giant Amorphous Bantha Breakfast Biscuits” being created, the Galactic Empire actually considered using it for biological warfare.
This was suggested as the only way to destroy the creature was to use blue sauce, which was often a condiment used alongside Bantha Breakfast Biscuits.
As ridiculous as it sounds, this made the creature invincible and a deadly weapon if used correctly.
