# Introduction

Hoi-broth was considered both a soup and a beverage, its ingredients consisted of boiled seaweed and oxidized spices.
With a distinctive smell that lingered even after consumption, it was served in a tube and was a delicacy during the reign of the Galactic Republic.
Usually, Hoi-broth could also have been served in Dexter Jettster’s Diner on Coruscant, Dex’s Diner.

Senator Padmé Amidala would have served it at a meeting regarding Chancellor Palpatine’s continued use of Emergency powers.
She would have the protocol droid C-3P0 serve it on a tray without drinking it herself, as she didn’t like the broth.

Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who was Padmé Amidala’s husband at the time, found out about the meeting because there was a distinctive smell of Hoi-Broth, and that Padmé herself did not like the broth.
Whilst on a Diplomatic mission to the planet Ando, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi had an allergic reaction when he had been served the broth.
