# Introduction

The Glock was a dish that was hand-made by the Duloks from Endor.
The dish consisted of various ingredients, including plant life; the dish was commonly cooked using a large cauldron and stirred until ready.
The appearance of it looked anything but delicious.
Glock was a thick gray ooze reminiscent of a simple soup.

# Section 1

During 2 BBY, a Tulgah named Morag gave away a baby Phlog to Gorneesh’s tribe of Duloks.
The tribe lived within the Dulok Swamp and was ordered by the Tulgah to look after the infant while she planned an attack against the Ewoks of a rival village, the Bright Tree Village.
To keep the child fed, Queen Urgah of Gorneesh’s tribe prepared Glock for the young child.

The infant had thoroughly enjoyed the food to the point where it immediately became addicting, and the baby Phlog could not put it down.
Instead of preparing Glock for the infant, The Duloks set off to capture Ewoks to do it for them.
The Duloks successfully captured Latara, Teebo, and Wicket Wystri Warrick, enslaving them to maximize the production of Glock for the young infant Phlog.
