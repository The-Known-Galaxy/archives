# Introduction

Tobo leaves were a type of food commonly eaten by Ewoks.
In 3 ABY, a group of Ewoks that went by the name of the Kagles made and served tobo leaves.
They were served alongside fried mahuga and jing-jang berries.
One of the regular buyers of this dish was Ewok Teebo.
Teebo soon passed on his love of the dishes to his friend, Wicket Warrick.
