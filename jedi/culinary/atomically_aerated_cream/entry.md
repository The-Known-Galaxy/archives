# Introduction

Atomically aerated cream was an ingredient native to the planet of Bakura.
It is used as a topping for many desserts, such as the Namana Cream Pie.
Other treats using atomically aerated cream included double-scoop sundaes and Tibanna splits.
These desserts were all served at Dexâ€™s Diner on Coruscant.
This cream was only edible to Besalisks, as Dexter Jettster enjoyed the taste of this cream very much.
