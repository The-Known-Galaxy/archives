# Introduction

Like glowblue noodles, teltiar noodles were blue; however, teltiar noodles were on the duller side in terms of hue.
Teltiar noodles were often served lukewarm and mushy alongside vegetables of the consumer’s choosing.
These noodles were used in Gormaanda’s Glowblue noodles and Chav recipe and were preferred to be mushy, but the chef can make the noodles to their preference.
After the initial broadcast of the Glowblue noodles and Chav recipe, Gormaanda later released a recipe for Teltiar noodles and Chav for her written column, “Gormaanda’s Culinary Corner.”
