# Introduction

Prior to the destruction of the Dex Diner restaurant by the hands of the tyrannic Galactic Empire, the Xizor Salad was sold for 7.7 credits there.
This special salad was created from fresh Sizhraniam lettuce, which had been laser-cut, and from Hecekerueem Sea salt croutons.
These ingredients were found on VegSatellites, which orbited the planet Coruscant.
This dish was famously known for being fit to serve a Falleen prince and was one of Dexter Jettsterâ€™s, the Besalisk chef, finest dishes.
This dish was loved, so much that it was also served at the Riverview Cafe in the city of Varlo, located in the Outer Rim world of Roonadan.
