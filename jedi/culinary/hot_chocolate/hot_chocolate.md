Over the years, hot chocolate eventually became a rarity within the galaxy.
This was mainly caused by the eruption of the Yuuzhan Vong War, a four-year conflict that rippled across the galaxy.
Hot chocolate was known to be produced by eight planets within the galaxy.
During the Yuuzhan Vong war, seven of these eight planets were terraformed, causing new hot chocolate production to be extremely limited.
