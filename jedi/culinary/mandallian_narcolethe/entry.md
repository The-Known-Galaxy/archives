# Introduction

Mandallian Narcolethe was a potent alcoholic beverage made by the Mandallian Giants of Mandallia.
The Mandallia was a planet in the Outer Rim of the Mandalore System.
The Narcolethe was developed a few millennia before the Galactic Civil War and was introduced to the Mandalorians by the Mandallians.

# Section 1

The Narcolethe beverage was very well-known across the Outer Rim for its potency level.
Many believed it was more than just fuel for ships.
However, over time, the famous Narcolethe became the definitive Mandalorian beverage.
Despite Narcolethe's popularity, it was strongly rivaled by a black ale called the ne'tra gal.

# Section 2

It was known that Mandalorian Crusaders fed their Basilisk war droids with a mix of pure Narcolethe and locap plasma.
A bottle of Mandallian Narcolethe or neâ€™tra gal was considered a good way to celebrate events in Mandalorian culture, for example, adopting a new Mandalorian member.
In 200 BBY, the Mandalorian warrior clan members participated and won the war against the Ithullans over a Narcolethe distillery.

# Section 3

An old cantina on the planet Mandalore kept a large amount of the Mandallian Narcolethe beverage for its customers.
Death Watch members were known to drink the Narcolethe in excess.
Mandalorian soldiers enjoyed Narcolethe, and most notably, two constables, Fenn Shysa and Tobbi Dala enjoyed a bottle of Narcolethe together after work.
