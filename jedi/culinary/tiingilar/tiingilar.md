# Introduction

Tiingilar was a spicy casserole that Mandalorians made.
Tiingilar consisted of meat, vegetables, and spices that smelled potent enough to burn the insides of one’s nose.
The dish was loved unanimously by Mandalorians and was often cooked by many of them regularly.

Nineteen years before the Battle of Yavin, not long after the Galactic Empire’s reformation, the Mandalorian Skirata clan ate a large dish of Tiingilar.
Bardan Jusik, a former Jedi, now Mandalorian, demonstrated the usage of the Force to make the dish for the Skirata clan.

Although beloved by Mandalore, Tiingilar itself would be reserved for clan and family gatherings; it was not a meal one would have daily, for it was seen as a rare delicacy one would enjoy with those one would call family.
