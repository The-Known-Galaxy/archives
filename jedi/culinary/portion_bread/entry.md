# Introduction

The simple and bland food known as portion bread or polystarch portion bread was a chemical reaction triggered by combining polystarch flour and water.
This simple food was one of the leading food sources on the planet Jakku.

# Section 1

Scavengers and Rebels commonly used portion bread during the era of the Galactic Empire.
Before the Battle of Jakku, in the year 5 ABY, a New Republic team formed, including a Zabrak bounty hunter by the name of Jas Emari and a Human starfighter by the name of Norra Wexley.

These two Rebels would go on to use Portion Bread when they did not have enough time to make a meal while working or when imprisoned.
When Norra got captured and put into Imperial custody, she used her little rations, including polystarch, which she added to water to form portion bread.

The ingredients to make portion bread were simple: it only took polystarch flour and water.
Polystarch was commonly found in ration packs from the Galactic Empire, the Rebel Alliance, and the New Republic.
Polystarch portions were described to have had the appearance of being a green and beige colored loaf with a lumpy texture.
The bread was edible for Humans, Artiodacs, Zabrak, and Melittos.

On Jakku, many scavengers like Rey salvaged items of value to trade for portions with Unkar Plutt, who controlled all food supplies at the Nima Outpost.
Scavengers spent most of their day trying to salvage items for portion bread; most could only have one meal a day.
Scavengers and local civilians on Jakku mainly ate portion bread as it was one of the only affordable food sources.
