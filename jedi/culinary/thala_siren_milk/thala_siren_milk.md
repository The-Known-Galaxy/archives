# Introduction
The famous thala-siren milk was a well-known organic drink that came from the species of thala-sirens.
It was served in many cantinas across the galaxy, but the most famous diet was based on this traditional drink.
After the Battle on Jakku, this culinary brew would often be recognised in its alcoholic version, Green Milk Cooler, enjoyed by many smugglers in the galaxy.

# Section 1
Thala-sirens were a species of giant marine animals living in the natural environment of Ahch-To.
They were known to inhabit the Jedi Temple Island's shores there.
Research protocols led by many scientists diagnosed them as a peaceful tribe, with no enemies or threats in their ecosystem.
Because of this, both males and females enjoyed sunbathing on the cliffs' edges as well as laying on the rocks and resting.
Thala-sirens could be easily recognised by their height, up to 5 metres tall, and their characteristic fins.
A typical thala-siren's skin was grey and pink.
Their eyes were black, and thala-sirens would be officially considered mammals.



# Section 2
Although thala-sirens were publicly thought to be producing certain green-coloured milk regardless of gender, it was actually only the female specimen that produced their famous milk.
 It was enjoyed by many drinking enthusiasts in the galaxy, with Luke Skywalker among them.
A method of harvesting it was developed by the Lanai, better known as the natives of the planet Ahch-To.
Unfortunately, these enormous animals have not been studied with effort, and little is known about them.
Another very common misunderstanding made by less knowledgeable individuals would be mistaking thala-siren milk for its older associate.
The galaxy-wide known blue milk was produced by bantha females.
It was manufactured by many industrial families in the Outer Rim and sold on planets such as Lothal, Tatooine, Batuu and Ord Mantell.
