# Introduction
Flash-Fried Zuchii is a crispy, scrumptious, and traditional dish.
It consists of fresh Zuchii, a 
delicious and juicy green vegetable, served in a flash-fried form.
The Zuchii was sliced into sticks, breaded, and quickly fried until golden and crispy.
It was then served with a vinegary sauce for that sharp taste.

The dish is made from the plant Zuchii, which can be found on the planet Takodana.
It was here that this dish was used in a cooking contest before the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, where it achieved its fame.
As the head chef in Maz Kanata’s castle was looking for a new sous chef, as the previous one was murdered, he decided to host a cooking contest while also attempting to uncover the murderer.
Contestant Sama Macoy attempted to produce the dish but was inconsistent with her texture and flavours, which unfortunately had her removed from the competition.
Tuggs, the head chef, would continue to serve a perfected version of this dish in his restaurant and across the galaxy following the castle’s destruction.

This dish was only edible to the species Artiodacs and Devaronians, yet it would be featured in many cookbooks with different variations due to its popularity.
