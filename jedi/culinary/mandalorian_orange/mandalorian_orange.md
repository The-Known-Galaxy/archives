# Introduction
The Mandalorian Orange was a type of fruit commonly used as a cooking ingredient in a plethora of dishes throughout the galaxy.
The name originated from a warrior culture known as the Mandalorians, who were native to the planet Mandalore, as they were the first to discover the unique fruit.

The fruit was most notably found in Dex’s Diner eatery.
This diner was located in the district of CoCo Town and was owned and managed by the Besalist Chef, Dexter Jettster.
He was able to implement the fruit into an interstellar garden salad, which he later noted as delicious.
The salad would cost around 5.7 credits and became the most prominent salad serving in the diner until the diner was eventually destroyed by the Galactic Empire in the first two years it was created.
The salad also included tomatoes, space carrots, Wol Cabasshews, Revwien lettuce, Qiraadishes, and Sriluurain raisins.
