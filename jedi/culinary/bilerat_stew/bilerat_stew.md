# Introduction
Bilerat stew, unlike other dishes, was a foul-smelling and tasting stew.
It was a thick, chunky, and green-colored stew that could be preserved in thermochurns for months.
This portability made it a staple for the nomadic tribes of Mandalorians.
It was eaten by the Neo-Crusader Mandalorian armies that conquered the planet Halthor.
