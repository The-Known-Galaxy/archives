# Introduction

Bocha was a flaky aliment that was served hot most of the time.
A man named Avon Starros contemplated bocha appetizingly.
And in 230 BBY Avon was kidnapped by the Nihil Pirates of Kara Xoo's Tempest.
She contrasted the Nihil Pirates' utterance (after she had been kidnapped) while making a not successful attempt to call for help while they were looking at a plate of bocha.
