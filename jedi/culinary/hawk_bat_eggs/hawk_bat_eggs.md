# Introduction
Hawk-bat eggs, laid by Hawk-bats, were a food commonly eaten by Humans.
These eggs were considered a delicious snack.
Emperor Palpatine himself was said to have a private aviary on Coruscant where Palpatine and any guests would enjoy eating the Hawk-bats as well as their eggs.

# Section 1
Due to the Humans’ love for this delicacy, the Hawk-bat mother would be very protective of their eggs.
The eggs would be well camouflaged and defended, and even if someone was fast enough or smart enough to get close enough, the mother would immediately attack.

Many of the most popular restaurants on Coruscant would serve both Hawk-bat and their eggs.
The species, and therefore its eggs were native to Coruscant.
Because of this, the delicacy would be incredibly rare elsewhere.



# Section 2
The Hawk-bat egg had become so well-loved on Coruscant that the eggs attracted many poachers who would attempt to steal the eggs while the mother Hawk-bat would be sleeping.
This was obviously a very risky task with many poachers having lost their lives in the process.
If, however, someone did manage to capture the egg and make it out alive, the profit itself would be enough to set up a poacher for life on Coruscant.
