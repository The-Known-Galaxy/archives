# Introduction

Glowwine, a non-alcoholic beverage, was consumed in popular demand during the Imperial Era.
Its reason for success was primarily down to how the user felt when consuming the drink; after consumption, a rush of endorphins would be experienced, causing the user's stress to be significantly diminished and feel relaxed.
The drink was known to put you in ecstasy without care.
Princess Leia Organa was one of these people to drink Glowwine commonly; she would enjoy a glass of the drink during a dance party in the Imperial Palace on Coruscant.
