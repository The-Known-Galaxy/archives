# Introduction
Blue milk, also going by the name Bantha-milk or even Tatooine milk, was a blue liquid that was produced from female Bantha’s mammary glands.
The milk can be found on many planets across the galaxy, in remote areas and even the diners of populated cities.
While blue milk was known to be rich, refreshing, and sweet with its opaque coloring, it could also be enjoyed in other forms.
The blue beverage was ingested and loved by many in forms such as yogurt, cheese, and even ice cream.
