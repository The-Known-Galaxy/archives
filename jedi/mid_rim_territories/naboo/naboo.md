# Introduction
Naboo is a lush and fruitful world located in the Chommel sector of the Mid Rim; not far from the Outer Rim territories.
The Native populations included a race of amphibious people known as the Gungans, and humans known as The Naboo.
A key point of interest about Naboo was its lack of a molten core.
In place of this, it is filled with a large network of caves that are flooded.
The native Gungan species was known to venture rarely down these cave systems, in fear of the enormous sea creatures living in the depths.
Few brave souls established trade routes and travel networks to speedily reach other areas of the planet through the core of the planet.
Alongside a rare and unique source of Plasma energy in its core, Naboo is considered an enigma to the Galaxy, being one of a kind in its composition.

Above the core and seas, the landscape of Naboo is that of most terrestrial planets;  containing a variety of plains, hills, mountains and swamps, often where the Seas were could be accessed.
The planet was considered a beauty to most travelers, due to its wondrous landscapes and unique architecture of The Naboo and the Gungans alike.
One of the many jewels of architecture would be Thede palace built by The Naboo.
Similar to all population centres of the planet, Thede was a marvel of  classical infrastructure.
It was home to the Royal Palace where monarchs such as  Queen Amidala would reside.



# Section 2
The fauna of the planet ranging from the land to the seas are vastly unique, a common factor of planets in the Galaxy.
The land dwelling creatures were mostly peaceful and non-aggressive.
One of the most well known being the Shaak, a race of bulbous four legged herbivores that populate a majority of grassland on the Planet.
The seas of Naboo are not so forgiving, housing a large array of monstrous and terrifying beasts.
The sea life is extensive and beautiful, being a staple for many visitors to the planet.
