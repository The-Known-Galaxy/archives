# Introduction

Malastare was a planet that served as a homeworld for Dugs, this planet contained an extremely high amount of natural fuel.
Most of Malastare’s terrain consisted of deserts and jungles that had methane lakes and rivers in them.
Because of this, podracers enjoyed racing on Malastare.
This world could be found along the Hydian Way.
Despite the success in fuel trading, Malastare had always been a tad underdeveloped and quite a lot of areas remained unmapped.

All the way from the beginning, huge creatures called Zillo Beasts roamed on Malastare and fed on the native Dugs.
If the Dugs did not find their weakness, they would have most likely gone extinct.
However, it was discovered that Zillo Beasts were not able to stand Malastare’s natural fuel at all, it was deadly to them.
Once the Dugs learned this, they managed to gain the upper hand and slay almost every beast that was left.
While the Clone War continued to spread through the galaxy, it was found out during the Battle of Malastare that not all Zillo Beasts had been wiped out.
Despite the Dugs' will to terminate this one as well, the Galactic Republic secretly took it to Coruscant in order to study the beast.
However, the beast was forced to put down after it escaped, though not before it managed to cause devastating damage and losses to both Malastare and the Republic.
