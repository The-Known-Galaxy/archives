# Introduction
Durkteel was an agricultural planet located in the Darksteel Loop.
Its population rose to 3.2 billion by around 20 BBY.
Saurin, the native species of Durkteel, originated from the Trandoshan, a lizard-like humanoid species.
The main difference between the two species was that the Saurin had less claws on their hand, and different eye colors.
Durkteel was also found in the Mid Rim.

# Section 1
The Saurin first came to Durkteel as early as 15,000 BBY.
The planet soon became a part of the Slice, and its agricultural wealth started blooming.
Durkteel had other neighboring agricultural planets, one of which being Yitabo.
Yitabo was not nearly as wealthy as Saurin, but it was still flourishing.
Over time, Durkteel became more and more wealthy, with more investment from other agricultural words.
Durkteel and its neighboring planets were forced into Hutt Space, making their world property of the Hutts, but was demolished by 4,000 BBY.



# Section 2
When the Jedi Civil War broke out, Durkteel and many other planets were captured by the Sith Empire, led by Darth Revan, however this ended rather quickly and Durkteel was free after 3 years.
Later, Durkteel would go on to be under control of the Hutts once again.
In the Clone Wars, Durkteel sided with the Galactic Republic, and started the Refugee Relief Movement, like many other planets.
Due to this, the Refugee Resettlement Coalition with the help of 9 other planets.



# Section 3
By this time, Durkteel was in its prime population of 3.2 billion.
For the 3rd time, Durkteel would be put into Hutt Space, as well as Speratist Space.
Soon the Hutt Space left Durkteel and the Saurin by 4 BBY, therefore Durkteel was free once again.
When Darth Krayt’s Galactic Empire rose, Durkteel was once again forced into the control of Darth Krayt and his Empire.
