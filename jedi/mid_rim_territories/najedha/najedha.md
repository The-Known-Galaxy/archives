# Introduction

NaJedha, an oceanic crystalline planet in the Mid Rim of the galaxy, was orbited by the moon Jedha.
The Rebel Alliance, during a mission to contact the Partisans, stationed themselves briefly on NaJedha.

# Section 1

NaJedha is a planet located in the Jedha system, within the Freestanding subsectors of the Mid Rim’s Terrabe sector.
It had pink oceans with crystalline formations appearing from the waves.
These formations contained caves suitable for construction, with some of the formations being large enough for spaceships to land on.
The planet was affected by Jedha’s destruction, which resulted in dust and fiery rocks falling onto NaJedha’s surface.

# Section 2

Leia Organa and the Rebel Alliance established a base in a cave on NaJedha to ally with the Partisans on Jedha.
Later, they returned to NaJedha with Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 after rescuing Partisan members Chulco Gi and Ubin Des.
After destroying the mining crawler Leviathan on Jedha, the rebels returned to NaJedha with Benthic and other Partisans.
