# Introduction

Eroudac, a small planet in the Mid Rim, was a planet inhabited by multiple species.
The planet had a small, pink moon around it.
Eroudac was home to many ancient ruins, as well as the Eroudac Citadel and Eroudac Academy.
The smuggler Izal Garsea was taught at this academy, and tried her best to impress her father, but Izalâ€™s family died soon after that.

The planet was mainly tellurian, with the exception being the Citadel.
Eroudac also had a spaceport, in which Izal Garsea spent most of her time in.
The Citadel, being one of the most populated places on the planet, was used by Izal Garsea as a home or shelter to stay in.
Once her parents died, Izal was leaning towards leaving the planet.
She decided to stay for longer and learn at her academy, until she was caught smuggling flowers for her professor, she left the planet.
Once returning to her homeworld, Batuu, she asked Julen Rakab out.
She proposed that they travel to Eroudac for a date, but they never reached the planet.
