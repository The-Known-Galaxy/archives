# Introduction
Takodana was a planet located in the Western Reaches.
The Takodana surface was covered in variants of forests, lakes, and grassy plains.
The planet was also a hyperspace route that was in between Chalcedon and Noe’ha’on.
The planet was used as a departure route that gave easy and accessible trade routes to both the inner and Outer Rim of the galaxy.
The planet was also seen as a traveling planet, having many tourists visit the planet; however, the planet gained not only tourist attraction, being a hotspot for fugitives, smugglers, and explorers who came across the planet.

# Section 1
Years prior to the control of the First Order and the fight against the Resistance.
A battle was held on the planet between the Jedi order and the Sith Order.
Soon after Maz Kanata’s cantina/castle would be built on top of the battlegrounds.
Ashoka Tano used Takodana as a planet to lie low after the results of Order 66 and revealed herself as Force-sensitive to an insurgency on the moon Raada.
However, Ashoka did not stay on the planet for long, leaving soon after because of the planet having many unknowns and traveling to the planet Thabeska.

Thirty years after the Battle of Endor against the Rebellion and the Galactic Empire.
Takodana was considered the meeting place of Han Solo, Rey Palpatine, and Finn, a deserter stormtrooper originally belonging to the First Order.
The planet was also where Rey uncovered Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber in the basement of the castle; the lightsaber called out to Rey through the force, making it known that Rey was force-sensitive.
Not long later, the First Order arrived on the planet after gaining info from beings located in the castle.
Hence a battle ensuing between the First Order and the Resistance.
In the end of the battle Rey was kidnaped by the First Order, hence resulting in Finn taking Luke’s lightsaber from Maz and defending the castle.
