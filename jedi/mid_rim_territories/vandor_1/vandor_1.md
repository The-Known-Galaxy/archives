# Introduction
Vandor, also known as Vandor-1, was a planet within the Mid Rim of the Galaxy, specifically as the Sloo Sector.
The planet orbited at least one star, with two moons orbiting Vandor itself.
The atmosphere was also breathable, allowing for life to take place.
A frigid planet and sparsely populated, the primary terrain features were mountains, plains and fast-flowing rivers.
Even with its sparse population, the Galactic Empire had a strong military presence here.

# Section 1
The planet was initially discovered by Arhul Corubalni, a scout for the Republic Survey Corp.
He found it centuries before the formal discovery by the Republic Survey Corps.
Its name comes from Arhul, which is a reference to an ancient poem about exploration.
Because of two factors, the Lorahns Cavity and Lesser Sloo Gas Cloud, navigation to Vandor was difficult, proving that settlement was difficult as well.
However, a settlement was established by the ambitious Yspobay Trading Company, which also built the primary settlement on the planet, Fort Yspo.
However, due to the planet’s isolation from any main hyperlane used for trading, the planet did not prosper.
After a few generations of settlement, many settlers moved off-world.



# Section 2
Before the start of the Clone Wars, a scout from the Commerce Guild named Tipps Ospe rediscovered the planet from Arhul Corubalni’s notes.
Tipps Ospe thought that Vandor could be used as a resting place for traders, as well as a place to refuel.
This thought was reinforced by the changing of hyperlanes.
Tipps restored the ruins of the Yspobay Trading Company headquarters on the planet and started to advertise traders to come by.
Tipps’ exploits were recorded in the journal of Tivoche Bilure, a bartender.



# Section 3
Vandor was also the site of Lando Calrissian and his droid, L3-37 where he played a game of sabacc.
This is where Tobias Beckett and his crew of hiesters met Lando.
The crew earlier had attempted a heist on a Imperial conveyex train to steal coaxium, fuel used for hyperspace travel.
The heist crew was assisted by Han Solo and Chewbacca to steal it for Crimson Dawn.
However the heist failed due to the interference of the Cloud-Riders led by Enfys Nest.
This is what later led to the meeting between Lando and the heist crew, in which Lando and Solo played a game of sabacc for the Millennium Falcon, a game where Lando won by cheating.
However, Lando still agreed to help with the heist as long as he got part of the cut for the job.
