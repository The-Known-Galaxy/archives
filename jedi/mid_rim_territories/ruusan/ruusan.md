# Introduction
Ruusan was a breathable planet and the place for the seven battles between the Sith’s Brotherhood of Darkness and the Jedi’s Army of Light.
The planet itself was located in the Mid-Rim part of the Galaxy and the Teraab Sector with three moons orbiting it.
All its battlefields were being used by the Sith’s Brotherhood of Darkness and the Jedi’s Army of Light.
These two powerful and huge armies fought each other constantly on it, eventually destroying Ruusan’s vegetation and its cities.
As it was the host to a vast range of Battles, lots of Ancient Relics lie on Ruusan still waiting to be found.
The planet shared its name with the Ruusan Reformations, an event within the Galactic Republic.
In conclusion, Ruusan was just a peaceful planet with nice villages before the Jedi and Sith liberated it.
