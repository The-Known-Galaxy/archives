# Introduction
Qiilura was a warm planet located in the Mid Rim, Ord Mantell was the closest planet to it, 40 light-years away.
Apart from non-sentient species such as gdans, merlies and vheks, Qiilura served as a home planet for Gurlanins; they were shapeshifters and intelligent predators ready to hunt down anyone from off-world.
Qiilura used to be avoided by any off-worlders; however, during the Clone Wars, Qiilura had successfully achieved human colonization with a population of over two hundred thousand farmers.
Qiilura had a terrain that was very generous and rich that made farming quite possible.
These farms were well known for their production of barq and kushayan; both of these products are used in highly expensive and luxury places such as restaurants.

# Section 1
Qiilura produced a large amount of food and beverages across the galaxy and was spoken highly of the quality of its products.
However, while the farmers had to work hard to earn their living, the planet was actually controlled by a Neimoidian merchant, Lik Ankkit, who supervised these farms.
He cared little for these farmers and only shared a small part of the profits he made.
A lot of credits were needed to keep up the tight security around these farms due to Gurlanins continuously trying to get rid of these outsiders.
For Ankkit to keep a larger amount from the profit to himself, he ordered part of his security force to hunt down merlies to provide food for these farmers.
It was said that these farmers would sell information for mercenaries and bounty hunters who visited the farm just to get a couple of credits or a bottle of urrqal.



# Section 2
After the Republic successfully managed to get past the Trade Federation blockade, a deal was made between the Republic and Gurlanins to remove the human colony from the planet.

According to the deal, Gurlanins had to act as spies for the Republic and the farms would be shut down by the Republic Forces.
This meant that the merlie species would once again live in peace and reach the previous numbers in the wild.
However, Gurlanins failed to fill their part, which meant that the deal was off.
A Republic garrison, led by General Arligan Zey and Commander Etain Tur-Murkan, had an objective to train these farmers to fight forthemselves in case of an invasion by the Separatist, or an attack by the Gurlanins.
However, since Separatist had no interest in controlling the planet, the Trade Federation had to leave the system and remove their blockade.
All the training and equipment the Republic provided for these farmers were used to expand their farms and pull back Gurlanin forces.
Shortly after, the Republic forces returned to Coruscant, unaware that a small highly skilled Gurlanin infiltration team had boarded their Star Cruiser.
The Senate Committee on Refugees was informed by Republic Intelligence of the significant damage Gurlanins had done on Coruscant and their demands to remove human colonization from their planet.
 After clone casualties began rising too high, the Republic had to accept their demands.
Another Republic occupation was sent to Qiilura led by Tur-Markan, who had achieved the rank of General, regretfully gave the order to use lethal force, due to farmers refusing to abandon their homes.
After the Clone War ended, Qiilura fell to the Empire by Imperial stormtroopers.
