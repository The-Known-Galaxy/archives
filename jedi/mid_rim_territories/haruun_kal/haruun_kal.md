# Introduction
Haruun Kal was a planet among many others in the Mid Rim, it could be found inside the Dustig sector.
Being the only world in the Al’Har system made Haruun Kal the capital world.
While this planet may have looked like an oceanic world from space, the so-called ocean was actually a huge formation of deadly gases.
Travelling on the planet's surface was limited since only areas high enough near the atmosphere, where the gases couldn’t reach, were safe to live in.
The native people of Haruun Kal were known as Korunnai.
They lived together in tribes and a moderate amount of these people were born as Force-sensitive.
It was unknown why that was so.
Several theories were written but very little answers were found.
Jedi High Council member, Master Windu was also born on this same planet.
During the Imperial era, Haruun Kal was bombarded by an Imperial fleet, during the chaos it became unknown if anyone had managed to escape.
