# Introduction

Wobani is a temperate planet located in the Mid Rim territories, specifically the Bryx sector.
The planet has a very grim outlook for many of its residents.
While the Galactic Empire is affiliated and stationed on Wobani, the main use of the planet as a penitentiary for the low-level criminals of the galaxy.
The Imperial Detention center, Imperial Headquarters, and of course, Wobani Penitentiary are all locations that can be visited on the dust bowl planet.

# Section 1

Planet Wobani mainly consists of mud plains, hulas, and rock formations of plateaus and canyons.
While no vegetation is seen on the planet's surface.
While the atmosphere is breathable, the planet is usually masked by dust storms making travel very difficult for those who wish to explore Wobani’s planetary surface.

# Section 2

While the planet has no recorded culture or history besides what the prisoners bring as their species or breakouts.
There have been political situations that have taken place.
During one of Princess Leia Organa’s humanitarian missions in her teen years, she traveled to Wobani with supplies as a show of good faith.
However, after seeing the conditions that the native’s lived in, she made the decision to take as many people as she could as refugees back to planet Alderaan.
Her plan required her to do unorthodox negotiations with the Officer in charge of Wobani, in other words, tricking the Officer into taking the refugees.
After their safe travel to Alderaan, she gave all of them the option of either going off-world or staying on the planet, either option would be supported by the Royal Family financially.
