# Introduction

Joralla is covered in jungles and is located within the Mid Rim’s Mektrun sector.
The planet had a rotational period of twenty-six hours and its year lasted 310 days.
It was the third and outermost planet to orbit the red giant star Jaska.
It had a normal level of gravity and no moons located around it.
Joralla also had a very unstable climate that caused considerable changes to the weather and seasons.
The surface of the planet is divided by expansive oceans and three main continents.

The terrain included mountains that climbed high into the sky, forests, and green luscious jungles.
The planet sustained a wide variety of plant life that included tequa bushes, sio trees, red spar fruits, and kewafi flowers.
The flora and fauna were just as diverse and incredibly beautiful.
Many of the plants on the planet had a way to defend themselves, an example is the barbs used by the kewafi flowers.
There were also a vast amount of animals that lived on this planet as well.
Some of them included oslets and wulkarsks; An aggressive and tribal sentient bird called Tikiarri also inhabited the planet.
It was known to kill off-worlders to attain advanced blasters.
This animal was very tribal and aggressive and would try to deter or kill off-worlders to try and attain advanced blaster systems.
Not long before the Galactic Civil War, Joralla was also home to the humanoids known by the name of the Wasilsi.
Both the Wasilsi and Tikiarri were very territorial over the land that they had on the planet and often got into quarrels that led them to become extinct.
Beyorth Gommdora, a sentientologist, formed a theory about the Wasilsi originating from somewhere outside Joralla.

The atmosphere of Joralla was considered to be Type I, which meant it was okay for life forms to live there.
Its climate was dependent on geographic latitude; this resulted in hot and tropical weather in zones closer to the equator while the more northern and southern poles of the planet were colder.
While there were colder conditions in the more northern and southern poles of the planet.
At the height of summer, the temperature in equatorial zones could reach up to 50 degrees celsius.
In the polar regions, there was a complete contrast in temperature which was seen to drop to lows of -35 degrees celsius during the coldest points of the year.

# Section 3

During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the neighboring star systems had problems containing the Tikiarri.
Any starship crew that mentioned these creatures had usually visited Joralla since they knew of the unruly nature of these creatures.
The Empire had refused to quarantine Joralla, so Moff Debin Seylas had chosen to appease the local systems and put the planet under an unofficial quarantine.
Soldiers piloting GAT-12 Skipray Blastboats did regular patrols of the planet.
Adriav Kavos stole a Rebel Alliance data disk while attacking some agents in the Mektrun sector.
He agreed to meet an interested buyer on Joralla, that turned out to be an Imperial spy who planned to acquire the disk and  capture Kavos’ freighter.
The freighter then traveled to the system but was forced to land in the jungle near the ruins of an old Wasilsi Temple.
