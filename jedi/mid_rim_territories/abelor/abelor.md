# Introduction
Abelor was a planet that located in the Western Reaches.
It was said that the Garsea family was residents of the planet Abelor after their leave of the planet Batuu in around 21 ABY.
Smuggler Dmar Olin also visited Abelor and encountered smuggler Ana Tolla with her crew that also happened to be on the planet.
This was beneficial for him, hence his partner Izal Garsea was stranded on the planet with no resources.
Then Historian and part-time author Eloc Throno, the writer of the Traveler's Guide to Batuu, included a map to Abelor.
