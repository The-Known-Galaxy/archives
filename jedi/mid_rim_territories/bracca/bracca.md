# Introduction

Bracca was a terrestrial planet in the Mid-Rim, being located in the Bracca System.
The planet was a ship wasteland, having plenty discarded and nonfunctional ships scattered everywhere.
Bracca was used for the Clone Wars, but by the Galactic Empire era it was completely useless other than selling ship parts to the Empire.
Bracca was extremely hazardous with all the wreckage and the people living on Bracca had to be careful, as well as be cautious of the Empire.

# Section 1

The planet was mostly three species: Human, Abednedo, and Dianoga.
Those who lived on the planet were mainly scrappers that made a living off selling scraps.
The Scrapper Guild was the main way for people to get money, as they gave credits in exchange for certain scraps and such.
Many scrappers were also skilled engineers, but as time went on, the skill of engineering was hardly needed on Bracca, as most things were past repair.
Credit exchanges also happened frequently for food and shelter.
The scrappers could also dump metal into Ibdis Maw, and take its waste for credits.

# Section 2

By the Clone Wars, Cal Kestis and Jaro Tapal were on a Star Destroyer during Order 66, with Jaro Tapal being killed and Cal Kestis being stranded on Bracca.
After the Galactic Republic's end and the start of the Empire, Rex as well as a few other clone troopers went to Bracca in order to obtain a needed item.
The item was used to take out the chip inside the head of the clones.
Even years after the Empireâ€™s beginning, Cal Kestis, still being stuck on Bracca, had to save his friend from dying with The Force.
This got the attention of the Inquisitors, with 2 Inquisitors coming, and Cal had no other choice but to retreat, and with the help of a former Jedi Knight he was able to escape.
