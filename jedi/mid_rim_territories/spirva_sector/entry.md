Cyphar, a world between Nkllon and Belsavis, had one sun and its grid coordinates were L-17.
Cyphar was protected by the Galactic Republic from the Confederacy of Independent Systems, also known as the Separatist Confederacy, in the year 22 BBY during the Clone Wars.
It was part of the D’Aelgoth Trade Route and home to one billion to ten billion citizens, in the year 25 ABY.

Derricon, occupied by the Rebel Alliance, was a rebel base during the Galactic Civil War.
The Derricon coordinates were also L-17.

Haurgub was allied with the Separatists during the Clone Wars.
The planet was later the location of the Battle of Haurgab which took place during the Clone Wars in 20 BBY, a battle that consisted of the local Maujasi Clans revolting against the local government and allying with the Separatist Confederacy.
Eventually, the Galactic Republic sent in troops to stop them, known as the Omega Squad.
The war ended in a stalemate and the Galactic Republic ended up withdrawing their troops from Haurgab.
Haurgab’s coordinates were L-16 and contained major cities Hadde, Neska, and Rishun.

Krykas V was an unoccupied planet that was covered in mud, briers, and thorns.
An eyesore, the planet was covered in a thick tan fog which consisted of clouds of particulate matter with strong electromagnetic charges which knocked out the majority of ship sensors.
To add on, it was also located within an asteroid field with the coordinates L-16.

Lopor Station, the home origin of bounty hunter Quantana, was located in grid coordinates K-17.
Quantana was a male who worked as a bounty hunter to raise money to cover his extended family’s medical bills.

Naalol, a barely populated backwater planet, was third in the Nalool system.
It contained a small Imperial garrison and was the Oquan headquarters.
Located in grid coordinates L-17, the planet contained high peaks, winding ridges, villages within the mountains, and larger cities in the flatland below.
Its immigrated species were Humans and Twi'leks.
Twi'leks were an omnivorous human species that originated from planet Ryloth, the creatures were known for their colorful skin.
Naalol’s major city was Rigton, the site of the world’s extensive starport.

Lenthalis, the sector capital of the Spirva Sector, was the headquarters of the Galladinium Galactic Exports, one of the largest shipping corporations within the galaxy founded by Galladinium around the year 50 BBY.
The Galladinium Galactic Exports published yearly Galladiniums Galactic Dialog of Fantastic Technology, which was eventually forbidden by the Galactic Empire because the Rebel Alliance used the Datalog to purchase their weapons.
Their capital, Hreas Port City, housed the Commerce Concourse, a place where gang riots broke out after the Battle of Hoth.
