# Introduction
Pelagon was a planet located in the Pelagia Province of the Tapani Sector, controlled by the House Pelagia.
Pelagon was a warm oceanic planet which made it an enjoyable place to live for early human colonists and an attractive sight to see for tourists from off-world.
Due to the endless ocean of the planet, the colonists had to gather large amounts of raw materials from nearby worlds to construct huge platforms above the ocean where eventually great cities, also known as seascapes, were built.
With the resources they had gathered over generations, these colonists were able to construct over 20 massive platforms with a large amount of population on each one.
It is said that down on the bottom of the oceans were ancient ruins that had predicted the arrival of these colonists.

Section I | The Great Jedi Purge
Pelagon was always known for its long tradition of providing many Jedi for the Jedi Order.
The Force was somewhat strong in this world due to long-lasting peace throughout the entire planet and having lots of lifeforms beneath the waves.
This fact, however, did not go unseen in the eyes of Darth Sidious.
Shortly after the Republic had fallen and Imperial flags began to reign across the galaxy, with help of House Mecetti, the Galactic Empire began sinking these platforms one by one to stop the production of Jedi and to be a step closer to having a galaxy with no marks of the Jedi Order left.
The Empire managed to destroy all platforms but two of them.
After the Imperial invasion had ended, four more platforms had successfully been built and the capital city of Pelagon was moved to the largest surviving platform that in the next years had grown over 20 more kilometers.
