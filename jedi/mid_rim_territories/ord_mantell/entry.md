# Introduction

Ord Mantell was a very popular planet located within the Bright Jewel sector and the Bright Jewel system.
Ord Mantell had an estimated 819,000 inhabitants.
The position of Ord Mantell was immense since it was near two notable hyperlanes which were referred to as ‘Celanon Spur’ and the ‘Entralla Route’.
The government that controlled this planet was known as the ‘Quests’.
Ord Mantell was primarily used as a stop-off point to resupply Republic ships that arrived from the mid-rim.
Ord Mantell was very urbanized near most of the major starports and did not have a very rural environment.
However, there were still mining locations on Ord Mantell.
The planet was very urbanized and it had three moons, which caused irregular activity, sometimes the infrastructure had to be repositioned to another location.

In later years, Ord Mantell began to have a strong economy and became much more industrialized.
The reason it became more industrialized was to support its original role which was to resupply the Republic ships that had journeyed there from the Mid Rim.
Most of the ice began to disappear around this time because they were quickly escalating the acceleration of the amount of greenhouse gases being produced.
Centuries later, Ord Mantell became a prime spot in the galaxy for tourism.
