# Introduction

Cantoncia was a planet located in the Outer Rim.
It was mostly desert, similar to Tatooine.
A variety of species resided on Cantoncia, such as Humans, Bufopel, Palandag, and much more.
On Cantoncia, the Canto Bight was the main tourist attraction on the planet, as those who lived there were mainly rich and wealthy, not to mention the casino and many racetracks.
It was more populated before the New Republic era.

# Section 1

Those on Cantoncia who owned property were allowed to rule over their properties, due to Cantoncia being in the Corporate Sector.
Long before the Canto Bight was built, Cantoncia had many ancient civilizations and ruins that became less and less known as time went on.
The desert had many taverns and such that a thief or lawbreaker could stay in.
Around the time of the war between the Resistance and the First Order, the Canto Bight was a paradise for smugglers and criminals alike.

# Section 2

The Sea of Cantoncia was a sea made by hand, or artificially.
As Cantoncia was a desert planet and water was quite limited in the desert, therefore containing and handling the water from the sea was extremely expensive.
Many sewage pipes were put into place in order to balance the water and prevent it from flooding the Canto Bight.

# Section 3

Two Resistance fighters, Rose Tico and Finn searched for a codebreaker that would help them stop a hyperspace tracker from the First Order.
They were arrested by the police of Canto Bight, although they did manage to escape with the help of a slicer named DJ.
In exchange, DJ was given his freedom.
With the support of BB8, they escaped the prison and fled on a yacht.
