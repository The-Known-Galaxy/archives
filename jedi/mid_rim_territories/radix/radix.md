# Introduction
Radix was a red/orange colored planet that was located in the mid-rim and was mostly unvisited due to it being a barren wasteland.
The atmosphere of the planet mostly consisted of random pieces of blown up ships, that had been pulled in by its orbit.

# Section 1
The only thing that is rumored to happen on the planet was when a group of Imperial related faction named the ‘Eiattu Pirates’ who went into hiding on the planet after the Battle Of Endor, which mocked many Imperials and Imperial sympathisers.
Lando Calrissian was sent on a mission to Radix to attack the pirates, due to them attacking Republic ships that were travelling through the system.
The leader of these pirates, Lieutenant Harme Kiera, was captured in the battle as the Republic was victorious yet later he escaped from them.
