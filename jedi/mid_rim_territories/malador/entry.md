# Introduction

Malador, a once-beautiful urban planet located in the Mid Rim's Juvex sector, was home to the aristocratic House Kellermin and the native cappabellor beetles.
However, as industrialization took hold, the planet's ecosystem suffered from years of pollution and smog.

# Section 1

Malador, situated in the Malador system of the Juvex sector, occupied a position between the Resti Kel and Zaria systems along the Senex-Juvex Loop hyperlane.
The planet was once known for its stunning natural beauty, but the relentless march of industrialization gradually turned it into an urbanized world.
The unfortunate consequences of pollution and choking smog severely damaged Malador's delicate ecosystem, eroding its once-pristine environment.

During the Galactic Civil War, Malador was among a select few worlds chosen to showcase its fauna in the Atrium, a prominent public building located in the sole spaceport on Ord Mynock, an Outer Rim Territories planet.
This exhibit aimed to provide glimpses of the planet's unique wildlife to visitors and tourists, highlighting the diversity that once thrived on Malador.

# Section 3

The crowded planet of Malador served as the homeworld of House Kellermin, an esteemed Ancient House hailing from the Senex-Juvex region.
Over time, many of the noble members of House Kellermin departed Malador, seeking refuge in the nearby industrial world of Resti Kel.
Compared to Malador, Resti Kel had undergone more thoughtful and careful development.
As the nobles left, slaves and individuals from various client species associated with House Kellermin remained behind, continuing to inhabit Malador.

Prominent among the locations on Malador were the dismal factories.
Following the exodus of local nobles to Resti Kel, these factories became staffed primarily by slaves and members of the client species affiliated with House Kellermin.
The industrial operations within these factories played a significant role in shaping Malador's economy and reinforcing the social structure established by the aristocracy.
