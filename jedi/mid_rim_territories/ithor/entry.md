# Introduction

Ithor was located in the Mid Rim and is the fourth planet in the Ottega System.
Ithor is also one of the oldest planets in the Galactic Republic and Ithor joined the Galactic Republic somewhere around 8000 BBY.
Ithor's surface did not have any civilization on it, but the planet did contain a lot of life.
The planet had many moons and the surface of the planet contains a variety of plants, such as the bafforr tree, a tree that possessed telepathic capabilities.
There were Ithorians on the planet, also known as Hammerheads, who built great floating cities on the planet, but that did not touch the surface of Ithor.
The surface of Ithor existed mostly out of the jungle.
Most Ithorians never even walked on the surface.

# Section 1

In 439 BBY, scientists tried to combine the bafforr tree with other plants on the surface, it did work, but the scientists made a new parasitic form of life and they named it Spore.
The Spore became hostile and eventually was sent to an asteroid in 300 BBY.
In 19 BBY Jedi Grand Master Yoda was reported dead in an incident on Ithor and the cause of his death was unclear.
Sometime before the Battle of Yavin, Ithor was under blockade by the Galactic Empire.
They ordered access to Ithorian farming techniques and technology, in a venture to find biotech for military appeals.
Even after the Battle of Yavin, the Galactic Empire planned to destroy Ithor.
Luckily the Rebel Alliance found out about this and sended Han Solo to save a group of Ithorians willing to evacuate.
There was very little chance, but Han Solo and Chewbacca managed to save the Ithorians without getting any damage from the incoming TIE Fighters.

# Section 2

The peaceful existence of Ithor ended in 25 ABY, when the Yuuzhan Vong War burned a trail from the Outer Rim.
Ten years later, in 35 ABY, in the beginning and end of the Dark Nest Crisis, the Ithorians tried to move to Borao.Their attempts almost failed, because of the attendance of the RePlanetHab organization, which asserted the rights of the world.
While most of the Ithorians sorted out on Borao, and considering the professionalism of the Ithorians for ecology, they still hoped that one day they could reinhabit Ithor, just like they did with re-terraforming Telos.
Without using the Ossus project given from Jedi Master Kol Skywalker, the Ithorians decided to rebuild their own world by utilizing the same technology as they did with the re-terraforming with Telos.
In 137 ABY, the planet's surface was dry and rocky, but, dangerous plants and animals began the transform the planet's soil to a breathable and livable condition.
