# Introduction

Deep in the galaxy lies a planet named Aruza.
This planet is orbited by five moons all colored with multiple light and pale shades of tan.
The planet is known to be one of the most peaceful locations in the galaxy based on previous documentations and written descriptions.
It is home to the Aruzan people, small individuals with light blue skin and very dark blue hair.
It also houses many different species such as farrow birds and bomats as well as unique plants such as rupin trees and inderrin trees.
According to sources from the people, the planet has not experienced a single murder of any sort for over 100 years since the year of 3 ABY.

Section 1: Background

```
During the times of the Galactic Civil War, Aruza was under control by the COMPNOR officer, General Sinick Kritkeen.
```

During his time, he was given orders to alter the peaceful inhabitants of the planet into a more social and viable force which would basically reform the planet into a war machine.
He was ordered to strip their humanity and turn them into vicious soldiers who would fight and protect under the Imperial Doctrine.
If the people resisted this action, they would be punished and or alleviated from further evolution.
The process in which Kritkeen proceeded with impoverished the Aruzans and brought wealth to himself.
To prevent any changes from this time on, all Aruzan ships were destroyed, trapping them on the planet and forcing them to abide by Kritkeenâ€™s orders.
