# Introduction

Overview:
Kashyyyk, famous to a lot of people as the forest-covered homeworld of the well known Wookiee species.
The planet itself is found in Mid Rim regions of space, located in the Mytaranor sector’s Kashyyyk system.
Kashyyk has three unnamed but identified moons visibly orbiting the planet, and orbits its sun in a perfect circle - negating seasons entirely.
It was a member of the Galactic Republic until the end of the Clone Wars era, where the Wookiee population was largely enslaved and shipped for labor work on Kashyyyk and other planets owned by the Galactic Empire.

Properties:
Kashyyyk’s surface is mostly mountainous and separated by islands, covered entirely by forests and jungles of the Kashyyyk’s own wroshyr trees.
These trees were huge - sometimes reaching up to several kilometers, visible much deeper into the jungles.
They could live as long as 50,000 years, and thousands of different species of trees existed, e.g.
some found the Wawaatt Archipelago.

The Wawaatt Archipelago was a series of islands that were a shocking contrast to the planet’s large jungles.
This outpost consisted of a more tropical wroshyr tree that could be seen only growing a few hundred feet in height.
Wookiees could also be seen inhabiting these islands and constructing the city Kachirho - a settlement that served at the planet’s Capital.
The rest of the Kashyyykian wilds were inhabited by extremely diverse and predatory creatures, and many species of carnivorous plants.
Such locations like the Black Forest were so dense with trees and danger, convincing the Wookiee population that the forest was haunted by evil dark spirits.

History:
Kashyyyk and the Wookiees have an expansive history of being enslaved for the benefit of other organisations.
The first discovered example of this is the Czerka Corporation occupying the planet and using the Wookiee population using much superior technology.
Eventually the Wookiees would start an uprising that would ultimately result in the evacuation of the invaders.

Furthermore, after the Clone Wars was concluded, the Wookiees would find themselves in a similar situation with the Galactic Empire despite their unwavering loyalty to the Republic beforehand.
The Empire’s presence on Kashyyyk was so destructive and overwhelming that the planet itself was redesignated as ‘G5-623’ and used for extreme mining operations, deforestation and Wookiee slave labor.
The planet itself would even experience an entire Imperial blockade when the Empire took control over Kashyyyk.
At some point the Wookiees enslaved would attempt another uprising similar to the Czerka Corporation, however it was quickly and easily extinguished by General Kahdah and the Imperial 212th Attack Battalion.

Some time before the Battle of Endor a massacre was ordered by the Empire, ending the lives of several innocent Wookiee slave lives and impacting the views of Alliance diplomatic perspectives in the case of Mon Mothma, Chancellor of the Alliance.
Even when the Emperor ultimately fell after the events of the Battle of Endor, Kashyyyk was still under the jurisdiction of the Galactic Empire under Grand Moff Lozen Tolruck’s ownership of G5-623 Imperial territory.
With the efforts of Admiral Ackbar and Leia Organa, Kashyyyk would be liberated from Tolruck.
