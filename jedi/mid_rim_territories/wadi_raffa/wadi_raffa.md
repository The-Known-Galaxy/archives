# Introduction

Wadi Raffa was a planet located in the Western Reaches.
Wadi Raffa was used by Ranos Yalli and Has Obitt hired by the Galactic Empire to transport dated separatist equipment to Wadi Raffa.
This was so the Empire could study the weapons and hopefully further their technology.
Later on, the Empire used the planet as a mining planet to supply the construction of the Death Star.
