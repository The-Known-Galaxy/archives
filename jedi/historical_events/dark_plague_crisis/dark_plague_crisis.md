# Introduction

The Dark Plague Crisis was a monumental event within the Great Galactic War that came close to destroying the Jedi Order.
Prior to the Cold War, Jedi Padawans Parkanas Tark, Yuon Par, Cin Tykan, Sidonie Garen, Eriz Vossan and Duras Fain travelled to the planet of Malachor III, located in the infamous system in which Malachor V had been destroyed several centuries prior.
They stumbled across the burial ground of Terrak Morrhage, an ancient Sith Lord who centuries prior had created a plague that corrupted Jedi, turning them to the Dark Side and placing them under his control.
Morrhage’s spirit began to corrupt members of the expedition, before they managed to escape at the expense of Tark, who was stranded and left behind.

By 3643 BBY with the Cold War occurring across the Galaxy, the Padawans had all reached the rank of Jedi Master, being notable in their own right.
However, Tark, who had been corrupted by Morrhage’s spirit and had assumed the name Lord Vivicar began to inflict the original plague upon his former allies, with the plague beginning to spread to other Jedi.
Par’s former padawan, a Jedi Consular who was to become the 3rd Barsen’thor (Warden of the Order) became aware of the plague, and set out to learn an ancient shielding technique that had been created with the first outbreak of Morrhage’s plague.
The Jedi Consular learnt the shielding technique after securing several ancient Jedi Holocrons, known as the Noetikons, and began to travel the galaxy, shielding the Masters from Vivicar’s control.
Eventually, the Consular confronted Vivicar upon his flagship, discovering his origin as Tark and using the shielding technique upon him.
As a result, Tark was redeemed to the Light Side, but Morrhage’s spirit was left intact albeit weakened.
For their actions and exceptional skill, the Consular was granted the rank of Master.
