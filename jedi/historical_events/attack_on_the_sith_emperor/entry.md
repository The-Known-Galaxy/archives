# Introduction

fter Revan, Surik, T3-M4 and Scourge united in 3950 BBY to confront the threat posed by the Sith Emperor, they journeyed to the Imperial Citadel on Dromund Kaas in an attempt to assassinate the Sith Emperor.
Scourge led them deeper into the Citadel until they were stopped by Imperial Guards, elite warriors who protected the Emperor and the Dark Council.
The group fought through these enemies, and eventually reached the throne room, with T3-M4 sealing the door to prevent any reinforcements.
After dispatching the remaining guards, they confronted the Emperor but were unprepared for his immense power.
After T3-M4 was sacrificed, distracting the Emperor, and being destroyed by Force Lightning, Revan, Surik and Scourge stood united against Vitiate.
However, Scourge was confronted by a series of visions showing potential futures, witnessing the eventual triumph of the Hero of Tython against the Emperor.
Determined to aid this future hero, Scourge stabbed Surik in the back as a ploy to show loyalty.
This attack distracted Revan, who was rapidly stunned by the Sith Emperor, resulting in the failure of the plot.

Scourge was granted immortality and promoted to Emperor’s Wrath for his supposed loyalty, whilst Revan was trapped in stasis as the Emperor attempted to corrupt him.
Surik became a Force Ghost, aiding Revan during his captivity and keeping watch over him as he was tortured for decades.
Scourge eventually discovered the Jedi he had witnessed in his vision, defecting from the Empire to aid the Hero of Tython in destroying Vitiate’s body.
