# Introduction
The Duel of Mustafar occurred in 19 BBY during the Great Jedi Purge.
It was a confrontation where Darth Vader, formerly Anakin Skywalker, fought with his Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, on the planet of Mustafar.

# Section 1
In 19 BBY, the Great Jedi Purge took place after three years of conflict between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Galactic Republic.


Anakin Skywalker informed Master Mace Windu that the Chancellor is the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious.
Windu then collected a party of Jedi Masters consisting Kit Fisto, Agen Kolar, and Saesee Tiin, in an attempt to arrest the Chancellor in his office.


Arriving in the office, Palpatine greeted the team politely, with the Masters informing that he will be taken into custody igniting their lightsabers, threatening the Chancellor, which angered the Chancellor and revealed his true image and quickly charged at them, eliminating the Masters Kolar and Tiin.
As Skywalker was arriving, Palpatine defeated Kit Fisto.
Then Windu cornered the Sith Lord and the Jedi Knight arrived.

Skywalker then saw the conflict, with the Master attempting to execute Palpatine–he begged Mace Windu to keep the Chancellor alive.
Palpatine then struck Force Lightning at the Jedi Master, who deflected the ability back at him, which slowly revealed the true appearance and facial features of the Sith Lord.
After the ability slowly fading away, Mace Windu tried to eliminate the Sith Lord but was stopped by Skywalker by severing his hands, resulting in the Chancellor on a chance to defeat Windu–striking the ability again, sending the Master away from the office, onto the streets of Coruscant, resulting in his death.

Skywalker then felt guilty for his participation in the Master’s attempt to exterminate the Chancellor since he knew that the Jedi would not allow him to stay in the Order due to the fact that taking one’s life is extremely forbidden.
Palpatine then offered Skywalker to join and turn to the Dark Side to avoid the death of his wife, Padmé Amidala.
Running out of options, the Jedi Knight knelt before the Chancellor, now revealed as Darth Sidious, accepting him as his apprentice; calling the Knight, Darth Vader.

Later that time, Darth Sidious commanded all Republic Clone Troopers to execute Order 66, an order to eliminate all existing Jedi across all star systems, resulting in the start of the Great Jedi Purge.
Sidious then told Vader that in order to be strong in the Dark Side, he should return to the Jedi Temple with the 501st Legion and eliminate all members present there, including the younglings.



# Section 2
After all the events in the Jedi Temple, Vader was sent to Mustafar to end the Clone Wars by eliminating the rest of the members of the Separatist Council.

Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda arrived in the Temple, seeing all the members eliminated.
They watched the security holograms of Skywalker in his dark deeds.
Kenobi asked Yoda to quickly head over to Palpatine and execute him since he will be unable to strike down Anakin since he considered him to be a friend, a brother.

Yoda told Kenobi that it would not be possible for him to execute the Emperor, especially without assistance, and that the Padawan that he always knew no longer existed.

Kenobi then went to Senator Amidala in order to locate Anakin’s whereabouts.
But she told him that the last time she had seen Anakin was the previous day, she hesitated telling that Vader went to Mustafar.
He told Padmé that he had turned to the Dark Side and the events in the Jedi Temple, but still hesitated to tell Kenobi.

Padmé left to Mustafar in her personal starship, but before she took off, Obi-Wan unnoticeably boarded the ship in one of its storage rooms, and then fled off.



# Section 3
In Mustafar, Vader noticed the arrival of Amidala’s ship.
He approached her and had a small talk where she revealed that his Master, Kenobi, knew about her pregnancy with Vader.
Padmé confronted Vader to stop all his dark deeds and come back to the light.
Vader then refused, angering him.

Kenobi then showed up by the boarding ramp of the ship, Vader assumed that Padmé sent the Jedi Master to kill him, Force choking his wife.
Obi-Wan then demanded to release her, but he believed that Amidala had turned against him.
Vader declared that he is no longer afraid of the Dark Side and Kenobi as his enemy.
Resulting in both of them igniting their lightsabers, starting a duel.



# Section 4
The pair locked blades, fighting in the Klegger Corp Mining Facility, where the members of the Separatist Council were exterminated.
The duel then progressed onto different structures of the facility over the lava of Mustafar.

Both parties then found themselves trapped on the arm of a structure of the facility, which was separated from the facility by the lava spewing out.
Obi-Wan then managed to land safely on a lava skiff with Vader following him, jumping onto a droid collector where both continued to fight.

Soon later, Kenobi jumped onto a hill and claimed that the duel was over since he had the high ground.
Vader then jumped towards Kenobi, but was striked by him, severing his limbs, falling down to the edge of the hill.



# Section 5
Kenobi spoke to Vader, crying out his emotions, believing that he was the Chosen One that would end the Sith.
He was unable to turn his former Padawan back to the light and then retreated and took Anakin’s lightsaber.

Darth Sidious then arrived and found Vader, taking him to the Galactic Capital of Coruscant to be rebuilt.
The suit that Vader wore would support him, but would need him to wear it for the rest of his life, otherwise it would cause his death.
