# Introduction

In 5000 BBY an attack on the Koros system by the Sith Empire introduced the Republic and the Jedi Order to the Sith and sparked the beginning of the Great Hyperspace War.
The battle began shortly after a Jedi Knight named Odan-Urr had a nightmarish vision of the death of Sith Lord Marka Ragnos, and the war against the Republic that it would cause.
He traveled to Coruscant with Jedi Master Memit Nadill and Teta, the empress of Koros, to voice his concerns in front of the Galactic Senate, though they did not take him seriously, and took no action.
Returning to Koros, Jedi Nadill, Odan-Urr and Urr's master Ooroo was present when a young convict named Jori Daragon burst into Teta's chambers, telling the Jedi that she had seen the great Sith Empire, and that they were on their way to attack the Republic.
Nadill learned as much as he could about the Sith Empire, then traveled to Coruscant to rally the support of the Jedi Knights.
The newly christened Dark Lord of the Sith, Naga Sadow, deployed his fleets to invade numerous Republic worlds simultaneously while he left his eye-shaped Sith Meditation Sphere near Primus Goluud and used Sith magic to create thousands of illusory soldiers, which made the Sith army seem far larger than it actually was.

The Jedi Order played a huge role in the defense of Coruscant, with Memit Nadill leading a team of Jedi Knights, including Tuknatan and Sonam-Ha'ar.
Meanwhile, another battle was raging on the planet of Kirrek, where Jedi Master Ooroo and his apprentice Odan-Urr were stationed.
However, when Naga Sadow's concentration was broken, the illusory Sith forces disappeared and the Republic's forces' morale was bolstered.
On Coruscant, the Jedi realized what had happened and launched a massive counterattack, easily defeating the Sith.
The Republic also emerged victorious on Kirrek, however only at the expense of the death of Master Ooroo, who sacrificed his life in defeating a large force of Massassi warriors.
With the Sith forces routed, Supreme Chancellor Pultimo ordered the sacking of Sith Space, liberating the Sith from the Dark Lords and ultimately dissolving the Empire.
In 4400 BBY, the ambitious Padawan Freedon Nadd was denied Knighthood by his Jedi Masters.
In an attempt to find out why this had happened, Nadd went to Jedi Master Matta Tremayne, who challenged him to prove to her that he was indeed a Jedi Knight.
Nadd saw this as a threat and decided to attack and kill Tremayne.

Furious at the Jedi Masters for making him kill his teacher, Nadd went looking for the Sith, because he felt that they were the only ones who would readily accept his apprenticeship and teach him about the Force.
During his travels, Nadd discovered the Sith Lord Naga Sadow who was serving out his exile on Yavin 4.
Awakening from his status chamber, Sadow trained Freedon Nadd in the ways of the dark side only to be killed by Nadd when his training was complete.
Following Sadow's death, Nadd abandoned Yavin 4 in favor of Onderon, located outside Republic space, with hopes of rebuilding a stronger Sith Empire.
After Freedon Nadd had made himself the leader of the capital city of Iziz, the Sith Lord began to exile all criminals from the city; some of whom managed to survive in the deadly jungles surrounding the city and organize into a tribe of hunter-gatherers.
The world of Onderon suffered through the legacy of Nadd even after his death as a cult devoted to his memory, known as the Naddists, wreaked havoc on the people of the planet.
When Jedi Master Arca Jeth attempted to move Freedon Nadd's remains to Onderon's moon Dxun the Naddists, led by Onderonian King Ommin, attacked and managed to capture Nadd's remains as well as Jeth himself.
Ommin then fled to the city of Iziz.
The Republic's army converged on the planet and attacked Iziz, but was too strong and devastated the city.

After the battle, Freedon Nadd's remains were taken to Dxun and sealed in an armored tomb.
In 4250 BBY the Jedi experienced a third Great Schism on Coruscant following Nadd's death.
After a brief civil war on Coruscant, the surviving group of Dark Jedi retreated to the Vultar system, where they discovered that the planets of the system were artificial.
The Dark Jedi could not control the huge Cosmic Turbine that powered the system and quickly annihilated themselves and the entire system.
