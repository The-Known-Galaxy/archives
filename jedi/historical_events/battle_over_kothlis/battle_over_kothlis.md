# Introduction

The Battle over Kothlis was a conflict that occurred during the Battle of Kothlis in 3.5 ABY.
The Battle of Kothlis occurred after secret Imperial construction data was stolen during a Rebellion raid on an Imperial freighter.
This construction data was revealed to be the plans for the Death Star II, a recreation of the previous Death Star superweapon.
The plans were delivered to a Rebellion safehouse on the colony world Kothlis.
The site was raided by bounty hunters, who stole the information and took it away on their ship, the Razor.
As the Razor was escaping the planet’s atmosphere, an Imperial Star Destroyer jumped out of hyperspace right on top of them.
The Razor was ensnared by the Star Destroyers tractor beam.

The Battle over Kothlis truly began when Rebel reinforcements jumped out of hyperspace and noticed the Imperial Star Destroyer.
These reinforcements were made up of Rogue Squadron, and contained three B-wing starfighters, four T-65B X-wing starfighters, and three RZ-1 A-wing interceptors.
This squadron was lead by Rogue Leader Wedge Antilles.
Rogue Squadron engaged with a contingent of TIE Fighters that were sent from the Star Destroyer.
Rogue Squadron engaged with the TIE Fighters and Wedge Antilles destroyed the Star Destroyer’s ion cannons.

He was also able to cause additional damage to the Star Destroyer.
Beginning a swift barrage of attacks, he took out the bridge deflector shields and the reactor.
The Star Destroyer, realizing it had no change, began to move to jump into hyperspace, but Antilles committed one last attack and managed to destroy the command deck.
The Star Destroyer began to plummet to the surface of Kothlis below, where the conflict would continue on the surface.
