# Introduction

At the close of the Mandalorian Wars, the Jedi Revan and Malak mysteriously disappeared into the Unknown Regions, supposedly pursuing the last remnants of the Mandalorian fleet.
Unknown to the Order or the High Council, the two Jedi had traced clues to the planet Dromund Kaas where they discovered that the Sith Empire lived on in secret and was ruled by the mysterious and incredibly powerful Sith Emperor.
Unable to stop him, the Emperor reprogrammed the Jedi and sent them back to the Republic as the Sith Lords Darth Revan and Darth Malak.
Returning to the Republic with their loyal followers in tow, the newly christened Sith Lords began to wage a second war, preying on a Republic already weakened by the Mandalorians and taking full advantage of the immense number of Jedi who were still willing to follow the pair.
This Jedi Civil War pitted masters against students, fathers against sons, and friends against best friends, making it one of the most emotionally powerful wars in galactic history.
While the early stages of the war were indecisive, it soon became apparent that Revan's Sith armada was growing at a steady rate, and in a short time, the Republic was overwhelmed with the seemingly limitless forces of the enemy.
World after world fell to Revan's vast fleets and masterful strategies.

Determined not to make the same mistakes they had in the Mandalorian Wars, the High Council devised a plan to eliminate the enemy at its source: Revan.
During one fateful battle a small Jedi strike team led by Bastila Shan, a young Jedi Padawan with the remarkable gift of battle meditation, infiltrated Darth Revan's command ship to capture the Dark Lord.
During the confrontation, Darth Malak, who was stationed aboard a different ship, realized that Revan could be easily defeated and that he could then assume the title of Dark Lord of the Sith, fired upon his own master's vessel in the hope of killing both Revan and the Jedi fighting him.
The Jedi managed to escape with Revan's body, but Malak had achieved a crucial victory, for he was now the Dark Lord of the Sith and commander of the entire Sith armada.
Malak continued to wage war against the Republic, relying exclusively on brute force as opposed to subtle strategies.
Following the Sith tradition, he took an apprentice of his own: former Jedi Darth Bandon.
As the situation for the Republic and the Jedi became more desperate, they began to rely more and more on the battle meditation of Bastila Shan to gain an advantage over the ever-growing Sith Empire.

Consequently, Darth Malak began to target Jedi Shan specifically, hoping to crush the Republic's last chance of standing against his armies.
During one battle in orbit above the world of Taris, Jedi Shan's vessel, the Endar Spire, was crippled beyond recovery, and the young Jedi was forced to evacuate to the planet below.
As fate would have it, two other survivors eventually caught up with Jedi Shan on Taris: Carth Onasi, a decorated soldier and war hero of the Republic, and another lowly officer who Shan recently had transferred to her command.
The key to the rest of the war, however, lay in the identity of this single, seemingly insignificant foot soldier.
Onasi and Shan continued to gain more companions, managed to escape the destruction of Taris, and fled to Dantooine's secret Jedi Enclave, where their third companion was inducted into the Order and they discovered the existence of the Star Forge.
The Jedi Council commissioned their small band to seek out Star Maps from various planets in order to discover the location of the Star Forge, which they believed was the key to Malak's power.
During their quest, the group encountered and defeated many Sith minions, including Darth Bandon.

The biggest interruption to their mission was the groups capture by one of the Sith fleet's command ships.
After a frantic escape attempt, Onasi, Shan, and the new Jedi Padawan encountered Darth Malak himself.
This confrontation revealed a startling truth: that Darth Revan had not been killed, but had instead been rendered comatose by Malak's attack and saved by the Jedi, specifically Shan.
The Jedi Council had inserted over his destroyed mind a new identity, that of a lowly officer who was now a Jedi Padawan.
Darth Revan had been traveling with Shan and Onasi the entire time.
Upon escaping Malak and realizing his true identity, Revan was determined to complete his mission and destroy his old apprentice.
Eventually, he and his companions discovered the location of the Star Forge and launched an attack in collaboration with the Republic against it.
Revan managed to infiltrate the giant factory, which was the source of the Sith's limitless armada and defeated his old apprentice Malak once and for all.
Despite the victory over Malak and the apparent defeat of the Sith, the High Council and the Order, in general, kept Revan and his wife, Bastila Shan, at a distance.
Regarded as outsiders, Revan and Shan remained outside of the walls of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant while an increasingly strained relationship with the Order wore on them.

Revan, suffering from crippling Force visions, eventually left for the Unknown Regions in search of answers.
