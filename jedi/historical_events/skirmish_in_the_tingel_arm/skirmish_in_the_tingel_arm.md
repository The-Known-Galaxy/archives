# Introduction
During the year 3681BBY, the resurgent Sith Empire under their illusive Emperor Vitiate deployed a small flotilla of Harrower class dreadnaughts to the fringe reaches of the Tingel Arm.
At this time, the Republic sent a small diplomatic convoy to rendezvous with the unknown fleet in an attempt to figure out the intent of the incursion into the sparsely populated region.
The diplomats collected and sent images of these mysterious warships to the Republic armada, only to shortly after that be reduced to broken hulks by the Sith flotilla.

It was later commented on by Master Gnost-Dural, that the diplomats had just barely enough time to transmit the images back to the Republic fleet before they were utterly annihilated.
This event was also known as the first spark of the Great Galactic War, which led to the Sacking of Coruscant.
