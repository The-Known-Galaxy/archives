# Introduction

The Battle of Ilum was also known as Operation Dark Ice and occurred on the ice world of Ilum, where the war between the Galactic and the Sith Empire raged.
During the war, a Sith, Darth Malgus, declared himself the new Sith Emperor and asked his fellow Sith to join him to create a “New Empire”; with this new power quickly occupying Ilum, the sides who were previously opposing each other, the Sith Empire and the Republic,  then joined forces to slay Malgus and end this new threat.

# Section 1

In 3640 BBY, after the Sith Empire discovered Adegan crystals on Ilum, they sent Grand Moff Regus and the Dark Council Member Darth Arho with an Imperial force.
They named this invasion “Operation Dark Ice”; in response to this invasion, the Republic sent their force, under Supreme Commander Rans and Jedi Master Jaric Kaedan.

In the start, the Sith Empire had the advantage, after slaying Jedi Master Kaedan and Admiral Shai.
In addition, they executed a surprise attack against Supreme Commander Rans and were able to capture him.
With the deaths of Master Kaedan, Admiral Shai, and the capture of Supreme Commander Rans, the Republic was at loss and did not know what to do next; but an unexpected ally appeared, Darth Malgus.
Shatterstorm, a codenamed mission during the war was led by Talz commandos but was intercepted by Operative Che'nash, a mercenary working for the Shrikaansi Reconnaissance Company.
Her job was to infiltrate and get more information on the Talz mission.
Later, Malgus revealed his secret of being in contact with Rans, the Supreme Commander, he provided deactivation codes and information on how to defeat Darth Arho; helping the Republic to free Supreme Commander Rans.
With Darth Malgus's help, the Republic and Malgus were able to defeat Darth Arho in a ruined Ilum Temple.

Although Arho had died he was able to complete the mission “Operation Dark Ice”, extracting Adegan crystals.
However, before the Empire could get the crystal shipment, Darth Malgus intercepted their transport and took away the Adegan crystals, transmitting his takeover to the galaxy whilst also announcing his New Empire.
With his new wealth of Adegan crystals, both the Republic and the Sith Empire felt threatened, both of the groups gathered their war councils to discuss Darth Malgus’s proclamation because he could make stealth ships with the Adegan crystals he acquired.
Making the first move in this new battle, Malgus sent his associate, the traitorous Darth Serevin to attack both the Republic and the Imperial forces that stayed on Ilum.
Following the start of  Severin's attack, Cole Cantarus of the Corellian Security Force and General Hesker of the Imperial Guard both with their respective attack forces launched retaliation strikes against Serevin.
In the end, both of the groups combined to defeat Serevin and find the coordinates of Malgus’ space station.
Finding the space station, the combined forces attacked the station, and battle troops of all sorts including defecting Sith and Imperial soldiers, Trandoshan warriors, Mandalorian mercenaries, Anomid scientists, and extermination droids from the Foundry.
As they attacked, Malgus activated the self-destruct sequence, incinerating the station itself plus the attacking fleets.
Activating the self-destruct button, he leaped down the throne and started engaging the combined forces.
Although he had significant fighting experience, he lost when his resolve faltered and he was thrown into a reactor shaft supposedly dying alongside his Empire.

# Section 4

After Malgus’ defeat, Ilum was in the hands of the Republic while the Empire was on the brink of extinction, even though they were able to get the Adegan crystals extracted.
This was mostly due to infighting within the Sith but with the ending of the battle; two years later a world caught the eye of the Empire, Makeb, somewhere in between the Republic and Hutt Space.
