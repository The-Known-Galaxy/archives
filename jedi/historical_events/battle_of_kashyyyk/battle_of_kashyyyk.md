# Introduction

The Battle of Kashyyyk, occurring during the New Sith Wars, was the lesser known second battle following long after the battle of Kashyyyk led by Master Yoda.
The battle was ferocious, and included the participants of the Brotherhood of Darkness and the Galactic republic.

The republic had established a firm stronghold on the Wookiee homeworld in an attempt to fortify their defenses in the Mid Rim and establish supply lines across the board.

The Republic were significantly outnumbered and outgunned by the Brotherhood of Darkness but despite this held out for many days and nights utilising guerilla tactics which stemmed from the planet's great jungles.

This battle is interesting due to the way in which the Brotherhood managed to accomplish their goal.
A man named Dessel, who led the Gloom Walkers survived these guerilla tactics for (3) days despite being lost in the jungle, and being ambushed from every angle.

# Section 1

The battle occurred on the date of 1010BBY with a former Jedi Master, Lord Kaan leading his newly organised forces of the Sith over (20,000) strong into the treacherous jungles of Kashyyyk.
The great Wroshyr forests littered with Kshyy vines provided excellent cover to the Republic forces who, through attrition, trained morale from the Sith.
The Sith endured thousands of casualties and sent several excursions into various areas.

However, when nearly all morale was lost, a special set of reinforcements called the Gloom Walkers commanded by Lieutenant Ulabore was sent to engage the unknown Galactic Republic forces who hid in the trees.

They were immediately ambushed with Ulabore losing his calm.
Thankfully, Dessel, one of the cortosis miners, took brave command.
He was surprisingly force sensitive and used this to detect where traps, enemy soldiers and ambushes lay.
The man was able to lead the squadron of Gloom Walkers out of the treacherous ambush valley and save thousands of his Sith brethren.

# Section 2

When this squadron came out of the forests unharmed, it inspired the rest of the Sith legion to push on, which they did, and successfully managed to capture Kashyyyk after (2000) more losses.
The Republic fled to Trandosha, but were pursued by the Gloom Walkers once more who literally burned them and their city of Hsskhor to the ground.
Ulabore was awarded a commendation, and never told his overseers that it was actually Dessel who led the men to safety.

# Section 3

Despite this being evil against evil, and the Sith having achieved victory.
There is still much that can be learned.
Dessel was a brave soldier who ultimately saved his fellow comrades through clever thinking and calm strategies.
He led his brethren to victory, citing the importance of morale in long attrition battles.
