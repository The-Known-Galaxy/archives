# Section 2

The final battle in the Dark Reaper Crisis, the Battle of Thule put an end to the threat of the Confederacy’s Sith superweapon, as well as to the opening stages of the war.
Led by the Jedi Generals Mace Windu, Luminara Unduli, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Kenobi’s apprentice Anakin Skywalker, the Republic’s assault commenced shortly after the Battle of Sivvi, a related assault that had captured Thule’s moon and lowered its defenses.
As Windu and Unduli unloaded the main assault force, Kenobi led a unit of speedy Republic fighter tanks to destroy Confederate supply depots and capture their forward command center.
Though the depots and command center were well-defended with turrets and droid tanks, the Jedi were eventually successful, allowing the Republic to unleash a full frontal attack on the city of Kessiak, where the Dark Reaper lay.
Windu and Unduli then boarded fighter tanks to lead AT-XTs and AT-TEs on side campaigns to destroy the enemy’s advantages.
They destroyed the Confederacy’s two fighter hangars, cutting off air support for the droids, and destroyed the main armory and a tank garage before rejoining the main assault on the gates of Kessiak.
On their way back they were ambushed by Dooku’s Protodekas, but destroyed them at a high cost in walkers.
As reinforcements sent by Yoda landed nearby, Cydon Prax entered the battle in his personal tank and destroyed Windu’s.

Forced to fight on foot, Windu made for the city wall as Republic fighter tanks attempted to stave off Commander Prax.
Windu managed to find a set of ancient tunnels into the city and opened the gates, allowing Republic forces to pour in and forcing a Confederate retreat inside the city.
As Windu’s army entered Kessiak, Skywalker’s attack force landed at the opposite side of the city and blasted their way in.
As the Confederacy’s droids were occupied with the main army, Skywalker raced through Kessiak in a fighter tank until he reached the city center.
There, he found that Dooku had left, but Cydon Prax had not, and the two engaged in a tank battle, which left Prax dead.
Skywalker then moved to engage the Dark Reaper, which was now quickly becoming active, without backup.
As Ulic Qel-Droma’s spirit whispered guidance to him, Skywalker destroyed the Dark Reaper’s weapon systems one by one, resisting the power of the superweapon.
When the Force Harvester was exposed at last, Skywalker emptied all the missiles on his tank into it, destroying the core mechanism of the weapon and causing the Dark Reaper to explode.

# Section 4

The Battle of Thule was a victory for the Republic, though a very costly one.
A large part of the Republic army had been killed in the fighting, though they had pulled through and won the day.
But the Confederacy suffered worse: Cydon Prax’s death cost Dooku another commander, alongside a superweapon and a massive droid army.
