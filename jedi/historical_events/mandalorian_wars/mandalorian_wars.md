# Introduction
The Mandalorian Wars was a major, galaxy-wide conflict occurring between the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, a reformed army brought together by Mandalore the Ultimate and the Republic.
Beginning at 3976 BBY, the resulting conflict would continue for a grueling 16 years, resulting in major devastation across the galaxy and acting as the predecessor to another galactic-scale conflict, the Jedi Civil War.

# Section 1
Two decades before the outbreak of the Mandalorian Wars, another conflict had been fought between the Jedi, with the Mandalorians taking part in what would be known as the Great Sith War.
After being defeated by the newly proclaimed Lords of the Sith, Exar Kun, and his apprentice Ulic Qel Droma, the Mandalorians fought a crusade into the heart of the galaxy and the Republic.
These Mandalorian Crusades would see them defeated and once again cast out by the Republic.
At the time, the current Mandalore, Mandalore the Indomitable, would be killed on the Onderonian moon of Dxun.
It was here a Mandalorian warrior found his body and would claim the mask, proclaiming himself Mandalore the Ultimate, ruler of the Mandalorian clans.


Remaining on Dxun, the new Mandalore would recall the clans, using the moon as proving grounds for the clans and a place to regain their strength.
The original species of the Mandalorians, the Taung, were few and dying, and so Mandalore sought to bring new species into the clans, spreading their warrior traditions across countless species.
In the eyes of Mandalore, if you could prove yourself worthy and would honor their traditions, you have the right to be called a Mandalorian.
However, Mandalore always sought to find a great challenge for his new Mandalorian army, and soon he would have such a challenge.

In 3976 BBY, the Neo-Crusaders began their conquest of fringe worlds on the Outer Rim.
Not wishing to draw the ire of the Republic, Mandalore the Ultimate sought to hide their presence to begin building up his forces for a confrontation with the Republic.
The Mandalorians had a habit of using the local inhabitants of worlds to help with transporting equipment across the surface and would incorporate them into their units.
However, the Mandalorians weren’t merciful, as seen in the Battle of Cathar, where the Mando’ade led by Cassus Fett, essentially purged the planet’s population, forcing the remaining Cathar to flee the planet for other worlds.


When the Republic finally had begun to move against the Mandalorians, they had already grown immensely.
Capable of taking on the entire Republic military, they continued to make progress as their warships slowly conquered Republic space.
Despite this threat to the Republic, the Jedi Council refused to intervene and help the Republic.
In opposition to this, a young Jedi Knight began to publicly advocate for the Jedi to join the war, inspiring many other Jedi and citizens of the Republic to take up his call to war.
Seeking out evidence to force the masters to allow the Jedi to join the fight, this Jedi and his followers traveled to Cathar.
When the masters came to confront him and his followers, this Jedi found a Mandalorian mask lying nearby.
When he reached out to grab it, every Jedi present received a vision of the atrocity committed by the Mandalorians against the Cathar, and a lone Mandalorian wearing the same mask the Jedi had found, standing against them only to meet the same fate as the Cathar.
Taking the mask, the Jedi Knight would proclaim himself as Revan, swearing to stop the Mandalorians and return the Republic to glory.



# Section 3
Unable to deny the threat of the Mandalorians, the Jedi Council permitted Revan to reform the Mercy Corps, a Jedi detachment meant to act as healers to the Republic during times of war, not having been put into service since the Sith War.
Under the command of Revan and his close friend Malak, the Mercy Corps began to help the Republic forces push back against the Mandalorian onslaught.
Revan would prove himself a capable General under the Republic military, providing tactical aid and advice to the heads of the Republic military.
Revan became so influential in the workings of the Republic military that he was eventually appointed by the Chancellor as Supreme Commander of the Republic military, making him responsible for the war effort.


Notably, during this time, Revan and Malak would seek to bring more Jedi to the war effort to bolster their forces.
During this, Alak would visit the Jedi Enclave located in the world of Dantooine.
It would be here a young Jedi by the name of Meetra Surik would be convinced to join the war effort, becoming one of the most influential Jedi of the war.

As Revan and his forces began to push back the Mandalorians however, Revan and many Jedi began to slowly forsake the ways of the Jedi.
The Council refused to guide Revan and his Jedi, leaving them to be engulfed by warfare.
Revan and Malak especially felt this influence, as they came to despise weakness as the Mandalorians had.
Revan began to adopt a more brutal war strategy, willing to sacrifice entire systems if it would lead to the collapse of the Mandalorian war effort.
In 3961 BBY, Revan and Malak discovered the remnants of the Rakatan Infinite Empire.
Revan would begin to hunt down these relics, ancient star maps leading to the crown jewel of the Infinite Empire, the Star Forge.
The Star Forge emanated dark-side energy, and as Revan sensed this, he avoided using the station, which was capable of creating endless armadas and armies that would’ve overwhelmed the Mandalorian threat.

However, this was not Revan’s last encounter with dark-side relics, as he would soon come to discover the Trayus Academy, an ancient Sith temple located on Malachor V.
Revan, convinced he would need any weapon he could find to stop the Neo-Crusaders, began to study the teachings he found at the long-abandoned academy.



# Section 4
By 3960 BBY, both the Republic and Mandalorian forces had been severely depleted.
Knowing the Mandalorians had grown weak, Revan looked to end the war in one final confrontation.
In order to do this, Revan deployed the use of a superweapon created by the zabrak Bao-Dur, the Mass Shadow Generator.
This weapon would pull any ships in orbit of Malachor V to the surface of the planet, ripping them apart and scattering them across the surface.


Deploying much of his forces under the command of Meetra Surik, Revan lured the Mandalorian fleet to Malachor V, engaging in a massive battle over the planet’s surface.
Once lured into orbit, Revan’s portion of the fleet arrived at Malachor and began to assist Surik’s forces.
Outnumbered and surrounded, Mandalore the Ultimate challenged Revan to ceremonial combat aboard his ship.
When Revan arrived, Mandalore and he engaged in a fearsome duel on the bridge.
When Revan finally landed the killing blow to Mandalore the Ultimate, he fell to the floor of his ship, speaking to Revan one last time.
As he lay dying, Mandalore revealed to him he had been tricked by a Sith infiltrator, who had told him he received a vision of the Mandalorian clans conquering the Republic and goading them into war.
Mandalore would give him the location of an ancient Sith world, Rekkiad, telling him he would find the answers he sought there.
Revan, taking the mask of Mandalore, fled the flagship and returned to his fleet.


As Surik and her forces slowly pushed the Mandalorian fleets closer to the planet’s orbit, Surik gave the order for the Mass Shadow Generator to be activated.
To her horror, the superweapon not only ripped apart the Mandalorian fleet but slowly caused the planet to crash in on itself, destroying its surface and creating a barren planet in the dead of space.
Destruction on such a scale had rarely been seen, and Surik, out of fear and anguish, cut herself off from the Force.



# Section 5
With the war ended, the Jedi Council demanded the remaining Jedi who participated in the war return to Coruscant and face judgment before the Council.
Revan and Malak refused their command, and instead headed to Rekkiad, the world that Mandalore had told Revan of before his death.
It was here that Revan would leave the mask of Mandalore, thereby preventing the clans from reuniting and scattering them across the galaxy.
It was on Rekkiad that Revan and Malak would discover that the ancient Sith had not perished, but instead waited out in the Unknown Regions, stalking the Republic and waiting for a time to strike.


Out of the three, Meetra Surik was the only one to return to Coruscant to face the Council.
Although the Council wished to punish Surik for her involvement in the war, they were terrified when they finally faced her.
When she was brought before them, the Council sensed that she had cut her connection to the Force, creating a dead spot in the Force within her.
Fearing what they saw, and unable to understand how she had cut herself off so fully from the Force and survived, the Council exiled Surik from the Order.


When Revan and Malak went hunting down the hidden Sith Empire, they saw the strength of this hidden Empire and knew the Republic would collapse if it did not prepare.
When Revan and Malak returned from the Unknown Regions, they did not come back as saviors of the Republic or as Jedi Knights, but as Lords of the Sith, leading an army of Dark Jedi along with their own Sith Empire.
