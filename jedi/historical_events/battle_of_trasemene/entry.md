# Introduction

After the end of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY, a Sy Myrthian senator of the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) named Toonbuck Toora kept on fighting against the Republic and the newly formed Galactic Empire.
She managed to create an army of Confederate forces and began her rebellion against the Empire.
This rebellion was called the Sy Mythrian Insurrection.
The Galactic Empire strove to eradicate Toonbuck Toora and her army, and almost every front she engaged them on ended in defeat.
Finally, an Imperial task force under the command of Admiral Adar Tallon and General Jan Dodonna, chased down Toora's flagship, Defiance's Banner.
They cornered her at the planet Trasemene, where the final war would begin.
Toonbuck Toora fought valiantly and threw everything she had left at the Empire.
However, the sheer power of the Imperial Fleet obliterated her flagship, and the Battle of Trasemene and the Sy Mythrian Insurrection ended with her death.
