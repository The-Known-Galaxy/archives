# Introduction

In 11,987 BBY Republic Supreme Chancellor Pers'lya was assassinated and replaced by Chancellor Contispex I, a member of the Pius Dea faith.
During his reign, the fanatical Chancellor began a series of crusades that would come in the form of war, purges, and genocide.
Officially known as the Recusal, the Jedi Order declared itself independent from the Republic in 11,933 BBY and completely withdrew back to Ossus.
Throughout the next millennium, the Jedi Order fought an internal struggle regarding the correct response to the insanity of the Contispex dynasty and the Pius Dea rule it had established.
While the majority of the Order refused to fight against the very government it had protected for millennia, some Jedi served as Knights errant, taking the fight to the cultists without the permission of the High Council.
Others declared for the Pius Dea, forming a splinter group called the Order of the Terrible Glare.
It wasn't until the 11,100s BBY that the Order was approached by the Caamasi and were finally convinced to end their period of isolationism and intervene.
The Jedi High Council joined with the Bureau of Ships and Services in seeding the cathedral ships of the Pius Dea with a crippling virus and plotting to arrest the current Chancellor.

In a stunning move, a Jedi strike team boarded Chancellor Contispex XIX's flagship, the Flame of Sinthara, and arrested him on war crime charges.
In accordance with the terms set forth by the Jedi Order at the start of their involvement, the Jedi High Council suspended the Galactic Senate and placed Grand Master Biel Ductavis in the position of Supreme Chancellor.
A few generations later, the Jedi Order had returned to their peaceful ways on Ossus upon seeing the Republic make a full recovery from the Pius Dea Era.
However, in 7000 BBY the Jedi suffered a Second Great Schism, resulting in a time known to history as the Hundred-Year Darkness.
The schism stemmed from the Order's reaction to a group of heretical Dark Jedi experimenting with forbidden alchemy.
The monstrosities which arose were deemed abominations to the Force by the High Council and war was begun to end the practice of these dark arts.
By this time the Order had managed to develop the lightsaber in a way in which it was useful in hand-to-hand combat.
Used before as a siege weapon due to its massive power pack, the Order's scientists were able to create a transportable power pack that could be worn on the belt of the user.
Crossing blades with the heretics, the Jedi Order finally saw the end of the conflict with the victory at the battle of Corbos in 6900 BBY.

# Section 2

There the Jedi Order arrested the twelve surviving Dark Jedi, led by High General Ajunta Pall, and banished them to Wild Space.
Unknown to the Jedi, these Exiles would land on the planet Korriban, homeworld of the Sith species, and conquer the natives, deeming themselves the Dark Lords of the Sith.
Shortly after settling on Korriban, a splinter group of exiles, led by Remulus Dreypa, returned to Republic space to enact vengeance but were intercepted by a Jedi patrol.
The Jedi pursued those Sith across the galaxy until both factions crash-landed on the planet Kesh.
After a period of fighting, the two factions made peace and formed a new organization called the Doomed, striving to achieve the balance between the light and the dark sides of the force.
Meanwhile, the Korriban Sith would eventually move their headquarters to Ziost where they would form the massive Sith Empire, an Order of dark side warriors who would dream of crushing their Jedi oppressors.
