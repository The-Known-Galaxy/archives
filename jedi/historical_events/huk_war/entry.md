# Introduction

During the Huk War, the Kaleesh lost, since the Republic reinforced the Huks in the war.
General Grievous, who led the Kaleesh, nearly defeated the Huks, but he was incapacitated in a shuttle crash.
San Hill, Chairman of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, paid the Geonosians to create a cybernetic suit for Grievous, later leading the Separatist Army.
The economic recovery of Kalee was funded by the Banking Clan in return for the work of Grievous.
The Huk on Oben were slaughtered by Grievous’ former subordinates, which were now under Bentilais san Sk’ar’s command, and later emigrated to Oben.

With the rise of the New Order, the Kaleesh, together with Bentilais san Sk’ar and his subordinates, opposed the rule of the Empire, which resulted in a conflict between them.
When Captain Thrawn attacked the planet Oben, the conflict concluded, with Sk’ar later joining the Empire.

# Section 1

This revolution consisted of former members from the Delegation of 2000, who were senators during the Clone Wars that supported Chancellor Palpatine up until the creation of the Galactic Empire, albeit some members of the Delegation of 2000 decided to still support Palpatine.
Sixty three senators from the Delegation of 2000 were arrested by Imperial authorities, however they were soon released.
Many of these senators were the cause of an alliance to rebuild the Republic, which ended up being successful.
