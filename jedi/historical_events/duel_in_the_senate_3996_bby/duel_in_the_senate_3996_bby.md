# Introduction

The Brotherhood of the sith, led by Dark Lord Exar Kun, wanted to use the next battle to decisively end the jedi.
The Dark Lord would charge his newly-initiated Sith converts with the task of murdering their Masters, a plot that would culminate with the death of Kun’s own Master.
However, the departure of the new Sith on Kun’s stronghold on the jungle moon would go awry.
During the battle, Qel-Droma was imprisoned in a wall of light side energy, later it was determined that punishment would be for Qel-Droma’s execution.
Mandalore wanted to rescue the Krath warlord, and he wanted Exar Kun’s assistance to do it.

However, the Dark Lord has warned Qel-Droma about a strike against the galactic capital and getting himself apprehended only validated Kun’s prior notion.
Nonetheless, he agreed to assist as Qel-Droma was still a vital factor in their cause.

# Section 1

During the Great Sith War in the year 3996 BBY, there was a duel that took place in the Senate Hall of the Galactic Republic, the duel consisted between Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas and his former apprentice Exar Kun.
The duel would commence on Coruscant, in the hall’s grand convocation chamber.
Exar Kun would be now known from here on out as the Dark Lord of the Sith.
Exar Kun marched with Mandalore as well as Sith Massassi warriors and busted through the doors of the Galactic Senate hall.
In the center of the Convocation Chamber was Qel-Droma being judged by the entire Senate assembly.
The Supreme Chancellor and Qel-Droma brother was also judging him.

# Section 2

Exar Kun has freed Qel-Droma from his shackles by using the force.
The Galactic Senate would have no time to react as the Dark Lord would use sith magic to freeze all of the assembly apart from the present Jedi and the Supreme Chancellor.
The Dark Lord proceeded to carry out his plans and free Qel-Droma but also kill the Chancellor.
Now preparing to escape the Dark Lord runs into his old teacher, Master Vodo-Siosk Baas.
The two would both exchange some heated words before the Dark Lord igniting his lightsaber.

# Section 3

When it was realized in battle that both opponents match the same strength as one another, the Dark Lord introduced his creation of ancient Sith design, the double-bladed lightsaber.
After this Master Vodo-Siosk, was killed with a stroke from Kun’s blade, and Baas would go on to say that he defeated Kun forever, Master Vodo-Siosk baas then became one with the force.
The Dark Lord would depart with Qel-Droma and Mandalore the indomitable, resuming their quest for dominion over the galaxy.
