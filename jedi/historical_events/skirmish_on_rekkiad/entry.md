# Introduction

To understand this battle, one must understand the significance of the “Mandalore’s Mask” which to Mandalore's people is a sign of power and leadership.
Whichever clan possesses this mask, will by extension, be in control of Mandalore.

With this said, this battle is minor and small-scale but holds immense importance due to Revan’s importance, who was still a Jedi Master at the time, and the outcome of the battle itself.
Clan Ordo ended up successfully finding the mask with Revan’s help, and thus decided the fate of Mandalore.

The clans of Mandalore had divided it’s lands into sections in the hopes of finding the Mask of Mandalore as it had been lost during the Mandalorian Wars.
Each section belonged to a different clan, and thus it was a gamble.

However, Master Revan, siding with Clan Ordo, remembered from his time with Malak that the mask was hidden in the territory that belonged to Clan Jendri, beginning a small scale battle.
The Ordo, convinced by Revan, marched into Jendri's territory, who then retaliated.

# Section 1

At first, Jendri outnumbered and outgunned the invading Ordo.
They had mobilised Basilisk war droids who shot down on the Ordo’s campsite from the air, and several soldiers and snipers around the camp itself.

Veela Ordo, also led a groundforce to take on the camp in a headon battle.
Despite this, Revan who wielded a lightsaber killed several soldiers, distracted the pilots and damaged a few aircraft making the odds even.
Canderous Ordo led his forces in a counterassault utilising their own Basilisks who resulted in the death of the straggling Jendri pilots.

The Jendri’s then abandoned their assault as the battle waned on against their favour.
Clan Ordo remained, seizing victory.

# Section 2

This has not come without cost though, as a funeral for (30) soldiers was held.
The Jendri had a warriors funeral for the fallen Ordo as well out of respect in Mandalorian culture.
The survivors held a feast, and partied for the remainder of the night.

With this captured territory, Revan and his Mandalorians were able to capture the First Spear which was a temple that housed a tomb which contained Mandalorians Mask.
They investigated further inside Dramath’s crypt.

Veela and other mandalorians had actually followed them, and ambushed the Ordo’s.
But they too were killed by Revan and Clan Ordo, resulting in more unnecessary deaths.

However, Clan Ordo was successful in their plight, and left the tomb with the mask concluding the expedition as a whole.
