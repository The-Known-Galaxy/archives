# Introduction

The Great Hyperspace Disaster, otherwise known as the Legacy Run disaster or the Evacuation of Hetzal Prime, was an incident that occurred 232 BBY, during the High Republic Era.
It involved the Legacy Run spaceship, which stumbled upon a Nihil spacecraft while traversing a well-established hyperspace route.
The captain of the ship, Casset, was then forced to take control of the ship and avoid the obstacle.
She succeeded in that task, but the ship was torn apart as a result of the immense force applied to it.
She and her crew managed to secure all the ship’s compartments before dying when the bridge was torn open with them inside.
The passengers were saved, however.

# Section 1

The Hetzal system placed in the Outer Rim was particularly endangered due to a great number of hyperspace anomalies.
Debris was falling all over the system and causing much destruction.
Eventually, a map was put together, displaying the amount of debris and its impact.
This prompted a system-wide evacuation order.
Chaos ensued, as there weren’t enough starships to transport all citizens to safety.
Some of them chose to ignore the order, as they didn’t believe in the threat’s existence.
The government later sent a distress signal, hoping the Republic would aid them in this crisis.

# Section 2

Hetzal’s call for help was picked up by the Third Horizon, which quickly responded to the request and started heading toward the system.
Over a hundred Jedi were involved in the rescue, led by Master Kriss.
At first, the Jedi didn’t realize what the anomalies actually were and thus decided to destroy the threat.
This changed when a Padawan sensed lifeforms inside one of the anomalies, and sent the information to Kriss through the Force.
A total of 10 such anomalies were detected, and rescuing those trapped inside became one of the team’s primary goals.
Even though the Republic succeeded in protecting the Hetzal system, they weren’t able to eliminate all the debris.
Due to this, a series of Emergences began, as the leftover pieces would exit hyperspace at random points and fall on the surrounding land.
