# Introduction

The Despot War was a conflict within the Tython System in 25,805 BBY between the Despot Army and the Je'daii Order.
The Despot Queen Haidya tried to unite the crime barons of her homeworld Shikawaa, to then conquer the Tython System.
While rising to become the Krall or Overlord of her planet, she looked to unify the planet’s aristocracy under one leader.
However, many of the aristocracy resisted this, causing her to kill Clan Ryo’s leader and their oldest son.
Despite this fact Haidya had enthusiastic support of many commoners who had been swayed by her promises like safety and freedom from Je'daii intervention.

# Section 1

Once she was known as the Despot Queen, her ambitions would gain the attention of the Je’daii.
The Je’daii would join the Shikaawan Aristocrats in opposing her, realising the system’s stability was at risk.
Following this, there would be a short period of small skirmishes in space and some moons of the planet Kalimahr.
Haidya had secretly trained a Despot Army, however, initially taking the order by surprise with a full invasion on Tython.
The Je’daii Order quickly regained their footing against this invasion.
Master Rajivari led the Je’daii into the battle, earning the nickname “General”.Temple Master of Akar Kesh temple and leader of the Je’daii Council Telaat would be slain during this invasion, with Master Ketu succeeding him.

# Section 2

On the planet Nox, multiple doomed cities sided with the Je’daii while others sided with Haidya.
When it was found out that three domes of Greenwood Station were supplying Haidya, the Order tried to convince them to stop.
Despite best efforts and warning the inhabitants, the places would get bombed, with thousands of deaths from the attacks.
Greenwood itself would only be damaged as it had a laboratory producing for the Order.
The inhabitants there, however, would gain an intense hatred for the Je’daii Order.

# Section 3

During the war many Battle Droids would be used with the Despot Army using both Deathstalker and Deathblaster class fighters, thought many of the Deathblasters would be destroyed.
Voynos Rok, wanting revenge for his father's and brother’s death, would seek out Je’daii Ranger Daegen Lok.
With help Lok would join the Despot Army and rise through the ranks to Lieutenant.
Lok would fall for Haidya, hesitating to kill her first at the siege of the Kaleth Temple.
Haidya would attack him, leading him to kill her and fight his way out of the camp.
This death would cause generals to fight one another, allowing the Je’daii Order to defeat the remains, claiming Victory of the War.

# Section 4

Following this war, the Deathblaster would become a really rare ship and Greenwoo’d Council would allowed the murder of Je’daii in return for all the civillians killed in the bombings.
These assassinations continued for two or three years with now a general resentment for the Je’daii Order across the System.
Lok would gain the rank of Master in 25,800 BBY before receiving a vision within Tython’s Chasm, causing him to go insane.
