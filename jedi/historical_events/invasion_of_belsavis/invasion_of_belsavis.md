# Introduction
The Belsavis prison break, or more famously known as the Invasion of Belsavis was a strategic offensive conducted by the Sith Empire during the Galactic War in 3641 BBY.


The Belsavis prison was the equivalent of the Ilum crystal caves, the knowledge of its existence was exclusive to only a few in the Republic.
However, it’s whereabouts were discovered on the planet of Belsavis a small squadron of Sith specialists utilised an orbital bombardment to peel away the main defenses of the prison.

This battle was important to the Sith as the prison was used to house the Sith Lords called the Dread Masters, feared Sith who had both immense knowledge and strength when it came to the dark side of the Force.

The battle itself was strategic in nature and was merely used as a red herring for Executor Krannus who was attempting to soften the defenses so that he would be able to raze the entire planet as part of a Sith empowerment ritual.

# Section 1
The prison was divided into multiple sections with further sub-sections as it was a prison colony that was fairly large and was built upon another prison called the Tomb.
The Tomb was an underground complex consisting of vaults that sealed away Esh-kha species and other violent terrors.

The surface prison was used to contain Dread Masters, Mandalorians and other criminals deemed to be too dangerous to be kept in a normal prison by the Republic.

Section X, although little is known about it, was supposedly the main goal of the freed dread masters.
They aimed to break open the vault and release something devastating to annihilate the entirety of the prison.
This fortunately never happened however, as the Dread Masters were thinned away by the Esh-kha and Republic security soldiers, forcing them to retreat beforehand.



# Section 2
Imperial intelligence had been gaining intel about the weak points and guard rotations of the prison for many weeks, and thus when the prison-break was attempted it was done with frightening accuracy.

The Emperor Executor Krannus and his death cult aimed to use Belsavis for his Sith ritual which would supposedly eradicate all life in the galaxy.
In order to complete the ritual he had to carry out a planet sacrifice.

The first assault was an utter massacre for the Republic as it was completely unexpected.
A squadron of Sith and elite soldiers were sent to key areas to release prisoners, which would conveniently add to the Sith army.
They used the chaos created by the bombardment to kill many dazed guards.


The Empire sent a second task force to construct a defensive point within the prison itself whilst the guards were distracted with the first task force.
This brilliant assault was further successful in the addition of the Proculus Station which entered the orbit of the planet.
It was a mobile battle platform that essentially rained hellfire upon the inhabitants and defenses of the prison.

The prisoners later gained access to the guard armoury supplying them with equal ammunition and firepower to that of the prisons defenses, which they used to maximum effect.



# Section 3
This ultimately motivated a retreat from the Republic guards who’s families escaped under the leadership of Officer Mark Vempor.

The Republic Military later entered the playing field but still struggled to contain the chaos as they were outnumbered.
Fortunately, Jedi Knight Enna Tabord was sent to lead the recapture of the prison and was further supported by “the Hero of Tython” an unnamed Jedi Master who was instrumental during the Galactic War as a battlemaster.
Enna Tabord was wounded during the conflict, and the New Men (cybernetic criminals) captured the database of the facility allowing them to download the prison records and locate various more dangerous criminals across the prison.

Ultimately, the Sith were successful in their capturing of the Dread Masters and would have decimated the Republic forces had the Esh-kha not turned on them.
Furthermore, Major Camren after relentless fighting and casualties on both sides executed a genocidal protocol and detonated the center’s power relays, halting the Sith’s progress.



# Section 4
The Sith ultimately left with what they sought, but not without immense casualties.
The Republic similarly, suffered great losses, and the lesson learned here is that surprises will come wherever you least expect it.
The dark side of the force shrouded these events in mystery and the Jedi were unable to foresee this event.
This was pivotal in prolonging the Galactic War and various Sith criminals and Dreadmasters alike who led Sith invasions later were rescued during this prison invasion.
