# Introduction
The Battle of Hoth was a decisive triumph for the Galactic Empire and one of the Alliance to Restore the Republic's worst battlefield defeats during the Galactic Civil War.
The Imperial attack was aimed at eliminating the Rebel Alliance's Echo Base on the distant ice world of Hoth.
When a viper probe droid sent by Darth Vader arrived on Hoth, the location of the base was compromised.

# Section 1
Imperial forces eventually forced the Rebellion to vacate their base on Yavin 4 following the Rebel Alliance's significant victory at Yavin.
If the Yavin 4 base was ever lost, a holocron produced by Bail Organa, one of the Rebel Alliance's founders, provided a list of probable hideouts.
Despite the loss of both the Yavin 4 and the Boz Pity bases, Luke Skywalker picked Hoth as the Rebellion's new major base after being stuck on the planet for a length of time around 1 ABY.
Following a surprise discovery by a Viper probe droid deployed to the planet, Vader's own Death Squadron fleet arrived in the Hoth system.
Luke Skywalker briefly witnessed the arrival of the Viper robot on one of his patrols, mistaking it for a meteorite, but he was unable to explore the matter further before he and his tauntaun were assaulted by a wampa.



# Section 2
Han Solo ,who had originally planned to leave Hoth due to his status as a wanted criminal by Jabba the Hutt, with the main motivating factor behind the decision being an encounter with a bounty hunter at Ord Mantell, eventually decided to go into the snowstorm to find Luke Skywalker when he failed to report back before the personnel was forced to close the base due to the blizzard.
Skywalker was able to flee the wampa cave while also amputating one of the residents, albeit he was left barely alive as a result of the attack as well as being stranded in the storm.
Han Solo found Skywalker, who had almost frozen to death.
They set up camp and used Han’s dead tauntaun to keep themselves warm.



# Section 3
Zev Senesca, posing as Rogue Two, was dispatched the next morning to scout for them and bring them back to base, with Solo answering to his calling.
Skywalker's injuries were treated in a bacta tank once he was recovered and returned to Echo Base.
After examining unusual radio communications detected up near the shield generator, Solo discovered and engaged the Viper, who fought it alongside Chewbacca.
After Solo attempted to disable it with a blaster, the probe droid self-destructed, but not before transmitting evidence of their shield generator.
Their discovery turned out to be the Rebel Alliance's primary base, which is located on the system's sixth planet.



# Section 4
Vader and many of his best officers planned a surprise strike, jumping out of hyperspace at a safe distance from the planet and exploiting the fact that meteor activity made it difficult for the Rebels to see approaching ships.
They'd next launch a restricted long-range orbital bombardment to destroy the base, as well as any spacecraft and defenses that could be present.
The next step would be for Major General Maximilian Veers to launch a massive ground attack to capture any survivors.
The Imperials would have been able to easily conquer the planet with few losses if the plan had worked.
Ozzel, on the other hand, devised his own assault strategy.
He blasted out of hyperspace near the star system, aiming to catch the Rebels off guard before they could prepare their defenses.
When the Rebels' early-warning sensors discovered the fleet, this backfired.
Echo Base was protected by a planetary shield, which prevented any aircraft bombardment.
Vader was alerted by Veers, who realized that taking the base would require a full-fledged ground attack rather than simply destroying it from the air.
An enraged Vader Force choked Ozzel to death for his incompetence, and promoted Firmus Piett, the Star Dreadnought Executor's chief fleet captain, to Admiral.



# Section 5
After assessing the situation, Vader ordered General Veers to land beyond the energy shield's range and launch a surface assault aimed at knocking out the Rebels' power generator and, as a result, bringing down the shield, while Death Squadron formed a blockade formation to prevent any fleeing Rebel starships from escaping.
The Imperial landing force, codenamed Blizzard Force, was made up of multiple battalions of 501st Legion Stormtroopers (also known as Snowtroopers), some of whom were equipped with heavy repeating blasters.
This infantry force was transported by AT-AT and A5 Juggernaut transports, which were accompanied by AT-PT, AT-ST, and AT-AR walkers, as well as Viper probe droids for additional sensory support.
The Blizzard Force also possessed five powerful anti-air warriors to deal with any aerial threats, albeit they were also tightly guarded due to their vulnerability.
The rebel coalition deployed the Rogue Squadron in T-47 snowspeeders as a deterrent to this attack.
The attack officially began at this point.



# Section 6
The major goal of the Imperial assault was to destroy the Rebels' main power generators.
The planetary shield that protects the base from orbital bombardment would be disabled as a result of this.
Even before the fight began, the Imperials had incurred casualties.
In order to impress Vader, Blizzard 4 sought to make its way through the Kerane Valley.
Veers lost three trekkers to ice flow crevasses.
As a result, the force was forced to return to the safer western path.
After Rogue Squadron destroyed a set of probe droids blocking the transporter's escape route, Rogue 10 was shot down.
Before rescuing the pilot, Skywalker and his wingmen destroyed three AT-STs that were threatening him.
The shield generator and Outpost Beta were then ordered to be defended by Rieekan.
On their route, the squadron destroyed three AT-ATs and five additional AT-STs.



# Section 7
Following that, the Imperial force marched against the Rebel base.
To avoid any Star Destroyer fatalities in the space fight, they moved for the Outpost Beta ion cannon.
Rogue Squadron's snowspeeders flew in and destroyed the assailants before they could reach the gun.
AT-ST reinforcements brought in by Imperial loader shuttles were also killed by the Rogues.
In addition, other Rebel Thermal Detonator troops and repeating blaster troopers supported Rogue Squadron by destroying various All Terrain Anti-Air walkers, albeit at a substantial cost to the troopers.



# Section 8
The Alliance emplacements opened fire on Blizzard Force, but the walkers' armor plating was too robust for Rebel lasers.
Only Rogue Squadron was successful in toppling one assault transport, using magnetic harpoons and tow cables to entangle the walker's feet, a novel strategy devised by Luke Skywalker and Alliance tactician Beryl Chiffonage.
Unfortunately, the approach failed miserably, and the AT-ATs killed a large number of snowspeeders with lethal blaster cannon volleys.
The insurgents dove into the trenches in search of cover.
Luke's craft was hit by walker fire, instantly killing his gunner Dak Ralter, before being shot down.
Skywalker just made it out of the speeder wreckage before it was destroyed by a walker, leaving Ralter's body inside.
Wedge Antilles was given command of Rogue Squadron for the duration of the mission as a result of this.
In an act that seemed to validate Palpatine's concerns about Skywalker's growing prowess as a prospective Jedi, the young pilot decided to take down two AT-ATs (one of which was Blizzard 4) on his own.
Luke was able to accomplish this using only a grappling hook, his father's lightsaber, and a concussion grenade before returning to the rebels.



# Section 9
The inexorable Imperial attack left the majority of the rebels in the trenches injured, dying, dead, afraid, captured, or demoralized.
The rebel gun emplacements opened fire on the walkers, but it was ineffective.
The walkers' tearing rays claimed the lives of many rebels.
AT-STs and snowtroopers cleaned up what they could with their bodies.
As the armored assault force approached the trenches, the Alliance forces came under heavy fire, with the majority of their laser gun emplacements damaged, and the order to retreat was given.
Veers in Blizzard 1 smashed through the defensive lines and annihilated the shield power generators with the help of the other AT-ATs.
Blizzard 1 delivered the final blow on the shield generator after destroying its core and a turret guarding it, while repeating soldiers and AT-ARs gave backup by annihilating any remaining resistance.
The blockade in orbit began a piecemeal bombardment of the battlefield after the decisive winning move, knocking down defensive emplacements and fleeing ships.
Snowtroopers were then deployed onto the surface by Imperial soldiers using airmobile tactics.
Rogue Squadron was also redirected to help the other grounded transports and put an end to the bombing runs from multiple TIE Bombers until they were ready to take off.
Lord Vader personally led 501st Legion warriors into Echo Base, slaying everybody who stepped in his path.
They made their way through the base to the back hangar, where the rebels attempted to flee.
The majority of the rebels were successful in escaping, but some had to give their lives for the cause.
Even while the Empire triumphed in this fight, it did so at a cost.
At least one Star Destroyer was momentarily disabled by the orbital-range ion gun, and Rebel defenders destroyed numerous AT-ATs, with more being lost when the dangerous ice floes broke away.
Despite forcing the Rebels to evacuate, the Imperial forces were unable to destroy all of the transports, and Lord Vader failed to capture Luke Skywalker, which he considered the main priority.
The Rebel Alliance suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Hoth.
Thousands of Rebel soldiers and pilots died in the defense of Hoth or were slain when the ships transporting them off the planet were destroyed.
The Rebels were forced to flee once more after losing their base, and they struggled to reassemble their battered forces.
Seventeen of the planet's thirty medium transporters were destroyed, resulting in enormous material and troop casualties.
The Alliance's fighting capabilities were severely reduced by the loss of soldiers and materials, giving the Empire an advantage over the Rebels for a while as they pursued their fleet.
