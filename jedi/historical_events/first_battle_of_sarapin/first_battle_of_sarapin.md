# Section 1

With the asteroid defenses and air support of the Republic force on Krant having been eliminated in an earlier battle above the planet, General Sev’rance Tann had little trouble landing her full army on Sarapin in short order, not far from the massive Republic stronghold home to Sarapin’s main geothermal generators.
As other, more minor facilities across the planet were destroyed by smaller armies, Tann took the bulk of her force and all of her stolen Decimators to eliminate the stronghold.
General Drakas had very poor odds to begin with: the Sarapin stronghold had only recently been retrofitted for war and garrisoned, and the Republic was not expecting a strike so far into the heart of the Core.
He had no starfighters for air support at all, and chose not to use the few remaining troopships on the base for that purpose.
He had little time to muster his army and prepare a hasty defense when Tann began a full frontal attack.
But Drakas was not only outnumbered, but outgunned as well.
The powerful turbolasers on the experimental Decimator tanks melted through the Republic’s defenses, allowing battle droids to pour in and overwhelm the defenders.
Tann personally led the assault on the power generators, and killed Jor Drakas in a duel, the Jedi General’s last-ditch attempt to salvage the battle.
Tann then had the Decimators fire on the geothermal power generators, ending the battle.

# Section 2

Only a few clones were able to escape aboard troopships, and many were shot down either by the orbiting fleet or by Tann’s Decimators.
The battle was a major victory for the Confederacy: not only had Sarapin been captured, but the power generators for several key Core Worlds lay in ruins.
Many blacked out as panic spread.
The Core was no long believed to be safe.
The Decimators, as well, proved successful.
Only one had been destroyed, victim of a concentrated turbolaser bombardment in the battle’s opening stages.
The rest had proven deadly, and had quite literally melted the Republic’s defenses.
Tann left to set up a new Decimator factory on Krant shortly afterwards, leaving Zian Finnis the commander of the garrison left in the ruins of the generator fortress.
