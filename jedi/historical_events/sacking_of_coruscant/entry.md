# Introduction

After the Sith reemerged from the depths of unknown space, they declared war on the whole Republic.
The Sacking of Coruscant was the concluding event of the war.
During the Sacking, the Sith destroyed the Jedi temple and much of the city, killing many key dignitaries, including the assassination of the Supreme Chancellor by the leader of the Sith invasion force Darth Angral.
When Malgus destroyed the Jedi temple, many Jedi were murdered, including six members of the Jedi High Council.
After the Sacking, the Sith forced the Republic to sign the Treaty of Coruscant, declaring that the Republic had thoroughly lost the war.

# Section 1

The Sith plan was to lure the Republic Leadership to a peace conference on Alderaan so the attack could go more smoothly.
Supreme Chancellor Berooken was warned not to go by the Jedi High Council and stayed in his office on Coruscant.
While the politicians of both superpowers were discussing peace, a Mandalorian Force snuck into Coruscant space and disabled the planet's defence systems, leaving it vulnerable to an Imperial attack.

# Section 2

With Coruscantâ€™s defensive network down, Darth Malgus walked into the Jedi temple drawing out the Jedi defenders.
Soon after, a Republic shuttle crashed through the entrance of the Temple, destroying many pillars and from its hatch emerged 50 Sith Warriors.
A large battle ensued that led to many Jedi deaths, including six members of the Jedi High Council.
Several Jedi engaged the Sith in combat; one of note was Master Ven Zallow.
Master Zallow duelled with Darth Malgus and was on par with the Sith Lord until he was impaled by Malgus just as the siege on the City of Coruscant began.
During the battle, most of the Temple was reduced to ruins as many of the Jedi defenders died.
With the Jedi vanquished, the rest of the Sacking could continue unimpeded.

# Section 3

With the Jedi defenders no longer proving an obstacle, Darth Angral laid siege to the Senate building while an orbital bombardment rained overhead, murdering many senators.
The Republic Special Forces and a few Jedi defenders stood their ground against the raiding force fighting hallway to hallway through the Senate building.
Republic troops would take cover in offices and fire on the Sith intruders from cover, killing a few of them, but as the Sith and imperial numbers grew, the defenders were overrun and defeated.
Supreme Chancellor Berooken managed to make his way to his office.
He contacted the Republic delegation on Alderaan and tried to warn them as Darth Angral destroyed his wall and beheaded the Chancellor while his delegation watched in horror.

# Section 4

Imperial dreadnaughts fired on both civilian and military buildings during the battle, killing tens of thousands of civilians and turning the cityscape into rubble.
After the Supreme Chancellors' death and the hands of Darth Angral, the Empire declared victory and set up a blockade and an occupying force to subjugate the people.
For two days, The Empire ruled Coruscant with their iron fist.
During the battle, the Empire destroyed all of Coruscant's communication satellites, cutting off the planet's ability to call for help.
During the occupation, the Empire enforced rations.
The Sith forces also commandeered a Hospital to make sure imperial forces were treated first so they could be sent to the medical facilities on the orbiting ships.
Soon after his successful raid on the Jedi Temple, Darth Malgus was sent to the Blockade fleet to command it.
A young Jedi who was part of the Alderaan delegation felt her Master's death and decided to rush to Coruscant to confirm her suspensions.
Aryn Leneer was the Padawan of Master Ven Zallow.
She didn't ask for permission to leave the delegation and was declared a deserter by both sides.
Darth Angral informed Malgus of her impending arrival, telling him to treat her like any common Spice-runner.
Padawan Leneer arrived at the Coruscant and tried to run it.
The ship she was travelling on was destroyed but not before she jumped out and free fell into the lower city, using her force powers to slow her descent.
In her search for Malgus, she found his Twilek companion; Leneer spared the Twileks life and headed for the Ruins of the Jedi temple to find the body of her Master.
Darth Malgus followed her to the temple, and the two duelled.
Leneer is ultimately defeated when Malgus shot her with Force Lightning.
The young Padawan survived as Malgus spared her life for showing mercy to his Twilek companion.

# Section 5

During the battle, the Sith Lord Baras was holding phoney peace talks, but these broke down when the Republic delegation received a communication from Coruscant from the Supreme Chancellor, warning them that it was a trap.
The delegation then watched as their leader's head was removed through the expert use of a lightsaber.
Baras then started laying down the terms of the Republic's surrender.
He presented them with a document that was very biased towards the Empire.
He convinced the delegation of Senators and Jedi that they had no other choice but to sign the treaty.
This document became The Treaty of Coruscant and ended the war with a decisive Imperial victory.
