# Introduction

The First Jedi Purge was conducted at the end of the Jedi Civil War from 3954 BBY to 3951 BBY, being led by the Sith Triumvirate, a group of 3 Sith Lords (Darth Traya, Darth Nihilus, and Darth Sion) that commanded the remainder of Revan’s Sith Empire.

Throughout the Purge, the Jedi Order fell apart, with most of the Order’s members being defeated, and those who did survive being hunted down and slaughtered.
The Jedi Temples were abandoned, with all remaining Jedi fleeing for their lives.
Many well-known Jedi Masters were defeated in the purge, including Master Dorak and Master Kavar.

# Section 1

With the Jedi Order suffering through The Great Sith War, The Mandalorian Wars, and the Jedi Civil War, less than one-hundred members still lived and served for the Order, making it extremely difficult for them to rebuild, especially since a tremendous amount of Jedi Knowledge stored in libraries and holocrons had been destroyed, lost or stolen during the wars, meaning there were few Jedi knowledgeable enough to teach future generations.

Even before the Purge, both the Jedi Order and Galactic Republic were at the edge of corruption after the wars.
The Jedi began questioning their teachings and wondering why so many of them had fallen to the dark side in recent times,  as well as feeling anger and resentment towards the citizens of the Republic, who had begun fearing them.

# Section 2

Despite Darth Malak being defeated along with the Star Forge and the Sith Empire, Revan’s Sith assassins still lived on, now serving the Sith Triumvirate at the Trayus Sith Academy on Malachor V.
Using the Jedi’s current stage of weakness as an advantage, the Triumvirate planned a war on the Jedi, aiming for the Order to be completely exterminated.

Throughout this time, many Jedi gatherings started vanishing, which left a disturbance in the Force that was felt by members of the Council.
At first, they suspected they were being haunted, but after this continued, Jedi Master Atris requested the presence of the most powerful of the remaining Jedi Masters at a secret conclave on Katarr in order to discuss this new threat.
However, in Atris’s attempt to lure the enemies out of the shadows, information was leaked as to the conclaves' location, which led Darth Nihilus to the location on Katarr.
The Lord of Hunger then completely annihilated almost every living thing on the planet using Force Drain, with the exception of Visas Marr, whom Nihilus took on as an apprentice and trained her in the ways of the dark side of the Force.
The Jedi that were not at the conclave at the time of Nihilus’s deadly attack all went into exile.
One of the Jedi Masters that went into exile, Vrook Lamar, stated that “it is unlike any war we have fought before—we have yet to even meet our attackers in battle.
Somehow our enemy is targeting us through the Force, striking, then retreating to the shadows.
The gathering of any Jedi seems to attract them like a beacon.”

# Section 3

By the final year of the Purge, there were only a few survivors.
Known as the Jedi Exile, Meetra Surik, who had been cast out of the Jedi Order for following Revan to battle, was one of these few survivors.
The Republic Admiral Carth Onasi ordered a ship “The Harbinger '' to pick up Surik from the Outer Rim where she had been living, whilst on their way to Onderon.
Soon after, while The Harbinger set course for Telos IV, Onasi’s home planet, the crew received a distress signal from a nearby ship and was ordered to assist the stranded vessel.
Once The Harbinger arrived at the site, the captain discovered two ships, the Ebon Hawk and a Sith Warship.
Both were adrift, seemingly deserted.
A boarding crew entered both the Ebon Hawk and the warship after The Harbinger had attached to them.
Matching how it looked, the Sith warship seemed to be completely abandoned, but with an eerie feeling about it.
Then, a shocking discovery on this ship was the body of Darth Sion, assumed to be dead.
The boarding crew brought Sion’s corpse aboard their ship, and even though he was assumed dead, many mysterious things kept happening, such as crew members suddenly dying.

Things only got worse for the crew of The Harbinger, as Darth Sion awoke, and his Sith assassins that secretly boarded the ship started murdering the Republic Officers that were aboard.
Despite it taking barely any time for The Harbinger to be completely under Sith control, in the fraction of time that the Sith were distracted, the Ebon Hawk docked with The Harbinger, taking Meetra Surik aboard, and then jumping to hyperspace.

# Section 4

When Surik awoke from being unconscious, she found herself in a mining facility on Peragus II, along with an older woman, who later revealed herself as Jedi Master Kreia.
Together, Surik and Kreia guided their way out of the lifeless facility, only to be discovered yet again by Darth Sion, who had followed them to the planet aboard The Harbinger.
The two Jedi boarded the Ebon Hawk, and attempted to make an escape to Telos IV, however after being pursued by the Sith in The Harbinger, an explosion caused by the ignition of fuel around an asteroid field both deterred the Ebon Hawk and completely destroyed the planet.
Both the Ebon Hawk and the Harbinger survived the explosion, however, and were able to make an escape.

After arriving on Telos, the crew of the Ebon Hawk were captured by Jedi Master Atris, who controlled the aqueduct system they were in.
On release, the droid aboard the Ebon Hawk, T3-M4 revealed that they had been able to download the Jedi Master’s database and navigational charts, including the location of the remaining Jedi Masters who had gone into exile after Nihilus’s attack on Katarr.
Atris, as the crew knew, was on Telos.
Jedi Master Kavarr was on Onderon, Master Vrook Lamar on Dantooine, Master Ell on Nar Shaddaa, and Master Vash on the Sith planet of Korriban.

# Section 5

Surik, Kreia, and T3 traveled to each of these planets to reunite the Jedi Masters to fight the Sith, and to re-address her banishment from the Order.

First, Surik traveled to Dantooine in search of Jedi Master Vrook Lamar, and on arrival, she found out that Lamar had been detained by mercenaries.
Surik searched for Lamar and eventually found him.
Surik also assisted the new government Khoonda in defeating the mercenaries, before taking the Jedi Master to the Jedi Enclave on the planet.

Next stop for Surik was Nar Shaddaa, in search of Jedi Master Zez-Kai Ell.
Straight after arriving on the planet, Surik had bounty hunters chasing after her and was eventually captured.
However, another bounty hunter called Mira assisted Surik in her escape, and the Jedi was forced to temporarily leave the planet.

Upon Surik's re-arrival on the planet, she located the Jedi Master, and after having her questions answered and being taught a lightsaber form, Surik took the Master to Dantooine to wait with Master Vrook.

Surik then arrived on Onderon to look for Jedi Master Kavarr.
After befriending the Mandalorians and assisting in a Civil War, Surik eventually got Master Kavarr on Dantooine, whilst she went out in search of the final remaining Jedi Master.

As soon as Surik touched down on the surface of Korriban, she was informed that the Jedi Master she was looking for had been murdered just moments ago, by the Sith Lord Darth Sion.
While on the planet, Surik also encountered the Sith Lord.
During their duel, Surik slashed Sion many times, however the Lord of Pain utilized his hatred, being able to heal himself.
Eventually, Kreia telepathically communicated with Surik, informing her this was a battle she could not win, so Surik fled the battle and returned to Dantooine and the Jedi Masters that awaited her arrival.

However, after the Jedi gathered together to reconsider the Exile’s banishment, they came to the decision to renew the banishment, and they froze her still in order to strip the Jedi of her powers.
Before they could do that however, Kreia revealed herself to be Darth Traya, the leader of the Sith Triumvirate, and she drained both the Force and the life out of the Jedi Masters.
Traya then fled, leaving Surik depleted on the planet, surrounded by 3 dead Jedi Masters.

# Section 6

Surik then traveled to Telos in search of Traya.
Surik again encountered Jedi Master Atris, who had been corrupted by the dark side of the Force.
After Surik defeated her and convinced her to let go of her pain, Atris informed her of Traya’s location, Malachor V.
Atris then labeled herself as an ex-Jedi, and once again went into exile.

Before Surik could leave Telos, the Lord of Hunger Darth Nihilus appeared in his ship The Ravager.
Surik allied with the Mandalorians Canderous Ordo, and they engaged him.
Nihilus attempted to drain Surik of her Force energy but failed, and tired himself out.
However, Surik and Nihilus then engaged each other in battle, with Nihilus looking too strong for the Exile.
Nihilus then stunned Surik, allowing for a final, deadly blow to the Exile.
However, to Nihilus’s surprise, his apprentice, Visas Marr, offered her life in exchange for Surik’s.
This stalled Nihilus just long enough for Surik to recover.
Marr then disrupted her link with her Master, which weakened Nihilus enough, so that he could be defeated.

Surik was then able to travel to Malachor V, in order to defeat the Sith.
While entering the Trayus Academy, Surik battled past many Sith Warriors and assassins, eventually coming face to face with Darth Sion.
After a lengthy and complex duel, Surik persuaded Sion to let go of his hatred, as Traya was just using him.
Sion eventually obliged, letting go of his anger, resulting in his death from multiple injuries.

Making her way to the Trayus Core, Surik stood before Darth Trayus, the only remaining Lord of the Triumvirate.
After a harsh battle, the Exile defeated Traya, but spared her life.
Traya however, who refused to give up, attacked Surik again, and was again defeated.
Traya was redeemed from the dark side, and told Surik where she could find Revan, right before she gave herself to the Force.

# Section 7

The Jedi Order began to rebuild, with Marr, Surik, and many other Jedi survivors scattered throughout the galaxy leading the way.
