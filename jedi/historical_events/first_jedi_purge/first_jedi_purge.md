# Introduction
The Jedi Civil War took a huge toll on the Jedi and the Republic, leaving them incredibly vulnerable to attack.
In the wake of the war, the High Council called a conclave on the planet Katarr to regroup and refocus the Order.
It was at this conclave that Darth Nihilus, a member of the Sith Triumvirate, attacked the world and wiped all life from the planet's surface.
The attack on the conclave would see the near-destruction and death of the Order, with all but a hundred individual Jedi surviving throughout the galaxy.
Immediately after, Triumvir Darth Sion committed his legions of Sith assassins to hunt down the surviving Jedi in the First Jedi Purge.
Realizing that the threat was greater when Jedi gathered in numbers, the surviving members of the High Council disbanded the Order, with the remaining Jedi Masters going into hiding on planets across the galaxy in the hopes that this would allow them to discover the true origins of the new Sith threat without endangering everyone around them.
The Jedi Temple on Coruscant was completely abandoned, and the badly damaged Jedi Enclave on Dantooine was left nothing but a hollow shell.

# Section 1
A former Jedi, Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile who had been cut off from the Force and exiled by the High Council years earlier, sought out the remaining Councilors who were in hiding, in an attempt to form a group to defeat the threat of the Sith Triumvirate, who were threatening to annihilate the Jedi completely.
As she traveled the galaxy in search of the hidden Jedi, Surik trained several of her companions in the ways of the Force.
She found Vrook Lamar on Dantooine, Zez-Kai Ell on Nar Shaddaa, and Kavar on Onderon.
The three former Councilors then met with Surik once again in the rebuilt Jedi Enclave on Dantooine.
They decided to once again exile her, as well as sever her completely from the Force, as they felt she was a threat to all living beings around her.
As they attempted to carry out their plan, Kreia, Surik's mentor, killed them, and after revealing herself as the third Sith Lord, Darth Traya, she left Surik on Dantooine.
Surik's revival corresponded with the Sith attack on the Republic, and she traveled to Telos IV to fight the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus.
Surik defeated Nihilus on his flagship above Telos, before traveling to Malachor V to kill Darths Traya and Sion, the two remaining Sith Lords.



# Section 2
Eventually, the group of individuals Surik trained, known as the Lost Jedi, would, as Darth Traya prophesied, come together to re-establish another Jedi Order.
As the Order was slowly reformed, Surik was able to convince Masters Shan and Atris to return to Coruscant and the abandoned Jedi Temple there and slowly rebuild.
Training a new generation of Jedi, Surik reestablished the High Council with the assistance of her companions from the war, and the Order and the Galactic Republic began the long, slow process of rebuilding.
Within time, Surik saw the Jedi Order flourish once more, but was haunted by reoccurring dreams and a beckoning from beyond known space.
Leaving the Republic and the Order behind, Surik departed Coruscant to search for Master Revan and the darkness he had sought to find beyond the galactic rim.
