# Introduction

Kashyyyk was located in the Mid-Rim territories.
As well as that, it was located on the Kashyyyyk system and the Mytaranor sector.
Kashyyyk has a 26-hour rotation period and a 381 orbital period, and the planet Kashyyyk has three moons.

This significant battle was named the Battle of Kashyyyk during the New Sith Wars.
This war had started due to a disagreement between the Galactic Republic and the Brotherhood of Darkness.
Due to the fact that this disagreement happened, the Brotherhood of the Darkness wanted to take over the Wookie world, known as Kashyyyk.

# Section 1

Troops were entering the planet of Kashyyyk wave after wave, by the Sith.
The Galactic Republic had major disadvantages in the number of troops; however, they were set on not allowing themselves to get rid of it.
Once the Sith’s fleet first landed on the planet of Kashyyyk, the Galactic Republic decided to hide inside the Wroshyr forests along with all of their forces.
The Sith troopers have never fought on treetops; due to this, they were not as good at fighting on them.
The Galactic Republic soldiers and the Wookie guides used the kshyy vines to hide behind them as they were tall vines.
Thousands of the Sith soldiers were being murdered and even died without being able to see the enemy.
The Sith masters did not care, and they still sent more troops into the maelstrom.

# Section 2

The second wave of reinforcements included a batch called the ‘Gloom Walkers.’ which was commanded by Lieutenant Ulabore.
The Gloom Walkers were separated from the rest of the reinforcements and the main lines of the battle taking place and ended up being behind the enemy lines.
There was a man named Dessel who was one of them.
He was also force sensitive, so he was able to see the locations of the enemies even though he could not see them, due to this the Gloom Walkers were not falling for the Galactic Republic’s traps.
It took three to four days and nights for the Gloom Walkers to return to the Sith’s forces.
The Gloom Walker’s story became very famous in the Sith army, and most people remembered it.
It took around two thousand units; however, the Sith finally won the battle and captured Kashyyyk.

# Section 3

Once the planet of Kashyyyk fell to the Sith, the remaining Republic troops went to the world of Trandosha to escape from the Sith.
Once the Sith found out about this, they sent twenty units and the Gloom Walkers in pursuit.
Because of this, the ‘Battle of Hsskhor’ had begun.
