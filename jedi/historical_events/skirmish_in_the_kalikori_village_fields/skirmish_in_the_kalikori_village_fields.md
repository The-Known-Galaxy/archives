# Introduction
Near the end of the Cold War, in the year 3643 BBY, the Flesh Raiders began attacking in great numbers on their homeworld Tython.
The Jedi Order discovered that Jedi Master Orgus Din's former Padawan, who went missing over a decade ago during the Sacking of Coruscant, was the facilitator of the Raider's invasion.
Din’s new apprentice was given an objective to disable a shield generator that belonged to the Flesh Raiders, with the shield generator now disabled, a team of Jedi could move in to attack the Flesh Raiders command base.

Din’s Padawan was contacted by Bengel Morr shortly after he disabled the field generator, and he was warned about how Bengel planned to attack the Jedi Order.
Now worried about Morr’s plans, the apprentice was eager to get back to the village to find master Din so that he could warn him.

# Section 1
A lot has happened while the Jedi was away, Ranna Tao’Ven has greeted the Jedi with some news of her mother’s passing.
With this news, Ranna Tao’Ven was now the leader of the Pilgrims.
Before Ranna could discuss Orgus’s whereabouts, a young villager has rushed in to warn about another attack by the Flesh Raiders.
This attack led to the enemy leaving toxin mines that would poison the village, as well as the crops and fields.
Ranna would then seek the help of the apprentice, because of the belief that the Force could protect the Jedi long enough to take out the mines.

The Padawan agreed and with that being said, the Padawan would start to focus on his breathing, and connecting with the Force.
The Padawan was able to stop the poisonous effects left by the mines, however, many Flesh Raiders buried themselves underground to catch the Jedi by surprise and hopefully stop the Padawan from continuing.
Luckily, the Padawan was able to keep cool under pressure and the Jedi were able to defeat the Flesh Raiders, saving the town and crops from further harm.



# Section 2
When the Padawan returned to the Matriarch building, there were many thanks given, especially by Tao’Ven, who would give him and the Jedi a token of appreciation by the village.
The Padawan then received contact from his master, Master Din via.
Master Din was informed that the Flesh Raiders were defeated, with that, he was relieved and thankful that his former apprentice did not turn to the dark side as well.
Now the Padawan would get a new assignment and be told by his master that he would travel to the planet Kaleth.
When the Padawan arrived, he would receive orders to take out the command base since he had already defeated some of the natives that had been based on that camp.
