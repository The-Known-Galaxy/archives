The “Fall of the Old Republic,” also known as the dark age, was a prolonged decline of the galactic government during the era of the Old Republic.
As the Old Republic weakened, the galaxy entered a dark age.
This dark age ended with the apparent defeat of the Sith and the reorganization of the Republic.
