# Introduction

The climax of the Clone Wars was the Battle of Coruscant, one of the largest battles in galactic history.
As the Clone Wars were beginning to end in the Galactic Republic’s favor, the Confederacy of Independent Systems launched an attack on the Republic’s capital of Coruscant to turn the tide of the war.
With Venator Class Star Destroyers coming desperately to box in the separatist fleet, many Jedi leaders participated in the battle, including Jedi Master Mace Windu, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Master Shaak Ti, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Grandmaster Yoda, and many more.
This battle would be a decisive battle that could have been in either side’s favor.
However, it did result in victory for the Republic and the death of Count Dooku, the head of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

# Section 1

As the Clone Wars raged on, the Confederacy of Independent Systems was pushed out of the core worlds to the Outer Rim.
The war was leaning in the Republic’s favor, as Chancellor Palpatine even sent some of the core world’s defense fleets to the Outer Rim to assist republic forces.
With most of the political elite on Coruscant at the time, no one could have expected a Separatist invasion, as Coruscant was in the Deep Core Region of the Galaxy, and fleets would have been identified before they could reach the capital.
With a secret hyperspace lane being given by Lord Sidious himself, the separatist rallied the largest fleet seen in the Clone Wars, composed of thousands of ships.
The attack was under the command of General Grievous with his flagship, “The Invisible Hand.” With the Coruscant Defense Fleet still relatively still composed of a great number of Venator Star Destroyers and frigates, the Separatist caught the Republic forces off guard and broke through the fleet unleashing droid forces down on the surface of Coruscant.

With a desperate move to stop the invasion force, the Republic Defense Fleet made a protective screen, and a large orbital battle raged on between the two fleets.
With the orbital battle being filled with chaos, hell broke out on the surface, as hundreds of millions of battle droids, armored units, and bombers were causing massive panic in the population.
As a lack of communications caused an absence of riot control, evacuation, and emergency response, vulture droids were raining from the sky targeting buildings and landing kamikaze attacks.
Luckily for the Republic, with battle analytics, the Republic was able to get communications back online after learning the Separatist forces used a similar tactic in the Battle of Praesitlyn.
This allowed the Jedi to lead the Grand Army of the Republic to defend the planet of Coruscant, as Jedi Master Saesee Tiin, Jedi Master Mace Windu, and 22 Jedi pilots all took off to the orbital battle.
Master Window was shot down before making it to orbit but reinforced Grandmaster Yoda and assisted in leading ground forces against millions of droids.
However, Jedi like Master Tiin broke through and assisted in the orbital battle that raged amongst thousands of ships.
The Jedi pilots were also able to send a transmission to the Outer Rim Sieges of the battle, which allowed the Republic to send reinforcements.

# Section 3

With the Venator Class Star Destroyer, “The Impavid,” being at the brink of destruction, General Tiin led a battalion of jet troopers to take an enemy cruiser.
As this was happening, Grandmaster Yoda, Master Window, and ARC-77 (Fordo) made significant progress on the surface.
They noticed that the Separatist forces weren’t pushing towards the temple or senate building.
Rather, it was a diversion to capture the Supreme Chancellor.
Jedi Masters Shaak Ti, Roron Corobb, Stass Allie, and Foul Moudama were sent to secure the Chancellor’s safety but were soon chased by General Grievous himself.
Stass Allie and a few royal guards were able to hold Grievous off but were soon dealt with as Grievous continued to pursue the Chancellor.
The chase went on to the Maglev Train Station, where the Jedi were able to lose Grievous for a while.
This allowed Master Shaak Ti to regroup with Jedi Masters Stass Allie, Mace Windu, and Kit Fisto, where they sent Chancellor Palpatine to another district.
Jedi Masters Roth-Del Masona and B’ink Utrila would reinforce Corobb and Moudama in securing the Chancellor.
Masters Fisto and Windu joined the battle.
However, General Grievous was able to land near the Chancellor, killing the four Jedi protecting him.
While Master Allie notified Windu and Fisto of the situation, Shaak Ti tried to stop Grievous from escaping, not before being neutralized.
Master Windu arrives just as Grievous is escorting the Chancellor on a shuttle and wounds Grievous using Force.
However, Grievous was able to escape with the Chancellor.
Jedi Masters Windu, Fisto, Agen Kolar, Pablo-Jill, and many pilots pursued Grievous in a last-ditch effort to save the Chancellor but were unsuccessful, having Jedi Master Pablo-Jill and Jedi Knight L’lacielo Sageon being caught in “The Invisible Hand’s” tractor beam.
The two Jedi were then slaughtered, and their bodies dumped into space, as Grievous announced to a live HoloNet transmission on the capture of Palpatine and how the Republic will soon burn.

# Section 4

The tide of the battle would soon change, as a massive force of Spaarti Clones from Centax-2 were deployed to assist the Jedi on the ground forces.
Fleets from the Outer Rim Sieges, Open Circle Armanda, and new secret fleets with Imperator-Class Star Destroyers appeared out of hyperspace as they cut off the Separatist from escaping with the Chancellor.
This caused the remaining separatist ships to defend “The Invisible Hand,” and the final stages of the Battle of Coruscant were almost to a conclusion.
Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker made their way into “The Invisible Hand.” As they infiltrated the ship, they engaged the head of the Separatists, Count Dooku.
Count Dooku was defeated and executed by Skywalker, and the two Jedi successfully rescued the Chancellor.
Grievous and remaining Separatist remnants were left in disgrace, and the Battle of Coruscant was a major victory for the Galactic Republic.
