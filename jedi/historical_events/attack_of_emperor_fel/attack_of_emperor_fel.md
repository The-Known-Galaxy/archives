# Introduction
The Galactic Empire saw the Yuuzhan Vong terraforming project as a failure.
Around 127 ABY, The project was an effort to restore planets that had been damaged during the Yuuzhan Vong War.
However, many things went wrong on the planets where the project took place, and because of this many mutations were occurring.
The empire’s knowledge about the Yuuzhan Vong War was not forgotten, and this only made them angry.
The empire would declare war on the Galactic Alliance, which supported the Ossus project for a new Jedi Order.

Until a year into the war, the Empire was performing poorly; it wasn’t until the Sith Order emerged and offered their assistance.
Thanks to the help of the Sith, the tide started to turn.
However, the sith would cause the Ossus project to fail as well as make an alliance offer to Grand Admiral Morlish Veed and Moff Nyna Calixte.
Veed assumed that the sith were talking about him and his lover when they said that they would replace Emperor Fel with someone far stronger.
Veed and his lover accepted because of this, as for the Moff Council was manipulated into accepting the sith’s deal.

# Section 1
Upon the surrender in 130 ABY, Darth Maladi met with Moff Calixte and Admiral Veed, and the time had come for the removal of Fel from his throne.
The meeting was set into Fel’s schedule with the Moffs; however, Calixte had second thoughts and feared that the sith would name their leader, Darth Krayt, the new Emperor.
Calixte warned Fel in secret, informing him that the sith intended to kill him.
Fel decided to place a double on the throne during the meeting.



# Section 2
Fel and the Moffs started the meeting ahead of schedule discussing the terms of the alliance’s surrender.
Halfway through the conference, Darths Krayt, Maladi, Nihi, and Wyyrlok arrived.
Fel’s decoy was curious, so he asked what reward the sith wanted for their assistance in war, Krayt responded with, “The Emperor’s life”, in which Fel’s Imperial Knight bodyguards moved to protect Fel’s double.
They were no match for the sith and quickly disposed of.
Mohrgan Fel and Fel’s other protectors were also killed quickly.
Darth Krayt then killed Fel’s decoy and declared himself emperor.
With the war now over, Krayt stated that he would put his grand vision into action.


Krayt was quick to realize that the man he killed was not Fel, as he was skilled in the force and in lightsaber combat, where Fel’s double did little to nothing to defend himself.
Krayt would send Maladi to visit Calixte, accusing her of informing Fel of the Imminent attack.
Before leaving, Maladi would threaten Calixte, telling the Moff that she now served the Sith Lord.
Krayt would proclaim that Fel is a fugitive from Imperial justice, and his agents began looking for him.
For the next several years Fel and those who would remain loyal to him would launch hit and run attacks on the Krayt Empire.
