# Introduction
The Battle of Hsskhor was one of the many battles that were fought during a time known as the New Sith Wars.
Taking place in 1003 BBY, this battle involved the Galactic Republic and the Brotherhood of Darkness, which sought to eliminate all the Republic’s forces on the planet of Trandosha.

# Section 1
As a result of previous battles with the Brotherhood, the Republic was forced to retreat to the capital city of Hsskhor on the planet Trandosha.
Eventually, the Brotherhood’s forces caught up to the hiding Republic soldiers and engaged in combat with them.
The battle between them was brutal, with lots of casualties on both sides and with no end to the battle in sight, both the Republic and Brotherhood were forced to halt the fight and regroup with each other.
During the nighttime, the Republic encountered a tribe of Trandoshans that felt threatened by the battle between them.
As a result, the Trandoshans intervened and ambushed both the Republic and Brotherhood’s forces, with half of their forces now deceased.
However, the Brotherhood later got reinforcements from Kashyyk and were able to massacre both the Natives and the Republic’s forces alike, which forced the Trandoshans to side with the Brotherhood to prevent them from burning down their villages.



# Section 2
As a result, the Republic’s troops were all massacred within a week, which made the Brotherhood the victors of the Battle of Hsskhor.
Unfortunately, the city of Hsskhor did not survive the conflict and was all but destroyed, and it took the city one thousand years for it to rebuild to its former glory.
