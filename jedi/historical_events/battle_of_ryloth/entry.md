# Introduction

The Battle of Ryloth, also known as the Ryloth campaign, was a war with the Galactic Republic and the Twi’lek Resistance facing off against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, taking place on the planet of Ryloth, which was the homeworld of the Twi’lek species.

# Section 1

The Battle of Ryloth began with the Confederacy of Independent Systems launching an invasion force enough to overrun the defensive fleet commanded by Admiral Dao.
The CIS, specifically Executive Council Member Wat Tambor, was interested in the planet for its resources and location in the Correlian Run.
Nonetheless, the invasion force faced resistance from the local Twi’lek Freedom Fighters, led by Cham Syndulla, and the Outer Rim Garrison consisting of Clone Captain Keeli and Jedi General Ima Gun Di.
Although the combined efforts of the local Twi’lek Freedom Fighters and Outer Rim Garrison were valiant, the overwhelming amount of separatist droid forces allowed the CIS to push the resistance into hiding and the garrison to be wiped out, including Jedi General Ima Gun Di.
While The Outer Rim Garrison was completely destroyed after a final stand, their actions were not in vain as they allowed the resistance to retreat far enough to get republic supplies dropped by a blockade runner, thanks to the efforts of Senator Bail Organa.

# Section 2

The Republic’s response after many calls for support from the inhabitants and Ryloth was the liberation force led by three Jedi Generals.
These Jedi Generals consist of Master Obi Wan Kenobi, Master Mace Windu, and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker.
General Skywalker and Admiral Yularen were in charge of the space battle to break the blockade.
Although General Skywalker and Admiral Yularen suffered the loss of two venator class Star Destroyers, they destroyed the separatist blockade and Padawan Ahsoka Tano developed a maneuver called the Mog Sabel Maneuver, that would go on to be important in future space battles, specifically noted by Grand Admiral Thrawn in the Galactic Empire.
With the blockade being destroyed and the liberation force cleared to enter the atmosphere, they suffered harsh resistance from land-based proton cannons stationed at a village, near a landing site they needed in order to deploy the rest of the ground troops.
The 212th Attack Battalion sent the Ghost Company, led by Jedi General Kenobi and Marshal Clone Commander Cody, to clear the landing site and destroy the proton cannons.
This effort was successful and General Windu was able to land their acclamator class Star Destroyers to deploy the rest of the liberation force.
After many operations, the final operation of Ryloth was conducted by General Windu, grouping with the local Twi’lek resistance to do a final charge on the capital where Separatist leader Wat Tambor was located.
The final charge was successful leading to the capture of Wat Tambor and the final liberation of Ryloth, bringing it back into Republic Control.
