# Introduction

The Battle of Jedha took place on the moon of Jedha in 382 BBY, involving fighting factions from the planets Eiram and E’ronoh, diverse Force-worshiping cults in the Holy City of Jedha, the Jedi Order, and the Galactic Republic.
The battle broke out during a summit to sign a peace treaty between Eiram and E’ronoh, organized by the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic.
Due to mistrust between the planets and riots caused by the extremist cult Path of the Open Hand, the summit turned into a full-blown conflict between the Eirami and E’roni forces on Jedha, with cults also involved in the fighting.

# Section 1

In the years 387 BBY to 382 BBY, planets Eiram and E’ronoh, located within the Outer Rim Territories, were engaged in a long-lasting conflict dubbed the “forever war.” After an undecided cease-fire, the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order organized a summit between the leaders of both planets to end the war.
The peace would be sealed by the marriage of Prince Phan-tu Zenn of Eiram and Princess Xiri A’lbaran of E’ronoh.
However, the wedding was attacked by forces, including the terrorist group Children of E’ronoh and the cult, Path of the Open Hand, who desired to continue the war.
The attack was thwarted, and the planets decided to proceed with the treaty, which would be signed on the holy moon of Jedha.
Due to the destruction caused by the war, the prince and princess decided to oversee rebuilding efforts on their planets, and their ambassadors, Lain Cerox of Eiram and Tintak of E’ronoh, were sent to represent them at the summit.
The summit took place in the Second Spire, an old temple refitted for the occasion, with the Guardians of the Whills serving as guards.
Both delegations arrived with large fleets to show their strength, causing concern among the Jedi overseeing the event.
Jedi Master Creighton Sun watched over Ambassador Cerox, while Jedi Knight Aida Forte tended to Ambassador Tintak.
Morton San Tekka, a member of the San Tekka Clan, was appointed as the mediator for the proceedings.

# Section 2

Existing tensions between various Force cults were heightened by the presence of fleets from both planets.
The Path of the Open Hand, a cult from Dalna, protested against the use of the Force, seeking membership in the Convocation of the Force.
The Convocation planned the Festival of Balance, leading to artifact thefts and more tension.
Vigilante Tey Sirrek noticed the thefts but got involved in a confrontation with a Jedi Padawan.
The Path sought the Rod of Daybreak to control the Nameless, a dangerous species preying on Force-sensitives.
They aimed to petition the Convocation for change.

# Section 3

During the signing ceremony, a bomb exploded, killing mediator Morton San Tekka.
The Jedi and Guardians of the Whills attempted to find the culprits but faced conflicting accounts, pointing fingers at different factions.
Republic Chairperson Meldan appointed Tilson Graf as the new mediator, unaware that he was secretly working for the Path of the Open Hand.
Jedi Master Silandra Sho was asked by Creighton Sun to investigate the bombing.
She teamed up with Keth Cerepath and visited different cults on Jedha, including the Path of the Open Hand, where patients provided confusing information.
Meanwhile, the Brotherhood of the Ninth Door collaborated with Graf.
After the bombing, Tey Sirrek, the Jedi, and the Guardians of the Whills investigated missing artifacts, leading to a confrontation with Sirrek and the Guardians.
An explosion occurred during their encounter.

# Section 4

After speaking with Jedi Knight Gella Nattai, Creigton suspected that Axel Greylark may have been involved with the Path of the Open Hand in their attempt to sabotage the peace process and the royal wedding.
Silantra visited the Path’s leader, The Mother to investigate this claim but feels ill in her presence.
The Herald of the Path petitioned the Convocation of the Force to ban the use of the Force, leading to a heated confrontation.
Later, while leaving Enlightenment, Silandra and Keth are attacked by an individual on a speeder.
The Herald gives an inflammatory speech to a crowd, inciting riots in the city.
The riots reach the Second Spire, where the signing ceremony was taking place, resulting in the Battle of Jedi as the conflict escalates between Eiram and E’ronoh forces.

# Section 5

During the firefight in the spire, Creighton and Forte assisted Ambassador Cerox’s escape.
The streets of Jedha were engulfed in riots, and the Jedi faced attacks from angry rioters.
Sun called for reinforcements, while Forte rallied the Guardians of the Whills to protect the citizens.
Silantra was stalked by the Leveler during the chaos but was saved by Keth Cerepath’s droid.
The riot escalated, and heavy forces from Eiram and E’ronoh engaged in all-out war.
Forte and the Guardians tackled weaponized mining loaders, while Sun and Mesook faced Eiram’s enforcer droids.

# Section 6

Silanta and Cerepath investigated Cerepaths’ droid, P3-7A’s databank, which revealed that a member of the Brotherhood of the Ninth Door was behind the bombing.
Silantra decided to protect the citizens of Jedha from the ongoing battle while Cerepath led them to safety.
Later, they confronted the Brotherhood at the Dome of Deliverance.
Silandra fought and defeated the members, but Keth Cerepath sacrificed himself to save her and kill the last Brother.

# Section 7

During the battle, a statue of a Jedi known as the Final Protector was taken down by rioters using ropes and explosives.
Jedi Master Leebon and Oliviah Zeveron tried to stop them but arrived too late.
Creighton Sun and Mesook witnessed the statue's fall, which deeply affected them.
Mesook was killed by Eirami enforcer droids, prompting Sun to intercept the converging Eirami and E'roni forces in the central square.
A force of Jedi and Republic peacekeeping troops arrived as reinforcements, and Sun's speech convinced many soldiers to stand down and return to their ships, ending the battle.
Maz Kanata's pirate crew and Jedi Padawan Sav Malagán also participated in the battle.
A Spiral-class Viz-Core Eviscerator starfighter also played a role, but production of the model was later shut down and banned by the Galactic Republic.

# Section 8

After the battle, Ambassador Cerox decides to continue fighting the E'roni against the heirs' wishes.
The communication system between Eiram and E'ronoh was destroyed again, and the pirates targeted both planets during the chaos.
Creighton Sun and Aida Forte planned a mission to Dalna to investigate the Path of the Open Hand's involvement in the battle.
Chancellor Greylark considered blockading hyperspace to protect neighboring regions from the chaos.
Silandra visited Enlightenment and shared the tale of Keth Cerepath's heroism and sacrifice with Moona, Piralli, and Kradon.

# Section 9

In 232 BBY, Maz Kanata and Sav Malagán reminisced about the Battle of Jedha and their long friendship while going through old stuff in Takodana Castle.
In 0 BBY, the remains of the fallen statue of the Protector from the Battle of Jedha still laid outside Jedha City.
However, in the same year, the Galactic Empire destroyed the city and most of the moon using the Death Star superweapon.
