# Introduction
Not long after the Republic had turned into the Galactic Empire and the events of the Siege of Mandalore, remaining Clone forces were used to start an occupation of the planet.
However, some Mandalorians including Bo-Katan Kryze, refused to serve under Imperial rule and quickly began to stand against the Emperor’s rule.
 To counter this rebellious act, the Empire orchestrated Gar Saxon to be the new governor of Mandalore.
While a good number of clans still stood with Kryze, the devastating events of the siege had weakened many warriors, causing them to support and join Gar Saxon.
At that point the Empire had claimed Mandalore as theirs while some still continued to fight against their rule.

# Section 1
Years later, while the Empire was still in control of the planet and the houses, a young student at an Imperial academy came up with plans for a new type of a weapon that could be used against the remaining rebellious Mandalorians.
The student, Sabine Wren, began working on her new project.
This weapon was designed to target anyone that wore beskar.
The Duchess, as she was going to name it, could vaporize any Mandalorians that got its range and leave nothing but ashes behind, while dealing no damage to Imperial forces.
After the Empire turned it against her people, realizing what she had done, Wren proceeded to disable the weapon, but was forced to flee the system as her own clan and family stood with the Empire, against her.



# Section 2
After devastating losses and many attempts to conquer Mandalore, the Empire came up with an alternative solution.
Since they could not control the planet, the Imperial Security Bureau made sure no one would.
Imperial forces started the purge by sending a massive amount of TIE bombers towards their capital city.
Mandalorians tried to counter the incoming attack but the overwhelming number of Imperial ships made it impossible.
While the bombers leaving nothing but destruction and ruins behind them proceeded to head for the next cities, Gunships armed with high-repeating weapons took out huge portion of those who survived.
Imperial Security Bureau officer Gideon took part in the battle and obtained the Darksaber from Kryze before she managed to flee with a small amount of Mandalorians.



# Section 3
At the end of the Great Purge, Imperial probe droids along with security droids were sent to find and execute any possible remaining survivors.
The events of the so-called Night of a Thousand Tears left the surviving Mandalorians broken and shattered for a long time, they were also forced to go into hiding for many years.
