# Introduction
During the Clone Wars an assassination attempt was made on Count Dooku by his former student, Asajj Ventress and newly appointed apprentice Savage Opress.
However, both of them failed to accomplish their mission and were forced to flee from the droid control ship.
Some time later an invasion issued by Count Dooku and led by General Grievous was sent to Dathomir to punish the Nightsisters for their treacherous behaviour.
A Separatist fleet, including Grievous’s personal command ship, a Providence-class Dreadnought called ‘the Invisible Hand’, arrived above Dathomir.

# Section 1
The Separatist started the invasion by bombarding the Nightsister fortress with Hyena-class bombers.
Shortly after the bombings, multiple landing crafts made their way to the surface and began deploying their forces.
While the Nightsisters and droids began to fight, the leader of the Nightsisters, Mother Talzin went back to their fortress to talk to their oldest member, Old Daka.
To reinforce her clan, Daka began resurrecting fallen Nightsisters from their graves and sent them to attack the droid army.
Talzin also created a voodoo figure which resembled Count Dooku, she warned him to leave Dathomir at once or he would face horrible torture.
Not long after, these undead witches began lunging at the frontlines, tearing droids apart.
At that point of the battle, the Separatist brought in a Defoliator Deployment Tank that would burn these witches alive.
However, with the help of Asajj Ventress, the tank was taken out before it managed to cause too many losses to the Nightsisters.
At some point of the battle Ventress challenged Grievous into a duel in order to save her fellow sisters, however once she managed to get the upper hand, the General ordered the droids to fire at her, causing both sides to lose members again.



# Section 2
Eventually the droids started controlling the battle and began pushing the remaining Nightsisters back towards their fortress.
Not being able to handle the pain anymore, Dooku ordered Grievous to attack the main fortress before Talzin killed him with the earlier mentioned voodoo figure.
After hearing this, Grievous ordered his droid forces to start heading towards the fortress immediately.
One of the walls was blown up by a commando droid, revealing the hidden caves where the ritual was happening.
Old Daka was impaled by Grievous which drained the life from the undead witches, causing the undead to fall again.
Talzin’s ichor cauldron was also knocked down which ended the voodoo curse and saved Count Dooku from the immense pain.
The remaining outnumbered Nightsisters were massacred by the droids outside.
Mother Talzin managed to flee by using her dark magic.
