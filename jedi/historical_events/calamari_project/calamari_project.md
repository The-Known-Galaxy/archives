# Introduction
The Calamari Project was a mission conducted by the Destabilization Branch of Imperial Intelligence  during the Galactic Civil war.
This mission’s main goal was to halt the construction and supply of starships to the Rebel Alliance; this would be achieved by the Destabilization operatives, starting a civil war between the Mon Calamari and the Quarren species, putting the starship production on halt and weakening the Rebel’s armada.

# Section 1
This project was carried out by the Destabilization operatives that were surgically-altered to resemble  Mon Calamari.
Once they infiltrated the Calamries’s planet they took over a farium mining facility and caused multiple disruptions where they would slow down or even halt the Calamari’s mining operations.
Farium is a vital resource in the construction of starships, and with this major mine being shut down, this potentially put the Mon Calamari’s starship construction for the Rebel’s on halt.
The Rebels were not too pleased about this and sent a skilled team of agents to go find and execute the infiltrators.
The Agents were assaulted by a group of Quarren thugs; they all survived, but this attack was suspected to be caused by the Imperials.
After the failed attack the Imperials murdered Morjanssik’s (city) Chief Manager and put the blame on the agents eventually leading to the arrest of the Rebel agents.
The agents made a quick escape out of the prison where they made their way to the Morjanssik Mine, where they found the infiltrators and executed them, thus ending the Calamari Project.
