# Introduction

The Battle of Felucia, a significant engagement during the Clone Wars, took place as part of the Outer Rim Sieges.
Initially, the mission to retake the planet from the Separatist forces was assigned to the 182nd Legion of the Grand Army of the Republic.
However, when contact was lost with the legion, the renowned 501st Legion, consisting of elite clone troopers, was dispatched to investigate their disappearance.

# Section 1

Earlier in the Clone Wars, General Grievous led a devastating assault on Felucia, securing the planet for the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
Jedi Masters Plo Koon and Obi-Wan Kenobi, along with Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano were sent on a mission to save the planet from Separatist control.
However, overwhelmed by the numerically superior enemy forces, the clone troopers and Jedi were forced to retreat, ultimately failing in their mission.

The battle commenced with the arrival of the 182nd Legion, initiating an assault on the Felucian blockade established by the CIS.
Although they encountered mild resistance, the real challenges awaited them on the planet's treacherous surface.
Felucia's nightmarish topography, characterized by dense foliage, endless jungles, and hazardous spores, made ambushes commonplace and hindered the use of heavy support vehicles.
As the 182nd Legion became overwhelmed and their fate uncertain, the Republic called upon the 501st Legion for reinforcements.
Upon landing, the 501st Legion sent out a patrol to scout ahead.
Unfortunately, their communication was abruptly cut off, replaced by the sounds of blaster fire, screams, and eerie screeches.
Advancing cautiously, the troopers stumbled upon a group of six feral acklay, vicious creatures that had decimated both the 182nd Legion and the initial patrol.
Employing rockets and mines, the clones fought valiantly but suffered heavy casualties.
Despite the arrival of two gunships attempting to provide support, one was shot down by anti-aircraft guns, crashing nearby.
Members of the 501st Legion rallied to protect a severely damaged AT-TE walker from super battle droids and assault droids.
Approximately fifty enemy droids advanced down the hill, attempting to destroy the vehicle with rockets.
However, their efforts proved futile, and the exposed droids became easy targets for the resilient clones.
In order to repair the AT-TE after surviving the assault, the clones retrieved a power cell from the crashed gunship, which allowed them to retake control of the walker.
The arrival of Jedi General Aayla Secura marked a turning point in the battle.
Leading the 501st contingent, Secura exhibited her exceptional skills with dual lightsabers, cleaving through the ranks of droids.
She successfully retrieved a power cell from the crashed gunship, further augmenting the Republic's firepower and causing havoc among the advancing Separatist tanks.
With renewed vigor, the Republic troops destroyed six Anti-Vehicle turrets that had been inflicting damage, further pushing forward.

As the battle progressed, the focus shifted to the hunt for Presidente Shu Mai, the influential leader of the Commerce Guild, who was believed to be holding Jedi Knight Barriss Offee captive.
With Secura at the forefront, the Republic forces set their sights on the Nigkoe Detention Facility, where Offee was thought to be imprisoned.
Engaging the formidable Gossam Commandos in fierce combat, the clone troopers, under the command of Clone Commander Bly, successfully secured the facility, allowing Secura to free Offee and her Selonian Padawan, Zonder.
Determined to apprehend Presidente Shu Mai, Secura and Offee, accompanied by the 327th Star Corps under the leadership of Commander Bly, advanced towards Mai's heavily fortified compound located near Kway Teow.
Employing diversionary tactics that obliterated several B2 super battle droid guards, the Jedi and their clone trooper allies pressed on, utilizing Aratech BARC speeder bikes to navigate the battlefield.
A squadron of Republic ARC-170 starfighters effectively neutralized the threat posed by droid starfighters, enabling the ground forces to continue their advance.
However, their hopes of capturing Presidente Shu Mai were dashed when they discovered that her personal ship had departed days before their arrival, and the compound appeared devoid of any recent activity.
Despite their disappointment, the Republic forces pressed on, gathering vital intelligence about the ongoing attack on Coruscant.

As the Battle of Felucia reached its climax, tragedy struck in the form of Order 66.
This sinister protocol, secretly embedded within the clone troopers by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, commanded them to turn against their Jedi commanders.
The unsuspecting Jedi, including Aayla Secura and Barriss Offee, suddenly found themselves facing betrayal from the very soldiers they had fought alongside.
Barriss Offee, besieged by B-2 battle droids, attempted to rally her troops, only to be met with blaster fire from a Republic All Terrain Tactical Enforcer (AT-TE).
The betrayal resulted in her untimely demise at the hands of her own troops.
Meanwhile, Aayla Secura, leading her forces toward Niango, was abruptly attacked when Commander Bly received the fateful Order 66.
Seemingly entranced by the sight of a bird taking flight, Secura was caught off guard as Bly turned his blaster on her, ending her life.
Concentrated fire from the clone troopers surrounding her sealed her tragic fate.
In the aftermath of the Battle of Felucia, the surviving Padawans stationed at the Jiaozi water treatment facilities, witnessing the horrifying slaughter of their Jedi mentors, made a daring escape from their own troops.
Fleeing the planet, they carried with them the burden of the tragic events that had unfolded on Felucia.
With the toxic threat contained and Felucia saved, the newly formed Galactic Empire swiftly assimilated the planet into its growing dominion.
