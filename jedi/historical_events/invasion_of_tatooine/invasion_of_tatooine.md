# Introduction

The Invasion of Tatooine arose in 19 BBY during the Clone Wars.
This invasion took place within Tatooine’s training yards and in space.
The fighters within this invasion were the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

# Section 1

The Galactic Republic had created training grounds for the armed forces that protected Tatooine.
Jedi Master Ferroda spectated these training grounds, making sure they were safe and free from any forces from the Separatists.
Two clone troopers known as X1 and X2 were specially chosen to help General Ferroda instruct the newest batches of clones.
This was because of the great skill they showed off during battles with the Galactic Republic.
X1 was the first clone to arrive, followed by X2.
X2 listened to X1, and they ran training courses as well as instructed them on how to shoot and use hand-to-hand combat.
Unfortunately, during the course, the clones all spotted a Confederate probe droid that was currently inside the landing bays.
X2 had quickly destroyed the droid, entered a V-Wing starfighter, and flew into space following a drone ship from where the probe had come from.
X2 successfully blew up the ship, but now knew there might be a problem with the Confederates soon.
Suddenly, X1 realized that there was going to be a substantial Confederate invasion.

# Section 2

The little Republic troops that were on Tatooine were greatly endangered by the Confederate invasion and lost some forces.
Some Venators began orbiting Tatooine, staying in the battle with the Confederates.
The Confederates had also started a surface invasion.
They placed a lot of OG-9 spider droids and B1-Series battle droids on the planet, which made some Clone pilots retreat to a bunker to stay safe.
However, X1 and X2 helped them by destroying the Battle droids.
Unfortunately, they did not have good enough weapons to kill the Spider-Droids.
A fellow clone had given X2 a rocket launcher, which allowed him to destroy the Spider droids.
The battle continued, making the Confederacy drop more and more battle droids on Tatooine.
X1, hearing of this, had called in reinforcements, which allowed the clone troopers to fight off the fellow droids.

# Section 3

Hearing of this, the Confederacy began releasing Vulture droid starfighters around the Republic positions.
X2 had a plan to create anti-aircraft guns to shoot the Confederacy ships down, which Ferroda approved.
X2, x1, and the Clones all ran to a Republic hanger and cleared out all the remaining droids that lay there.
X1 and X2 found a spare starfighter each, and both took one and began fighting in space.
They both destroyed many fighter escorts and secured the safety of the destroyer.
X2 and some of the Clone Troopers all landed inside one of the ships and destroyed droids and the ship’s reactor core.
The Clone Troopers and X2 had escaped the ship just in time, and because of this destruction, the ship exploded.
The Republic had begun to clean up the mess and secure their win.

# Section 4

Chancellor Palpatine had noticed this bravery and combat ability during the battle and awarded X1 and X2 medals.
Unfortunately, during the ceremony, General Grievous attacked Coruscant, and yet again, X1 and X2 helped secure Coruscant and send the battle away.
