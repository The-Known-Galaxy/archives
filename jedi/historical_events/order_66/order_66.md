# Introduction
The war was finally going to end and all was looking well until A meeting between Jedi knight Anakin Skywalker and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.
During this, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine has revealed to Anakin that he is Darth Sidious.
Anakin immediately ignited his lightsaber and pointed it at Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, but Supreme Chancellor Palpatine did not try to defend himself.
Anikin felt conflict and could not bring himself to kill him.
Instead, Anikin would return to the Jedi Temple and report it to Mace Windu.
After Mase Winu heard of this, he went to the Jedi High Council.
The Jedi High Council was ashamed of themselves because their oath to protect was led by a Dark Lord for over a decade.
Knowing this the Jedi High Council would plan to take back the peace.
Mace Windu would take Jedi Masters Kit Fisto, Saesee Tiin, and Agen Kolar to confront Darth Sidious, They were the best fighters that the order had on Coruscant.
Anakin would stay behind at the Jedi Temple because of a feeling from Mace Windu.
Together Mace Windu and the Jedi Masters would much into Supreme Chancellor Palpatine’s office and confront him.
They tried to place Supreme Chancellor Palpatine under arrest but he would retaliate by igniting his lightsaber and attacking.
This would be a fight that would end up being their last.

In the end, it was Mace Windu fighting Supreme Chancellor Palpatine but coming up the stairs was Anakin, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine Now on his knees, Mace Windu would try to put an end to him but not before Anikin tried to defend Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.
It did not matter Mace Windu has made up his mind and with that, Anakin would cut off Mace Windus’s lightsaber hand, now Sidious would take this opportunity to strike Mace Windu out the window with a jolt of lightning.
With Mace Windu now dead, Anakin would not know what else to do than to pledge himself to Darth Sidious.
Darth Sidious has now made Anakin his new apprentice and renamed him, Darth Vader.
Now Darth Sidious needed to carry out his plan but first, he would call for Order 66.
After the start of Order 66, many Jedi would be killed by the clones.
This led to Anakin leading an army to the Jedi Temple and killing Jedi Masters, Jedi, and many younglings.
Just like that, there was no longer any support of the Jedi or so they thought.
