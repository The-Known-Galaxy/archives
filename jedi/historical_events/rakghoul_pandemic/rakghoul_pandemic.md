# Introduction
The Rakghoul Pandemic was a devastating historic event in the Old Republic.
Starting after the end of the Great Galactic War, the Virus was discovered on a Republic ship known as the Stardream, which carried many different animals that had, or by chance, carried the plague with it on the ship.
The passengers would eventually get infected with the plague which left the crew disabled, eventually crashed the Stardream on the planet of Tatooine.
This released the infected survivors, which resulted in the virus to start spreading to the different tribes of Tusken Raiders and to the native fauna.
The deadly plague would affect high populated areas like Mos Ila and Anchorhead, preventing travel to and from the planet.

Once the Virus started, it had quickly spread across Tatooine including the cities of Mos Ila and Anchorhead.
A Galactic news broadcast was sent across the Galaxy, warning the people of the galaxy to go into quarantine and not travel into space.
Of course, the people did not listen straight away and it became apparent that the virus would eventually spread across the galaxy to many planets.
For instance, planets such as Corellia, Alderaan, and many more in the galaxy.
This led both the Republic and the Empire to start quarantine and prevent any more casualties.
Many people were killed by the Rakghoul Virus and they were doing this quarantine as a safety precaution to make sure it could be contained from now on.



# Section 2
After some time, the Republic finally started working on a vaccine to prevent the virus from spreading further, but the Empire saw this as an opportunity and attempted to weaponize the virus.
Of course, this backfired on them which led them to eventually decide that the Rakghoul Virus needed to be eliminated once and for all.
The vaccination was eventually completed and the vaccination process had finally began on the people who were infected with the virus.
But however, the Rakghouls were still at large with tunnels created on the many planets for them to hide in.
This led to the start of both sides, Empire and Republic, beginning to organize hunting forces to eliminate the rakghoul threat.
Many were found on the planets of Alderaan, Tatooine, Corellia, and many more.
