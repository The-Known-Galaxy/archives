# Introduction

Not to be confused with the Great Hunt hosted by the Mando’ade and undertaken by a variety of infamous Bounty Hunters, the Great Hunt you will be reading about today was a unique mission conducted by the Jedi Order during the era of the Old Republic.
The Great Hunt’s purpose was to send exceptionally powerful Jedi Knights out into the galaxy with the intention of exterminating Sith loyalists and their beastly creations.
It was one of the few Jedi offences designed to carry out the complete extinction of numerous different species, though it can be argued it was done with a pure and justified purpose.

Part I: Origin of the Great Hunt

During the era of the Old Republic and reign of the Brotherhood of Darkness, the Dark Lord of the Sith, Exar Kun reigned over his subordinate Sith followers and waged a war against the Galactic Republic.
During this war Exar Kun and many of the Sith under his command, notably his Sith sorcerers and alchemists conducted experiments with forbidden knowledge gained from lost Sith holocrons and from a variety of Sith tombs on worlds such as Korriban and Yavin IV.

The experiments with the most devastating effects were undoubtedly those that produced the dark-side corrupted beasts that would serve a singular purpose; the consumption of force-sensitives.
These beasts fuelled with dark side energy inhabited dozens of planets and actively sought out locations and populations ripe with force-sensitive energy with the purpose of consuming the blood of force-sensitive individuals.

As a result of the harm these creatures were causing, towards the end of the Great Sith War, the Jedi Council decided it was their responsibility and duty to seek out these creatures and eradicate them.
Surprisingly this was the only order of genocide issued by the Jedi Council that was not met with any controversy or backlash, as the threat of these creatures and their intent was too harmful to ignore.

And as such, the Jedi Council dispatched a variety of talented Jedi Knights to complete this unique and exceptionally dangerous task; to hunt and kill the very creatures designed to hunt and kill them.

Part II: The Hunters

The Jedi Council was highly selective when making the decision of who to send after the various creatures plaguing the galaxy.
The Jedi chosen had to be expert hunters and trackers, as well as maintain a mastery of the force and lightsaber in order to be a match for what they would soon face.
There were at least a dozen Jedi chosen for this task, but only four are noted in galactic records.

The group put together had no distinct leader, all known members being of the position of Jedi Knight, but three we know of notably had a force-bond that allowed them to compliment each other’s abilities and helped them against the allure of the dark side, to an extent.

Duron Qel-Droma

The first notable member of the Great Hunt retinue is Duron Qel-Droma.
Duron Qel-Droma stemmed from the Qel-Droma family, a notably force-sensitive family who had strong ties to the Jedi Order and unfortunately for young Duron, the Sith as well.
Duron Qel-Droma was uniquely strong in his ability to influence the minds of other people and creatures, he employed this consistently during the Great Hunt and would often choose not to utilize his lightsaber, even when facing the great and terrible beasts of his hunts.

Shaela Nuur

The second notable member of the Great Hunt retinue is Shaela Nuur.
Once said to be the most promising student of Master Ood Bnar, which is no small compliment considering the many Padawans the elderly Master had taught as well as the many centuries he’d lived for, Shaela Nuur was exceptional at lightsaber combat and was one of few Jedi capable of hunting and killing great beasts, including the ones hunted during the Great Hunt.
She was seen doing this single handedly on numerous occasions.

Guun Han Saresh

The third notable member of the Great Hunt retinue is Guun Han Saresh.
This particular Jedi Knight is perhaps the most surprising to be considered an expert hunter of the group, having grown up on the city world of Taris to a wealthy family it is indeed unique that he would have developed such a talent for hunting beasts.
Perhaps what is even more unique is that Guun Han Saresh utilized a force-imbued sword, not unlike the ones used by the ancient Je’daii of Tython and a compound bow, with which he was a brilliant marksman.

Cale Berkona

The forth and least notable member of the Great Hunt retinue is Cale Berkona.
Cale was a newly minted Jedi Knight and as such was considered the least experienced and talented of the group.
He did not maintain the bond that the original three members had and would only join the retinue for one of their hunts before being gravely injured, having his lightsaber destroyed and being returned to Dantooine for medical treatment.
For this young Knight though, perhaps this was a blessing in disguise.

Collectively these brave and noble Knights set off to carry out what was arguably the most dangerous task in the galaxy at the time, certain they will face conflict and even more certain they run the risk of losing their lives, for these chosen Knights this was nothing to fear.
