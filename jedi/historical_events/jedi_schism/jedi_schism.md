# Introduction
A few months before the start of the Clone Wars, unlike other schisms within the order's history, this one remained non-violent.
Instead of playing the political game, it focused on the values of the Jedi Order.
This nonviolent schism introduced two things first: one of them being that individual Jedi could follow their path, and for protests by Jedi about the Order to be taken seriously.

# Section 1
Around three months before the Clone Wars, following Chancellor Palpatine’s appointment of Jedi officers within the Republic Army, several Jedi including a satellite council, the Almas Council of the Almas Academy, would join the schism.
They believed that it was not within the Jedi way to lead armies and that the Separatist situation should be handled through diplomacy instead of violence.
Several Jedi within the schism were found to have Separatist ties, including the leader of the schism, Jedi Master Sola Bulq.
After the proof of this collaboration came out, many Jedi returned to the Republic’s service.
However, some invoked the Right of Denial, and the Jedi High Council permitted it as long those members did not fall to the Dark Side of the Force, turned in their lightsabers, and did not have Separatist ties.
