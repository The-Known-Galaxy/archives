# Introduction

The horrors of the Old Sith Wars and the near extinction of the Jedi Order that had resulted from the conflict were remembered in the Republic for generations.
Few could have guessed, however, that a much larger conflict would soon engulf the galaxy.
From within the Order's ranks Jedi Master Phanius, one of the Order's brightest members, became entranced with the forbidden knowledge of the Sith and, defying the High Council, absconded into deep space with a Sith Holocron stolen from the Jedi Archives.
Phanius took up the long-vacant title of Dark Lord of the Sith as well as a new name and identity: Darth Ruin.
In the ensuing years, Ruin gathered together a large number of dark side followers and surviving Sith clans and founded the New Sith Empire.
With this army Ruin planned to bring the Republic, and the Jedi who served it, to their knees.
Beginning what would be a thousand-year war, Ruin's empire quickly became fractured, tearing down the Republic and the Jedi Order while ravaging itself from the inside out.
The Order was plagued by ineffectual leadership throughout the conflict, constantly held back by a politically-minded High Council.

# Section 1

To counter the poor management of Order, several Jedi left Coruscant to establish baronies and kingdoms on the Rim, protecting their subjects while demanding fealty and military service.
These so-called Jedi Lords established a loose confederation under the guidance of a Jedi Grand Council made up of the most powerful Lords, waging wars against the Sith Empire and killing any Sith minions who intruded on Jedi space.
In 1010 BBY, the High Council raised their protege Skere Kaan to the rank of Master, dispatching him into the galaxy to cripple the Sith Empire; the High Council did this despite their knowledge of Kaan's extremist views and his belief that the Order and the Republic were responsible for the state of the galaxy.
Taking with him a group of like-minded Jedi, Kaan declared himself Dark Lord and organized a Brotherhood of Darkness, issuing a warning to all surviving Sith: join the Brotherhood and bend the knee or die.
Holding true to his promise of death to all who did not join the Brotherhood, the High Council sent their congratulations to Kaan for his swift work of the worst of the Sith Lords.
Kaan openly mocked the Order and the thanks, declaring war on them and promising to burn their Temple to the ground.

Furious at the Council ineptitude, Lord Hoth rallied the banners of those loyal to him and raised a great host called the Army of Light.
Gaining the support of the last Grand Council of the Jedi and every last lord, Hoth harried the Brotherhood along its flank until the Army of Light had enough practice at warfare to strike at the Brotherhood's heart.
Meeting the Brotherhood in open combat during a series of campaigns at the planet Ruusan, the conflict ground on for seven fierce battles costing many lives on both sides.
At the conclusion of the seventh battle, Lord Kaan?
Near defeat and driven insane by the power of the dark side?
Unleashed the horrors of the thought bomb in a cave system, engulfing every single Force-user on the world.
The New Sith Wars were over.
The Jedi Order had survived once again despite the deaths of nearly every member of the Army of Light on Ruusan, and the Sith were presumed wiped out to the last individual.
One, however, had survived: Darth Bane.
He and his successors would hide from the Republic and the Jedi, planning revenge in utter secrecy under the Rule of Two.
