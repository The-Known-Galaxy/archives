# Introduction
The Jedi Order continued to grow in strength and influence, spreading throughout the galaxy, with the establishment of training enclaves in systems such as Corellia.
As more members were trained and elevated to knighthood, the Council decided to move the majority of masters and knights to Coruscant's Temple; leaving the Ossus Academy open for the training of younglings.
In 40 ABY, the galaxy was plunged into the Second Galactic Civil War.
Struggling slightly with the perceived need to side with the Galactic Alliance, the Jedi Order worked as best they could to prevent the situation from escalating.
Amid this crisis, however, betrayal came from within as the Jedi Knight Jacen Solo was seduced to the dark side and became the Sith Lord Darth Caedus.
Despite Caedus's control of the Alliance, Luke and the Order made a distinction- they supported the Alliance, but not an Alliance controlled by Jacen himself.
In the aftermath of the Battle of Kashyyyk, the Order declared its neutrality and formed the Jedi Coalition.

Efforts were then begun to remove Caedus from power; though the Order was forced to retreat secretly to Endor, where they established a temporary base.
In 41 ABY, Darth Caedus was killed in a duel by his sister on the Anakin Solo.
Shortly after the war ended and the galaxy was once again at peace and the Jedi Coalition had been reformed into the New Jedi Order and reunited with the Galactic Alliance.
Lumiya's Sith, the last surviving remnant of the Order of the Sith Lords had perished with the arrest of Tahiri Veila, former Jedi Knight and Caedus's Sith apprentice turned informant and, thus the Sith were once again believed to be extinct.
However, the Jedi were in a state of despair as many had looked to Jacen for guidance before his fall.
