# Introduction
The Battle of the South Ridge took place on Naboo in the year 32 BBY.
This infamous battle was at the south ridge of Theed, the capital city of Naboo during the Trade Federation’s invasion of Naboo.
This battle commenced soon upon the arrival of Queen Amidala and her security force, seeking to liberate Naboo to the planet it recently was.
The Queen and her security force partnered with the Gugans to create a massive defence against their capital.
The Trade Federation’s forces kept on coming, thousands of B1 Battle Droids and armoured tanks came down the Great Grass Plains.
The Trade Federation’s plethora of droids came from their airbase.
Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes viewed their base as crucial to their offence, and called upon some pilots to destroy a convoy that was leaving the base, which was being destroyed simultaneously.
With the base destroyed, the Trade Federation’s continuous flow of troops was cut short, giving the partnered Gungans and Naboo the upper hand.
The alliance used a lot of droid shock grenades as well as land mines.
As the battle in space commenced, the young Anakin Skywalker managed to destroy the entire Separatist carrier Lucrehulk, which powered the droids.
Once it was blown up, all remaining forces on Naboo shut down, resulting in a victory for the alliance of both the Naboo and Gungans.
