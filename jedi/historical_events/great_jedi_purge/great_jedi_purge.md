# Introduction

The Great Jedi Purge was the second mass extermination of Jedi, as a result of Order 66.
Clone Protocol 66 was one of 150 Contingency Orders for the Grand Army of the Republic, created by Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas in case of armed forces who were to oppose the Republic.
These Orders would be issued by the Supreme Chancellor, or commanding authority, in times of crisis and had to be obeyed by Clones or else they would face military degradation and execution.
Order 66 acted to exterminate Jedi officers, declared to be acting in opposition to the Republic, and reverted all command to the Supreme Chancellor.
The Order had several intricacies that allowed for the immediate extermination of Jedi at the will of the Chancellor without the need for discussion or authentication, features that many of the other Contingencies Orders didn't have.
Furthermore, Order 66 was programmed within biochips in the brains of Clones to ensure it was carried out and there was no room for doubt.

# Section 1

A year before the event of Order 66, there was a sign of biochips being used - this knowledge previously being kept secret to only a handful.
CT-5385 (Tup) of the 501st Legion experienced headaches, which ultimately led to him killing Jedi Master Tiplar, the General he was working under at the Battle of Ringo Vinda.
Upon returning to a command post, Tup was questioned by CT-7567 (Rex) but didn't even know what happened himself.
Suddenly, Tup attacked Jedi Master Tiplee, who was able to restrain the trooper to the wall.
Worried that it may be a contagious virus, the Clone was sent to Kamino to allow for further examination.
Darth Sidious had Tup abducted by Separatist forces during his transport to Kamino to prevent the spread of the biochip conspiracy, but CT-5555 (Fives), Rex and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker successfully rescued him.

# Section 2

At Kamino, Fives was desperate to save his friend, and with the assistance of a medical droid, was able to uncover a biochip implanted in Tup's brain that had malfunctioned.
Thinking that removing the chip would stop his friend's suffering, Fives had the medical droid operate to retrieve it; unfortunately, due to Tup's already unhealthy state, he died during the operation.
Fives learned from the medical droid with orders to have his memory wiped so he escaped the facility to present his findings to Jedi Master Shaak Ti.
Receiving the news, Ti ordered the chips and Fives to be brought to Coruscant to explain the case to Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, not knowing he was Darth Sidious.
Palpatine demanded a private conversation with Fives, which allowed him to claim an "assassination attempt".
The Jedi High Council learnt of Fives' alleged attack and launched an investigation, which led to an encounter Fives had with Rex and Skywalker.
The agitated Clone tried to explain the situation, but appearing hostile, was shot by CC-1010 (Fox) of the Coruscant Guard, ordered by the Supreme Chancellor to deal with the situation, ending the conspiracy.

# Section 3

In 19 BBY, Skywalker had news that Palpatine may be a Sith Lord after a conversation with the Chancellor, so warned Jedi Master Mace Windu.
In response, Windu and Jedi Masters Agen Kolar, Kit Fisto and Saesee Tiin approached the office of the Chancellor, trying to arrest him.
Upon being confronted by the four Jedi Masters, Sidious was able to slay three of them with ease, leaving Windu who duelled against him.
Putting up a fight, Windu was capable enough to disarm and even disfigure Sidious but was incapacitated by Skywalker in an act of temptation, allowing the Sith Lord to eliminate the Jedi Master through a blast of Force Lightning.
In conflict with dark emotions, Skywalker became Sidious' apprentice under a new name - Darth Vader.
Darth Sidious issued Order 66 to all Clone Commanders, leading to the Great Jedi Purge.

# Section 4

When Order 66 was received, Clones all across the galaxy acted to bring down all Jedi with brutal force:
Above the Battle of Boz Pity, Jedi Master Plo Koon was shot down by CT-55/11-9009 (Jag) with an ARC-170 starfighter squadron during clean up operations.
On Saleucami, Jedi Master Stass Allie was struck by blaster fire from CC-8826 (Neyo) of the 91st Mobile Reconnaissance Corps on BARC speeders during clean up operations.
Jedi Master Aayla Secura was gunned down by CC-5052 (Bly) with the 327th Star Corps during preparation to engage Separatist droids.
Feeling her death through the Force, Jedi Master Darrus Jeht alerted himself of the danger of the Order, but the situation eventually led to his ships jumping through one of the many time vortexes in the Cularin system, leading to his disappearance.
On Mygeeto, Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi was executed by CC-1138 (Bacara) with the 21st Nova Corps and a unit of the 501st Legion in an advance for one of the planet's massive cities.
On Ilum, the units of the 481st Legion were sent to secure the planet, killing survivors in the process.

# Section 5

A few managed to escape the initial onslaught, fleeing out of Clones' sights and going into hiding, while some also abandoning the ways of the Jedi:
On Kashyyyk, Grand Master Yoda evaded a sneak attack conducted by CC-1004 (Gre) and escaped.
Jedi Master Quintlan Vos was fired at by an A6 Juggernaut and was presumed dead, but managed to escape off the planet with his son Korto Vos 8 months later with Jedi Masters T'ra Saa and Tholme.
On Utapau, Master Obi-Wan Kenobi was fired upon by an AT-TE, ordered by CC-2224 (Cody), while he was on a Dragonmount, but managed to escape the planet.
Some Masters died protecting their Padawans:
On their way to assist the assault on Mygeeto, Jedi Master Jaro Tapal was shot as he tried giving way for his Padawan Cal Krestis to escape his Venator-class Star Destroyer by escape pod.
On Kaller, Jedi Master Depa Billaba died surrounded by the Clones that were with her while her Padawan Caleb Dume escaped as a fugitive.

# Section 6

At the same time, Darth Sidious dispatched his new apprentice Lord Vader, and CC-1119 (Appo) with the 501st Legion, to march upon the Jedi Temple on Coruscant silently, with the intent to eliminate the Jedi.
This commenced Operation: Knightfall and the siege upon the Temple.
Gate Master Jurokk greeted Skywalker, unknowing he had fallen to the dark side, and the first to be killed by Vader's hand, marking the beginning of the end for those in the Temple.
Within minutes, a large portion of the Jedi Order was executed, even though there were several Jedi and the Temple Security Force.
Vader made it his task to change the signal of the Jedi Beacon that was informing Jedi outposts across the galaxy in an attempt to lure surviving Jedi back to the Temple, so took a group of Clones with him to the library.
Sensing this, Chief Librarian Jocasta Nu managed to leave the library unseen.
The message was sent out that the war had finally concluded, drawing those who hadn't yet been exterminated by the Clones to the Temple, only to be slaughtered by the troopers that were not letting any Jedi leave or enter the temple.
Clone assassins were left at the beacon to guard it with their lives.

# Section 8

Trying to destroy the remaining Jedi, Vader hunted the fleeing masters and younglings, with only a handful being able to escape.
A notable event happened when Vader made his way to the High Council Tower, where he was met with a clan of Younglings.
Sors Bandeam was amongst them and asked Vader what they were going to do.
In response, Vader executed him and the remaining Jedi in the temple.
At this point, the temple was burning and Senator Bail Organa landed at a nearby platform to see what caused the fire.
He saw the death of a young Padawan whilst being fired at, and quickly fled the premises.
Sidious arrived at the Temple to applaud him for his deeds.

# Section 9

The flames of the temple alerted the Senate Emergency response to declare martial law on Coruscant and stated that anyone who tried to enter the Temple must be doing so against the Senate's will.
The Coruscant Security Force was sent along with the 501st to track down all fleeing Jedi.
The news that the Jedi had betrayed the Republic was constantly sent across the HoloNet.
Palpatine was able to justify Order 66 on the basis that an "assassination" attempt by Jedi had occurred, and the allegation that the Jedi Order started the Clone Wars by commissioning the creation of the Clone army without the agreement of the Senate in an act to cripple the Republic.
He used misleading recordings of conversations with Windu as evidence for the assassination attempt, convincing the Senate to reform the Republic into the Galactic Empire.

# Section 10

To prevent further death, Kenobi and Yoda cautiously entered the Temple to switch the signal to one that warned Jedi to stay clear of the Temple and hide.
This is where the pair discovered that a lightsaber user was behind the killings, and they met and defeated the clones guarding the comms room.
On their way out, Kenobi sought the security recording to see who had done all of this, only to see Skywalker's slaughter of Battlemaster Cin Drallig and his padawan and his anointment to Sith Lord.
Despite the change in signal, several Jedi still made their way back to the Temple, meeting their demise.
Shortly after, there was a duel between Yoda and Sidious in the Senate Chamber, while Kenobi went to Mustafar to confront Vader.
Both Jedi Masters later went into self-imposed exiles on Dagobah and Tatooine respectively.
The duel on Mustafar was a defeat for Vader; joined by CC-4477 (Thire) and Coruscant shock troopers, Sidious brought Vader to the Grand Medical Facility, where he was saved through cybernetics.

# Section 11

Over the next 19 years, several groups were designated to completely remove the Jedi from the galaxy:
Vader personally dealt with many groups of Jedi with the 501st, now called Vader's Fist, utilising Clone Commando units that would assist and escort him in his hunt for the last remaining Jedi.

The Inquisitorius was a branch of the Imperial Intelligence Service set up by Sidious to help in the hunt for Jedi.
Inquisitors would be selected from fallen Jedi who had been corrupted or tortured to the dark side.
The Grand Inquisitor, who was formerly a Jedi Temple Guard, trained the fallen as Inquisitors.
One example was Jedi Padawan Trilla Suduri, who was caught due to her master, Jedi Knight Cere Junda, revealing her location.
After the torture and the betrayal, Suduri gave into the pain, becoming the Second Sister of the Inquisitorius.
Other examples were the Seventh Sister, Ninth Sister (formerly Jedi Masana Tide), the Fifth Brother, the Sixth Brother (formerly Jedi Bil Van) and the Eighth Brother.
Learning of this program from Sidious, Vader eventually led it.

# Section 12

One crucial mission the Inquisitorius was instructed to undergo, was the mission to locate and bring back Jocasta Nu alive - her knowledge and access to the vaults could be key for the Empire's future.
One such artefact that they tried to gain access to was the Kyber memory crystal, a list of all known Force-sensitives.
Even though the list was recovered and Nu accepted her death by lightsaber, Vader destroyed the list to prevent Sidious from choosing new Sith apprentices - the possibility of a new apprentice was a threat to Vader's position in power.
The Inquisitorius was also in charge of Purge Stormtroopers, trained formidable death squads containing Imperial soldiers and the last generation of Clones from Kamino.
Naturally, they were programmed to obey Order 66 and execute Jedi immediately.
Sidious established the Shadow Guard, a unit within his Royal Guard, consisting of former Sun Guard and Jedi Knights trained by Vader, tasked to follow orders from the Emperor himself, to protect him or eliminate suspected Force-sensitives.
A few Shadow Guards would accompany Inquisitors or Stormtroopers as well.

# Section 13

Sidious also took steps to secure his power as Emperor:
The Jedi Temple on Coruscant had been built on an ancient Sith Shrine in the hopes of neutralising its effect.
After the siege of the temple, it was converted into the Imperial Palace.
Sidious later looked to siphon the dark energies of the shrine.
Additionally, Sidious created the Emperor's Eyes, Hands, Reach and Voice.
The Eye was responsible for seeing into the future using the Force.
The Hands was responsible for carrying out covert missions to eliminate certain politically powerful people in secret.
The Reach and Voice were responsible for ensuring that the Emperor's wishes were kept throughout the galaxy.
These elements helped stabilise the Empire further for Sidious' own goals, helping turn people to favour it through the use of propaganda and destroying Jedi history.

# Section 14

There were many events to diminish the Jedi presence in the galaxy:
After the Coruscant Temple had fallen, Vader moved his interests to the planet Kashyyyk, where a joint Jedi-Wookie force was maintaining resistance against the invading Empire.
Crushing the resistance and taking in an orphan as his secret apprentice, the Sith Lord moved on to demolish the Jedi Conclave that had gathered on Kessel a month later.
Months following the raid on Coruscant, a resistance group called Whiplash was made and assisted those who fled the Temple off-world.
The surviving Jedi went into hiding, joined resistance groups or relinquished their lightsabers for civilian life.
In 18 BBY, Vader's Fist gained control of Naboo, whose Queen Apailana decided to sever all ties with the Empire.
These were examples of events that showed the proficiency of the dark lord's stormtroopers.
The Purge was eventually considered over when the Emperor decided there was only a very small amount of Jedi left in the galaxy to be a threat, by 1 BBY.
