# Introduction

The Second Battle of Geonosis was one of the Republic’s largest operations during the Clone Wars.
The military campaign was a planetary-wide invasion that rostered many Jedi Generals in the massive invasion force, which included Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Master Luminara Unduli, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and Jedi General Ki-Adi Mundi.
Although the Second Battle of Geonosis was a victory for the Republic, all four Jedi Generals faced heavy resistance and challenges from the native geonosians.

# Section 1

Before the Second Battle of Geonosis, Geonosis was liberated from Republic control, months after the First Battle of Geonosis, due to high separatist resistance from the native geonosian population.
Senator Rush Clovis, Archduke Poggle the Lesser, and Senator Lott Dod were discovered by the Senator of Naboo, Padmé Amidala, to build the largest droid factory of the Confederacy of Independent Systems on Geonosis.
This information would lead to the Republic sending a massive invasion force, to recapture Geonosis from Separatist control, due to the threat the large droid factory could present in the Outer Rim Territories.
The planetary invasion force was under the command of Admiral Wullf Yularen, while the four Jedi Generals would be in charge of the ground forces, during the operation.
The large droid factory was under the protection of a ray shield, so orbital bombardment was not an option for the destruction of the factory.
To assault the factory, the Jedi Generals came up with a plan to land near the ray shield, to reduce the amount of open-field combat, as this was a major flaw in the First Battle of Geonosis, where the republic lost about 85% of the clone attack force of 190,000.
To reduce the amount of surface fire from the geonosians, they planned to come from 3 different directions, but meet at a singular rendezvous point.
What the Jedi Generals did not account for, was that the geonosians also accounted for their mistakes in the First Battle of Geonosis.
The geonosians and the droid army’s main weakness during the First Battle of Geonosis, was the lack of anti-aircraft weapons.
In response to these flaws, the geonosians armed themselves with their starfighters and proton cannons.

Once the LAAT transports flew down from the Venator and Acclamator Star Destroyers, what awaited them were Geonosian Nantex-class Territorial Defense Starfighters and long-range proton cannons.
Although a squadron of Y-wings did reduce the number of proton cannons near the landing zone, the LAAT transports were still getting shot down in massive numbers.
As a result, Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ki-Adi Mundi, and Anakin Skywalker were all shot down in different areas and Clone Commander CC-2224 (Cody) was the highest-ranking officer at the landing zone.
In response to the amount of fire coming from all sides, Cody ordered his forces to make a defensive perimeter, to hopefully hold out until air support and reinforcements arrived.
General Mundi’s forces crashed northeast from the landing point, where they were forced to go through a cave to reach the rendezvous point.
In the cave, General Mundi’s forces had to deal with a geonosian nest, but luckily his Special Operations Troopers also consisted of a unit of flame troopers.
With the use of flamethrowers, General Mundi and his clone forces were able to escape the cave.
General Skywalker and the 501st Legion crashed southeast of the landing point, where they were forced into a canyon, where they encountered a droid fortress.
The fortress had turrets mounted at the top and droids firing down at the 501st.
Luckily, with the combat prowess of General Skywalker and his padawan, Ahsoka Tano, they were able to destroy the fortress and met up with General Mundi’s forces.
Unlike the other Jedi Generals, General Kenobi’s force landed at the rendezvous point, but his gunship crashed near the landing zone.
Clone Commander CC-2224 (Cody) sent Clone Troopers “Waxer'' and “Boil” to rescue General Kenobi out of his crashed gunship.
The rescue was successful, but the 212th Attack Battalion was getting overwhelmed by enemy fire from all sides.
Overcoming all odds, Admiral Wullf Yularen was able to get a Y-wing Bomber Squadron to bombard the droid and geonosian lines surrounding the 212th.
The 501st and Mundi’s forces regrouped and started their plan to destroy the shield generator, to allow the reinforcements and 41st Elite Corp to the area.
General Skywalker and the 501st were able to destroy the shield generator, with the use of EMP grenades and AT-TE walkers.
What was up ahead, was the droid factory.

# Section 3

With Generals Kenobi and Mundi injured, they were sent to the medical bay on the Venator, where they left Generals Skywalker and Unduli in charge of the assault on the droid factory.
With the 41st Elite Corps and the 501st Legion rallying near the droid factory, Master Unduli came up with a plan to destroy the factory.
She planned to have her Padawan, Barriss Offee, and General Skywalker’s padawan, Ahsoka Tano, sneak through the geonosian catacombs underneath the droid factory and destroy the droid factory from the inside, while the 41st and 501st will distract the droid and geonosian forces from the entrance of the factory.
The plan worked at the beginning, but after the padawans were noticed by a geonosian soldier, the plan changed, as the geonosians took their thermal detonators and flew off to other parts of the factory.
Due to time, the padawans used a nearby droid super tank to shoot the main reactor of the factory, causing the whole factory to crumble.
Luckily, the padawans were safe from the wreckage, due to the armor of the super tank.

# Section 4

The final operations on Geonosis included a search for Archduke Poggle the Lesser and any form of separatist resistance on the planet.
After Master Unduli and her clone trooper units were missing, after checking the Progate Temple, Kenobi, Skywalker, and a few troopers from the 212th, inspected the temple.
In the temple, they discovered Master Unduli was captured and the temple was the location of Poggle the Lesser and Geonosian Queen Karina.
With this information, the Generals and clone units freed Master Unduli, captured Poggle, and killed the Queen, after collapsing the cave onto her.
With all major separatist leaders captured or dead, the Second Battle of Geonosis was a success for the Republic.
