# Introduction
Project Hammertong was a secret project called the Ultimate Weapon by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars before it was given the Galactic Empire.
The Project was handed over to the Galactic Empire making it the Death Star project.
Palpatine would send a unit of the 501st Legion in 19 BBY to Mygeeto.
The story was the unit was sent to support the Galactic Marines by destroying an Energy Collector.
In reality, they were sent to retrieve an energy crystal from one of the Intergalactic Banking Clan’s power generators for the project.
By 0 BBY the original Death Star was entering service, the Project now led by Scientist Eloy was working on a super laser design for the second more powerful battle moon.
Within a secret facility on Gorno, a prototype type section of the weapon was constructed before being relocated to another planet via a specially adapted Strike Class medium cruiser.
Mandra D’ulin and the Mistryl Shadow Guard were going to provide security for the transit however she was gunned down along with her comrade Pav D’armon.
The surviving guards would attack the Imperials and steal the strike cruiser to then escape to Tatooine.
They made contact with the Rebel Alliance but fell out over who the details should go to first, leading to Agent Winward stealing their Astromech and the technical readout of the device.
