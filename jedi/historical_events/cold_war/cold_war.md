# Introduction
The Cold War officially was only border skirmishes between rogue elements of the Republic and Sith Empire, yet all across the galaxy, both sides were supporting coups, revolutions, assassinations and even all-out civil war.
Without the Temple on Coruscant, the Order drifted homeless for a short period before Jedi Knight Satele Shan returned from the Deep Core with coordinates to the lost planet Tython.
As Jedi scouts prepared the planet for recolonization, the Order dealt with the loss of Grand Master Zym over the ruins of the Coruscant Temple and the defection of Master Dar'Nala to terrorism.
As a new Temple emerged on Tython, the Jedi resettled their ancient homeworld and began to slowly rebuild.
As Shan was appointed Grand Master, Jedi explored Tython forests and ruins, reconnecting with their roots and growing stronger in the Force.
Elsewhere in the Republic, planets like Balmorra and Alderaan were major battlegrounds where both sides suffered from treaty-breaking, but unofficial backing; all across the galaxy the Great Galactic War was igniting a second time.

Several new heroes emerged in this time period; these heroes were both of the Republic and the Sith Empire, and they grew more powerful and significant over time, eventually becoming the main fighters for their respective sides, as many significant ones fell in the Cold War.
Members of the Jedi Order who remained on Coruscant made up a special Jedi delegation within the Senate, while others tried to protect the ruins of the Jedi Temple and protect any of its remaining treasures.
The new heroes which emerged were believed to be the ones that would lead the Republic and Sith Empire to an all-out war that would be more devastating and dangerous than any other in the past.
