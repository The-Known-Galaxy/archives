# Introduction

The Battle of Corellia is not just a battle, but one of the key conflicts in the Galactic War.
The parties to the conflict were the revived Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic.
The conflict began at the beginning of 3640 BBY and ended at the end of the same year.
The attack was planned by Darth Decimus during the Cold War.
Thanks to a sophisticated interview, Decimus managed to persuade the entire government, the Corellian Council, to take their side.
The Emperor’s first son revealed his identity as Syo Bakarn to the Council to strengthen their loyalty to the Empire.
In 3642, the Treaty of Coruscant, which was maintaining peace in the Galaxy, was falling apart.
That’s why Darth Decimus started his plan to invade and seize control of Corellia.

# Section 1

While the Corellian Council capitulated, the Empire began to invade the planet.
It wasn’t really necessary, but Darth Decimus wanted to demonstrate the power of the Empire.
All communication was cut off immediately, leaving the planet lonely and without the support of the Republic.
The attack on the planet’s capital caused considerable damage to the civilian population, which was augmented by wild alien animals from the Coronet Zoo.
Overall, the invasion went almost perfectly with small setbacks, such as the destruction of the rocket tram system of Coronet City.
However, the citizens of Corellia weren’t going to submit to the Empire so easily.
For the duration of the occupation, the Empire kept having issues with rebeliants and sabotage.

When the Republic re-connected communication lines with Corellia, it immediately sent a fleet and an army to help the besieged planet.
Commander-in-Chief of the Republic was General Aves.
Republic forces soon established a bridgehead on the Shipwright Auxiliary Spaceport at Coronet’s Blastfield Shipyards.
Despite the strong and numerous attacks of the Empire, the Republic remained on the planet and sent more and more troops to the bridgehead.
The Republican command center was also set up in the Spin Library when the Legislative Building was under siege.
The fierce fighting over Axial Park was soon called the “Battle for Axial Park”, as both the Republic and Empire kept sending more and more troops to gain control of this crucial region.
However, after some time the Empire gained the upper hand and won the Battle for Axial Park.
After such glorious victory, Darth Decimus focused on the allied forces in Blastfied Shipyards.
He proceeded to launch bombarding strikes at the Republican Forces, however, the Anti-Air systems soon forced the Empire to focus on ground fighting.
Neither side could gain the upper hand.
However, the Emperor running out of patience was putting pressure on Darth Decimus to take over the sector and eliminate the remaining Republic forces.
However, the republic began to send reinforcement to aid its trapped forces.
Both sides didn’t hold back and the number of casualties kept rising.
Especially among the civilians who were dying from both Republic and Imperial shelling.
The Republic gained the upper hand managing to push the Empire back to the Legislative Building.
In the building, was where all Corellian Councilors aiding the Empire hid and it also served as a command post for Darth Decimus.
A crucial moment came with a final push into the Speaker’s Courtyard, where the commander of the Imperial Forces Darth Decimus faced his death and had fallen.
His death was broadcasted across the entire planet and brought despair to the Empire.
The Republic declared its victory, which left the remaining Imperial Forces in confusion.
They started to escape the planet by themselves, some of the Sith Lords including Darth Marr recognized the defeat of the Empire and ordered a retreat.

The Battle of Corellia was a crucial victory for the Republic, as it gave them hope for victory in the war.
The Empire was significantly weakened after the battle, as three members of the Dark Council had fallen during the conflict and two more died on other fronts.
The Imperial Army has also lost a tenth of its army on Corellia and didn’t regain its mighty power ever again.
