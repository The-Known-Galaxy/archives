# Introduction
In 3681 BBY when the Sith Empire had returned and started the Great Galactic War with the Galactic Republic, the Imperial Military had started a campaign to conquer the Minos Cluster.
This cluster was rich with resources and the resulting offensive would last for the whole twenty-eight years of the war.
Both the Jedi and Republic Army would battle the Imperial Military and it’s Sith Leaders around the whole sector for almost thirty years, three decades.
Among the many Jedi that was stationed at the cluster for long periods, Master Orgus Din had been seen fighting alongside Republic soldiers more than any other Jedi that survived.
When the Republic beat the Empire in 3667 BBY in the Battle of Alderaan, Harron Tavus would be recruited into Havoc Squad and eventually stationed at the cluster as well.
Tavus and Din became friends and would together lead the Republic Forces against the Imperials throughout the cluster.
 Some point before the end of the battle in 3653 BBY the Empire tried to invade the planet Karidepth, a world that had a main industry of foodstuff production.
Din and Tavus however, led a counterattack that successfully made the Imperials turn back and forced the Empire to abandon it’s invasion efforts.
Both men would be named “Heroes of Karidepth” and both continued to serve in the battle for the Minor Cluster until the Empire withdrew in 3653 BBY as an offer of peace.
