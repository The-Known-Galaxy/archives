# Introduction
The Battle of Umbara was one of the most infamous battles during the Clone Wars, where it saw republic forces seizing control of the former republic planet, Umbara.
The battle rostered many esteemed Jedi Generals, including Jedi Master Obi-wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Jedi General Saesee Tiin, and Jedi General Pong Krell.
Although the Battle of Umbara was successful, it was one of the bloodiest battles of the Clone Wars and a necessary win for the republic.

# Section 1
Before the battle, Umbaran Senator Mee Deechi was assassinated by Rodian Representative Lola Purs.
After news spread in Umbara about the death of Senator Deechi, the Umbarans seceded from the Republic.
This was a devastating loss for the Republic because Umbara was an important planet in the Great Kashyyyk Branch, a major hyperspace lane that connected the Republic to the Mid-rim.
To make matters even worse, the Umbarans aligned themselves with the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
With the increasing presents of CIS forces on Umbara and the vital position Umbara was located on the Great Kashyyyk Branch, the Republic sent their forces to the planet and started the Battle of Umbara.



# Section 2
The Battle of Umbara started with a space battle, having starfighter squadrons led by Jedi Commanders Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee, and gunship landings led by the Jedi Generals.
The Separatist Orbital Fleet was fierce, but the Republic eventually broke through and had the four Jedi Generals land in specific areas.
Jedi General Kenobi would lead the 212th Attack Battalion from the south, to push towards the Umbaran Capital.
Jedi Generals Saesee Tiin and Pong Krell would lead their forces from the east, to capture Umbaran bunkers near the Capital.
And Finally, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker would lead the 501st Legion from the north, to push towards the Capital from the opposing direction from Master Kenobi’s position.
Although this plan sounded good on the blueprint, the Jedi Generals all experienced heavy resistance from the Umbaran land forces, having the 501st Legion facing some of the worst of it.
The 501st had to capture a defensive ridge that stationed Umbaran Hover tanks, hordes of Umbaran Militia, and Starfighter strikes that would occasionally bombard platoons of clone troopers.
Nonetheless, the 501st was able to capture the ridge, but still faced heavy resistance when they tried to lay down camp on the ridge, due to Umbaran Militia using guerilla warfare.
The clone legion had to abandon the ridge and call in an airstrike, where the ridge would be bombarded by Y-wing bombers led by Clone Pilot Commander CC-2237 (Oddball).
From the east, clone units were able to capture Umbaran bunkers and were steadily moving towards the capital.
As the northern ridge was now carpet-bombed, the 501st now did the same, but news from Coruscant had Jedi General Anakin Skywalker called out of the front lines.
The 501st would now be under the command of General Pong Krell, as his forces already met with General Tiin’s forces in the east.



# Section 3
Jedi General Pong Krell’s battle plans and style were different from that of General Skywalker, as Krell planned to advance on the main road towards the capital.
This plan had lots of risks, but Clone Captain CC-7567 (Rex) followed the given plan, leading his platoon on the main road.
The plan ended up as a disaster, as the road was marked with minefields and the platoon faced an ambush from Umbaran Militia.
As a result, the platoon had to retreat to the main legion to drive off the Umbaran forces but was faced with a counterattack by more Umbaran Militia, this time with air support, so the clone legion was forced out of the main road.
Krell was furious at the CC-7567 (Rex) for his order to retreat, due to this causing the loss of the main road, even though Krell’s plan was reckless and had a high chance of failure.
Krell’s next order was to recapture the main road to the capital, until General Kenobi informed them of the Western Umbaran Airbase feeding supplies to the capital, which gave the other clone units a hard time from the southern and eastern fronts, making an advance towards the capital all but possible.
The 501st now were ordered to change route and secure the airbase, to cut off supply lines to the capital.
The fastest way to the airbase was going through a central gorge, where it was perfect for Umbaran ambushes.
Although the 501st could have looked for a more secure and safer route, Krell ordered the 501st to march towards the airbase through the gorge.
What happened was exactly as predicted, the Umbarans ambushed the 501st with a group of Impeding Assault Tanks, as the tanks dwindled the number of clones, before they were destroyed by RPS-6 Rocket launchers and thermal detonators.
What came after the Impeding Assault Tanks were worse, the Umbaran Airbase sent their best-armored unit, two Umbaran Mobile Heavy Cannons.
The 501st had nothing that could destroy the armored units, so in response, CC-7567 (Rex) sent Clone Trooper “Hardcase” and ARC Trooper ARC-5555 (Fives) to sneak into the enemy airbase and use Umbaran Starfighters to destroy the heavy cannons.
With the heavy cannons destroyed, the 501st pushed towards the airbase and took control.
With the airbase in Republic hands, the eastern and southern clone units were able to push towards the capital and lay down a siege, but discovered the capital now could bombard the clone units with missiles supplied by a Separatist supply ship.



# Section 4
As the space battle was leaning towards the Confederacy’s favor, defying orders to not commandeer Umbaran starfighters, ARC-5555 (Fives), Clone Trooper “Hardcase”, and Clone Trooper CT-5597 (Jesse) flew through the space battle and infiltrated the Separatist supply ship.
Successfully destroying the supply ship, at the cost of Hardcase’s life, turned the tide towards the Republic’s favor, as the space battle was now leaning towards the Republic’s victory and the clone units in the south and east now breached the city’s gates and it was only a matter of time till Umbara fell.
None of this mattered to Krell, as he was furious at the troopers would ignore his orders to not commandeer Umbaran starfighters.
He ordered ARC-5555 (Fives) and Clone Trooper CT-5597 (Jesse) to be executed, but against his orders and a few inspirational words from Fives caused the firing squad to refuse to execute the two heroic troopers.
Krell tolerated this and sent Torrent Company to intercept Umbaran soldiers, who he claimed were wearing 212th Attack Battalion armor.
Although Torrent Company intercepted the Umbaran soldiers, the Umbaran soldiers were not Umbaran, but rather a 212th platoon led by Clone Lieutenant “Waxer”.
Clone Captain “Rex” ordered a cease-fire and found out that the orders of the attack came from General Krell.
Furious with the discovery, Torrent Company and 212th troopers marched back towards the airbase to confront the General.
Krell revealed that he did give the order and turned against the Republic.
The General now had the clone units chase him, killing many of them in the process, but was subdued by a stun by Clone Trooper CT-5385 (Tup), where they imprisoned him in the airbase.
There, he was executed by Clone Trooper “Dogma”, not until revealing that he deliberately tried to sabotage the republic’s campaign to gain favor with Count Dooku.
After the death of General Pong Krell, the 501st discovered that the battle was over, as the 7th Sky Corps took control of the capital and remaining separatist warships were pulling out of the battle.
With the end of the Battle of Umbara, victory came at the cost of many lives and the Republic would have to spread more units from the high amount of casualties on Umbara.
