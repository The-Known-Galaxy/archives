# Introduction
The Battle of Foundry was a battle during the early moments of the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.
This war took place in 3642 BBY and was fought on the Foundry.
This battle was because of Darth Malgus discovering an ancient spaceship named the Foundry against a Jedi Master who commanded the ship.

# Section 1
Six hours off schedule due to hijacking, a ship named Donrins Sky had docked onto the Foundry.
Once docked, the sith team had engaged in combat with the defense squadron of the team filled with droids, Jedi, and republic soldiers.
They had then made it to the lead Jedi Master, which had tried to convince them for peace, which in turn failed.
The Imperial Expeditionary Fleet had then engaged against the fleet of the Republic just outside of the ship.
The Jedi Master was later revealed to be Revan, a Jedi Knight from three centuries ago who had been overcome with the dark side.



# Section 2
Once Revan had been revealed to be a Jedi Master, he had decided to confront the Empire and duel the Emperor.
In this battle, he had been betrayed by himself, which caused him to be defeated for three centuries.
During the imprisonment of Revan, he had been in a long mental battle while trying to convince the Emperor of how the dark side benefits him and why he should return to becoming Darth Revan, while Revan fights back saying peace is the best option.
After receiving his freedom, he had taken leadership of the Foundry to seek the downfall of the Sith and their legion.
During Revans escape, he had pleaded to the strike force of the Emperor to leave him and instead destroy him but refused.



# Section 3
Using the power of the Force, Revan proved to be a strong foe, but in the end, was not able to defeat the Empire’s top agents which resulted in his defeat.
After this battle, Darth Malgus had used the Foundry to build the New Empire and defend his new ship with his team, droids, and HK-47.
Although Revan had been assumed dead, he later reawakened on Rakata Prime in 3637 BBY, starting a new cult named the Order of Revan.
