# Introduction

The Unification Wars was a series of conflicts that led to several of the Core Worlds uniting to form the Galactic Republic.
Millennia before the war, the Rakatan Infinite Empire was the dominant power in the galaxy.
They enslaved many planets and sentient species on their Force-powered hyperdrive, until a plague ravaged their Empire.
They were stripped of their connection to the Force and could not prevent the slave uprising that followed.
This collapse allowed other powers such as Duros and Corellians to start to explore the galaxy using the Rakatan’s hyperdrive.

# Section 1

Before a Dominant power was established, the Unification Wars erupted around 25,053 BBY.
Warlord Zakrinand Minus, regarded as a near-invincible leader, commanded forces during the conflict.
The Jedi Order, consisting of Force-Sensitives, partook in this ongoing conflict, eventually becoming the winners of the wars by 25,053 BBY.
It is believed that the Jedi’s were aided by the Bendu monks during their fight.

# Section 2

Following the war, several planets from the Core World combined and the constitution for the Galactic Republic was ratified.
The founders of this new Republic were planets such as Coruscant, Corellia, Alderaan, and Duro.
Although wary of this new entity, the Jedi eventually joined a century later, taking on the role as peacekeepers.
The Bendu Emblem was adopted as the official symbol for the Republic.
The Republic would survive for twenty-five thousand years, enduring many conflicts that sought to overtake it.
