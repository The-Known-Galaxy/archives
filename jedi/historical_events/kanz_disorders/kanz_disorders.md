# Introduction
The Argazdans, originating from the planet Argazda and being descendents of human colonists developed various facial and physical changes.
Importantly, this race faced constant crime from the Ereesi species encouraging them to join the Galactic Republic.
The Republic only accepted this request due to the Argazdan being closely related to humans, and the Argazdan’s expressional desperation.

For many years, the Republic Navy relentlessly defended the Argazdans from the hatred-filled efforts of the Ereesi.
This lent time to the Argazdans who began building their own formidable military which would later be used to oppress the Lorrdians.
Ironically, the Argazdans departed from the Republic alliance citing that it was “corrupt and faithless” only to later exhibit the same characteristics.

It is unknown whether these characteristics stem from the Argazdan’s belief in Vianism or if it was from their many decades of suffering gifted to them by the Ereesi.

# Section 1
This term was essentially used to describe the wars and battles that the Argazdan engaged in for a long period of time.
The Argazdan’s also endured their own civil war with Loyalists rebelling.
These Loyalists caused more damage than would normally be permitted as the Argazdan navy was out eradicating the Ereesi homeworld of Ereesus.
Ereesus was literally razed to the ground with not a single life being spared.

Governor Myrial, the leader of the Argazdan at the time began a conquest of razing other planets and species.
One of these included the Amaltanna.
The Amaltanna were supported by the Lorddians which the fruitless Governor punished by enslaving the entire Lorrdians race.
This autocratic and dictatorial regime lasted hundreds of years with the Mandalorian and Sith wars preventing the Jedi from intervening.


The power that the Argazdan’s held was however, slowly eroded by the chains of time, and the last Governor made a pact of a demonic alien artisan shaper who was an expert in bioengineering.
The alien constructed a monster which was buried in the Slave Pits of Lorrd and only discovered later by the scientist mentioned in the Argazdan case study.



# Section 2
The Lorrdian Jedi Mari-Elan Nora led a task force into the Kanz Sector finally freeing over (500,000,000) Lorddians from their (300) year enslavement.
All in all, the disgusting disorders had resulted in the deaths of over (5) billion people.
This plague ended when the Kanz Sector was brought under Republic control.

This event will forever be a scar on the Jedi’s history, having failed to act sooner.
It is up to the reader to decide whether it is excusable that the Jedi had failed to act considering they were preoccupied with droid, sith and Mandalorian wars.
