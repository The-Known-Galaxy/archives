# Introduction

The Battle of Yavin was a major historical event in the galaxy.
It was sometimes referenced as the ‘Miracle of Yavin’ or even at times the ‘Battle of the Death Star’.
During this event, the Rebel Alliance destroyed and blew up the Death Star, one of their many major victories within the galaxy.

# Section 1

This historical event all started due to Jyn Erso during the Battle of Scarif.
Erso was able to steal the very detailed plans that represented the Death Star, which was a big battle station the Imperials were currently creating.
Leia Organa, a princess, somehow ended up with the Death Star plans, due to this, Darth Vader, the Dark Lord kidnapped Princess Organa and her crew, who were on the ship Tantive IV.
Princess Organa was rescued by a once nobleman by the name of Obi-Wan Kenobi and a couple others who were called: Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and a Wookie by the name of Chewbacca.
These members retreated to Yavin 4 with two droids R2-D2 and C-3PO with the stolen Death Star plans.
There was a chancellor named Chancellor Mon Mothma and people evacuated her into a shuttle, due to General Dodonna referencing her as ‘the core of the rebellion’.
Mothma made a plan to surrender to Emperor Palpatine.

General Dodonna created a plan and notified the rebel pilots of it and what would happen.
The imperial battle station, the Death Star had big defenses and were made for huge-scale assault.
However, the rebels used starfighters that could only fit one man inside them.
Due to the fact their vehicles were so small, they were able to go past the defenses .
The Death Star was greatly damaged due to this, and it blew up when a proton torpedo fired and hit the core.

# Section 2

The remaining rebel fighters and Solo and Skywalker returned to Yavin where they all celebrated the destruction of the Death Star and attended a celebration ceremony.
Once Mothma heard that they had won, she decided not to go along with the plan to surrender herself to Emperor Palpatine.
Sadly, shortly after the battle occurred, they were yet again forced out of their base on Yavin, meaning they had to escape from the Empire yet again.
Emil Graf, a space cartographer, made a theory saying their evacuation was interrupted by a star destroyed, however, the Rebels dismantled their crew and escaped.
The Rebels began to use the Empire’s weaknesses against them.
