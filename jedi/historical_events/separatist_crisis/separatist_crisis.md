# Introduction
By the time Dooku began organizing the Separatist Movement, the Republic was already effectively splintered.
As part of the Ruusan Reformations, the Republic dissolved its central military in favor of Planetary Security forces maintained by individual worlds.
However, many remote star systems could not afford strong defense forces, and so it fell to guilds like the Trade Federation to provide protection for these worlds.
In exchange for protection, these megacorporations often received the votes of these systems in the Senate, adding to the corruption and gridlock in which Coruscant was already mired.
           Among many weaker systems of little note resentment grew for the Republic that could not protect it.
These systems were some of the first to rally behind Dooku’s Separatist Movement.

# Section 1
On the other end, many stronger worlds gravitated towards Dooku as well, seeing an opportunity to grow their own power.
The stage for this was set before Dooku even entered the picture.
           In the eight years between his fall to the Dark Side of the Force and the Raxus Address, Dooku met with the leaders of thousands of star systems and some of the galaxy’s largest corporations.
Playing on fears set in place by Sith before him, Dooku began to spread sentiment that the Republic could not protect the systems of the galaxy, using the Battle of Naboo as a prime example.
On the other hand, he used the Republic’s post-Naboo treatment of the Trade Federation as an example of another sort to the commerce guilds: under the Republic, they would face nationalization.
           Dooku ensured that all was ready by the end of Palpatine’s term as Chancellor.
One week before Palpatine was scheduled to leave office, Dooku appeared before the whole galaxy on Raxus Prime.
His agents hacked a HoloNet transceiver on the world, and the Sith Lord broadcasted a fiery speech condemning the Republic for its corruption and casting the Jedi as overglorified leg-breakers of a tyrannical regime.



# Section 2
And then, before the entire galaxy, he declared the secession of a thousand star systems from the Republic, and the formation of a new government: the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
           Chaos broke out immediately.
Amidst a wave of declarations of secession, the Galactic Senate frantically voted to extend Palpatine’s second term as Supreme Chancellor for the duration of the Separatist Crisis.
Palpatine strongly urged for cool heads and unity, but it was to no avail.
Raxus, Agamar, Ukio, Metalorn, Serenno, Yag’Dhul, Geonosis, and Celanon all seceded in short order, bringing thousands of worlds with them.
The Republic was hopelessly divided.
The Separatist Crisis had begun.
           Some worlds seceded shortly after the Raxus Address, and would be known over the next few years as rabidly Separatist.
On the other hand, many Republic worlds - including Kuat and Fondor, which both broke ties with the Techno Union following the Raxus Address - became rabidly Loyalist, urging the Senate to recreate the Republic military and declare war on the fledgling CIS.
Others, like Corellia and Mandalore, declared neutrality.



# Section 3
But the worlds that saw the worst of the Separatist Crisis were worlds like Antar and Ansion: worlds now embroiled in fierce civil wars between Loyalist and Separatist factions.
           Antar 4 was the site of one of the most notorious battles in the Separatist Crisis, and marked when the Crisis truly turned violent.
Taking place eighteen months after the Raxus Address, Antar 4 - the moon home to the Gotal species - had come under the control of the Gotal Assembly for Separation, which backed the CIS.
However, the Antarian Rangers, a Jedi-allied Loyalist group, opposed secession, and kept the Antar System contested.

           During the New Year Fete Week of that year, however, open violence began.
The Roshu Sune, a militant splinter group in the Separatist Assembly, had placed sleeper agents within the Antarian Rangers, and activated them.
Many of the Rangers were massacred, and those offworld quickly returned home to avenge their fallen comrades.
The Republic responded with a Jedi-led assault, which was shredded by Separatist militants.
As a counterattack the Republic fired off several electromagnetic pulses across the moon, overwhelming the Gotals’ sensitive head cones and causing extreme pain for the entire population.
The Republic retained control of Antar 4, but had lost the support of the Gotals, and had shown the galaxy that it was not invincible.



# Section 4
Anti-Jedi sentiment began to grow on both sides at this time.
Many of the Separatists hated and feared the Jedi, who they saw as kidnappers and the mysterious servants of a tyrannical regime.
On the other side, many rabidly Loyalist groups distrusted the Jedi in equal measure.
After all, many said, was not Count Dooku himself a former Jedi?
The Jedi did not help their case by refusing to connect Dooku with violent Separatist attacks, even when the Confederate Head of State refused to condemn the attacks done in his name.
Bombings on Coruscant continued, seemingly at random.
           Over the course of the Separatist Crisis, the galactic government on Coruscant continued to prove ineffective.
The Financial Reform Act was initiated as a response to the Raxus Address and aimed to combat corruption in the Senate; however, after the assassination of one of the bill’s chief proponents, the vote was indefinitely postponed.
This spurred even more secessions, and seemed to confirm Dooku’s claims.
  Chief among those secessions were those of Ando and Sy Myrth.
Both brought hundreds of systems with them, bringing the total of Confederate member worlds above six thousand.
Ando, however, became the center of yet another civil war in short order.



# Section 5
he Andoan Free Colonies, in opposition to the militaristic Spiverelda government, refused to acknowledge Ando’s secession, and a bloody civil war began.
The Andoan Civil War lasted for three years, and would be a microcosm for the conflict brewing outside.
           The CIS would often be remembered in later years as having a backbone of major corporations, but in truth none of these openly backed Dooku until shortly before the Battle of Geonosis.
However, in secret their leaders conspired and built up massive droid armies nonetheless, and manipulated worlds into secession.
The Republic would not discover this until it was far too late.
           One of these manipulated worlds was Ansion.
A backwater grassy planet in a remote part of the Rim, Ansion seemed to have nothing significant about it - but not to the Confederacy.
Shu Mai, the Presidente of the Commerce Guild, pointed out to Count Dooku something about Ansion that had previously gone unnoticed: Ansion was the nexus of a complicated net of theories ranging from the Malarian Alliance to the Keitumite Mutual Military Treaty - meaning its secession would bring forty odd major worlds into the Confederate fold, and potentially more besides.



# Section 6
Shu Mai managed to unite the scattered Ansion clans into a Separatist coalition - but the Republic sent Jedi to stop it.
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luminara Unduli, with their Padawans, Anakin Skywalker and Barriss Offee, were sent to Ansion to settle the dispute and keep the planet in the Republic.
They were ultimately successful: a bright spot for the Republic, but merely a distraction from the storm massing in the galaxy at large.
           By the time of the Mission to Ansion, the Confederacy was composed of more than ten thousand star systems, with the number rapidly growing each day.
In the Galactic Senate, militarism spread, and soon a Military Creation Act was put forward, which would recreate the Republic Military.
Many Senators opposed it, including Bail Organa of Alderaan, Mon Mothma of Chandrila, and Padmé Amidala of Naboo.
           But when Senator Amidala arrived on Coruscant to vote against the act, her star cruiser was bombed, killing dozens of Naboo personnel, and prompting the Supreme Chancellor to put her under the protection of two Jedi: Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker.
The assassin tried again that night, but after a high-speed chase was caught by the Jedi.
The bounty hunter responsible, Zam Wesell, was shot before she could give up her employer by a man in a suit of Mandalorian armor.



# Section 7
While his apprentice took Amidala to Naboo to be guarded more securely, Kenobi attempted to find the identity of the armored man who shot Wesell.
After pinpointing the origin of the dart used to kill Zam, he tracked the man to Kamino, a remote Wild Space world above the galactic plane.
What he discovered there changed the history of the galaxy forever.
           Shortly before the Battle of Naboo, a Jedi Master known as Sifo-Dyas had a vision of a war that would split the Republic in two.
At the urging of his close friend, Master Dooku, Sifo-Dyas had traveled to Kamino and placed an order for a massive clone army to be grown for the Jedi over the course of ten years.
He said the army was for the Republic.
           But Dooku, operating under the name Darth Tyranus, had Sifo-Dyas killed, and took over the project.
He selected Jango Fett for the job of clone template, a Mandalorian bounty hunter whom he had met on Galidraan years prior.
Fett accepted, demanding that he would receive a high salary and that he would receive the first clone with no genetic tampering to raise as a son.
The Kaminoans agreed, and he named his new son Boba.



# Section 8
Ten years later, Obi-Wan Kenobi entered Tipoca City to find that the first batch of clones was ready - the Kaminoans had grown a massive army, with two thousand units ready and a million more on the way.
Though Kenobi assumed “units” to mean individual clones, the Jedi later learned that it actually referred to platoons - and that the army totalled more than forty million clones, with many more to come.
Kenobi reported this to the Jedi Council, who found the report disturbing - Sifo-Dyas had never been commanded to place the order, and never discussed it with any of them.
           Kenobi was then taken to meet Jango Fett - and identified him as the very man who had killed Zam Wesell.
Recognizing the Jedi from a few nights before, Jango and Boba immediately prepared to leave Kamino.
Though they were able to escape Kenobi in Jango’s ship, Slave I, the Jedi had planted a tracking device on it.
Kenobi then followed the Fetts to Geonosis.
           On Geonosis, Dooku had at last gathered the heads of the large corporations that had come to support him, and officially organized the CIS.



# Section 9
The beings present - several Senators and the heads of the Trade Federation, Techno Union, Banking Clan, Commerce Guild, Corporate Alliance, Geonosian Industries, Hyper-Communications Cartel, Quarren Isolation League - became the Separatist Council, and pooled their droid armies into a vast fighting force, which was being expanded in the catacomb factories below.
The CIS was now a powerful military threat.
           Obi-Wan Kenobi reported these findings to the Jedi Council, but was captured by Geonosian guards - as were secret lovers Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala, who attempted to follow and rescue him.
As all three faced death in a Geonosian execution arena, the Jedi reported their findings to the Senate.
Two hundred and twelve Jedi, led by Mace Windu, departed for Geonosis to rescue the trio.
           Back on Coruscant, the vote on the Military Creation Act was interrupted by the news of Dooku’s actions on Geonosis.
The stunned Senators quickly voted to give more emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor.
Palpatine accepted with seeming reluctance, and immediately created a Grand Army of the Republic.
Jedi Grand Master Yoda departed to collect the Clone Army from Kamino, and took nearly two hundred thousand troopers to Geonosis.
           There they found that Windu’s rescue had gone badly.



# Section 10
Only thirty Jedi remained (as well as Senator Amidala), and they were surrounded by massive hordes of Separatist battle droids.
With little time to lose, Yoda ordered the clones to land and create a perimeter around the survivors, spiriting them out of the arena before landing en masse in the wide flats outside to combat the already-deployed Droid Army.
The Battle of Geonosis kicked into high gear, and open war had begun.

           The Battle of Geonosis was a Republic victory, but an incomplete one.
The entire Separatist Council escaped, as well as Count Dooku and most of the Confederacy’s military leaders.
Anakin Skywalker had lost a hand in the battle, and many Jedi lost their lives.
Vast numbers of battle droids escaped aboard corporate warships.
Geonosis was in Republic hands, but only in name and on the surface: in the catacombs below the Geonosians schemed to take back their world.

           The CIS claimed Raxus Secundus as its capital and moved the Separatist Parliament to it.
Sev’rance Tann, Dooku’s favored general, was made Supreme Commander of the massive force that was the new Confederate Military.
The Republic brought in the first three million clone troopers of its order immediately, and sent them off aboard assault ships to early battlefronts.
Only one thing was certain - Clone Wars had just begun.
