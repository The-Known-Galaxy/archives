# Introduction
The Battle of Endor, which took place in 4 ABY between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire, was one of the most significant battles of the Galactic Civil War.
The deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader, as well as many other prominent Imperial officials, and the destruction of the Death Star II,  was a blow the Empire could not recover from.

# Section 1
When the Rebel Alliance learned that the Empire was building a second Death Star above Endor, they started planning an attack against this station.
Their goal was to destroy this Death Star, just like they did to the first.
Spies had also informed the Rebel leadership that not only were the Death Star's protection systems inadequate, but that the Emperor himself would be overseeing the superweapon's completion.
The Alliance prepared an attack on the unfinished space station, seeing an opportunity to deal a debilitating blow to the Empire.
One group of Rebels would fight on the surface of the moon in an attempt to destroy the Death Star's shield generator, while another would fight in space, assaulting the battle station in Endor's orbit once the Death Star's protective shield was removed.
Palpatine had purposefully given false information to the Rebels, revealing that the Death Star was operational and ready for action.
In addition, the Emperor had a fleet of Star Destroyers waiting to ambush the Rebels.



# Section 2
Onboard the seized shuttle, Tydirium, the Rebels took the Emperor's bait and sent a group to Endor.
Solo piloted the shuttle to the moon's surface after using a stolen clearance code that the Executor cleared, despite it being old.
After sensing Vader on the Executor, Luke began to have second thoughts about joining the mission; he feared Vader would sense his presence through the Force and jeopardize the entire operation.
Vader had certainly discovered his son and had ordered the ship to pass before reporting to the Emperor.
Solo’s team landed and the mission could proceed as planned.



# Section 3
After arriving on the planet, Solo's party made their way through the forest until they came across two Imperial scout warriors.
Solo tried to sneak up on the soldiers, but his plan backfired when he stepped on a twig, revealing his location and forcing him to confront them openly.
Two additional nearby Scout Troopers were alerted by the disturbance and escaped on speeder bikes to report to the main Imperial base.
In pursuit, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa mounted the speeder bikes of the troops Solo had killed.
Skywalker and Organa found themselves chasing the 2 Troopers and eventually caught up to them, preventing the Troopers from alerting the Base.
Leia however, got separated from Luke and did not return to the rendezvous point in time.
Skywalker, Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 started a search for her in the forest.
The rest of the group continued with the mission objective.



# Section 4
The group searching for Organa got caught by Ewoks and taken to their village.
Organa herself, on the other hand, had been found by Wicket Wystri Warrick, a native Ewok, after she had been knocked unconscious by crashing her speeder bike.
Wicket was originally wary of Organa, unsure if she was a friend or foe because she was human and the nearby stormtroopers had slain numerous Ewoks.
She gained his trust after they were ambushed by Scout Troopers and fought together to defeat them.
He then escorted her back to his village.
After being kidnapped by the Ewoks and transported to Bright Tree Village, where they were to be sacrificed, she was reunited with Han, Luke, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2.
If Skywalker hadn't persuaded the Ewoks to help them by levitating C-3PO on his god-throne, the Rebel heroes would have perished.
The Rebels were anointed as formal members of the Ewok tribe after explaining their narrative.
One of the Ewoks also indicated that he knew the quickest path to the Endor shield generator, prompting Han Solo to question C-3PO which way, as well as their need for their weapons and fresh food, immediately after the latter revealed this.



# Section 5
That night, after inquiring about Leia Organa's real mother, Luke Skywalker disclosed to her that she was his sister and that Darth Vader was their father, shocking the Princess.
Skywalker left the Ewok village with a twofold purpose: to hide his comrades from discovery and to surrender to Vader in an attempt to sway him away from the evil side, believing that Vader had sensed his presence and had come to the moon in search of him.
The Rebels descended onto a secret entry to the Imperial bunker the next day, fully rendezvoused with each other and accompanied by an army of Ewok warriors.
In an attempt to create a diversion, one of the Ewoks, Paploo, climbed aboard a nearby speeder bike and raced away into the forest, initially causing the Rebels some fear due to the high chance of being caught.
After most of the Scout Troopers defending the entrance bolted in pursuit of the Ewok, Solo and the rest of the rebels snuck into the bunker, enticing the last trooper towards the waiting task force and forcing him to surrender, and began setting explosives after capturing the Imperials within.
They were attacked by another force of Imperials commanded by Colonel Dyer and then Lieutenant Renz after the former was shoved beyond a railing to his death by General Solo, who led them out of the bunker where they were confronted by hundreds of stormtroopers and AT-STs.
The Rebels and Ewoks swiftly took these Troopers out and blew the base up.
The ground operation was a success.



# Section 6
The Alliance Fleet enters hyperspace at the same time the commandos were caught by the Imperials and moved to attack the Death Star, which appeared to be unshielded.
Sensors were not detecting the residue of an active or deactivated shield, which meant that the Empire was jamming the Alliance and the shield was likely still up.
They backed up to avoid colliding with the shield, though some pilots failed to do so in time and collided with it.
Once an Imperial fleet arrived, the Rebels quickly figured out it was a trap.



# Section 7
As the Imperials released the TIEs into space, the battle began.
The TIEs destroyed some of the smaller warships, and both fleets attacked from afar.
TIE bombers eventually entered the fray, requiring multiple squadrons to fight them before they could reach the fleet.
They next had to defend the medical frigate, which had been badly damaged by the TIE bombers and fighters earlier.
The Star Destroyer fleet, on the other hand, did not attack the Rebels after being commanded to do so by the Emperor, who planned to surprise the Rebels by employing the fleet simply to prevent them from fleeing.
The Emperor's previous "surprise" to his officers was soon revealed to be a demonstration of the battle station's operability: the Death Star II destroyed Liberty with its main superlaser.
The Rebels were taken aback because they had assumed the Death Star's weaponry systems were not yet functioning.
Calrissian convinced Ackbar out of retreat, reminding the admiral that this was their only chance to take out the Death Star II.
Calrissian proposed to Admiral Gial Ackbar that the Rebel fleet attack the Imperial Navy at point-blank range, expecting that the Death Star would hold fire to prevent Imperial ships from being destroyed, and if it didn't succeed, they'd at least take a few Imperial ships with them.
Soon, the two sides were fighting at ranges of only a few hundred metres, and the Death Star was forced to reduce its firing.
This however did not prevent the Battle Station from taking out multiple Rebel ships.



# Section 8
Admiral Ackbar ordered the fighter squadrons to attack the Death Star's main reactor after receiving information that the Rebel strike team on Endor had destroyed the shield generator.
With many TIE Fighters and TIE Interceptors from Scythe Squadron and the 181st Imperial Fighter Wing in pursuit, General Calrissian took advantage of the new tactical situation that had occurred earlier and led all of the surviving fighters from Red and Gold Squadrons into the Death Star's superstructure.
General Calrissian ordered the majority of the remaining fighters to split up and return to the surface in order to draw the attention of a few of the remaining fighters.
In the end, this succeeded, as the Millennium Falcon and Antilles were pursued by only two TIE fighters.
However, the Millennium Falcon suffered minor damage when Lando Calrissian accidentally scraped part of the Millennium Falcon against the overhead while navigating through the battle station, resulting in the rectenna of the ship being knocked clean off.
After a long time of navigating through the inside of the Death Star, Antilles and General Calrissian made it to the Death Star's main reactor chamber.
Antilles used proton torpedoes to hit the reactor core's power regulator, while Calrissian went after the core itself, rushing out of the core tube and narrowly escaping just as the core erupted behind them.
The pursuing TIE interceptors, on the other hand, were unable to avoid the resultant firestorm and were destroyed while pursuing the Millennium Falcon near the exit.
This resulted in the Death Star blowing up and the Rebellion winning this battle.



# Section 9
During the space and ground battle, Luke Skywalker was on the Death Star, after he got taken there by Vader.
Luke’s attempt to turn Vader back to the light side had failed, and he was in Palpatine's room together with Vader and Palpatine.
As Luke was watching his friends of the Rebel Alliance fall into Palpatine's trap as Palpatine tried to turn Luke to the dark side of the Force.
Luke tried to assassinate Palpetine, he was however not successful in doing so, as Vader blocked his attempt.
Luke then engaged in a duel with Vader, in which Vader tried to turn Luke to the dark side as well.
Luke gave into the attempts, and charged at Vader, using the dark side to boost his physical powers.
Vader was taken by surprise and was quickly beaten by Luke.
Vader lost his footing and crashed against a railing on the side of the bridge as uke continued to strike him with ferocious power punches.
After a few more blows, Luke used an undercut to push Vader's lightsaber away and brought his weapon down on Vader's wrist, severing Vader's weapon hand and knocking him to the ground.
Sidious was smiling and declaring his joy with Luke's power as Luke held his defenseless father at bladepoint.
Luke took his prosthetic hand from his lightsaber and glanced down at it as Palpatine prodded him to finish Vader and take his position at the Dark Lord's side.
Luke recognized he was on the verge of replicating Vader's fate as he glanced from it to the severed stump of Vader's own mechanical hand, and took a long breath to calm himself.
Luke declared that he would never succumb to the dark side, deactivating his lightsaber and tossing it aside, reaffirming his Jedi status.



# Section 10
Palpatine, being enraged that he had failed to turn Luke, declared that if Luke did not turn, he would die.
Once he said that, he unleashed his Force Lightning towards Luke, who was unable to act against it.
As Luke fell down to the floor, screaming of pain, he begged his father to help him.
Vader did not give in.
Palpatine stopped torturing Luke after a few more moments and told him that his time had come.
He resumed his attack, preparing to ramp up the intensity of his lightning to fatal levels.
However, unnoticed behind him, beneath the mantle of Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker, unable to bear the sight of his son screaming in pain, found himself in a similar position to that of twenty-three years ago, when he made the decision to save Sidious from Mace Windu, who had been killed by the Emperor, and this began to bring back all of Anakin's painful memories.
The decisions he made back then had led him down this path, had led him to lose everything and everyone he ever loved.
Those decisions led him to kill hundreds of Jedi, including his old Master and led him to lose his wife.
But, as he realized, he didn’t have to lose his son.
Anakin Skywalker started to fight Vader and at that very moment, Darth Vader was no more.
Anakin Skywalker grabbed Palpatine, ending his attacks on Luke.
Anakin threw Palpatine down the reactor shaft, ending the life of his old Master.
The Sith Order was destroyed.



# Section 11
Luke got back up and helped his father get to a shuttle, as the station was being evacuated.
Vader’s suit had been compromised by the Force Lightning Palpatine unleashed and Anakin realized he wasn’t going to make it.
Luke laid Anakin down on the ship’s ramp and with his last wish, Vader asked Luke to remove his helmet, so he could see him with his own eyes.
Shortly after this, he passed away.
Luke took his body with him on the shuttle and departed from the station, which was about to blow up.



# Section 12
The Empire had been defeated once more, with this devastating blow by the rebellion, it slowly started to fall apart.
The remaining parts of the Empire were hunted down and destroyed.
The victory in the battle of Endor was celebrated on Endor, together with the Ewoks.
The people all around the galaxy were now free of the Empire’s reign.
The new Republic and the Jedi Order started building and balance had been restored.
The Battle of Endor was a major turning point in history and the galaxy was at peace once again.
