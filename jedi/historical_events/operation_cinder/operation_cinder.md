# Introduction

After the devastating Battle of Endor and the death of Emperor Palpatine, the rest of the Imperial fleet were given a new objective.
Operation Cinder was to commence immediately.
The late Emperor had planned to punish his own Empire for failing to stop the rebels.
Messenger droids were sent to give each high ranking officer a different world they would make suffer for either supporting the Rebel Alliance or for their weakness to stop the destruction of the second Death Star.
Many worlds from across the galaxy were targeted such as Commenor and Nacronis.
Even planets that were known for their loyalty to the Empire, like Vardos, and the Emperorâ€™s own homeworld, Naboo.
Each flagship carried Climate disruption arrays to their destinations and deployed them facing the most important and populated cities.
These beams caused electrical storms and even hurricanes that lead to massive destruction while killing rebels, civilians and Imperial forces.
These satellites were taken out by the Rebel Alliance around the Battle of Jakku.
However, some planets that were damaged by the satellites were given a so-called ash rain that lasted many, if not hundreds of years.
