# Introduction
The Clone Wars were a war that took place from 22 - 19 BBY.
This war was dubbed “The Clone Wars” because of the vast army of Clone Troopers utilized by the Republic to form their main offensive body.
The war ended with the Great Jedi Purge and brought the galaxy into the Age of the Empire.
This war was mostly started and ended by Darth Sidious, who posed as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.
The Clone Wars were pivotal in the galaxy’s history and shaped the current events within the galaxy today.

# Section 1
The Clone Wars were the result of Sith Lord Darth Sidious, formerly the disciple of Darth Plagueis, carrying out the Sith Grand Plan.
This was a scheme created by the sith that focused on complete political manipulation of the galaxy’s planets and to carry it out, Sidious played to both sides, as Chancellor Palpatine for the Republic, and Sidious for the opposing forces.
Sidious planned to shift the Galactic Republic to the Galactic Empire, and bring about a golden age for Sith.

After the Galactic Senate had passed 2 pieces of legislation that declared that the Outer Rim was now a free trade zone, they had given immense power to the Trade Federation, which was a Nemoidian cartel.
Because of these laws, not only did they have complete control of trade within the outer rim, but they also gained many spots on the Galactic Senate.
The delicate issue of the Outer Rim polarized the senate, with sides being taken.
During this time, two groups popped up.
Firstly, a faction referred to as the Militarists had been calling for the Republic Military to be brought back up to its former glory, to keep the Outer Rim in control.
The second group was the Nebula Front, a terrorist group that declared war by any means necessary on the Trade Federation.
While these two groups further complicated the issue and caused a storm of politics, Senator Palpatine began his term as a senator representing the Chromell sector.
Little did anyone know, however, that Palpatine was actually Darth Sidious, and had carefully set into place each conflict to jumpstart the Sith Grand Plan, which was a scheme to create a war that would bring about the end of the Galactic Republic through political manipulation.

The Battle of Naboo was where the personalities, Sidious and Palpatine, worked in tandem to create a mass conflict.
This invasion began when Darth Sidious ordered the Trade Federation to create a blockade.
This incident made the current chancellor, Supreme Chancellor Valorum, seem impotent to stop the conflict on Naboo.
As Palpatine, Sidious deceived Queen Padme Amidala to declare a Vote of No Confidence, which, if successful, would remove Valorum from office.
During this, not only did Sidious murder his master, Darth Plagueis, and become a Sith Lord, but also became Supreme Chancellor by an empathetic senate vote.
Finally, the Sith Lord was at the head of the Galactic Republic.



# Section 2
The Trade Federation’s invasion of Naboo caused the death of Jedi Master Qui-Gon-Jinn, who was killed at the hands of Darth Maul during the conflict.
On top of this, events that had transpired while Queen Amidala was attempting to escape from Naboo to Coruscant had revealed the discovery of the force-sensitive Anakin Skywalker, who was surmised by Qui-Gon-Jinn to be the prophesied Chosen One, a being said to bring balance to the force.
After Qui-Gon’s untimely death, Anakin was assigned as a padawan to Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was promoted to Jedi Knight.

Unfortunately for Sidious, his apprentice, Darth Maul, had also been killed in the conflict during the Invasion of Naboo.
In lieu of Maul, Sidious decided that Jedi Master Count Dooku, who had had his faith in the Republic shattered after their perceived impotence over the Battle of Galidraan, and their lack of action in Naboo, was a good candidate for turning into a Sith.
After Dooku had betrayed and killed his friend, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, he was officially converted into Sith Lord Darth Tyrannus, and became the Sith puppet for Sidious to carry out his bidding.
However, before his death, Sifo-Dyas, foreseeing war, decided to contact the Kaminoans to have them build a clone army for the Republic.
However, what he did not realize is that Sidious was one step ahead of him in this matter.
Sidious, however, was caught off guard by the fact that the army had been discovered before he wanted it to be.
Count Dooku appointed bounty hunter Jango Fett to be the template for this clone army, and the inhibitor chip originally conceived by Sifo-Dyas to be a failsafe for rogue Jedis, became the catalyst for the Clones to perceive the Jedi as gone rogue and kill them in the Great Jedi Purge.

While this clone army was being prepared, Palpatine’s eight-year term was coming to an end.
However, because of this, Count Dooku finally emerged into the spotlight on Raxus Prime, and declared the creation of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, an organization of different governments and organizations designed with the goal to secede from the Republic.
This triggered a wave of organizations and governments seceding to join the Confederacy, which caused the Separatist Crisis.
Out of fear, Palpatine’s term was extended past the permitted amount to keep order within the Senate.

Subsequently, tensions between both the Separatists or Confederacy and the Galactic Republic grew, with Dooku appointing Dark Acolytes, further extensions of himself, who included Asajj Ventress, Sev’rance Tann,  Sora Bulq, Tol Skorr, Kadrian Sey, Artel Darc, Karoc, Vinoc, Saato, Trenox, and Jedi Master Quinlan Vos for some time.
On top of this, Dooku arranged for a shuttle crash which caused the disfigurement of the Kaleesh warrior Qymen jai Sheelal, whose body was taken to Geonosis and repaired, as well as had support given to his people by the InterGalactic Banking Clan, in exchange for leading the Confederacy Droid Army.
Finally, all the pieces had been set in place for the Sith to begin The Clone Wars with the Battle of Geonosis.



# Section 3
Battle of Geonosis

After a bomb attack aimed at killing Senator Padme Amidala on Corusant, and a subsequent second attack, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi was given the task of uncovering the mastermind behind the assassination attempts on Amidala’s life, while his padawan, Anakin Skywalker, escorted the Senator back to Naboo.
Kenobi was led to Kamino through his search, where he discovered the Clone Army, which at this time had 200,000 units, with a projected 1,000,000 in production.
Here he also met Jango Fett, who attempted to flee to Geonosis, but was followed by the Jedi Knight.
When Kenobi arrived on Geonosis, he realized that the Separatists were creating a massive droid army to strike at the defenseless Republic, but was captured by the Separatists.
However, he managed to get a message to the Republic before his capture.
Meanwhile, Mace Windu ordered Anakin Skywalker to stay where he was with Amidala on Tatooine.
However, Amidala wanted to go to Geonosis to free Kenobi, so the pair traveled to the planet, where they were captured.
Following their capture, Kenobi, Skywalker, and Amidala were all sentenced to be executed at the behest of Archduke Poggle the Lesser, who was later revealed to be a Separatist leader.
With the knowledge of the droid army, Chancellor Palpatine legalized the use of the Clone Army within the Republic’s offensive force.

Following this, a Jedi strike team, headed by Mace Windu, traveled to Geonosis in order to free the Jedi and Senator.
On Geonosis, they stormed the Petranaki Arena, where the three were being executed.
The battle within this arena resulted with many casualties for the Jedi, but also the death of Jango Fett, the clone template.
This was also where the Jedi faced B2 Super Battle droids for the first time, and were overpowered by their weaponry.

The Jedi, despite fighting valiantly, were getting overpowered under opposing forces, and had made the decision to fight to the end.
Fortunately, under Jedi Master Yoda’s command, the Clone Army dropped into the arena from Republic gunships, thus saving the strike team from an untimely death.
The clones engaged the droid army to prevent their escape.
In the air, clone pilots led by Adi Gallia took out numerous Trade Federation Gunships, and clone commandos, namely of the Delta Squad, took out many Separatist forces and leaders, such as Sun Fac, who was Archduke Poggle the Lesser’s chief lieutenant.

Meanwhile, Count Dooku, seeing the losing battle, fled with plans for a Separatist “Ultimate Weapon” to a secret hangar.
However, he was cut off by Obi-Wan Kenobi and his padawan, Anakin Skywalker, while on his way there.
Dooku managed to best the two, and severed Skywalker’s forearm, before he was confronted by Yoda, and had to use trickery to escape.
Dooku escaped to Coruscant, where he met with Sidious in Sector 943.
(aka.
The Works) Though Geonosis had been a loss, the two were focused on the long game.



# Section 4
Subsequently, tensions between both the Separatists or Confederacy and the Galactic Republic grew, with Dooku appointing Dark Acolytes, further extensions of himself, who included Asajj Ventress, Sev’rance Tann,  Sora Bulq, Tol Skorr, Kadrian Sey, Artel Darc, Karoc, Vinoc, Saato, Trenox, and Jedi Master Quinlan Vos for some time.
On top of this, Dooku arranged for a shuttle crash which caused the disfigurement of the Kaleesh warrior Qymen jai Sheelal, whose body was taken to Geonosis and repaired, as well as had support given to his people by the InterGalactic Banking Clan, in exchange for leading the Confederacy Droid Army.
Finally, all the pieces had been set in place for the Sith to begin The Clone Wars with the Battle of Geonosis.



# Section 5
Following the Battle of Geonosis, war had now become inevitable for both the Republic and Separatists.
The Clone Army was deployed to find and hunt down Separatists, and defeat the Confederacy for good.
These clones were led by Jedi Knights, and this marked the first time the Jedi had collectively taken up arms to fight since the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, marking the severity of this conflict.

The Republic’s strategy was largely crafted by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who established sector armies, which were large bodies of troopers that covered areas of priority.
Each sector army numbered 150,000 clone troopers initially, but this number expanded largely as the war continued.
Under command of Jedi Masters, the main purpose of these armies was to be reactionary, incase attacks happened within these sectors, and they were divided under the 1/4/16/64 plan created by Chancellor Palpatine.
This plan divided them into 1 corps operation, 4 brigade-level operation, 16 regiment-level operations, and 64 battalion-level operations.
The Republic also utilized Planetary Security Forces, which were small defensive deployments.
Due to this, many battles during the Clone Wars were fought without use of Clone Troopers or Droid armies.

The Republic fought rather defensively, though it launched some successful attacks.
Most attacks by the Republic were usually raids on a small scale, and were mostly inconsequential.
The Separatists, however, utilized a stateless strategy, knowing their army was far outnumbered by the Galactic Republic.
This strategy mostly focused on attacking where the Republic could not, and utilizing their spread space to their advantage.
Behind the scenes, Darth Sidious was controlling most of the actions of the Separatists indirectly through Count Dooku, his apprentice.

Many battles were fought by both the Republic and Separatists, and further increased tensions between the two groups.
The first year of battle consisted mainly of preparations for the long war, and saw mostly prosperity for both sides.
The second consisted of far more action, and saw humiliation for the Republic and victory for the Confederacy in many places, and the final year of the battle saw the culmination of Sidious’ motives, and The Great Jedi Purge.



# Section 6
Order 66

One of the main contributors to the downfall of the Republic was Anakin Skywalker, who had been manipulated and lied to by Sidious, whom he considered a father figure.
Through Palpatine’s decievement, Anakin began to resent the Jedi, and Palpatine further played into this, offering him more than the Jedi ever could.
Palpatine eventually revealed he was Darth Sidious, knowing that Anakin would report this to the Jedi Council.
However, when Jedi Master Mace Windu arrived along with Jedi Masters Kit Fisto, Saesee Tiin, and Agen Kolar, Skywalker arrived against Windu’s wishes, and under deception of Sidious, betrayed Windu, cutting off his lightsaber wielding hand, giving Sidious time to throw him out of the Coruscant window to his death with Force Lighting.
Anakin’s betrayal completely transformed him into Darth Vader, a Sith Lord.
His first task was to go into the Jedi Temple and eliminate all the Jedi within.
This event marked the beginning of the Great Jedi Purge.

On Sidious’ side, he carried out a secret protocol known as Order 66, which activated the Clone Troopers’ inhibitor chips, making them view the Jedi as traitors to the Republic.
Almost instantly, tens of Jedi were killed by the troopers, while Vader commenced Operation:Knightfall, a protocol to kill all Jedi within the Temple, regardless of rank.
Many prominent Jedi were killed during this operation, and after this purge, there was little opposition left.
After Vader’s mission, he traveled to Mustafar, and slaughtered every single one of the Separatist leaders who assumed they would be rewarded.
Following this, Vader deactivated the droid army, to force Separatists to surrender to the Galactic Republic, which would soon be converted by Sidious.
The Great Jedi Purge had ended, and the Age of the Galactic Empire had begun.
However, certain Jedi had survived the purge, notably Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi, both of whom would go into exile and eventually raise Luke Skywalker to become a Jedi, setting off a chain of events that would result in a new Jedi Order being established.

To summarize, the Clone Wars were a large-scale conflict characterized by the vast armies of Clone Troopers utilized by the Galactic Republic.
This war was headed by Darth Sidious, who used it as a way to carry out the Sith Grand Plan, and bring about the Age of the Empire.
This war, despite only lasting three years, was pivotal in shaping the current hierarchy within the galaxy today.
