# Introduction

Occuring from 137ABY onwards, the mission to Prakith in short was conducted by the Sith Lord Darth Wyyrlok III in order to acquire a cure for Darth Krayt.
Darth Krayt at the time was suffering from the implications of Yorik-Kul implants gifted to him by the Yuuzhan Vong.

Wyyrlok III had spent countless days researching Sith archives for answers and any form of antidote.
He came upon a holocron belonging to the Dark Lord Darth Andeddu.
This was important as Andeddu was famous for supposedly having the ability to preserve his body long after death.

Wyrlok III embarked on a mission to Prakith, which was Andeddu’s homeworld in hopes of finding information regarding this method of immortality that ANdeddu had used.

The Chief Lieutenant, Wyrlok III encountered a cult of Sith named the Malevolence who prohibited the man from entering.
He had however come too far to quit, and had them all executed except one named Gerlun.
Gerlun was used to awaken Andeddu by sacrificing his own body.

Andeddu and the Lieutenant engaged in combat upon awakening as Andeddu refused to share his secrets.
The Lieutenant mercilessly killed Andeddu, who now lay dead for a second time.
He now left Prakith without gaining any more progress towards finding an antidote for his master.

# Section 1

At the beginning of the Second Imperial Civil War, a man named A’Sharad Hett who later became Darth Krayt was captured by the Yuuzhan Vong and implanted with their feared Yorik-Kul slave seeds.
This drained power from the Sith and essentially sent him telekinetic commands from a yammosk or dhuryam.
It would slowly make it’s victims brain dead which motivated Krayt to seek all means to heal it.
He even later turned to Cade Skywalker for assistance.

# Section 2

The conflict between Andeddu and Wyrrlok III was both perilous and filled with darkness.
The two clashed for a while, lashing out shards of lightning and utilising the Force to best eachother.
However, Andeddu’s fault came when Wyrrlok III sensed that he was afraid of death.

The Lieutenant used the Force to launch lava and rocks at the Artefacts around Andeddu’s tomb.
Andeddu, believing these illusions to be real, and treasuring his artefacts was distracted long enough for Wyyrlok III to cover him in real lava and flames.

The man perished for a second time due to his fear of death, triggered by the fear that he would lose the knowledge he had spent many years to get.

# Section 3

As honourable as Darth Wyrrlok III’s mission was, he later betrayed Darth Krayt anyways, sighting one of the most famous Sith philosophies by Darth Bane.
That there should only ever be two sith, one to have power, and another to crave it.
