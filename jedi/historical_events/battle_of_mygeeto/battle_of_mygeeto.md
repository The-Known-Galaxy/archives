# Introduction
The Battle of Mygeeto was one of the largest and longest operations conducted in the Clone Wars.
It saw some of the harshest and most hectic scenes of warfare in history, which resulted in many casualties presented in both the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
Known Jedi presented in the Battle of Mygeeto included Jedi General Ki-Adi Mundi, Jedi Knight Rivi-Anu, Jedi Knight Eon, and two unidentified knights.
Although the Battle of Mygeeto was drawn out for two years in the Clone Wars, it was one of the major systems fought for, being part of the Triad of Evil, and allowed military figures to rise from the battle.

# Section 1
Mygeeto was a colony of the Banking Clan Guild, where it saw mining and resource operations due to the rich natural resources it presented in shipbuilding and warship construction.
The planet was also used by the Banking Clan as credit vaults, where the wealthy class would store their credits to avoid taxes conducted on many other planets under the rule of the Galactic Republic.
When the Clone Wars started, Mygeeto was a major target for the Republic because of the natural resources it presented for the droid army and the wealth it displayed through the many credit vaults.
Prior to the main battle, republic special forces provided intelligence on the planet, and many missions were conducted for minor operations.
An example of missions, before the Battle of Mygeeto, would be a mission conducted by the well-known commando squad, Delta Squad, where they secured credits from a vault from the Vau Family, which was under the planet’s surface.
The Galactic Marines provided a distraction for this operation, but they would be presented in many future conflicts in the battle, being somewhat the face of the Battle of Mygeeto.



# Section 2
As the Clone Wars progressed, the 4th Sector Army led an invasion force to capture Mygeeto.
The invasion force included the 21st Nova Corps and a few Jedi Knights.
Battles raged between the two sides of the conflict, causing cities to be burned and urban fighting was mainly seen throughout the battle.
This resulted in many civilians being caught in the crossfire and many cities being destroyed.
Being almost a sister world to Muunilinst, the Separatists dispatched many droid forces on the planet and even used some of the most powerful droids in their arsenal, including the infamous Octuptarra Magna Tri-Droid, which were the behemoth-sized Tri-droids that were heavily armored.
Although the first year of the Battle Of Mygeeto was mostly a stalemate, where both sides of the conflict did not gain any significant sides of territory, it did see some of the harshest resistance.
Even a Venator Class Star Destroyer was shot down by a major clone unit.
Luckily an injured Jedi Knight was able to use the force to hold off the Venator to allow the major clone unit to escape but died in the process.



# Section 3
Nearing the end of the Clone Wars, a 501st detachment was sent to Mygeeto by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine himself to secure a crystal power resource, which would be used for a future Death Star Project.
With Master Ki-Adi Mundi destroying two shield barricades, the 501st were led to fight off the Separatist resistance, where they saw AAT Tanks and AA guns being used against LAAT gunships.
After the 501st extracted crystal samples, Mundi led the Galactic Marines for future operations on Mygeeto, where they would primarily see fights on bridges that linked city districts.
This would be the last battle Master Ki-Adi Mundi would fight, as a transmission issued by the Supreme Chancellor ordered all clone units to execute their Jedi Generals.
Marshal Clone Commander, CC-1138 (Bacara), and his Galactic Marines were pushing against droid forces on a bridge, led by Mundi, but once the order was in effect, the Galactic Marines executed Master Mundi and the battle later came to a halt, as control of Mygeeto would soon be under the rule of the Galactic Empire, where they would use the planet for mining operations for the large Imperial Navy.
