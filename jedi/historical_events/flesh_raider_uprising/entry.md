# Introduction

The Flesh Raider Uprising happened in 3643BBY near the end of the Cold War between the Republic and the Sith Empire.
The Flesh Raiders on Tython started to wage war on both the Jedi Order and the Pilgrims of Kalikori Village.
Under Command of Dark Jedi Bengel Morr the Flesh Raiders became more bold with their attacks on the Jedi.
Bengel Morr had been driven insane from the devastation of the fall of the Jedi Temple, making him blame the Order and fall to the Dark Side.
He would take on Callef as his apprentice and begin plotting the Order’s destruction.

# Section 1

Some of the Flesh Raiders they trained, found out to be Force Sensitive and as such were trained into Force Adepts.
Eventually they commanded a significant fight force under the leadership of Grand Chieftain Keshk.
While the Order could easily repel their attacks, losing only young and inexperienced Jedi, the Village on the other hand, suffered.
The Village had many losses and heavy resentment to the Jedi for following the Senate's request to refuse them aid.

# Section 2

Many apprentices were imprisoned within cages, while others got injured fighting them off.
A Flesh Rider infant would be found near the temple and taken to Master Quib.
While the Jedi Order through multiple Jedi learned more about the Flesh Raider’s culture.
On top of this, Twi'lek Viyo was taken by a Force Sensitive Flesh Raider named Fashk.
A Jedi would see to Fashk’s request to join the Jedi, which would be accepted by Master Strayen.
Viyo would be set free and Fashk headed to the Temple.
Master Strayen hoped to calm his violent nature while also showing him the ways of the light side,knowing that without Jedi Training Fashk would likely fall to the Dark Side.

# Section 3

Within the month’s leading to Morr’s assault, there was a Minor Conflict at the Fount of Rajivari, between Yuon Par’s Apprentice and Nalen, who had attempted to destroy the Forge.
He would be trained as a Jedi, hoping to improve relations with the Village.
Following this T7-O1 would discover plans of the Flesh Raiders and record it while captured.
By this time, Morr had many small camps across much of Tython and sent the Force Sensitive Raiders to study for the Force from Holocrons.

# Section 4

As Callef led his Forces through the Gharls, a new initiate arrived on Tython.
This Initiate would seal off the Gharls, thought Aharo would be found and captured.
Called would interrogate Aharo was the Initiate fought through Flesh Raiders to save him.
Called and the Initiate would fall into a duel that despite Callef having more experience, led to his defeat and death.
Orgus Din, would arrive just as Callef was defeated, collapsing the tunnel using the Force.

# Section 5

Following this the Initiate, now Din’s padawan, would begin to aid the Village in return for information.
While this Padawan fought off Flesh Raider Warmasters to get to their weapons cache, they would find T7-O1 and bring them back.
The weapons would be delivered to the Village, who had been attacked while they were gone.
Din would see and review the recording while his padawan then began to explore the ruins of Kaleth.
After defeating the group’s leader the holocron was found and returned before security was set up in the ruins.

# Section 6

Din and the padawan following this, began an attack on the nearby command base with the padawan attacking the shield generator.
Having their part, they returned to the Village saving them from the Toxin mines.
This Padawan would fight again in Kaleth to enter the Forsaken Den.
Here Loatah’s lightsaber would be recovered as Din struck at a nearby camp.
Both would head to the Village for an unknowingly fake distress call, allowing DIn to be captured and taken to the Forge.The Padawan would head to the Forge, fighting Morr himself.

# Section 7

Morr defeated would offer his dark side knowledge to the Padawan, however, would be denied.
The Padawan open waking thier master would be allowed to create their own lightsaber.
The Padawan once returned to the temple would be granted the title of Jedi Knight.
While the uprising was fairly localized, the consequences would help shape events of the Galactic War.
