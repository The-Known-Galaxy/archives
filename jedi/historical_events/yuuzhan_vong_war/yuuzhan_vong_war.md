# Introduction

During the time of relative peace up to 25 ABY, the new Jedi Order seemed to be well and truly established as a force in the galaxy once more.
The Order now numbered at least 100 Jedi, possibly more, with many Jedi Masters actively training new Padawans.
During this time Luke Skywalker sought permission from the New Republic to re-establish the Jedi Council.
However, with the onset of the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Jedi were to face a foe that would rock their Order to its very foundations.
Significant public opinion was turned against the Jedi by the invaders with Jedi hunted around the galaxy.
However, the Jedi did receive aid from unexpected sources, such as from many Priapulin who signed up as Jedi Auxiliaries to support the Order as the famous Charza Kwinn had decades earlier.
During this time, cracks appeared within the Jedi Order over what approach to take to the invaders.
Spearheading the more aggressive faction was Kyp Durron, while Luke Skywalker led a more defensive position.
Some of this conflict was resolved with the establishment of a Masters' Council, seeking to create a unified response for all Jedi.
The Jedi eventually played a vital role in the resolution of the war, but the cost was severe.
The number of Jedi was halved and their mindset became far more severe.
