# Introduction

With the Sith presumed extinct, the Jedi believed that they had at last forged a long-lasting peace in the galaxy.
With the Ruusan Reformation passing the Senate and receiving the High Council's blessings, both the Jedi Order and the Republic renounced militarism, disbanding their vast armies and navies.
From that point on, the galaxy would rely on smaller Planetary Security Forces and the Judicial Department to help the Jedi keep the peace.
The wave of change sweeping the Republic enabled forward-thinking Jedi to make vast strides in the Order' setup during the first years of peace.
Under the leadership of Grand Master Fae Coven, the Jedi High Council became more influential, and many loose rules were codified.
Adults were banned from entering into the Order after Ruusan proved them to be too volatile and susceptible to the dark side's sway.
They would renounce all ties to the outside world to wealth, material possessions, and even family.
Training would now be undertaken on a strict one-to-one basis and centralized on Coruscant.
With the far-flung academies of the past, the temptation of delving into forbidden knowledge was considered too great for members of the order.
Many far-flung, satellite training facilities were closed and the Temple on Coruscant became the heart of the Order.

The Trials of Knighthood were firmly put in place to ensure all Knights were tested on a fair and equal scale.
Coven was also ensured that her changes would be known by every Jedi by drafting and putting into circulation throughout the Order personal copies of The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, a guidebook given to each and every member of the Order.
Along with Master Coven's quest to set the Order on a firm footing, Caretaker of First Knowledge Restelly Quist and the other members of the Council of First Knowledge were determined to completely eradicate all memory of the Sith to ensure they never returned.
Dispatching Shadows to find and locate all Sith artifacts, relics, and even history books detailing past Jedi-Sith conflicts; the Order essentially erased all memory of the Sith in under five decades.
