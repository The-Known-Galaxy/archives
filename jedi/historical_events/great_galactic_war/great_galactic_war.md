# Introduction

The Great Galactic War dragged on for decades.
Thousands of Jedi and Sith were slain.
Countless star systems were ravaged.
The Republic and the Order had thought that the Sith Empire had been completely destroyed in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace War; unknown to them a single Sith Lord managed to escape Chancellor Pultimo's attack on Korriban and established himself as the new Sith Emperor and continued the rule of the Sith Empire in the Unknown Regions.
It was this Emperor who had corrupted Revan and Malak, the same Emperor who would imprison Revan for a second time after his return to Dromuund Kaas following the Jedi Civil War.
In 3681 BBY the Sith Empire came out of hiding and attacked the Republic and the Jedi, taking both by complete surprise.
Unknown to the Republic, the Sith had already infiltrated several planetary governments, the Republic and the Order itself, allowing it several victories.
As Jedi and Republic forces fought back, the Mandalorians, under the leadership of Mandalore the Lesser, entered the conflict on the side of the Empire.
The war would eventually last 28 standard years.

In 3653 BBY with peace talks commencing on Alderaan, the Sith launched a surprise attack on Coruscant, devastating the planet, killing the Chancellor and nearly destroying the Jedi Temple.
With Coruscant in their hands, the Sith presented the Republic with the Treaty of Coruscant.
The Treaty sued for peace but was heavily biased towards the Sith, demanding that the Republic turn over several long-time territories and Republic forces had to withdraw from current battlefields leaving the planets defenseless to Imperial occupation.
With little choice, the Republic accepted ending the Great War.
