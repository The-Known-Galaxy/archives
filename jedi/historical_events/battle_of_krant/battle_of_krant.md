# Section 1
The Battle of Krant was the final battle in the Hunt for the Decimator, and an early major battle of the war.
After capturing the moon Aereen to use as a staging base, Echuu Shen-Jon began planning his attack, and supplemented his own army with reinforcements hastily sent by the Republic.
When all was ready, he executed a full-scale assault on the CIS strongholds on the world.
           In the first day of battle, Shen-Jon’s forces were bolstered by a number of escaped Wookiees, which fought on the front lines against Tann’s hordes of battle droids.
As the assault force tried to destroy the multiple bases on Krant, the section of the Republic army led by Shen-Jon’s apprentice, Naat Reath, was cut off, and Reath was captured by General Tann.
Tann then pulled a majority of her forces back to the main stronghold, where the Decimator facilities were.
           Furious, Shen-Jon began to fall towards the Dark Side, and ordered his full army to assault the Confederacy’s main stronghold.
The defenses fell, and in three further days of battle the Republic gradually overran it completely.
Tann’s active Decimators were fought and destroyed at a high cost in clones, and the factories dedicated to producing more were reduced to ashes.
General Shen-Jon himself led his troops through the inner sections of the Confederate base, seeking out his enemy.



# Section 2
He found Tann deep within the fortress with Reath, and as clone troopers overran the last of the planet’s battle droid forces the two engaged in a fierce lightsaber duel.
The two fought to a draw, but - spurred on by his enemy’s taunting - Shen-Jon eventually gave in to his anger, overpowering Tann and cutting her in half.
Dying and in bitter pain, Sev’rance Tann used her last words to taunt the Jedi further in an attempt to drive him forever over the edge.
           But Reath stopped her master before he could strike the final blow.
Realizing how far he had gone, Echuu Shen-Jon gave his Padawan orders to finish the battle and return to Coruscant, and disappeared into the jungles of Krant, never to be seen for the rest of the war.
The Battle of Krant saw the end of the Decimator threat, gave the Republic its first major military success since Geonosis, and also saw the death of Sev’rance Tann, the CIS’s Supreme Commander.
No other would fill the role for three months.
