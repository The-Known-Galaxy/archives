# Introduction

The Great Hyperspace Rush was a period of time in which there was a rush to claim and map the unknown yet existing hyperspace routes, as the Galactic Republic expanded its territory into the outer regions of the galaxy, which had not been mapped yet.

# Section 1

During the era of the Galactic Republic, teams of Pathfinders, which were led by Supreme Chancellors Kyong Greylark and Orel Mollo, were sent to the Outer Rim Territories to find new hyperspace routes and create communication networks.
The Jedi Order helped them in their efforts.
Private parties, such as the San Tekka and Graf families, also desired fruitful hyperlanes.
The San Tekkas became highly successful thanks to hyperspace savant Mari San Tekka.
However, the Grafs sought to uncover the San Tekka clan’s secrets and Mari’s abilities, which eventually led to her capture by the Ro family.

Meanwhile, the Republic Pathfinders discovered and assisted in the evacuation of the endangered Tungurary people from the planet Tunguary due to volcanic activity.
Another Pathfinder team led by Jedi Knight Gella Nattai had an unfortunate mission outcome in Orvax.
The Graf and San Tekka families later sponsored the Hyperspace Chase.
While some routes mapped during the rush were made accessible to the Republic, the Grafs kept a few routes private using encrypted beacons.
Chencey Yarrow pushed for accessibility, but the Grafs kept control over some routes.
