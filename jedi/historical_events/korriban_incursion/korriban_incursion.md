# Introduction

The Korriban Incursion was a battle that took place during the Galactic War between the Republic and the Sith Empire in 3637 BBY.
The Republic was given the objective of retrieving intel from the Dark Council chambers within the Sith Academy on Korriban.
The first wave allowed the Republic to breach the Valley of the Dark Lords, but they were soon stopped in their tracks by Imperial forces.

During the second wave of the Incursion, four Republic heroes took out the Imperial forces and then killed Lord Renning.
After the heroes completed their initial task, they helped the Republic forces decide whether or not they should free the Imperial servants.
The Republic then advanced towards the Sith Academy in pursuit of its goal.
Once they entered the Academy, they went and defeated nearby Sith Instructors so they could access the turbolift to the Dark Council Chamber.
The heroes swiftly took out Darth Soverus.
Later on, Jedi Commander Jensyn arrived at the Academy with reinforcements and defeated the remaining Sith.

# Section 2

After the completion of the attack, the heroes reported to Colonel Rian Darok and Theron Shan for a mission debrief.
However, their meeting was cut short when word of an Assault on Tython broke out.
This forced the heroes and a group of Republic forces to leave and assist their allies on Tython in retaking the planet.
With the majority of the Republic forces having left Korriban, The Sith Empire was able to retake the Academy and their planet after killing countless Jedi and Republic troopers.
