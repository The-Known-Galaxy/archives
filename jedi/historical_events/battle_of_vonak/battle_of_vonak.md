# Introduction
During the year 25 ABY the battle between the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong species and the warrior-species Cilare took place on the planet Vonak.
It was hardly a battle, as fierce as the Cilare were, their tech was not enough for the overwhelming strength of the Yuuzhan Vong, thus leading to their soon defeat.
The casualties of this battle were nothing short of genocide and near extermination of the entire Cilare race.
All but one Cilare, Commander Arbeloa, leader of the Cilare armies, only survived after being taken onto a Yuuzhan Vong slave-ship named the “Tsam P’ah”.

# Section 1
While being held captive, he managed to submit a signal into space which was picked up by the two-man crew of a ship known as the Pythea, the crew of this ship was Chiss Panha, and her Wookiee friend Sarkkin.
The Yuuzhan Vong slaughtered the Cilare with their attack, Arbeloa urged his people to flee instead of fighting, he was wise to know that to fight them would lead to their downfall.
He had known the story of what had happened between the Chiss and the Yuuzhan Vong and understood their military prowess and threat to the galaxy.
The combatants from the Cilare were documented as only a few fierce warriors and only a handful of tanks, that were wiped out by the attack of Fire-Breathers held captive by the Yuuzhan Vong under the command of Commander Sha’kel.
These war beasts blew gelatinous flame and exhaled anti-laser aerosols through their pores.



# Section 2
The message contained from Arbeloa read aloud, quoted like this; “Abandon your world.
Our great strength could not save us, could not save our loved ones.
Learn from our mistakes.
Don’t share our fate.
Run.”
