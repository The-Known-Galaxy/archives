# Introduction

The Infinite Empire, also known as the Rakatan Empire, was a galactic superpower from 36,453 BBY to 25,200 BBY.
The downfall of the empire was brought when, having already suffered greatly at the hands of a plague, the Infinite Empire sought new ways to stave off the loss of their political power, and more importantly, extinction.
As such, in 25,792 BBY the Infinite Empire sought out the planet of Tython, the home of the Jedi, Sith, and Je’daii orders, as it was rumored an Infinity Gate was on the planet.
This started the Second Battle of Tython.

# Section 1

Predor Skal’nas, a high ranking member of the Infinite Empire, invaded the planet of Tython in hopes of finding the Prime Infinity Gate.
The fighting itself was brutal, with the Rakatan forces obliterating the forces of the Settled Worlds of Tython on Tython’s moon Ashla.
The invasion was a remarkable success for Skal’nas up to this point, as he was about to reach his goal.
His plans would not reach fruition, however, with Sek’nos Rath breaking free from his Rakatan imprisoners and leading other freed prisoners into battle against the Rakatan forces.
Near the Prime Infinity Gate, Skal’nas was pursued and caught by Daegen Lok and Shae Koda, two members of the Je’daii Order.
Daegen Lok fought with Skal’nas while Shae Koda fought Skal’nas’ Xesh, his Force Hound, which were Force-sensitive servants of the Infinite Empire.
Lok attempted to perform an ability called the “Mind Twist” on Skal’nas, with the intent to enter his mind, but this backfired when Lok had felt the raw emotions from the Predor’s victims.
Shae, meanwhile, was attempting to appeal to Xesh’s humanity.
During this, Sek’nos Rath was leading the battle further up on Tython’s surface, defeating Trill, another Force Hound.
In the midst of the battle,  Skal’nas successfully activated the Prime Infinity Gate, proclaiming his goal of conquering the galaxy.
Xesh, meanwhile, begged Shae to surrender during their fight, right before Skal’nas blasted her with Force Lightning, causing Xesh to attack him.

# Section 2

At the temple of Anil Kesh, a Je'daii by the name of Tasha Ryo took the A’nang Holocron to the deepest point of the temple, at A’nang’s request so they could use the power of the Tho Yor, which were ships that were later found to be potent superweapons if enough Force Energy was concentrated into them, on the Rakatan fleet.
This would come at a cost, however, as Tasha Ryo would have to give her life to activate the Tho Yor.
Tasha would end up jumping into the pit where A’nang had led her.
Her sight and Force sensitivity would be restored right before she vanished, causing a charge of Force energy to awaken the Tho Yor.
As the Tho Yor awakened they opened fire on the Rakatan fleet, while another blast of Force energy destroyed the Prime Infinity Gate.
Xesh then defeated Skal’nas, whose body was turned to ash in the flames of the destroyed gate.
After his death, the Rakatan forces felt the demise of Skal’nas and fled, with his Sub Predors turning on each other and the remaining Rakatan ships being destroyed by the Settled Worlds fleet.
