# Introduction

The Ataraxia was a starcruiser used by the Galactic Republic, built before the year 232 BBY.
It was commanded by Jedi Master Jora Malli during the Battle of Kur.
The Ataraxia was eventually taken over by Nihil Tempest Runners during the destruction of Starlight Beacon, and later reclaimed by the Jedi before 90 BBY.
90 years before the Battle of Yavin, the Ataraxia was used to transport a group of Jedi Initiates to a celebration of the native cultures of Serenno.
Among them were Sifo-Dyas and Dooku.
The latter was insulted by another Jedi during the flight, but did not fight back.
