# Introduction

The ship known as the Harmzuay was a heavily modified version of the Kaloth-style battlecruiser.
This vessel was part of a pirate fleet that belonged to the Thalassian Slavers or alternatively, Thalassian Pirates.
This ship and its well-trained and efficient crew quickly began gaining reputation as they aided the rest of the fleet in different tasks.
The modifications that made the Harmzuay so powerful included additional turbolasers and fighters, as well as increasing the general armor and durability; it was even able to go head to head against any well equipped vessels, such as the Nebulon-B class escort frigate.

# Section 1

The Harmzuay eventually met its end in an attempt to raid the planet of Kerilt.
During the assault, it was spotted by an Imperial Star Destroyer, the Invidious.
The commanding officer of this destroyer, Admiral Leonia Tavira, ordered her crew to wipe out the pirate ship to defend what she claimed to be rightfully hers.
Not being able to withstand the advanced fire power from a Star Destroyer, the pirate vessel was destroyed in an instant.
