# Introduction

The Katana fleet, also known as the Dark Force, was a task force of two hundred Dreadnaught-class heavy cruisers launched by the Galactic Republic to restore its Navy’s power.
However, the fleet was lost due to a hive virus, which made the crew go insane, causing the captain to send all the ships into hyperspace blindly.
Five years after the Battle of Endor, Grand Admiral Thrawn of the Galactic Empire discovered the fleet's whereabouts, and the New Republic also joined the race to find the fleet.
The Empire managed to acquire 178 of the ships before the Republic arrived.

# Section 1

In the final years of the Galactic Republic, the Senate funded ambitious projects, including the Katana Fleet, which was completed in 46 BBY.
These ships were equipped with experimental AT-PT walkers and were named after their flagship, the Katana.
To reduce labor requirements, the fleet was modified with advanced slave circuitry, reducing the crew needed to operate each ship from over 16,000 to just about 2,200 members.
Rendili StarDrive also redesigned the fleet’s interior and hull color, earning it the nickname “the Dark Force.” The Katana fleet marked a new era in military warship technology.

# Section 2

The Katana fleet’s demonstration turned into a disaster when a hive virus infected the crew, which drove them insane and caused them to jump into hyperspace, taking the entire fleet with them.
This incident embarrassed the military leaders who commissioned the fleet and contributed to the decentralization of automated ship functions.
Efforts to salvage the fleet failed because of its random location in the galaxy.
The Republic suspected Zeta Magnus, a genetic terrorist affiliated with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, as the culprit behind the virus.
The fleet eventually became a legendary tale, and some doubted its existence.

# Section 3

The Katana fleet was lost for nearly fifty-five years, until the smuggler Captain Hoffner and navigator Talon Karrde discovered it in 6 BBY.
They kept the fleet’s location a secret, eventually selling some ships to Garm Bel Iblis.
By 6 ABY, the fleet’s value could shift the balance of power in the Galaxy.
The fleet’s importance was used to draw away the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer, the Eviscerator, before the Second Battle of Borleias.
In 9 ABY, Grand Admiral Thrawn sought the fleet and acquired information from Hoffner.
During the Battle of the Katana fleet, Thrawn obtained all the Dreadnaughts except for twenty-two.
The New Republic got hold of those remaining ships, which were crewed using cloned soldiers produced quickly from Spaarti cloning cylinders.
Thrawn’s fleet, magnified by the Katana Dreadnaughts, became a powerful force, allowing him to attack multiple New Republic systems simultaneously.
