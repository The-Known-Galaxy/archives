# Introduction
While the T-65 X-Wing is the most famous of the products produced by Incom Corporation, it was not the only product that was used by the Rebel Alliance.
The UT-60D U-Wing was a unique craft that performed the hybrid role of a troop transport and an air support-oriented starfighter.
Due to balancing between both roles, the U-Wing was not exceptional at either.
The U-Wing had limited fuel due to needing to power more life-support, and its larger hull made it less maneuverable than a typical starfighter.
While it was worse than a Y-Wing when it came to dogfighting, it was remarkable when it came to close air support.

# Section 1
The UT-60D U-Wing was one of the last products produced by Incom Corporation before the Galactic Empire nationalized the company.
Despite its short production run, it had two models.
The first model lacked weapons and s-foils.
It also lacked a hyperdrive and possessed two engines instead of four.
For obvious reasons, this model did not see much use in the Rebel Alliance.



# Section 2
The better-known model had four engines instead of two.
The engines were Incom’s 4J.7 model.
Inside each of the engine modules, there was a hyperspace motivator that allowed the craft the ability to go into hyperspace.
Unlike the earlier model, the later model had two KX7 laser cannons.
Due to the presence of laser cannons, the U-Wing needed to radiate off much more heat.
Incom Corporation decided to utilize their signature solution to problems of this nature: they made the wings of the craft have s-foils so that they could throw off heat far away from the main section of the craft.
Behind each of the loading doors on the U-Wing’s sides, a gunner could operate an improved weapon attachment.
The UT-60D U-Wing could have a single pilot or two pilots working in tandem.



# Section 3
Bail Organa was responsible for most of the U-Wings that were under the Rebel Alliance’s control.
After a shipment of U-Wings was “lost” by Bail Organa, they eventually showed up in the hands of Rebels.
As the Rebel Alliance could not replace any U-Wings they lost, they considered the vessels valuable.
One of the most famous deployments of Rebel U-Wings was the Battle of Scarif, where Blue Squadron escorted much-needed reinforcements.
