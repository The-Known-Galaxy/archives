# Introduction

The Star Forge was constructed by the Rakatan Infinite Empire in 30,000 BBY, designed to create the most powerful army of all time in an automated shipyard.
The Star Forge drew its energy from a nearby star, which, when combined with the power of the force, was capable of creating an endless supply of ships.
The Star Forge was made so that Capital ships could move in and out very easily, as for many of the fighter crafts, they could dock using the bays located on the fins.
The fins of The Star Forge could extend downwards allowing The Star Forge to draw matter from the star of the Rakata system, using it to produce weapons and armament.

# Section 1

The Star Forge would not be made possible without the work of the slaves, because of the cruelness and savageness of the species.
The Star Forge became an Immense tool of dark side power.
The Star Forge was not focused on making defensive weaponry; in fact, there was little to almost no making of them.
Instead, there was almost all of The Star Forge focusing on its massive ship production.
The first deck of The Star Forge was a hanger for Capital ships, but fighter ships could land in this hanger as well.
As well for the second deck, it had a console that could create light sided Star Forge Robes, and the second deck also wielded an elevator that leads up to the command center.
The command center had many elevators to the viewing platform and the second deck, the command center also had a large hologram of the Star Forge itself.

# Section 2

The viewing platform was used to observe what was going on outside of the space station.
The viewing platform was accessible by a turbolift from the command center.
The Star Forge was heavily protected by many series of droids, as well as including an incredible amount of heavy blast doors that ran throughout the entire factory, and it was protected by a deadly ship-disabling energy field projected from Lehon’s Temple of the Ancients on the Rakata homeworld nearby.
The field caused ships to malfunction and be captured in the planet’s gravity well, sending any ships crashing on the world down below.
After its destruction, the Star Forge was decided to go out of commission by the Republic because of panic and fear.
