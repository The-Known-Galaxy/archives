# Introduction
A large dreadnought that was 800 meters, 433 meters in width, and 151 meters in height.
The dreadnought adhered to the wedge-shaped design that had been used for warships within the Sith Empire.
The point of the wedge was split down the middle for a quarter to a third of the length of the ship, forming two prongs.
Between the two prongs, hangar bays were stacked on top of each other.
Two additional hangars were on either side of the ship.
The ship’s shield generators were on the upper hull of its wings that protruded from each side of the ship.
The vessel’s command tower was positioned atop of a smaller wedge on the top of the dreadnought.

# Section 1
Harrower-class dreadnoughts sported heavily reinforced hull plating and four shield generators.
Dreadnoughts also featured turbolaser batteries, quad laser cannons, ion cannons, proton torpedoes, and concussion missile launchers.
Most of the Harrower-class dreadnoughts had three primary thrusters surrounded by four smaller ones at the rear of the ship.
Standard dreadnoughts carried ninety-five starfighters, most of which were the Imperial Navy’s standard Mark VI Supremacy-class starfighter, and thirty-two B28 Extinction-class bombers and thirty-five shuttles.



# Section 2
These dreadnoughts required crews of 2,400 and carried around 7,300 troops.
As the largest and most armed vessel, a single Harrower-class dreadnought could hold its own against fleets of starfighters or several smaller warships.
These dreadnoughts were the backbone of the fleet, coordinating fleet attacks while absorbing and dealing most of the damages.
