# Introduction
The Ewok battle wagon was the mode of transportation that the Ewoks used once engaged in battle.
The wagon was one of their many inventions that suited their small stature and was made from wood and rope which was abundant on their home planet.
The Ewoks were a short, furry, and tribal race native to the Forest Moon of Endor.
The Ewoks were quite territorial, often capturing trespassers no matter the size wielding spears.
They were members of a polytheistic religion in which they praised multiple Gods, often connected to the forests in some way.
Their species wasn’t as advanced as the normal species in the rest of the Galaxy, and they were isolated on their moon, having no connection with the rest of the Galaxy.
The battlewagon was seldom used due to the peacefulness of their moon, but it was surprisingly deadly.

The main weapon was a battering ram made out of a severed tree log in which inflicted mass damage to any attackers.
Erpham Warrick, the greatest Ewok Warrior of all-time invented this, along with a plethora of other inventions.
The wagon was controlled via four stone wheels, making it a far more sturdy vehicle.
It also carried their spears and missiles which the Ewoks used.
The Ewoks liked to trophy their feats by decorating skulls and bones of animals far greater than them on the wagon as to enforce intimidation.
This wagon was the main offence that the Ewoks had during the Battle of Endor, in which they managed to take down battalions of stormtroopers and AT-STs during the battle, mounting the cockpits on the top of the wagon as to show that it managed to take down an Imperial walker.
This entire wagon was held together via string, and quite feeble and susceptible to fire.
Nonetheless, this was a dangerous weapon that the Ewoks had in their arsenal, and were not afraid to use it if needed.
