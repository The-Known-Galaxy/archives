# Introduction
Astrogation or Astronavigation, as the name implies, is the navigation of hyperspace and realspace with a spaceship.
Astrogation has two jobs, which are, deciding the current location of the spaceship and calculating a safe landing on the final destination.
Knowing how to navigate in space is crucial when going into hyperspace, one incorrect calculation could cause a collision with a planet or another ship.

# Section 1
Astrocartography was invented to prevent people from colliding with planets and other ships.
Astronav blueprints are mapped areas of space, it could be used to accomplish paths through hyperspace.
Accomplishing paths was done most of the time by droids or navigation computers.
