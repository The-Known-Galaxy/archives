# Introduction

The AA-9 Coruscant Freighter-Liner was a product of Botajef Shipyards.
The AA-9 was able to function both as a cargo freighter and a passenger liner.
Due to the refugee crisis preceding the Clone Wars, many were used to transport refugees.
A famous AA-9 modified to serve as a transport for refugees was the Jendirian Valley.
The Jendirian Valleyâ€™s middle deck was modified to be able to transport a staggering 30,000 passengers.
In 22 BBY, Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala were able to pass as refugees and used the AA-9 vessel Jendirian Valley to travel to Naboo.
In a dark twist of irony, the AA-9 would see some use transporting slaves, instead of refugees, by the cult Bando Gora.

The AA-9 had a length of 390 meters.
It could be described as bearing an incredibly rounded T-shaped form if viewed from the front or rear.
The AA-9 had a trio of powerful Type Dyne-2577 Sublight Drives for engines.
It possessed a Class 4 hyperdrive.
Due to its common role in transporting large groups of refugees, it usually carried around an extra 3 months of food supplies in case of an emergency situation.

# Section 2

During the Clone Wars, many AA-9s would travel in convoys.
Even during the Clone Wars, the unarmed ships would continue to transport refugees.
They would serve the Galactic Republic in many roles, ranging from cargo transports to troop transports.
The usefulness of the AA-9 would ensure its survival past the Clone Wars.
It would not be uncommon to see the AA-9 still in use as late as the Galactic Civil War.
