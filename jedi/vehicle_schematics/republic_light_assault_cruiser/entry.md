# Introduction

First entering service in 44 BBY, the Republic Light Assault Cruisers were modified variants of the Consular-class cruiser, manufactured by Corellian Engineering Corporation.
They saw almost exclusive use by Republic Judicial Forces and Jedi Order before and during the Separatist Crisis.
Before the unexpected formation of the Republic Navy as part of the Military Creation Act at the start of the Clone Wars, this vessel along with the Consular-class cruisers, was the backbone and face of the Republicâ€™s peacekeeping and diplomatic forces.

The iconic look of the three large ion-engines and diplomatic red paint job gave the cruiser a distinct aesthetic and was known to many throughout the Republic.
Originally intended to be used purely as a diplomatic vessel to aid in conflict-resolution and diplomacy missions, Consular-class cruisers were entirely unarmed.
The Republic Light Assault Cruiser aimed to rectify that weakness for more serious missions by having varying amounts of turbolasers and other additional, but smaller weaponry.
Some even had an extra fourth engine, mounted on top of the middle of the original three.
The standard salon-pod in the bow meant for safe diplomacy, was swapped out for a more combat-oriented pod.
Note that not every cruiser looked the same - some had extra durasteel plating fitted on the topside for additional protection and different variations of said plating existed also.
During the Clone Wars, the Republic Light Assault Cruisers saw less action than anticipated, largely due to the better-performing Charger C70 Retrofit, or better known as the Republic Frigate.
This was, ironically, another modified Consular-class cruiser aimed to fill an offensive combat role within the Republic Navy.
After the Declaration of a New Order in 19 BBY, what little use Republic Light Assault Cruisers had seen during the Clone Wars came to an abrupt end - ending their 25 years in service.
