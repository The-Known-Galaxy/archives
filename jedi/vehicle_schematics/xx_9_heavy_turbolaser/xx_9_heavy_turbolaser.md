# Introduction
The XX-9 Heavy Turbolaser was protected by a layer of quadanium steel.
These weapons proved to work against capital ships, being a deadly asset to the empire; however, these weapons did not prove to be cheap, having a hefty price on each cannon.
Each cannon had dual barrels for faster fire rate against enemy ships.
The turret also had a safety mechanism that would lock on to enemy starfighters unless they go below the surface they are equipped on; this gave the Rebellion an upper hand in escaping fire from the turrets.

# Section 1
The XX-9 Heavy turbolaser was a variation of the previous XX-8 turbolaser and a prototype of the XX-10 turbolaser.
The XX-9 was used on the death star armoury of artillery.
