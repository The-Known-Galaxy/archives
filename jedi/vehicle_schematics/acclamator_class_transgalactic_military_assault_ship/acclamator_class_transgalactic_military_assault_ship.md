# Introduction
The Acclamator-class Transgalactic Military Assault Ship was developed by the famed Kuat Drive Yards’ subsidiary company Rothana Heavy Engineering following the passage of the Military Creation Act through the Galactic Senate in 23 BBY.
Following debate upon the Act, the Senate voted to grant Chancellor Sheev Palpatine emergency powers, which was promptly used to authorise the creation of the Grand Army of the Republic.
The Acclamator-class starship was one such model commissioned to service the Grand Army, serving largely as a troop transport that worked in concert with the similarly designed Venator-class Star Destroyers to combat the Sepratist Droid Army.

# Section 1
The Acclamator-class was notable in its ability to land directly onto planets, transporting its armed complement of up to 16,000 soldiers, 320 speeder bikes, 66 gunships, 14 gunship carriers, 48 AT-TEs, 36 SPHA-Ts and a Nu-class Shuttle.
The Acclamator-class had a relatively small crew in comparison to its size, having 700 crew members at maximum capacity.
The Acclamator-class was quite large, with a length of 752 meters from bow to stern.
With two hyperdrive engines, speeds of up to 1,200 kms per hour at sub-light speed could be reached by the Acclamator class, slightly faster then the top speeds reached by the CIS’s Subjugator-class of 1,050 kms per hour.
Despite their role as troop transports, the Acclamator had several defensive armaments including 12 quad-turbo laser turrets, 24 laser cannons and 4 missile launchers.



# Section 2
The Acclamator-class Assault Ship was present in several notable battles throughout the Clone Wars.
In 22 BBY, 12 Acclamator-class Assault Ships participated in the First Battle of Geonosis, aiding the besieged Jedi within the Geonosis arena.
They were also present during conflicts on Christophsis, Teth, Ryloth, Saleucami, Kamino, Sullust, Umbara, Kiros, Naboo, Aleen, Ringo Vinda and throughout the Ruusan system.
Whilst not as heavily manufactured as Venator-class Destroyers, for any large scale battle which required greater forces then those provided in a Venator or cruiser’s complement, the Acclamator-class was present.
By 19 BBY when the First Galactic Empire was declared, the Acclamator-class began to be phased out of the new Imperial Navy, with its replacement being the Ton-Falk-class Escort Carrier, also produced by Kuat Drive Yards.
