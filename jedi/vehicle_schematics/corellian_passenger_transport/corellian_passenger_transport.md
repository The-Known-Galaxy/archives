# Introduction

The Corellian Passenger Transport was a transport class ship manufactured by the Corellian Engineering Corporation (CEC).
It was one of thousands of ships made by the CEC, which throughout its history had been far surpassing its competitors in renown and effeciency.
Many ships made by it were confirmed to be faster and better than their peers and even if it wasn’t tested, there would be rumors a plenty about how fast one of their ships were.
The very notion that the Corellian Engineering Corporation was the best in their field became subconscious.
This was in some ways true, thanks to the many talented individuals - working in ship manufacturing - that the Corellian System (CEC’s home) harboured.
Due to their renown and talent, they could make the majority of their sale off civilians, unlike their competitors.
However, this does not mean they do not have private or military requests ; during the rule of the Eternal Empire, the Corellian Engineering Corporation was rumoured to be developing an experimental stealth technology for a mysterious buyer.
Additionally, they constructed Star Destroyers for the imperial Navy, which were often noted as more powerful than the rest of the fleet.
As you can see, they were known as the best in the Galaxy - even the famed Han Solo once boasted he could outmaneuver one of their ships.
That’s the level of fame that came with the name of the manufacturer of the Corellian Passenger Transport.
