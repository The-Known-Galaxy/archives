# Introduction
AT-AA, or the All-Terrain Anti-Aircraft, was a quick mobile anti-aircraft walker, which was used by the Galactic Empire.
It had four stubby legs, and a locomotion that resembled a lizard.
It held a very low profile, which was unusual for most Imperial walkers.
The model most often had a turreted flak pod as its primary weapon; the pod could shoot several types of the ordinance.
Some other versions had up to one or three rocket launching tubes.
The AT-AA was designed to fire at ground targets, but later gun ports were added for the crew to fend off infantry attacks.
Some versions of the AT-AA had their flak pods replaced with concussion mission launchers.
Apart from an offensive purpose, the AT-AA also carried electronic countermeasure systems, which would scramble missile guidance strikes, ultimately reducing the risk of missile strikes.

# Section 1
The design of the AT-AA was developed back as far as the Clone Wars, and their production began at the beginning of the New Order.
The AT-AA was most commonly used during the Galactic Civil War, where its primary purpose was to assault aircraft, but was made useless against ground targets.
During the Battle of Kalaan AT-AA batteries were used in order to protect armored columns from airborne enemies.
They were also used at the time of the New Republic, as they defended the galactic capital against the New Republic Defense Force.
