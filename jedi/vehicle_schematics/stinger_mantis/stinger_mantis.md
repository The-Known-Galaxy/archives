# Introduction
The Stinger Mantis, also known as the Mantis, was a luxurious S-161 Stinger XL yacht owned and piloted by Greez Dritus.
In 14 BBY, Dritus used the Mantis to transport former Jedi Cere Junda and Cal Kestis on their secret mission to rebuild the Jedi Order.
Dritus bragged that the vessel was incredibly strong and could withstand all sorts of climates.
However, in 9 BBY, the Mantis endured internal damage during a landing on a planet.

# Section 1
The Mantis had a unique exterior design, which was divided into three sections: front, back, and a moving piece housing the outer board engine and vertical fin.
This piece gave the vessel a distinctive appearance.
The Mantis had two laser cannons for light armament.
The floor inside the cockpit was somewhat made of glass, which offered a wide field of view for the pilot.
The seats for both the pilot and co-pilot were raised, which provided an assertive position, and the third seat served as the communication station.



# Section 2
The Mantis featured a well-chosen interior with six specific areas.
Behind the cockpit was the holotable room, where a cozy semicircular sofa upholstered with Potolli-weave fabric surrounded a central table.
There were two boarding ramps situated on both sides of the ship, which would be changed to complement the ship's landing orientation.
Further back was the common area, which had a roomy seating area.
Fancy terrariums, behind an Umbaran glass wall, decorated the area.
A couple of stairs would lead to a raised galley that featured a table and a couple of shelves for food storage, along with another large terrarium.

Passing through the main corridor, which was available through the back of the galley, were three separate doors that led to different rooms within the vessel.
Located after the corridor was the engine room, which consisted of two levels connected by a ladder.
The upper level housed railings, a workbench, diagnostic controls, and sleeping quarters for passengers.
The hyperdrive was located behind the workbench.
The lower level also contained two escape pods and a dimly lit corridor.
