# Introduction
Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi commanded The Surrogator, which was an Arquitens-class light cruiser.
Involved in the Battle of Saleucami, The Surrogator participated in the rescue of Jedi Master Eeth Koth from Seperatist General Grievous' flagship, a Recusant-class light destroyer.
The Surrogator was created by Kuat Drive Yards and featured turbolaser batteries, concussion missiles and laser turrets, as well as engines capable of both hyperspace and sublight travel.
As The Surrogator was only a decoy ship, it had a sparse crew comprised of two Clone Naval Officers, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Clone Commander Cody and three additional members of the 212th Attack Battalion.
The Surrogator docked with the light destroyer, luring Grievous aboard whilst a rescue attempt was undertaken by a secondary force.
The Surrogator was ultimately destroyed by the light destroyer when Grievous became aware of this deception.
