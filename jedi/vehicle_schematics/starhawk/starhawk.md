# Introduction
The Starhawk was a ship prototype for the Starhawk class battleship.
The prototype ship was under construction in the secret docks of Nadiri.
The ship was a vessel made for the project Starhawk.
Its purpose was to be able to compete with the Imperial Navy’s ships.
Later on, the Starhawk would take its place in New Republic fleets as flagships.
		The idea of its creation was from the New Republic.
The Starhawk’s purpose was to be able to compete with the Imperial Navy’s ships.
The prototype was fabricated with Imperial-class Star Destroyer parts.
One of the ship’s main features was its six Magnite Crystal Tractor Beam Array that was 10 times stronger than tractor beams equipped on Star Destroyers.
The tractor beam array itself was a weapon and was able to tear the hulls of ships.

Eventually, the Imperial Navy discovered project Starhawk and they tasked Admiral Rae Sloane with hunting down the location of project Starhawk.
Admiral Rae eventually located the Starhawk vessel and destroyed it.
But despite its destruction, the crew and engineers on the prototype escaped the ship’s destruction and later were sent to Chandrila to continue their work on the construction of more Starhawk-class battleships.

		The vessel would carry on the New Republic as a part of the New Republic Defense Fleet.
A Starhawk convoy would consist of several CR90 corvettes and GR-75 medium transports.
The Starhawk would be one of the New Republic’s newer bigger ships that could match with an Imperial Star Destroyer.
Starhawk would be equipped with multiple turbolaser batteries.
The ship’s unique design allowed its tractor beam to be on the front, Starhawk was arrow-shaped.
While in its prototype stage, Starhawk faced many battles that eventually led to its destruction on the moon of Galitan.
