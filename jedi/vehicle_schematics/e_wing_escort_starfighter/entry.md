# Introduction

The E-wing starfighter was the first fighter fully supported by the New Republic.
It was designed to surpass the X-wing’s performance and to become its replacement.
The initial versions did face issues with its laser cannons and astromech units, which led many pilots to continue using the reliable X-wing.
Over time, the E-wing models improved and became widely used by the New Republic and later the Galactic Alliance.
Even though it became an excellent starfighter, it never rose above the iconic X-wing in terms of popularity.

# Section 1

The E-wing starfighter was a perfect mix of firepower, maneuverability, speed and armor.
It featured two aerodynamic folds, powerful sensors in the nose cone, and a concealed place for an astromech.
Armed with three lasers and a proton torpedo launcher, it was able to use its lasers for diverse distances.
The first model required a costly R7-series astromech droid, but later versions of the E-wing could use more affordable R2 or R5 units.
The price of a new E-wing was 185,000 credits.

# Section 2

The E-wing starfighter was introduced by the New Republic during Grand Admiral Thrawn’s campaign and was later used against the resurrected Palpatine.
It was a powerful and versatile escort fighter with excellent armament.
Even with the initial issues involving the wing lasers, it became the primary fleet space dominance fighter for the New Republic’s Fifth Fleet.
Four major models were made, with the Series IV model remaining in service through the transition from New Republic to Galactic Alliance and into the Second Galactic Civil War.
While the E-wing was very capable, it had competition in the form of the more widely adopted XJ X-wing.
