# Introduction
The XS stock light freighter, more commonly known as the XS freighter, was a type of starship manufactured by the Corellian Engineering Corporation.
Armed with two pairs of laser cannons, XS stock light freighters were used for a variety of purposes, including smuggling and deploying soldiers.
The ship has 2 engines and has a few weapons like explained.
Despite becoming outdated people still used the XS freighter for many missions and uses but eventually they became rare to see because they got even more outdated.
These ships were used in the Clone Wars and the Imperial Era, which the Jedi used.

The XS freighter was a relatively small model of the starship, but at the time it wasn't bad.
The vessels had a small circular shape to them and the cockpit had a blunt end to it.
The XS flyer had a brightish yellow to it and also some areas were just not painted.
The aft of the freighters featured it having a very heavy armed armour to it.
The ship had a capacity of at least 2 which was actually quite surprising, for how small it was.
The ship had weapons but not all models was presented with them, for some people just do like violence.
