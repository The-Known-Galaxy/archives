# Introduction

The Lambda-class T-4 a shuttle was a space shuttle designed and produced by Sienar Fleet Systems.
This shuttle had similar traits to its predecessors such as the Nu-class and Theta-class shuttle.
However, this new design was far more advanced, equipped with a powerful deflector shield and laser cannons for the front and rear side.
The engineers continued using the well known tri-wing design on this model as well.
After being released from the facilities, it quickly began gaining the favor of Imperial officials and not too long after, it became the standard shuttle for the Imperials to use.
Afterwards, mostly officers and other high-ranking members used it as a transport to move between locations.
It was known that the Rebel Alliance used these shuttles in attempts to infiltrate imperial property, however, the continuous rotation of the clearance codes made it nearly impossible.
While this shuttle was extremely capable, other shuttles such as the Delta-class T-3c were used for more demanding missions and circumstances.
