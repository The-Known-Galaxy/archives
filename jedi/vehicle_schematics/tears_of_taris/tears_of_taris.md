# Introduction
The Tears of Taris was a ship that was originally a Centurion-class battlecruiser manufactured in the era of the Jedi Civil War.
The battlecruiser was a part of Darth Malak’s fleet that was a part of the bombing of the planet Taris.
After the ending of the Jedi Civil War the ship went through many changes and addons over centuries however it never changed away from the Sith Empire.
By the era of the Great Galactic War, Darth Charnus realized the existence and the history of the Tears of Taris.
Darth Charnus scrapped the ships for the production of a new dreadnought putting the key elements of the Tears of Taris into the ship: the dreadnought was a part of the transportation of troops and the besiege of planets.
The last that the Tears of Taris were used was at the invasion of Corellia during the Galactic War.
