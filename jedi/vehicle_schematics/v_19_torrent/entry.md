# Introduction

The V-19 Torrent was a starship used during the Clone Wars.
It was commissioned and put in use by the Galactic Republic.
It was a descendant of a starship of similar lineage in terms of its usage and purpose, the Alpha 3-Nimbus-V-wing Starfighter.
The V-19 Torrent was a unique ship for its age as it had two S-foils that gave the starfighter added maneuverability while also providing the pilots with easy access to the ship's sliding canopy.
Its repulsorlift engines made it an excellent VTOL fighter.
The fighter was armed with two laser cannons on each wingtip and two concussion missile launchers.
The fighter carried at least six concussion missiles.

The prototype for this fighter was introduced first during the first assault on Geonosis.
After its success in the assault, the production rates were ramped up to aid in the rest of the Clone Wars.
After the execution of Order-66, the Galactic Empire continued to use these starfighters.
They were usually assigned to older carrier ships and other Imperial installations in the Outer Rim sector.
