# Introduction

Designed by Incom and Subpro Corporations, the Z-95 was a starfighter known for not only it’s longevity, but its resilience, as it was designed before the invasion of Naboo and seen in use even after Thrawn’s attempts to take the galaxy.
It remained in service as a private and low-priority government fighter.
The design was based off of the ARC-170 and would be the basis of the T-65 X-Wing starfighters.
However, unlike both the ARC-170 and X-Wing, the craft did not have a hyperdrive until later models in its service life.

# Section 1

The design was first constructed before the start of the Clone Wars for the Galactic Republic’s use.
It was used by several different types of characters, such as a Bothan pilot by the name of Eelo Begraas around roughly in 31 BBY.
Another notable individual is Nirama, who was a crime lord.
He sponsored Z-95s as ships for racing on Eskaron and to provide armed transport.
A year before the Clone Wars began, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi piloted a Z-95 that had been owned by Senator Rodd whilst on mission to Fondor.
The clone Z-95 starfighter was born during the Clone Wars and was utilized by the Galactic Republic during several different campaigns against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, such as the campaign to take Umbara.

# Section 2

After the fall of the Galactic Republic and rise of the Galactic Empire, the Z-95 Headhunter changed hands to different parties other than the Galactic Empire who wanted a cheaper fighter.
Instead it fell into the hands of pirates and underworld cartels.
The Z-95 was very much out of date by the Galactic Civil War, but because of its resilience, it was still in use by a variety of different parties.
The Rebel Alliance used the Z-95 as a trainer spacecraft and a close air support role.
It was also used temporarily for an Alliance covert operation, by Bandit Squadron.
Despite the fighter’s age and how obsolete it became because of advancements in spacecraft.

# Section 3

Many people of interest after the Galactic Civil War used the Z-95, such as Mara Jade who used a Z-95 that had been modified with a ion cannon instead of a concussion missile launcher.
It was also equipped with hyperdrive technology, allowing the craft’s operational range to exceed its earlier counterparts.
Another individual who used the Z-95 is Jaina Solo, who’s first ship was a Z-95.
Jaden Korr also flew a Z-95, which was also equipped with a hyperdrive.
He used his ship on several missions to several planets.
Several others used the Z-95 well past it’s expected life expectancy, making the craft quite unique, with many upgrades to keep it up to date and on par with more modern starfighters.
