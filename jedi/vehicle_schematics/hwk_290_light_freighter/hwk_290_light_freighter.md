# Introduction

The HWK-290 light freighter, manufactured by CEC (Corellian Engineering Corporation), was a light freighter model that was released a few decades prior to the invasion of Naboo.
It was primarily marketed towards the wealthy elite and high ranking government officials and saw moderate sales continuing into the Galactic Civil War.

The base model was unarmed, but when modified was moderately armed, equipped with Heavy Laser Cannons, a Photon Torpedo Launcher and Incendiary Bombs.
The base model also featured a Class 2 Hyperdrive, a short-range sensor array, a Nav Computer and could store enough consumables to sustain its crew for 3 months.
Its crew capacity was one pilot, one co-pilot and two passengers.

# Section 2

The base model for the HWK-290 was a small unarmed freighter that was dagger-like shaped with wings on its stern.
It was lightly shielded, but very fast and highly customizable.
It usually filled the role of a freighter for high value cargo, but could be easily modified to be a heavy starfighter.

# Section 3

The model was released to the market a few decades prior to the Invasion of Naboo, and although it saw many praises from wealthy individuals, it never reached the YT seriesâ€™s popularity, and manufacturing ended during the clone wars.
However many ships remained in service, even well into the Galactic Civil War.
During the Galactic Civil War HWK-290s were used by a variety of persons, smugglers trying to build a mini fleet, Imperial officials and even the Rebel Alliance used it for a number of missions.
