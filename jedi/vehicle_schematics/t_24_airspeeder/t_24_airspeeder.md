# Introduction
The T-24 airspeeder was an atmospheric airspeeder made and produced by Incom Corporation some time before 32 BBY.
The T-24 was small and curved with only one fin positioned on the top of the central cockpit, featuring a side opening door which allowed for a faster maneuvering of the pilot out of the shuttle.
The flyer had room for one pilot and two passengers.
Incom only made 200 of these, but were deemed an older version by 37 BBY.
Someone called Nella Bold claimed that she had found a green-coloured Incom T-24 after it was abandoned by miners Nella also added cannons.

This T-24 would go on with Nella to assist Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and at the time Padawan Obi-Wan.
The ship would transport them to Taxers Sundown stellar energy station to fuel the ship.
The Jedi was ambushed by the Sundown thugs who stole the stashed goods to their little hideout.
Qui-Gon chased them down on a Speeder Bike but couldn't catch up and Nella was held hostage, where the T-24 was stolen at the docks before anyone could retrieve it.
The model was later on copied for Incoms new T-47 airspeeder model.
