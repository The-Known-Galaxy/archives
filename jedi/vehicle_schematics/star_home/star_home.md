# Introduction
The Star Home, initially constructed by the Hapan, was one of the most spectacular and luxurious spaceships seen throughout the entirety of the galaxy.
The Old Republic referred to it as a "Custom-built Royal Conveyance," the Star Home was a castle located amongst the stars.
It was equipped with capabilities similar to a fleet carrier and held military personnel on board.
The Star Home was referred to as “He” as all Hapan ships were addressed as “He” as opposed to the traditional “She.”

# Section 1
The Star Home was a large ship with a hull measuring 2,500 meters in diameter.
Though the ship looked intimidating and powerful, he had many design flaws, such as being hollowed out in many places, leaving it with a rather weak structure.
Despite this weakness, he was designed to be able to fight through an attack and escape swiftly into hyperspace unscathed.
Although fragile and not designed as a warship, he carried a heavy defense consisting of; 20 Laser cannons, 20 Turbo lasers, six Tractor beams, and 60 Miy’til starfighters.



# Section 2
The Star Home was created by the Queen Mother, the sovereign of the Hapes Consortium, just after 4000 BBY.
His design was an exact replica of the Fountain Palace, the housing of the Hapan throne itself, designed as a showpiece for the Hapan Star Cluster.
The construction was attributed by every planet within the Hapes Consortium, and a key part of the Star Home was that it housed a vast treasury containing many invaluable artifacts gathered from the 63 planets under the reign of the Queen Mother.
