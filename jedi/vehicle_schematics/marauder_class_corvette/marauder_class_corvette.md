# Introduction

The Marauder-class Corvette was a warship originally designed for use by the Galactic Republic by Sienar Technologies, a division of Republic Sienar Systems.
The ship was generally classified as a capital ship, though this designation was in flux throughout its lifespan.
This same company would go on to produce several ships of notoriety including the Scimitar prototype infiltration ship.
The Marauder-class Corvette saw little initial success and would inevitably fall into obscurity despite a fairly adequate design.
Though eventually used fairly widely across the galaxy by minor security and planetary defense forces it never saw mainstream service by any particularly notable force.

# Section 1

The Marauder-class Corvette was designed at an unknown date prior to the Clone Wars.
It was generally estimated to be at least one hundred ninety five meters long, one hundred thirty one meters at its widest, and nearly twenty two meters tall.
It had an estimated one hundred eighty crewmembers and was capable of hauling either eighty troops or three hundred metric tons of cargo.
It was rated to fly up to eight hundred fifty kilometers per hour while in atmospheric conditions.
It sported a class two hyperdrive and a backup class twelve hyperdrive as its primary faster than light modes of travel.
It featured eight dual mounted turbolasers and three tractor beam projectors.
It was designed with the option to install an additional four more dual mounted turbolasers and another variant featured up to four diamond boron missile launcher systems at the sacrifice of its turbolaser systems.
The Marauder also featured adequate space for up to twelve starfighters, two landing barges, or four shuttles.

# Section 2

The Marauder-class Corvette was originally intended for use by the Galactic Republic as a patrol and interdiction ship, though the Republic Navy rejected the design.
The design was eventually sold to the Corporate Sector Authority following incredibly poor sales.
While here it served the Corporate Sector Authority Picket Fleet as a capable escort ship to its various Victory-class Star Destroyers.
Other notable users included the Corellian Resistance, Rebel Alliance, and New Republic Navy.
The design was used as late as 25 ABY by various naval forces across the galaxy though it never saw the success that most Sienar Technologies were known for.
