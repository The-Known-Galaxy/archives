# Introduction

Speeder bikes, or jumpspeeders are open-air vehicles that are used in nearly every world in the galaxy.
The Jedi notably used the Undicur-class Speeder bike, which became well known and used among civilians.
The Clone Wars produced the CK-6 Swoop bikes that are made primarily for the cold climates of worlds like Hoth.

A combat variant of the CK-6 was created also, designed especially for General Grevious.
The Imperial speeder bikes are inspired in design and engineering by the BARC speeders used during the Clone Wars.
One of the newest models of the speeder bike was the 74-Z, the model that was most used during combat by troops, as well as civilians.
One notable scene where the 74-Z was in use was during Order 66, where two Clone Troopers on speeder bikes slowed down and opened fire on Jedi Master Stass Allie, destroying her speeder and causing her to crash and die instantly.
