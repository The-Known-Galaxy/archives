# Introduction
The Nebula-Class Star Destroyer was a ship manufactured by the Republic Engineering Corporation.
The ship was to be used as a command destroyer and carrier.
Introduced in 15 ABY, the Destroyer was created at a time of peace.
The ship was designed to be a Defender-class Destroyer for the New Republic’s core systems.
		The Nebula-Class Star Destroyer was one of the best ships manufactured in the New Republic era, if not the best ship.
It was equipped with almost everything and was run by around 7 thousand people.
While the Imperial-Star Destroyer required around 37 thousand to maintain.
An upgrade from its relative destroyer.
An average Defender would cost approximately 168,528,000 credits.

# Section 1
Eventually, the first destroyer to enter service was named after Jedi Master Obi-wan Kenobi.
By 17 ABY there were about 10 Nebula-Class Star Destroyers in service.
The ships weren’t in the frontlines defending, they were a ship that was tasked to defend the core worlds of the New Republic.
With its unique design, the destroyer was able to hold 60 starfighters, and 13 modes of transport.
Along with having a Class 1 hyperdrive which allowed for faster than light travel, the ship was designed to compete with at least one star destroyer and 2 heavy cruisers.
		Being one of the most advanced ships in its time, the Nebula Star Destroyer was outfitted with 40 heavy turbolaser batteries, 40 turbolaser cannons, 20 ion cannons, 8 tractor beam projectors, and 8 assault concussion missile tubes, each equipped with 30 missiles.
The Destroyer had a food supply that could last its entire crew including troops 6 months.
The production of the vessel was never steady, political tensions, Thrawn’s campaign, and Darth Sidious’s resurrection caused halts in production.



# Section 2
The Nebula Star Destroyer proved its efficiency in the Yuuzhan Vong War.
By the time of Darth Krayt’s Galactic Empire, there was only one Destroyer left.
The Defender shared a similar design with its relative the Endurance-class fleet carrier.
