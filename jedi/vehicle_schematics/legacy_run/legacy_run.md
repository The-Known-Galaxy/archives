# Introduction

The Legacy Run, a Class A modular freight transport, was destroyed in an event known as the Great Hyperspace Disaster.
Fragments of its debris were shot through hyperspace, traveling to various points across the galaxy.

# Section 1

The Legacy Run was a Class A modular freight transport manufactured by Kaniff Yards.
It had a large triangular prism-shaped middle compartment for cargo and engineering.
The ship’s design made it possible that up to 144 smaller modules could be attached, enabling various modifications for different voyages.
While it was over a century old at the time of its destruction, Captain Hedda Casset kept the vessel in pristine condition.

# Section 2

The Legacy Run’s last captain was Hedda Casset, a former military officer.
Lieutenant Jary Bowman served as the executive officer.
During the final voyage, the ship’s bridge was destroyed, killing both Casset and Bowman.
Other crew members included Cadet Kalwar.
Casset believed Kalwar to be only slightly older than a child named Serj Ukkarian.

# Section 3

During its final voyage in 232 BBY, it carried thousands of colonists from the Core Worlds and Colonies to the Outer Rim Territories.
The ship encountered a mass shadow, which turned out to be a Nihil Stormship on a secret hyperspace route.
Despite Captain Casset’s efforts to steer clear of the obstacle, the ship’s old age caused it to lose structural integrity, destroying the vessel.
This event triggered the Great Hyperspace Disaster, with fragments of the ship, known as Emergences, being flung across the galaxy.
The Republic and Jedi started a massive rescue effort to aid stranded survivors.
The Nihil’s leader, Marchion Ro, intentionally designed the catastrophe to cause chaos and destruction.
