# Introduction
Made by the Commercial Guide, this cruiser was a rapid deployment cruiser for OG-9 homing spider droids and DSD1 dwarf spider droids.
Capable of carrying loads of spider droids, this cruiser was fast and very easy for spider droids to be deployed.
This cruiser was very valuable to the Commercial Guide and it was very precious to them.
The cruiser was only armed with a few laser cannons on the ship, which was a con to it, for the cruiser could not have too many guns on since if it did then it would weigh too much and would not be as capable to transport so many droids.
The cannons were very strong though since the spider droids had to get off in certain places so the cannons had to cover fire while they did and if they did not then the spider droids would be killed on sight if given the chance.

The cruiser was an arc shaped vessel powered by a few engines and three sunlight drives.
The Diamond-Class Cruiser became part of the seperist starfleet in the lead up to the Clone-Wars.
Over forty of these were sold to many different people.
The Cruisers was very rare to see, for not many copies were sold of it in the galaxy.
At the Clone wars time, a lot of them showed up to help the Sith escape the wrath of the Jedi.
When the Republic invaded the seperist bases they used these to escape them while their droids fought them off.
Commerce Guide President Shu-Mai would go on to use a modified Diamond-Class Cruiser to fly around in.
