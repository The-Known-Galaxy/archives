# Introduction
The Onager Class Star destroyer was a late Clone Wars superweapon prototype ship called “Siege Breaker'' which was designed to obliterate Seperatist capital ships and Shielded Fortresses on planet surfaces from incredible distances.
Manufactured by Rothana Heavy Engineering with a license from Kuat Drive Yards, the Cruiser-Classed Star Destroyer was heavily armed, well shielded and equipped with two superheavy composite beam turbolasers that could engage enemy ships from distances far surpassing anything else fielded by the Republic or Seperatist Navy at its time.

# Section 1
While the prototype didn’t see any use during the Clone Wars, four cruisers were deployed through-out the Galactic Civil War though this was rare.
The Rebel Alliance Commanders feared the Onager’s capabilities far more than any planet killer, and many within the Empire’s ranks felt that if they had built a fleet of Onager Star Destroyers rather than a planet killer, the war would have ended with a different victor.



# Section 2
After the Battle of  Endor in 4 ABY, with the death of both Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader, the Onager was seen as one of the last, if not the most vital instrument by the Imperial remnant to reclaim power.
Much of the Onager’s statistics, size and power was still unknown by both the Empire and the New Republic years after the battle of Endor, but what was known by Republic Command is that it was much alike to a portable cannon that could destroy almost any ship in a single shot, and thus decreed that any sightings of the Onager class where to immediately be acted upon.
