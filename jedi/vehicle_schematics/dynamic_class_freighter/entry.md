# Introduction

The Dynamic Class Freighter was a light freighter built by a subsidiary of Core Galaxy Systems.
The fighter was only modestly armed and shielded by a few weapons; however, the ship was designed to accept modifications without having to change it too much.
The freighter was very rare throughout the galaxy and it would be hard to get your hands on such a rare thing.
Dynamic Class fighters had relatively very less space in the ship compared to your average one, for they were very lightweight.
These ships were built around the time of the Mandalorian wars.

# Section 1

One of the most notable Dynamic Class Freighters, was the Ebon Hawk, which played a big part in the Jedi Civil War and later on the Dark Times.
The ship was so heavily modified that it was hard to ascertain the ship's builder or even origins.
It was originally owned by various members of the exchange and the Tarisian Crime Lord Davik Kang before Darth Revan.
An amnesiac Republic soldier and unknowingly the former Dark Lord took the ship to escape the Siths fleet.
The Ebon Hawk would eventually resurf under the Jedis command.
