# Introduction

The All Terrain Tactical Enforcer (AT-TE) was an all-around ground Walker and tank used by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars.
Nicknamed “six legs” by the Separatist Droid Army, it featured six legs, multiple laser cannons on its body, and a powerful mass-driver cannon on top.
It was one of the main ground vehicles for the Republic’s Grand Army throughout the war.

The All Terrain Tactical Enforcer had a flexible body design, inspired by a native creature.
Using terrain sensors and magnetized feet, it could travel on various surfaces and climb steep and metal surfaces.
The Walker featured a powerful mass-driver cannon for artillery and anti-spacecraft roles, along with smaller laser cannons for infantry defense.
Its armor was resistant to small arms fire and electromagnetic weapons.
The crew included a pilot, spotter, gunners and troopers, with seating for 20 clone troopers.
Some versions of the AT-TE held smaller transports or served as a mobile command center.
An IM-6 medic droid was placed on board to provide medical assistance to the crew and passengers.

# Section 2

The All Terrain Tactical Enforcer, constructed by Rothana Heavy Engineering, was the primary battle tank for the Galactic Republic’s Grand Army during the Clone Wars.
Referred to as "six legs" by Separatist B1-series battle droids, it played a role in various large and small-scale battles.
A notable usage of the AT-TE was when it scaled a mountain during the Battle of Teth for a rescue mission.
Jedi General Anakin Skywalker deployed AT-TEs onto a Separatist ship in space during the Battle of Devaron, a tactic that, though criticized, was ultimately successful.
The vehicles remained in use throughout the war, such as during the Conquest of Kaller.
Clone Commander Cody chose a blast from an AT-TE to eliminate Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi during Order 66, though it only incapacitated him for a while.

After the Galactic Empire came into power, Republic AT-TEs received modifications to conform to Imperial standards.
They were deployed on Raxus Secundus to quell protests led by Avi Singh.
Clone Force 99 later hijacked one to rescue Singh but destroyed several others during their escape.
In the years following the Clone Wars, AT-TEs were dismantled on the junkyard planet of Bracca.
Fifteen years later, Captain Rex, Commanders Wolffe and Gregor lived in a modified AT-TE on Seelos.
They used it with the Lothal Rebels to thwart Imperial forces, managing to destroy an AT-AT with its cannon.
Rebel mechanics modified some AT-TEs for attack purposes during the Galactic Civil War, creating so-called Elite AT-TEs with enhanced armor and weaponry.
Some AT-TEs saw action in the Imperial defense of the Kuat Drive Yards.
