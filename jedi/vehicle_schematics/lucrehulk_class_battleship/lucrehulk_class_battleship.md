# Introduction
The Lucrehulk-class Battleship, a Battleship used by the Trade Federation before and throughout the Clone Wars, was originally a modified cargo freighter.
Manufactured and designed by Hoersch-Kessel Drive Inc, the Lucrehulks were designed to carry large amounts of container transports and other shipments.

# Section 1
Lucrehulk-class Battleship appears as a large split ring with a spherical bridge in the middle of the ring.
The ship is 3,170 meters long and 3,009 meters wide.
Lucrehulks are equipped with 2 hyperdrives, a grade 2 primary hyperdrive used for most intergalactic maneuvers and jumps and a grade 10 secondary hyperdrive used in emergencies.
Lucrehulks have 3 primary ion engines, 4 secondary ion engines, and 2 tertiary ion engines allowing Lucrehulks to travel a sluggish 500km/h when in an atmosphere



# Section 2
Lucrehulks under control of the CIS were pushed to their limits being equipped with large amounts and variants of different turbo lasers.
Many turbolaser turrets equipped by the Lucrehulk battleship were designed for short point defense.
Rather than being used for large capital ship battles, the Lucrehulk-class battleships were used for blockades and planetary invasions.
The Lucrehulk battleships at maximum capacity could hold 50 landing crafts, 1500 vulture droids for defense, 1500 landing transports, and 6,000 battle tanks.
This carrying capacity makes the Lucrehulk ideal for large planetary invasions.
During the early years of the Clone Wars and during the Invasion of Naboo these ships served as central control ships that gave command and orders to ground mobilized battle droids.
This later was removed, as this posed a serious weakness to the droid army.
Anakin Skywalker destroyed the main Lucrehulk in control of the droid forces, and all battle droids fighting in the fields against the Gungans shut down allowing for an easy victory for the greatly outnumbered Gungan force.
