# Introduction
The YV 865 Aurore-class Freighter, produced and manufactured by CEC (Corellian Engineering Corporation), was a highly durable Freighter often used by the Zygerrian Slave Empire.
Because of this correlation they were often called “Zygerrian slave ships”.

# Section 1
The Freighter measured 52.3 meters in length, 42.33 meters in width and 16.44 meters in height.
It had a maximum atmospheric speed of 900 KPH (Kilometers per hour) and featured a class one Hyperdrive.
It was minimally armed, with only two medium laser cannons and a grappling turret.



# Section 2
The YV 865 Aurore-class Freighter’s crew and passenger capacity was quite large.
It’s crew capacity was a Pilot, an optional Co-pilot, an Engineer, Comms/Sensor operator, a Loadmaster and a gunner.
Its crew capacity was 15 passengers, and 100 prisoners.
Its ration capacity could last for two months.



# Section 3
The YV 865 were very large and bulky freighters, with a very spacious cargo hold that in the case of the Zygerrians, was used for slave trafficking.
Despite its large crew capacity, the vessel could be flown by a single individual, and had one escape pod in case of emergency.



# Section 4
The Freighter was used in the time of the clone wars by the  Zygerrian Empire for slave transport, and one such freighter named “Delta-T-3” was used to transport the captured Jedi Master Obi Wan Kenobi, Captain Rex of the Republic Army and a Republic citizen named Gupat Roshti to the facility on Kavado.
The ship’s use wasn’t limited to the Slave Empire, used across the galaxy, and years later used by the Mining Guild as well.
