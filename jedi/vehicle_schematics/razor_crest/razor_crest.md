# Introduction
The Razor Crest is a gunship that was employed as an Imperial patrol ship at around 19BBY.
The Razor Crest is equipped with 2 main engines, one on each side of the ship.
It used two front-facing laser cannons to attack and defend itself, it also had a  hyperdrive.
After some time it ended up in the hands of a Mandalorian named Din Djarin, also known as “Mando”.While under the use of the Mandalorian Din Djarin, the Razor Crest was used primarily for bounty hunting and eventually for traveling around and protecting Grogu.
It lived all the way through the Imperial Era and was destroyed on 9 ABY on the planet Tython.
It was completely destroyed by one shot of a turbo laser from a light cruiser.
The only things noted to survive were a Beskar staff that Din Djarin had picked up during his travels, and a small control knob that Grogu liked to play with.
