# Introduction
The alpha-3 nimbus-class v-wing starfighter was a light interceptor that was used by the Galactic Republic in the Clone Wars.
This ship had a wedge-like shape with 4 small wings on the sides and was equipped with light twin laser cannons, along with a forward-mounted concussion missile launcher.
These light vessels had major importance in tasks such as dogfights as well as support for transport vessels and more.

# Section 1
Having been invented by Kuat Systems, it was because of the alpha-3 nimbus-class v-wing starfighter’s miniature characteristics compared to other ships.
It was known to be similar to the delta-7 aethersprite-class interceptors, which were commonly used by the Jedi Order.
Both the Delta-7, as well as the Alpha-3 ship schematics had been designed by engineer Walex Blissix.
This great multi-purpose interceptor is still used with great purpose to this day.
