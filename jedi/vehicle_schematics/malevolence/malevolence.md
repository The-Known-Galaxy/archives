# Introduction
Planned, constructed, and put into service by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Malevolence was a sight to behold and an immense force to be reckoned with.
Made and labeled as a subjugator-class ship by the Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps, this heavy cruiser sported an interesting and iconic primary arsenal that has rarely ever been seen before on such a scale — two mega ion cannons.
These two debilitating weapon systems could knock out shields, communication arrays, and weapon systems of those caught in the O-shaped ion ring.
The rest of the ship’s plethora of weapons contained a tractor beam, five-point defense laser cannons, and a whopping total of 500 turbo lasers — which could all open up simultaneously in a broadside engagement with disabled enemy vessels floating helplessly in space.


On top of this, the cruiser was massive in size compared to most ships in its time, being five full lengths of the Republic’s Venator-class cruisers and some change.
This required a lot of manpower, leading to the 900 droids dedicated to serving as crew members.
This number does not include the infantry on board, ranging in the thousands — from B1 and B2 battle droids to droidekas.
This ship also contained B1-series rocket droids, including reports of B2-HA battle droids, being used to eliminate escape pods deployed from helpless Republic ships caught in its range.
Though the ship’s primary arsenal could sustain itself, the use of fighters in open space would prove difficult to repel, so multiple hangars housing vulture-class droid starfighters were utilized to deploy and engage opposing bombers and attacking spacecraft.

# Section 1
The initial shock and awe of the Malevolence occurred in 22 BBY, when the Republic lost communication with Jedi Master Plo-Koon and his fleet after an engagement with the subjugator-class cruiser.
After a hard-fought escape, Plo-Koon and a small detachment of surviving clone troopers were able to relay information on the Malevolence and its last known location and paths - beginning an assault on the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center, aiming to eliminate more than 60,000 clones being treated on board.
The cruiser was intercepted by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and the Shadow Squadron detachment of Y-Bombers, able to hold them off while a fleet of Venator-class ships came into range and forced the Malevolence to retreat.

On the backfoot and seeking a route for escape, General Grievous sought to capture Republic Senator Padmé Amidala as a hostage, seeing as they happened to jump into the same system she was traveling through.
Her capture was brief, as Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker boarded the Malevolence as a rescue mission, taking her back and knocking the cruiser’s hyperdrive back offline.
In a daring escape, Senator Amidala and her rescuers were able to get a safe enough distance away for Republic Venators to engage.
In a last-ditch attempt, the crew aboard the Malevolence attempted to jump to a secure Separatist base in Sector-4; however, due to malfunctions with the navigation, sent the now doomed cruiser on course into the Dead Moon of Antar.
General Grievous made his escape.
And, in the same year as it was introduced, the subjugator-class heavy cruiser was pronounced destroyed in 22 BBY.
