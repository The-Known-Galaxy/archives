# Introduction
The Kragg’s Fury was a flagship that was once told in fable legends, but was discovered to be true, along with the fable of its Captain, Hez Kragg.
The Fury was a flagship that was similar to a Victory-class Star Destroyer.
It was equipped with several weapons, including power turrets, blaster cannons, missile tubes, grappler claws, and a tractor beam.

It would be shortly before Space Pirate Hez Kragg’s death that the Kragg’s Fury would be hidden in the System VV-99-7JE-2N71, where it would remain and be set with traps throughout the flagship.
A Scholar by the name of Jonas Durns would try to enter the Kragg’s Fury, trying to claim Nijune Treasure Fleet’s riches.
However, when Durns accidentally triggered a trap, the ship had automatically set itself to crash into the nearest star in the area.
