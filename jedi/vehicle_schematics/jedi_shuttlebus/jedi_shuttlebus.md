# Introduction
The Jedi Shuttlebus often went by other names, such as: Senate Shuttlebus, Senate Speeder, or even Jedi Shuttle.
This Shuttlebus was one of the varieties of the airbus, mainly used on the planet of Coruscant within the last few years of the Galactic Republic, usually by members of the Jedi Order and Galactic Senate.
This unique shuttlebus was an estimated eighteen meters long, with an appearance that was similar to the 3000 airbus, which people used to transport in Galactic City.
It was manufactured by GoCorp.

After the Battle of Coruscant, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine was accompanied back by Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi in a Jedi shuttlebus.
Kenobi then traveled to the Jedi Temple to report to the Jedi High Council about what had transpired during the battle.
A distinct number of other shuttlebuses were docked at the Executive Building at that time, most likely used by other Senators and Republic Officials.
