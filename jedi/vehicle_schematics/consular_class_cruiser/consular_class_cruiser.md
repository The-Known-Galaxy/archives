# Introduction

The Consular-class cruiser was a spacecraft made by the Corellian Engineering Corporation and used widely by the Jedi.
Due to its frequent usage by the Republic, it was also referred to as the Republic cruiser.
It was 115 meters in length and could exert a maximum speed of 900 kilometers per hour.
These ships were made for the purpose of transportation, rather than combat, and often carried various diplomats.

In the year 32 BBY, a Consular-class cruiser was used to transport Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-wan Kenobi to the Trade Federationâ€™s battleship.
Additionally, some of them were repurposed as small frigates during the Clone Wars, having weapon batteries added.
These starships were painted red to symbolize ambassadorial relations.
