# Introduction

Mon Calamari Cruisers were large cruisers that were used during the times of the Rebel Alliance and New Republic.
Most would be deployed during the Galactic Civil War to fulfill its duty of restoring freedom to the galaxy, like before the dark times.
However, all Mon Calamari Cruisers would be handmade so each ship would be different to another, some could have bumps and others may have dots along the surface.
The only problem is that because of how they were all different, it would take a whole for a damaged cruiser to be repaired.
Being built for civilian purposes, it was first used for transportation across the galaxy.
These cruisers were designed by the Mon Calamari species as you can tell by the name, and were actually the first largest capital ships available to the Rebel Alliance.
This gave it the ability to rival the Empireâ€™s largest capital ship, the Star Destroyer, and frighten them more than before.
During the New Republic, the Mon Calamari began to spew out more designs that were more for military uses and not civil.
All civil designs would disappear into the unknown and try to focus on the new ones for the future.
At the time of the Yuuzhan Vong War, they would create new designs such as the Mediator-class battlecruiser.
These cruisers would be defended in battles by the Defense Fleet, allowing the cruisers to play their key role.
