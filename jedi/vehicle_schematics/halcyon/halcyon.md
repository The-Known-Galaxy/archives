# Introduction

The Halcyon is a Purgill-class Star Cruiser that was commissioned in 241 BBY.
The MPO-1400 model ship was a passenger ship owned and operated by Chandrila Star Line.
The ship held a similar ventral hanger bay to that of a Star Destroyer made for the Imperial Navy.
It contained 13 engines, which allowed the ship to move.
A pair of docking rings on both the port and starboard side of the ship are used for boarding the ship.
Designed for Launch Pod Docks, the docking rings are equipped with airlocks that allow passengers from planetside to access the ship whilst in orbit.

# Section 1

The ship was constructed well before not just the First Order-Resistance War, but the Clone Wars as well.
Its maiden voyage was to the planet of Batuu, a common destination for the starship.
In the tenth year of its service, the ship was captured by Nihil pirates.
However, due to the  actions of Jedi Knight Nib Assek and her Padawan Burry, they saved the ship.
In 230 BBY, the Halcyon helped in the Dalnan evacuation by towing Starlight Beacon through hyperspace.
The Halcyon was the site of a small skirmish between both the Republic and Confederacy during the Clone Wars.

# Section 2

During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the Halycon had entered a sad state, becoming a vacation spot for Imperial officers.
The ship was also stripped of most of its interior.
After the fall of the Empire, the ship was restored to its former glory.
The ship’s long life wasn’t finished however and was called into war during the Battle of Batuu.
Captained by Riyola Keevan, the ship posted a notice for a mechanic who can speak Shyriiwook at Oga’s Cantina in Black Spire Outpost on the planet Batuu.
