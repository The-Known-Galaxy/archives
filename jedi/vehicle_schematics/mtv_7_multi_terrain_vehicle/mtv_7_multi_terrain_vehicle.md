# Introduction

The MTV-7 is a scouting vehicle that fits two sets of single large tracks that are mounted on two wheels.
It’s crew configuration surprisingly is but just a single person who is the driver and gunner.
Aboard the MTV-7 is a single laser cannon for its firepower, it was capable of extending its wheeled-tracks out to the front and rear of the body to give the vehicle a low profile.
That in combination with the grooved surface treading capabilities of the tracks made the MTV-7 a highly versatile machine upon many forms of terrains.The usage of this vehicle by the Galactic Empire ground forces on Hoth was its most notable event.

At least (3) of these vehicles were recorded during the assault on the Rebel Alliance Echo Base during the Imperial Campaign, 3 ABY.
Usually piloted by Snowtroopers and the occasional Imperial Army Pilots, these machines were easily transported.
Especially over the option of an AT-ST or a “chicken walker”.
This was because of its compact ability to fold its wheeled-tracks up under the hull.
The crew also required less psychological preparation to use one of these over a Speeder Bike and their pilots suicidal daredevil aptitudes.
Though it was a scouting vehicle, I wouldn’t want to find myself in front of a rotating laser cannon.
