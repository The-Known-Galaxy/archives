Manufactured by Gefferon Pleasure Craft, the Eclipse was a medium sized luxury sail barge model.
Sold for 250,000 credits, the sail barge was outfitted with a luxurious interior and could easily accommodate up to 225 passengers.
The Eclipse could hold 250 metric tons of cargo, and while this class of sail barge was generally unarmed, add-on weapon systems were also produced.
