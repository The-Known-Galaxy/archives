# Introduction

The Gaze Electric, the starship, was owned by Marchion Ro.
Marchion Ro was a man that was the Eye of Nihil in the Nihil criminal organization during the High Republic days.
The Gaze Electric was not like any other starship in the Nihil organization, this starship was not only owned by the father of Marchion Ro, Asgar Ro, but it was also garrisoned with droids and hired personnel.

# Section 1

One of the reasons the Gaze Electric was crewed by droids and hired personnel was Marchion Ro's inability to trust the members of the Nihil to be stationed on the Gaze Electric.
The Gaze Electric also accommodated the medical pod of a Force-sensitive woman named Mari San Tekka.
