# Introduction
The Magna-spike was a type of modification made to a vehicle.
Though it is not entirely clear what the Magna-spike’s purpose was, it is surmised that it was used for one of two things.
The first surmised use was as a magnetic spike that would attach to objects and physically latch on to them with spikes, thus interfering with the components of the vehicle and inhibiting a podracer’s ability to function normally.
The second surmised use was as a magnet that interfered with repulsorlift technology when latched onto a podracer, making it spin out of control and crash.

The Magna-spike’s only recorded instance of being used was by Sebulba, a notorious Podracer who was the champion of the Mos Espa Grand Arena, and was particularly adored for his race during the Boonta Eve Classic, until he was upstaged by Anakin Skywalker.

Sebulba was a male Dug who originated from the planet Malastare.
Dugs were creatures bearing some semblance to a monkey, yet their skin was rather dehydrated and they had long snouts.
The Dugs also walked using their arms.
Sebulba used Magna-spikes on his podracer.

Sebulba’s podracer was a massive, orange podracer, notable for its enormous Plug-F-Mammoth Split-X Turbojet engines, which were engines developed by Collor Pondrat.
These engines were some of the fastest podracing engines conceivable, yet they were also extremely fragile and unstable.
These engines were fast due to their use of chem-boosting, which was essentially the usage of certain chemicals or minerals to boost an engine’s performance.
Sebulba’s enormous success stemmed largely from this podracer, as it was illegally modified in many ways.

Firstly, the engines of the podracer were modified with tradium, which was pressurized with quold runium, and finally, injected with ionized injectrine.
These volatile chemicals gave the podracer a distinct rumbling sound as it blasted down the track at incredible speeds.

The podracer also utilized weapons.
The most notable of these was the flamethrower, a device that shot liquid, usually some sort of gas, and then used a small flame to produce a continuous stream of fire.
This made him incredibly powerful as he could set any podracer aflame when he was within a cave.
Sebulba’s podracer had modifications such as nail shooters and buzz saws, which he used to become a significant threat to any other racer on the track.
Finally, Sebulba also made use of Magna-spikes on his podracer, increasing his level of threat further.
To conclude, Magna-spikes were a weapon modification, usually to podracers, that could interfere in some way with other Podracers.
