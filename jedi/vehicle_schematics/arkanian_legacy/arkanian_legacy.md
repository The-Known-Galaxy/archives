# Introduction
The Arkanian Legacy, a large capital Ship, was the primary headquarters of The Adasca BioMechanical Corporation of Arkania, though mainly known as Adascorp to most individuals that interacted with the vessel.
The vessel was primarily used during  the Mandalorian Wars, until its destruction 3963 years before the Battle of Yavin IV.

With a more medium-sized crew for a ship of its size, the Arkanian Legacy only employed five thousand  beings to its crew.
With four light turbolaser batteries, along with twelve medium of the same type, the Arkanian Legacy’s firepower was almost unrivaled at the time of it’s commission into the Mandalorian War.
The ship also contained an accompanying fleet of twenty-four Starfighters, and eight other various shuttles, excluding  Lord Arkoh Adasca’s personal fleet and various shuttles.
The Arkanian Legacy also had a class 2 hyperdrive, containing a class 8 backup hyperdrive in cases of emergency retreats, or the primary hyperdrive becoming inoperable.The Arkanian Legacy could hold approximately ten thousand tons of cargo,  around one hundred thousand passengers, and almost two years worth of stored  consumables, including food and other various resources.



# Section 2
Originally constructed during the Great Sith War by Aragaloh and his son Alok, the Arkanian Legacy was primarily used  to keep the headquarters of Adascorp quickly out of harm's way and generally protected from most slower, less mobile threats in the galaxy.
Around 3963 years before the Battle of Yavin IV, the galaxy was engulfed in another large-scale conflict that would mold the course of it’s history; The Mandalorian Wars.
Referring back to an idea held by his grandfather, Aragaloh, Arkoh Adasca had then plotted to use exogorths, a rare species of massive space slug, to create a profit and new standing stage for Adascorp on the galactic stage.
With his plan almost underway, Arkoh had The  Mandalorians, Jedi Order and his own Adascorp warriors fighting on another, though two Jedi were able to see through the guise Arkoh had made.
Sadly, the exogorths were still incredibly powerful, and eventually took the lives of most individuals involved in the conflict aboard the Arkanian Legacy.
After the conflict had finally ended, the Galactic Republic declared the ship unable to be salvaged, and let it drift into contested space as the Mandalorian War was still occuring.



# Section 3
Eventually, near the end of the Mandalorian War, a raiding party said to consist of mainly Mandalorians raided the Arkanian Legacy for what is documented to be the final time.
This raiding party would also discover Arkoh Adasca to still be alive,  only to end his life promptly after the discovery.
