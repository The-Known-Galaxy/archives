# Introduction
The Super Tank was created by the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
Its possible origins  are the AAT merged with the MTT.
With a small crew of only two members including a pilot and a gunner, if either crew member was taken out, then the tank was rendered useless.
It was quite large, being 12.6 meters in length alone.
It being armed with twin blaster cannons, twin laser cannons, and two concealed warhead launches made it a powerful weapon.
The ray shield and its heavy armor made it nearly impossible to be penetrated, making it a fairly slow tank only able to go about twenty-five miles per hour.
The Battle of Geonosis was the first time the Super Tank was deployed and used in battle.
Also this would be the Super Tanks last deployment.
With the Republic being victorious at the battle, the droid factory based there was destroyed and with it the Super Tank.
With the CIS suffering a crushing defeat on Geonosis, and the loss of the droid factory, the Super Tank was not able to be reproduced and used again to help their efforts within the war.
