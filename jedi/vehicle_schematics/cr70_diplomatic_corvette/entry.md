# Introduction

The CR70 Corvette was the predecessor to the more famous CR90 Corvette, also known as the “Rebel Blockade Runner.” Like its successor, the CR70 was manufactured by the Corellian Engineering Corporation.
Unlike its successor, the CR70 lacked any stock armaments.
Being 30 meters shorter than the later CR90, the CR70 possessed a length of about 120 meters.
When the CR90 was produced later, the CEC gave the option of retrofitting the older CR70s.

Due to the superiority of the CR90, the CEC offered the Vanguard c20 refit package to upgrade older CR70s to the standards of CR90s.
The most visible indications of a CR70 that had undergone the refit package were ring-like fins and extra thruster modules to complement the 11 engines that the CR70 already possessed.
The retrofit process would take 2-3 weeks to complete.
Once fully retrofitted, the CR70 would be a few meters longer and possess a second docking ramp at the back of the vessel.
The addition of weaponry to the CR70 was a popular choice when retrofitting the aging craft.
Despite the age of the CR70, retrofitted vessels like the Sundered Heart would continue to see service even into the Galactic Civil War.
