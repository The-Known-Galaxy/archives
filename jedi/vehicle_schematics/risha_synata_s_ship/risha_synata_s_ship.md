# Introduction
Rish Synata’s ship was a golden and dark-red themed starship owned by the Frenk actress Risha Synata.
The ship’s notable features included a large open-space hangar bay, as well as an enormous statue of the actress.
The starship contained exhibits featuring non-sentient species, such as opee sea killers and gundarks, and a luxurious reception hall filled with portraits and posters of the actress, emphasizing her many talents and achievements.
The vessel had numerous guest rooms, some with viewports looking out into space.
Aurebesh markings representing Synata’s initials could be found throughout all parts of the ship.

# Section 1
Synata’s starship had a theater and casino, as well as an extensive (although debatably accurate) museum of galactic history.
Named “Madam Synata’s Genius of a Thousand Faces Museum,” the exhibit contained dioramas of planets and locations, as well as depictions of well-known senators and Jedi.
While most of the ship was lavishly decorated, a hidden metallic viewing deck dedicated to the cause of the Confederacy of Independent Systems existed, along with a droid control center, utilizing LEP-series service droids as servants.
