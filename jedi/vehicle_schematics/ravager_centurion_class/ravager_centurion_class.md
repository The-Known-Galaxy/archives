# Introduction
The Ravager was a Centurion-class battlecruiser utilized by the Republic Navy.
During the Mandalorian Wars this battlecruiser was a vital vessel and was sought after.
In the final battle of the Mandalorian Wars, the ship was destroyed, leaving it to drift in orbit until Darth Nihilus decided to salvage what was left.
Using the force he repaired it to make it habitable for himself and a few Force slaves.

# Section 1
The ship itself was technically unlivable and would be impossible to man.
Due to the damage it had sustained from the Mass Shadow Generator, infrastructure and plating had been torn off.
The Ravager was taken to Katarr, a planet which Darth Nihilus had drained the life force of and used to power parts of the ship.
By making alliances, Darth Nihilus was able to power the ship once more and head to Telos IV to feed off of its energy.



# Section 2
As a stand to defend Telos IV, Meetra Surik, Visas Marr and Canderous Ordo boarded The Ravager to kill Darth Nihilus and end the attack.
Their method of attack was to plant proton charges at the weak places affected by the Mass Shadow Generator.
In the end, they dueled Darth Nihilus, killing him and destroying The Ravager.
