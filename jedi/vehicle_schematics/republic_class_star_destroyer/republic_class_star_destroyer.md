# Introduction
Rendili StarDrive created the Republic-class Star Destroyer for the New Republic.
Due to its architect, former Rendili designer Walex Blissex, it was marketed as a Rendili design.
The ship's bulbous, organic-like shape spoke of substantial influence from the Mon Calamari Shipyards, and it was more of a political move aimed to attract Rendili away from the Galactic Empire.
The Republic-class Star Destroyer was smaller than Blissex's daughter Lira's Imperial-class Star Destroyer, but it was a considerably more economical design.

# Section 1
Despite being half the price of an Imperial-class Star Destroyer and having a fifth of the crew size, the Republic-class had 20% more firepower than the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer.
The Imperial II-class Star Destroyer and the several Super Star Destroyers, however, were still superior.
40 heavy turbolaser batteries, 40 heavy turbolaser cannons, 20 ion cannons, and 10 tractor beam projectors made up the armament.
A Class 2 hyperdrive, similar to that found on the Imperial-class, was also installed on the Republic-class.
The Republic-class was just 1,250 meters long, much shorter than the Imperial-class, which was 1,600 meters long.
Because the smaller spacecraft retained a similar level of firepower, cargo capacity and endurance had to be sacrificed.
The Republic-class was equipped with enough consumables to last two years without resupply, compared to two years for the Imperial I-class and six years for the Imperial II-class.
Only a single regiment of 3,200 ground troops, as well as a single entire New Republic wing, could be carried aboard.
Long-range starfighters, rather than short-range fighters like the Defender and K-wing starfighters, were usually carried by Republic-class ships.



# Section 2
One of the first warship models designed for the New Republic's standardization efforts was the Republic-class.
Due to the Thrawn campaign in 9 ABY and Emperor Palpatine's return the following year, production on the Republic-class and other vessels was finally restarted at a lower level, and the new ships were scattered across the fleet.
The New Class Modernization Program was selected to build its largest ships from Republic Engineering Corporation's Nebula-class Star Destroyer hull design rather than the Republic-class Star Destroyer.
Despite this, the New Republic had managed to establish a sizable number of Republics by the time of the Black Fleet Crisis.
