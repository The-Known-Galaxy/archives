# Introduction

If any space traveler in the galaxy was asked to name a starship class off the top of their head, more than likely they would cite the YT-1300 light freighter.
Developed by the famous Corellian Engineering Corporation, the YT-1300 was as ubiquitous to supply lines as Tie Fighters were to the Imperial Starfleet.
It was beloved by pilots because its modular design made it easily customizable for a plethora of jobs, both legal and less-than-legal.
Used by shady smugglers and honest freight captains alike, the YT-1300 became commonplace quickly after its introduction in 72 BBY.
The YT-1300 freighter would see great demand even a century after its first models left the shipyards.

# Section 1

Intrepid owners of the saucer-shaped YT-1300 could remove and replace entire sections of the freighter to their hearts’ desires.
While most YT-1300 possessed a cockpit on the right side of the hull, the modular craft could be modified to have the cockpit lie on the left side or even in the front between its two mandibles.
Its two mandibles at the front of the craft could be used to haul external cargo pods, over even to tug containers larger than the YT-1300 itself.
Some owners opted to upgrade the YT-1300’s standard armament with semi-legal alternatives.
Han Solo had the famous Millenium Falcon modified to fire missiles from a launcher held behind the craft’s distinctive twin mandibles.
Han Solo also replaced the standard light laser cannons with quad laser cannons he stole from Imperials.

# Section 2

The most famous YT-1300 was easily the Millenium Falcon.
The Millenium Falcon was owned by many individuals over its long life and bore many different names.
The swindler Lando Calrissian lost the Millenium Falcon to Han Solo over a game of sabacc.
Wearing its wear-and-tear as a badge of honor, Han Solo refused to fully repair the Millenium Falcon.
Alongside the Wookiee Chewbacca as his copilot, Han Solo would ensure that the Millenium Falcon would have a place in the annals of history.
