# Introduction
Alter was an advanced Force ability that was only taught to Jedi Knights who had mastered the Control and Sense Force powers.
It involved the manipulation of objects, beings and environments.
Non-trained Force-sensitives who came across these abilities often caused disastrous events.
Not progressing to the Alter discipline meant perceiving the Force but lacking the ability to manipulate it.
The major techniques of Alter were telekinesis (Force push and pull), affect mind (controlling weak-minded individuals), and Alter Environment (manipulation of natural phenomena like lightning and whirlwinds).
