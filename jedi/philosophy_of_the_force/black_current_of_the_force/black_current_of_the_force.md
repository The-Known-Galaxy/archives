# Introduction

The Force is balanced; it is equal.
The Black Current of the Force represented this statement.
One of the most balanced and equal parts of the Force, the Black Current, provided delicate enlightenment to those who are Force-sensitive and flows through them.

# Section 1

The Black Current of the Force would conjure precise manipulations and cause catastrophic waves that could have devastating impacts.
There was another section of the Force, the White Flare of the Force, which was the opposite of the Black Current and was also balanced.
The Black Current could defy gravity and cause anything to anchor itself against gravity.
It had the ability to conceal the appearances and emotions of beings either entirely or partially.
It could trick the minds of sentient and humanoid beings with the Force.
And by connecting a mind to the Black Current, it could manipulate the memory and intent of the being to the userâ€™s choice.
If the mind was in a panic, it could be manipulated into soothing thoughts.
