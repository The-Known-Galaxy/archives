# Introduction
Control was an aspect of Force powers in the Jedi Order.
Initiates were first taught how to use the Control Force ability, so they may connect to the Force and use abilities relating to their own body.
This discipline included three main abilities: energy absorption (tutaminis), self-healing (curato salva), and increasing focus on the Force (altus sopor).
The developments of these skills would continue throughout a Jedi’s life and served as the foundation for later abilities.
