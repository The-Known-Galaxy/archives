# Introduction
A mass outbreak of a newly discovered disease started spreading shortly after the Second Galactic War.
However, this disease was not considered normal; this was a mental disease.
Force psychosis affected younger Jedi causing a constant deterioration of one's mental psyche.
Victims of Force psychosis would often become paranoid, believing that everyone who did not personally know them was a threat.

# Section 1
With this mass outbreak, the Jedi Order took many of the initial Jedi to study.
Many of these Jedi inflicted with Force psychosis would show signs of advanced Force abilities that other Jedi had never seen before.
These abilities were often incredibly powerful and difficult to perform.
One of these Jedi, Bazel Warv, had shown the ability to change the density of matter.
Powerful Jedi Knights such as Jacen Solo had never seen the Force used this way and could only imagine possessing such an ability.

Along with these Jedi, others had been inflicted with Force psychosis.
It was known to affect every Force-sensitive, and because of this, some Force-sensitives had contracted the disease and lived with it for many years.
These Force-sensitives would be called Mind Walkers.
Having traveled to a realm of the Force called beyond shadows, their once paranoia was now a strong belief that nothing else in the universe existed except the Force.
They had become consumed by the Force; it was all they knew and all they thought real.



# Section 2
Luke Skywalker and his son Ben Solo would eventually locate what they believed to be the source of the Force psychosis.
However, they could not defeat this pure dark side entity by themself.
Given that Sith was also Force-sensitive, they thought it wise to call a truce with the Sith and ally for the time being.
Luke and the Sith would travel to the Maw, home to the dark side entity named Abeloth.

This truce would not last, as the Sith would eventually turn on the Jedi and attempt to force Abeloth to do their bidding; despite this, Luke would still defeat Abeloth and stop the disease.
After this victory, every Force-sensitive diseased would suddenly find themselves completely cured as if it never happened.
Both the Sith and Jedi would stay after their victory to inspect and study Abeloth; during this time, they would realize that the entity had survived and escaped.



# Section 3
The Pool of Knowledge was a Force nexus located on Maw within the Force realm; this Pool was said to provide Force visions to those who would bathe in it.
Knowing this, Sith High Lord Sarasu Taalon stepped foot into the Pool of Knowledge.
However, instead of witnessing visions, the Sith High Lord would begin transforming into an entity reminiscent of Abeloth.
To end this quickly, Sith Apprentice Vestara Khai would kill him.
Unfortunately for them, this would not kill Abeloth, and the entity could flee again.

Since the Knights were no longer under the effects of Force psychosis, Luke concluded that they did not need to kill Abeloth but rather keep her in a constant state of weakness.
This, unfortunately, would be proven wrong, as after Jedi Knights Valin and Jysella Horn's rescue from carbonite, they would once again fall sick to this disease.



Luke would again engage in another battle with Abeloth, freeing Valin and Jysella from their psychosis.
However, as Abeloth regained her strength, she was able to influence the Sith to abandon their tribe and join her.
