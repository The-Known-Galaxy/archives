# Introduction

Force healing or Cure was an ability within the Force that allowed the user to accelerate one’s natural healing process.
This could range from surface wounds such as scratches to more fatal ones.
Jedi Healers often used this power to treat their patients of diseases or illnesses.
A remarkable usage of this ability was by Cilghal, a Mon Calamari Jedi Master, who cured Mon Mothma of a molecular poison that was deemed incurable.

# Section 1

The practice of this ability was frequent.
Ki-Adi-Mundi used this Force power to fix a broken collar bone through the means of meditation.
The power itself can often be applied by simply meditating to fix injuries, but sometimes it requires greater application such as another person using it on someone else.

# Section 2

It was often believed that those attuned with the dark side of the Force could not use Cure.
This belief was wrong, they could use this ability but it came at a cruel price.
Dark side practitioners such as Darth Sion were able to focus all their pain and suffering to one area which would instantly heal that wound.

# Section 3

Another modified version of Cure was a technique called Dark Transfer.
This ability came from a man named Cade Skywalker.
Skywalker was able to use his powers and bring back someone from the verge of death.
The usage of this ability often resulted in intense emotional stress.
Skywalker believed that due to the severe emotional stress, he’d need to tap into dark-sided energy to handle this power.
Jedi Master Wolf Sazen disagreed, stating that with training, a light-sided user could also obtain this power.
This point was later proven right.
