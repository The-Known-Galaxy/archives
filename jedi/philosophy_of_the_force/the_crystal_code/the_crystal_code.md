# Introduction
The Crystal Code is a mantra recited by a Jedi watching their students build their first lightsaber.
It served importance for them to feel the presence of the Force while constructing their lightsaber, understanding the importance of the weapon and its ability.
For the Jedi Order, a lightsaber is not just a weapon, it is a tool to help them connect more with the Force.
This was not often practiced since students construct their lightsaber privately as a separate tradition.

# Section 1
Before a Jedi Youngling construct their lightsaber, they will first be tested by the Force through the Crystal Gathering.
The Gathering takes place on a Jedi Temple in the planet Ilum, where most of the Kyber Crystals are located.


When a Gathering is held and the Younglings arrive on Ilum, they must first open the sealed entrance of the Temple, this served as the first test: where they will connect with the Force to open the entrance.
Once opened, they will be guided by a Jedi–of a higher rank–and explain the purpose and importance of the Gathering, together with the Kyber Crystals.
Greeted at the entrance, under a waterfall, of the Crystal Cave, a limited amount of time will be set in finding their Crystal as the waterfall on the entrance of the cave will slowly freeze as the sun sets.

After all the explanation is done, the Younglings will enter, tasked to find a Kyber Crystal within.
They will be faced with various obstacles and will be guided by the Force.
Once they collect their Kyber Crystal, they will return and exit the cave.

Following the success of the Gathering, the Younglings will now construct and assemble their lightsaber through the use of the Force and the Jedi supervising them will recite the Crystal Code.
Once assembled, they will be able to use the lightsaber to their heart’s content.
