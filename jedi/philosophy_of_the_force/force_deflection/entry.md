# Introduction

Force deflection is a technique used by both Jedi and Sith alike when they have no lightsaber to defend themselves with, or, alternatively, choose not to carry one.
It takes much skill and connection with the Force to use it properly and in most cases, Jedi choose to deflect incoming attacks with their lightsaber instead of using Force deflection.

# Section 1

The process toward performing Force deflection is quite hard to master, as an individual must project a concentrated amount of Force to mimic some sort of protective barrier around wherever they project it, like a shield.
Some might argue that it is a more refined version of the Force push, the technique that pushes anything an individual is facing away, that many Jedi know.
Like the Force push, most who know it need to extend their hand outward to concentrate the amount of force needed to deflect an oncoming projectile, but a true master of this technique may even be able to use it without lifting even a finger.

# Section 2

Notable uses of this power include: Former Jedi Knight Revan using the power to hold and deflect incoming Force lightning from Darth Nyriss and later against the Sith Emperor, Jedi Master Yoda deflecting an oncoming blast of Force lighting sent by Darth Tyranus, who was his former padawan before turning to the dark, and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi deflecting the bounty hunter Durge's projectiles, and later against a group of droidekas.
