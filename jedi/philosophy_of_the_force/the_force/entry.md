# Introduction

The Force was an essence that surrounded everything, it was inside of all life forms and flowed through the galaxy.
It was what gave Sith, Jedi, Dark Jedi, Grey Jedi, and many other Force-sensitives strength and built their belief system.
Sometimes, the Force was viewed as a deity and was believed to have an intelligent mind of its own.
The Force had many forms, there was the Cosmic Force, the Living Force, the Physical Force, and the Unifying Force.
All of these were different views of the Force and contained different morals behind its use.
These forms bind life itself together and could flow through beings differently.
The Living Force was the Force that flow through living things, the Cosmic Force was life after death, the Physical Force was what surrounded all physical matter, and the Unifying Force dealt with space and time.

The Force in general was abstract and could be manifested by those strong with it but the Force was divided.
The Force could withdraw energy from the user’s emotions.
There were two main areas of the Force, however.
There was the Light Side and the Dark Side.
The Light Side was studied and used within the Jedi Order whilst the Dark Side was used by the Sith.
Each had its own unique abilities and could be dangerous, especially the Dark Side of the Force.
Both needed each other for balance.
The Force did not support one side, it was neutral and balanced.
Although, many Sith believed that the Dark Side was more powerful than the Light, however the temptation of the Dark Side was where this belief stemmed from, both sides were equally as powerful depending on the user.
However, not everyone could use the Force, only those who were deemed Force-sensitive could.
Sometimes, the Force flowed through beings who had a high count of midi-chlorians, a microorganism within the blood, stronger and made them more sensitive.
However, a few Force-sensitives could tap into the Force and use its abilities for stamina, agility, skill and to shape the world around them.
It was referred to as Force aura.
The Force dates back to roughly 36,453 BBY, where scholars and scientists all gathered on Tython, a planet powerful in the Light Side of the Force, and discovered the Force from mysterious knowledge, and research about the topic.

# Section 1

The Light Side of the Force was the Force used for good intentions, such as healing, good morals, and benevolence.
The Light Side of the Force was studied mainly within the Jedi Order and gave the Jedi strength and discipline.
It was a powerful philosophy and shaped many different beings.
Those who followed the Light Side desired a peaceful and harmonious galaxy where people acted out of logic and wisdom rather than anger and fear.
Most people who followed the Light Side would often meditate so they could prevent themselves from succumbing to the treachery of the Dark Side.
Meditation often cleared the minds and would rid any negative emotions that led to the Dark Side, such as fear and hatred.
It was often recommended or rather assumed that those who studied and followed the Light Side would have to rid all emotions including love and passion so that if a loved one was ever in peril and it came between saving them or a larger group of people, the Light Side would always save as many people as possible.
This was seen differently by different Light Side users and some could control their passion and emotions so they could use them to harness the Force.
However, the Jedi Order generally forbids any and all emotions of a Jedi so it wouldn’t get in the way of their main goals, creating a peaceful and harmonious society.
They acted selfless and followed the sacred Jedi Code on behalf of the will of the Force.
The Dark Side of the Force was forbidden in the Jedi Order, there were immensely rare times where a Jedi could use the Dark Side and there were very few abilities that were allowed.

The traditional Jedi tried to eliminate the Sith to bring “balance” to the Force and restoring it for the Dark Side was corrupt and the only way to rid the Dark Side was to rid the Sith.
The Jedi denied the temptations of the Dark Side as well, they only had positive emotions like courage and empathy.
The Jedi tried to refrain from having passions and romantic relationships for they believed it could lead to fear and anger, which was how Anakin Skywalker succumbed to the Dark Side.
Even the Sith frowned upon romance because it would get in the way of their true goal; galactic domination.
For over twenty-five thousand years the Jedi tried to keep the same philosophy and policies within the Order, but after the Great Jedi Purge and the downfall of the Galactic Empire, Luke Skywalker’s New Jedi Order disregarded most of the old Jedi ways and allowed marriage within the Order along with the use of the Dark Side from time to time.
However, they were also mindful and were taught to control these emotions in case of an improbable emergency.

# Section 2

Followers of the Dark Side were usually Dark Jedi or Sith.
The Dark Side required one to unleash their anger, fear, selfishness, hatred, and passion to enhance their abilities.
Unlike the Light Side, the Dark Side was tempting and its users were self-motivated, they usually desired power and domination.
Their philosophy was to kill any and all opponents, even if they were on the same side.
If they viewed something as a threat, they would destroy it.
The Dark Side was viewed as an extremely addictive ability and could drive people insane.
The Sith strived to learn and use the Dark Side.
They were the main followers.
They didn’t approve of weakness and they believed that only the strong survived, so they desired strength and power.
However, a lot of Sith also desired eternal life and went on deadly conquests to find a cure for mortality.
Although the Sith were selfish, throughout history they were seen working together and serving under the Dark Lord of the Sith.
The Sith desired the destruction of the Jedi as much as the Jedi desired the destruction of the Sith.
They went into countless wars with the Republic and the Jedi to ascert their dominance.

The Sith would kill other Sith for power and rank status.
An ancient Sith ritual known as the Kaggath was a competition between two Sith and their allies that involved battling each other for one’s rank.
An example of this was the Kaggath of Ludo Kressh and Naga Sadow, powerful Dark Lords of the Sith who desired to lead the Sith Order.
The Sith Order eventually died out and the last surviving Sith, Darth Bane, started a new legacy where there could only be two Sith a Master to embody the power and an Apprentice to embrace it.
The Sith used the Force for their own will, they used it for power and greed.
Though they were strong with the Force, they lacked teamwork and were destroyed because of it.
Some Sith were more skilled in the Force than others and managed to survive, such as Darth Bane.

# Section 3

The Jedi and Sith weren’t the only people who believed in the Force.
There were many tribes and religions who embraced the Force and had different views of it, many of them also made sacrifices and had traditions put in place.
A lot of these followers had some unique relationship with the Force, like the Baran Do, who were Force-sensitive Kel Dors that embraced the Force.
The legendary Jedi Master Plo Koon lived amongst the Baran Do before joining the Jedi.
People known as the Aing-Tii had a special and different view on the Force, they believed the Force could manifest itself to help a being unlock their full potential.
The Aing-Tii did not believe in the Light or Dark Side, there was no good, nor evil among them.
The Aing-Tii viewed the Force as a much larger entity and they viewed themselves as small compared to the Force.
Another belief, which was developed during the time of the Old Republic, was the Paradox.
The Paradox was a belief founded by the heroes of their factions; Darth Marr and Grand Master Satele Shan.
When the two went into exile, they developed a different view of the Force and believed that the Force had its own will along with other possessive traits but required one to command it.
The Celestials known as the Ones were a belief amongst the Killik people and were balanced, with the daughter representing the Light, the son as the Dark, and the Father as the center.
The Ones were all killed during the Clone Wars without the Killiks people knowing of it.

Force-users use their emotions, willpower, and thoughts when they are utilizing the Force.
They act out on thoughts and manifest many kinds of Force abilities.
Force-users could enhance their physical powers as well and use mind abilities such as telekinesis and telepathy.
These physical enhancements could also allow Force-users to defy gravity and weight, allowing them to achieve unnatural speed and perform drastic flips.
This gave most Force-users unique acrobatic abilities.
Their health, stamina, and endurance were also naturally enhanced and could last longer than normal beings.
Some more Force abilities stem from one’s will.
A person who has a weak mind and a weak will could succumb to Force mind tricks.
Some Force-users could foresee the future and predict their opponent’s next moves in combat if they were strong enough.
Strong Force-users could also absorb the Force and use it for the world around them or transfer their consciousness into another body allowing them to live longer.
These were mostly used by Dark Side acolytes.
More unnatural absorbing abilities consisted of draining the Force of a single life form or an entire planet, as Darth Nihilus and the Jedi Exile had done.
These were generally performed by wounds in the Force.
The Force was very important in a Jedi’s usage of the lightsaber since it could heighten their reactions and prevent them from suffering potential injuries.
The Force also came into play when constructing a lightsaber or in combat where Jedi could deflect incoming blaster bolts.
Force-users also needed to rest otherwise their Force powers would weaken.
Emotions were also vital when using the Force since they could allow users to perform special abilities based on their emotions.
However, if a Light Side-user relied on hatred or a Dark Side-user relied on peace, it could weaken their Force powers.
This was how most Jedi transitioned to the Sith and vice versa.
