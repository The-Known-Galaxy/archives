# Introduction
The Korunnai people of Harrun Kal used the word Pelekotan to describe the Force.
The Korunnai people were relatively Force-sensitive and, in their language, Pelekotan translated to “Jungle Mind”.
Pelekotan was the spiritual power and focus of the Korunnai people and was the equivalent of the Light Side for the Jedi.
The history of how the term Pelekotan originated is unknown, however, in Korunnai history there is an important figure named the Lor Pelek.
Lor Pelek were people who held great power and were hazardous, they were also shamans who embodied the Pelekotan.
The shamans tended to be great warriors and were skilled in the arts of healing.

 The great Jedi Master Mace Windu encountered a Lor Pelek and noted that the shaman possessed unseen abilities that he developed through living in the jungle.
One of the most shocking abilities Windu saw was that the shaman could remove brain and nerve parasites and unite them with the Force.
The Pelekotan was the Korunnai people’s main source of survival, and they used it to survive on their harsh planet to preserve the history of their tribes and herds.
Just like the Force, Pelekotan was said to be a mystical and abstract ability that roamed the darkness of their environment, it was believed that it stemmed from the jungles.
Surviving the perils of the jungle would sometimes require a brawl with those who use it.
The Korunnai viewed Pelekotan as a deity and claimed that it answered all their desires.
