# Introduction
The Jedi Code serves as the fundamental principles that all Jedi are expected to adhere to.
It is taught on a Youngling’s first day in the Academy and is from that point onward a defining factor in every action of each Jedi throughout their career.
The Jedi Code is often summarised in Odan-Urr’s iteration, the version that all Jedi will memorise and often recite, but the Jedi Code itself is very expansive and detailed when broken down and studied.
I hope this case study widens your view beyond what you may think you know of the Jedi Code.

# Section 1
The Jedi Code stems from the Jedi Mantra, which in itself is a variation of the Je’daii Code, established when the Je’daii was an order of both light side and dark side practitioners.
When the Je’daii Order reorganised into the Jedi Order it was deemed necessary that a new Code was established, and so the original Jedi Council put together the Jedi Mantra.
The Jedi Mantra was designed with the same purpose as the Je’daii Code, to provide basic and fundamental guidelines for all Jedi to obey.



# Section 2
The problem with the Jedi Mantra was that it was extremely vague.
It could be argued that the Jedi Mantra was rushed in an effort to solidify the reorganisation of the Je’daii Order into the Jedi Order with no proper study or refinement having gone into the principles that would make a Jedi stand apart from the original Je’daii.
It wasn’t until Jedi Master Odan-Urr came along in roughly 5000 BBY that this refinement would take place.
Odan-Urr was a scholar and historian who decided upon achieving the rank of Master to study and refine the Jedi Mantra, going so far as to remake the Mantra into the Jedi Code we most commonly study today.



# Section 3
When Odan-Urr began his studies of the Jedi Code he also began putting together a series of texts and documents that would become known as the ‘’Teachings of Odan-Urr’’.
These various teachings would become some of the most influential and studied educational documents in Jedi history.
These documents were instrumental in reviving the Jedi Order numerous times after various purges and would even be used when Luke Skywalker recreated the Jedi Order in his own image roughly 2000 years later.
Odan-Urr would make simple changes to the Jedi Code in a way that would expand upon the Jedi Mantra to provide a clearer set of guidelines for Jedi to follow.



# Section 4
We can see here that with the simple addition of ‘’There is’’, it eliminates the vagueness of the original Jedi Mantra, providing a stricter set of guidelines that allows for less interpretation and guessing while also still keeping a sense of mystery.
One of a Jedi’s greatest challenges is figuring out their own interpretation of the Jedi Code and the Force, however the Jedi Order cannot allow for these interpretations to be too wild or unconventional, so while the refined Jedi Code instills a sense of curiosity and does allow for interpretation, we can see clearly that it also becomes easier to understand.



# Section 5
Take the first line of each code as an example of how it has been refined.
‘’Emotion, yet peace’’.
This implies that emotion can be involved in a Jedi’s lifestyle, that emotion can exist when a Jedi conducts their duties, and while Jedi cannot fully eliminate emotion, they are expected not to act upon emotion.
Whereas the refined version, ‘’There is no emotion, there is peace’’ makes it clear that Jedi guidelines forbid acting upon or with emotion, and that a Jedi should act with a peaceful mindset.
It is a simple change but one that caused much confusion and difficulty for the early Jedi Order.



# Section 6
The Jedi Code we most commonly recite and look to for guidance is only a summary.
Prior to Master Odan-Urr’s teachings there was little detailing the specific actions and expectations of the Jedi Code.
Odan-Urr would expand upon this.
Odan-Urr broke the Jedi Code into three separate categories.
Self-discipline, responsibility and public service.
These are not to be confused with the Three Pillars, as these specific categories are only the expanded and in-depth teachings of the Jedi Code.



# Section 7
It would be ignorant to say that the Jedi Code is only the six lines that we recite, for the Jedi Code is long and expansive.
During a Youngling’s training in the Jedi Academy they will be expected to study in great detail the individual parts that make up the Jedi Code, and throughout the rest of their long careers they will be expected to be a shining example of each aspect.



# Section 8
The most fundamental aspect of a Jedi.
In the same manner a soldier must keep their uniform clean and be able to parade neatly, a Jedi must act in a similar manner.
They must adhere to their studies with unwavering self-motivation, they must keep themselves and their lightsabers in fit and working order and they must humble themselves when faced with their duties.



# Section 9
Self-discipline is the only aspect of the Jedi Code that is shared with the Three Pillars, and for good reason.
All Jedi will have self-discipline drilled into their lifestyle from the moment they step foot in the Academy until the moment they become one with the Force.
From making their bed, keeping themselves fit, studying without supervision and keeping their lightsaber well maintained, all Jedi must tackle self-discipline and master it early in their careers.



# Section 10
The Jedi Code breaks self-discipline down into nine separate categories that I will go through in this essay.
Each of these categories are presented and taught as a challenge to young Jedi with the intention of encouraging Jedi to understand that every aspect of self-discipline must be studied, understood, overcome and then be put into practice throughout the Jedi’s career.



# Section 11
On a galactic scale, Jedi are indeed rare and the training and dedication it takes to achieve the title can rarely be compared to any other position or duty within the galaxy.
This however does not make a Jedi special.
While many of the abilities a Jedi will come to learn and employ are unique, a Jedi must understand that this does not grant them special privileges or a right to be put above others.
A Jedi’s life is that of servitude and dedication to helping others, it is our priority to place others above ourselves and ensure that the needs of those around us are seen to first.



# Section 12
Many young Jedi will struggle with this idea, believing that access to the force and the ability to a wield a lightsaber makes them unique, and in a way it does, but what truly makes them unique is their ability to use these skills in the service and defense of those less fortunate than themselves, not the other way around.



# Section 13
A Jedi must be confident.
The tasks they face are often perilous and they will often be looked to as the authority on matters they may or may not be trained in.
This however is not an excuse to be overconfident.
Overconfidence can cause the Jedi and others to be hurt or hindered as a result of the Jedi’s ego.
A Jedi should be the voice of reason in any situation, and when a Jedi fails to act in a reasonable and realistic manner, they have truly failed themselves and those around them.



# Section 14
Jedi training is designed in such a way that encourages students to overcome obstacles on a consistent basis to ensure they feel ready to tackle a wide variety of situations, however, the most important aspect of this lesson is understanding that a Jedi can and will fail.
These failures remind the Jedi that the force does not grant them unlimited power, but instead grants them the ability to understand the true limits of their power.



# Section 15
As taught in the lesson of conquering overconfidence, a Jedi will fail.
No Jedi is perfect and even the wisest and mightiest of Jedi have struggled greatly with failure.
A Jedi should prepare for failure and even expect it on occasion, but they should never welcome it.
Failure provides the best lessons but failure can also come with grave consequences and a Jedi that comes to tolerate failure without seeking improvement is just as dangerous to themselves and others as the Jedi that believes they cannot fail.



# Section 16
Conquering defeatism is one of the hardest lessons of self-discipline, a young Jedi’s first experience with failure can often strike a large blow to their confidence, and even a Jedi who has spent decades mastering the force can suffer from doubt should failure come their way.
It is important to understand that failure is a natural part of life, even for a Jedi.
But failure should always provide a lesson in success for next time.



# Section 17
Throughout a Jedi’s career they will be presented with overwhelming situations or may be presented with a point of view that contradicts their own.
It is important that a Jedi is understanding of those around them and appreciates that their approach to a situation may not always be the best.
This part of the Jedi Code runs in tangent with the conquering of arrogance and overconfidence.
A Jedi should not be so stuck in their own ways that they fail to adapt or understand that their goal may be accomplished through different means.



# Section 18
A Jedi should also understand that losing isn’t always so terrible, it is okay to admit defeat, consolidate and study their defeat and then return with a new approach to the situation.
A young Jedi can often become stuck in a specific mindset, with a black and white view of most encounters and refuse to consider different possibilities or solutions, this is dangerous for a Jedi.
A Jedi should always be open to change and accept that not everything can be done the way they want it.



# Section 19
Recklessness is the most common trait amongst many young Jedi and can often carry on into a Jedi’s Knighthood.
Overcoming recklessness is uniquely difficult for a Jedi.
By our very nature Jedi strive to deal with a situation in the quickest possible manner to prevent the worst possible outcome, however, as a result of this we can often become the cause of the worst possible outcome.
Even if a situation requires speed, a Jedi should take as much time as they can to consider every outcome and review the situation in its entirety.
What may seem like a safe path or a swift resolution may have unforeseen long or short term consequences.



# Section 20
Recklessness is often first shown when a Jedi gains access to a lightsaber, or even a training lightsaber.
It is common and even understandable that a Jedi’s access to a weapon, accompanied with their abilities with the force can often make them feel safe enough to approach any situation head on.
As a result a young Jedi will feel as if they have every situation under control, until they don’t.
A problem that feels like it can only be solved with a lightsaber or the force can often be solved another way, even if that way is unclear at first.



# Section 21
This aspect of the Jedi Code will often confuse a young Jedi.
This does not mean that a Jedi should not be curious or pursue their studies, but that a Jedi should never use their position or abilities to gain access to information that is private or has no relevance to the Jedi.
Information must be procured safely and responsibly and it is the duty of a Jedi to ensure their position does not interfere with this.



# Section 22
Information should be sought to aid the Jedi’s task or to educate themselves and those around them, not to satisfy mere curiosity.
Some information is best kept private and for a Jedi to abuse their powers to prod into the privacy of others is to abuse the trust the galaxy has given to them.



# Section 23
It is an unfortunate reality of a Jedi’s life that they will inevitably encounter hostility and conflict.
Throughout a Jedi’s career they will likely be attacked quite regularly and it is imperative that these attacks are never met with hatred or anger from the Jedi.
Calmness and serenity will allow a Jedi to have a clearer picture of any dangerous situation.
As a Jedi your primary concern when facing danger is the defense of those around you and yourself, as such you should only act offensively if there are no other options.
Always try to be peaceful until the last possible second, never rush to conclude a situation simply because it is convenient or faster than taking your time.



# Section 24
Young Jedi will struggle with aggression the most, it is easy to fall into the clutches of anger when first being introduced to combat but it is important to remember that combat should never be taken personally.
Losing is a victory in itself and even a loss can be met with a smile and meditation.
A wise Jedi will prevent conflict in any way they can, an even wiser Jedi will meditate on any conflict that did happen and find a way to prevent it for their next encounter.



# Section 25
Throughout a Jedi’s life they will meet all manner of people, including people they may form a bond with and even be attracted to.
This is a normal part of a Jedi’s experience but it is always important to remember that being a Jedi comes first and foremost.
Your duty as a Jedi is to the galaxy, not to one individual or groups of individuals.
This does not mean a Jedi cannot have friends and form bonds with those they encounter, but it does mean that the Jedi’s objective and overall duties are the priority in their life.



# Section 26
Jedi are often looked to for advice and to act as the authority on a wide variety of subjects and as such can be approached to take on additional responsibilities outside of the Jedi Order.
While it is up to the Jedi if they wish to do such things, the Jedi should never place these responsibilities over those they have within the Order, regardless of how personally important these responsibilities may be to them.



# Section 27
It is unbecoming of a Jedi to seek to possess items that do not aid them in their missions or represent who they are.
As a result of a Jedi’s often hectic and chaotic lifestyle it is important that a Jedi only possesses items they can carry with them on a short notice.
Most Jedi will live in a Temple or onboard transport they use for their missions, and as a result it is unlike a Jedi to own property.
Even so, a Jedi will likely never possess enough credits to purchase expensive items beyond what they need for their missions.



# Section 28
A Jedi should be content with what they have, as what they have is usually much more than those they protect.
To achieve a peaceful mindset a Jedi should never want nor seek, jealousy and desire are beneath a Jedi.
This does not mean a Jedi cannot accept a reward if the giver is truly insistent, or during the less busy times of their lives, even use some of their earnings to invest in luxuries such as clothing and items that may make their day-to-day lives easier, but it should never be a Jedi’s priority.



# Section 29
Whether a Jedi likes it or not they are always responsible for something.
Responsibility can range from being in charge of training a Padawan or Younglings to protecting and safeguarding the various citizens of the galaxy.
The Jedi Order as an organisation is responsible for the protection of the galaxy, therefore responsibility is ingrained into the mindset of every Jedi.



# Section 30
Accountability for one’s actions is a difficult process to learn as almost always there will be an excuse for failure.
Once an individual learns not to make excuses and to accept their responsibilities for what they are, they will become a much more reliable person.



# Section 31
A Jedi should always endeavour to be honest with themselves and others.
A Jedi that cannot be trusted is a Jedi that cannot be relied upon.
A Jedi is only permitted to lie or bend the truth should it serve to protect others or accomplish a necessary goal, but this should always be reflected upon afterwards and done so as little as possible.
A Jedi should never lie to their Master or the Jedi Council, there is no bending of the truth that can justify this, as their Master and the Council will always be there to aid them, regardless of their task.



# Section 32
A Jedi that cannot fulfil their promises is a Jedi that has no place protecting others.
A promise should never be made lightly and Younglings will come to understand this from the moment they begin their training.
Should a promise be made and broken, a Jedi should seek to make amends for this transgression as swiftly as possible.
A Jedi is a reliable individual and as soon as they have broken the trust placed in them, then there is reason to doubt that Jedi’s ability.
It is always wise to consult with a Master or close associate prior to making a promise, regardless of how small.



# Section 33
Once a Jedi is capable of taking a Padawan they should immediately understand that this is perhaps the most important thing they will ever do in life.
A Padawan is under your care and tutelage and it is your duty to ensure their safety and well-being, both mentally and physically.
A Padawan should never feel as if they cannot turn to their Master for any reason, nor should they feel that their Master doubts their abilities and does not have confidence in them.



# Section 34
Praise and encouragement should be given as much as possible to ensure a Padawan is consistently developing the right way and to prevent a hostile or potentially harmful relationship between the Master and Padawan.
Should a Padawan ever need to be reprimanded or reminded of any wrong doings, then it should always be done privately, so as to not harm the Padawan’s mindset.



# Section 35
A Master should never have to apologize for their Padawan’s behaviour or doubt that their Padawan respects them.
To this end, a Padawan should never place their Master in such a position.
A Padawan should always show great respect for their Master, especially publicly and in the presence of others, only speak when properly addressed.
A Master’s word during training is law and if a Padawan disagrees with their Master then they should disagree in a respectful and professional manner, and always privately.



# Section 36
The Jedi Council is made up of the most experienced Jedi in the Order and as such should be afforded the respect of such a deserving position.
While it is not unheard of for a Jedi to disagree with the Jedi Council, all disagreements should be done so respectfully, so as to avoid public hostilities or disrespect to the Masters that occupy the Council chairs.
When acting on behalf of the Jedi Council a Jedi represents the highest authority of the Order and should always act as such, showing a degree of professionalism above and beyond that of their peers.
Never put the Jedi Council in a position where they must justify or apologize for your actions.



# Section 37
In the words of Master Odan-Urr; ‘’it takes many Jedi to undo the mistakes of one.’’ As a Jedi you represent the entirety of the Order and it is your personal responsibility to ensure you behave as such.
Your actions, your behaviour and even your personal appearance can shift the opinions of individuals who may or may not have ever seen or met a Jedi, ensure that every time you represent the Jedi Order, you try to make the best impression possible.



# Section 38
Jedi exist to ensure that peace and order exists throughout the galaxy and as such are expected to be a part of that peace and order themselves.
May it be the laws of the Jedi Order or the laws put in place by foreign entities, always do your best to obey them and ensure those around you are doing the same.
Breaking the law is unbecoming of a Jedi and only serves to harm the image of the Jedi Order and the individual Jedi.



# Section 39
Life is the most precious entity in the galaxy.
Taking a life should never be done so lightly, and defending a life should always be a priority.
To take a life only serves to strengthen the dark side and aid those who wish to create chaos, so if a Jedi must take a life, do so sparingly and with as much grace and consideration as possible.
Should a life be taken, always meditate on why and make the best possible effort to refrain from doing so again.



# Section 40
As a Jedi your duties are to the public, everything and anything you do should be to better the lives of those less fortunate than yourself.
Everything from simple charity to defending the defenseless against attack are all actions taken in service to the public.
A Jedi’s life is one of servitude and selflessness, as soon as a Jedi understands that they exist to better the lives of others, they will be truly ready to render aid to others.



# Section 41
Having a lightsaber and the ability to wield the force does not make someone a Jedi.
The ability to put others before yourself, to stand up and admit when something is wrong or unjust and then do something about it, that is what makes somebody a Jedi.



# Section 42
The Jedi are sworn defenders of the Galactic Republic due to its desire to uphold democracy and protect its citizens against those who wish to cause harm.
A Jedi should always strive to uphold the ideals of democracy, freedom, safety and peace.
Even in the Republic’s darkest hours the Jedi should always be there to guide them towards the light.



# Section 43
Even if the Republic did not exist, the ideals it promotes are still fundamentally required for peace across the galaxy.
As a result, in the absence of the Republic a Jedi should still aspire to ensure the galaxy is reminded of its values.



# Section 44
Should aid be required, regardless of who requests it, a Jedi should always be prepared to offer it.
As the life of a Jedi is filled with servitude it is also a life filled with helping others.
This can create difficulties when prioritizing aid or offering aid to harmful individuals, regardless of this, a Jedi should always aspire to help no matter who asks for it, so long as the help does not go on to serve an evil agenda.



# Section 45
Small gestures of aid can have a significant result, never underestimate just how little or how much your assistance can mean to others.
Always take the time to at the very least, offer assistance, even if it is denied.



# Section 46
Unfortunately there will always be those that seek to harm or take advantage of those less fortunate than themselves.
That is where a Jedi strives.
Where a Jedi goes peace should always follow.
If you see an individual being exploited or attacked, always step in to prevent it.
Raising your lightsaber should never be done so lightly, but you have it for a reason, if the situation calls for it, raise your lightsaber as a beacon of hope and safety for those that need it.
More often than not you’ll find that your presence alone is enough to protect those that need it and change the lives of those around you.



# Section 47
Not every situation calls for a Jedi, and not every situation that calls for a Jedi requires them to be the solution to the problem.
Sometimes a problem can be solved by others with your assistance.
It is okay to take a step back and allow others to complete the job, even if you feel you could do it better.
Unfortunately Jedi are not always welcome in certain situations, so always refrain from jumping in and trying to be the solution, as sometimes you may realize you could be the problem.



# Section 48
The Jedi Code would undergo many changes during the latter stages of galactic history.
Luke Skywalker would be the biggest proponent of this and make numerous changes to the Code during his tenure as Grand Master of the New Jedi Order.
Luke Skywalker rebuilt the Jedi Order in a unique way, differing widely from the traditions of the older Jedi Orders.
As such he made many edits to the Code and promoted the idea that Jedi study all of them so that they could develop a unique understanding of the galaxy and their duties.



# Section 49
While Odan-Urr’s iteration is considered the default, there is no harm in studying and even following the modern iterations.
All Jedi should endeavour to study the unique iterations at least once, as they may have an answer to a question that Odan-Urr’s code did not provide.



# Section 50
An iteration of the Jedi Code read at Mara Jade Skywalker’s funeral by Luke Skywalker.

There is no emotion; there is peace.
There is no ignorance; there is knowledge.
There is no passion; There is serenity.
There is no death; there is only the Force.
A Jedi does not act for personal power or wealth but seeks knowledge and enlightenment.
A Jedi never acts from hatred, anger, fear, or aggression but acts when calm and at peace with the Force.
Jedi are the guardians of peace in the galaxy.
Jedi use the powers to defend and to protect, never to attack others.
Jedi respect life, in any form.
Jedi serve others rather than ruling over them, for the good of the galaxy.
Jedi seek to improve themselves through knowledge and training.



# Section 51
We can see quite clearly that this iteration of the Jedi Code is far more expansive, taking the majority of Odan-Urr’s original code and expanding upon it with many statements regarding the lifestyle of a Jedi.
It is uncertain as to why Luke Skywalker decided to recite this unique iteration at his late wife’s funeral, but as he consistently meditated on the Jedi Code during times of difficulty and strife, perhaps he believed this was the most fitting iteration for the event.



# Section 52
In this iteration Luke Skywalker chose to use multiple statements commonly made by members of the Jedi Order throughout galactic history.
These lines are less vague than Odan-Urr’s code and serve much more as a statement as to the nature of a Jedi and how a Jedi should act.
The lines come directly from the expanded teachings of Odan-Urr.
It is possible Luke Skywalker felt these lines should have originally been included in Odan-Urr’s Jedi Code, though we can see Luke Skywalker left the line ‘’There is no chaos, there is harmony’’, out of this iteration.
It is not entirely clear as to why he did this.



# Section 53
A variant of the Jedi Code recited in 32 BBY, unknown author.


Jedi are the guardians of peace in the galaxy.
Jedi use their powers to defend and protect, never to attack others.
Jedi respect all life, in any form.
Jedi serve others, rather than rule over them, for the good of the galaxy.
Jedi seek to improve themselves through knowledge and training.



# Section 54
This variant of the Jedi Code also appears to be much more of a factual statement as to what a Jedi is, and less of a set of guidelines for a Jedi to meditate on.
We do not know who wrote or recited this Code, but it would later be adopted by Luke Skywalker during his attempts to rebuild the Jedi Order after the fall of the Galactic Empire.



# Section 55
An edited variant of the original iteration used by Luke Skywalker during his efforts to rebuild the Jedi Order.


Jedi are the guardians of peace in the galaxy.
Jedi use their powers to defend and to protect.
Jedi respect all life, in any form.
Jedi serve others rather than ruling over them, for the good of the galaxy.
Jedi seek to improve themselves through knowledge and training.



# Section 56
This iteration is only slightly changed, with the line ‘’Jedi use their powers to defend and to protect.’’ being a shortened variant of its predecessor.
Why Luke Skywalker decided to make this edit is unknown, and why Luke Skywalker decided to use this variant of the Jedi Code at all is also unknown.
As the original variant was written in 32 BBY, we know that Luke Skywalker did not create it himself though deemed it important enough to the recreation of the Jedi Order to study it and include it when teaching the newest generation of Jedi Younglings.



# Section 57
A unique iteration of the Jedi Code, written and recited by Grand Master Luke Skywalker during his time training Jedi Younglings at the Jedi Praxeum, around 22 ABY.

A Jedi's promise must be the most serious, the deepest of his or her life.
A Jedi seeks not adventure or excitement, for a Jedi is passive, calm, and at peace.
A Jedi knows that anger, fear, and aggression lead to the dark side.
A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
There is no "try," only "do."
Believe and you succeed.
Above all else, know that control of the Force comes only from concentration and training.



# Section 58
This iteration of the Jedi Code appears to be particularly directed towards Younglings.
It provides some of the basic and fundamental lessons that Jedi Grand Master Yoda once taught to Luke Skywalker on Dagobah.
Perhaps these are some of the lessons Luke Skywalker believed to be most helpful to him, and as such he may have believed they could be useful to the new generation of Jedi.
The Code goes over some of the more serious requirements of Jedi life while also trying to instill a sense of confidence and self-belief in the reader, hence why I believe it is particularly directed towards Younglings, and even contains a version of Grand Master Yoda’s famous line that he once told to Younglings on Coruscant and later Luke Skywalker; ‘’There is no ‘try’, only ’do'."



# Section 59
The final line, ‘’Above all else, know that control of the Force comes only from concentration and training.’’ is a very basic lesson that a Jedi Knight, Master or even Padawan is unlikely to forget or be unaware of, which further adds to my belief that this Code is primarily used for new arrivals to the Jedi Order.



# Section 60




# Section 61
After understanding this case study I hope you realize that the Jedi Code is much more than a set of vague guidelines, but instead a comprehensive set of teachings that touch every aspect of a Jedi’s life.
Every Jedi reading this should aspire to represent every aspect of the Jedi Code on a daily basis and even at their darkest and lowest point, look to the Code for guidance, as it will always be able to offer something.



# Section 62
The Jedi Code and its various iterations have been meditated upon for thousands of years and even the wisest of Jedi look to it on a daily basis for guidance, despite its many iterations and variations, the Jedi Code always maintains a fundamental basis; work hard, help others, act rationally and always walk the path of least conflict.
