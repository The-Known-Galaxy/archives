# Introduction

Also known as Force Seeing or Combat sense, Force Sight was a common Force ability that was derived from Force Sense.
It caused the user to enhance their ability to see beyond walls and in darker areas, which improved their spatial perception and visual awareness.
The Miraluka relied on this ability greatly, seeing it as a way to make up for their physical blindness.
They could not see color, but they could identify organic beings, even dead, and their alignment with the Force based on their characteristic auras.
Most objects appeared translucent to the Miralukans, allowing them to see through the objects, including walls and doors.
The Miraluka were the most skilled in the art of Force Sight and their reflexes were greatly improved.
Some notable users of Force Sight include Darth Bane, Meetra Surik, Kreia, Visas Marr, and Starkiller.
