Dooku had one aboard his ship as well and had a secret trap door in that room.
Former Jedi Master Atris had a meditation chamber of her own, however, she used it to store her collection of Sith Holocrons.
During the Clone Wars, Darth Sidious had a mediation chamber on the planet Coruscant, where he hid it from the entire galaxy.
The most commonly known one is Darth Vader’s.
Darth Vader had several meditation chambers that were unique, it could allow him to breathe without his body suit.
They had mechanical claws that could remove his suit and the oxygen was special since it allowed him to breathe without the mask.
In his chambers was also a holoprojector, which he used to contact Darth Sidious.
He used his chambers often, but also when his wife, Padme Amidala, died.
He mourned the death of his wife along with hiding his reflections of his sufferable past from his master.
Following the duel with Mustafar, Vader attempted to use the Dark Side energy in his chambers to repair his body.
Unfortunately, he couldn’t heal much and still required his body suit.
