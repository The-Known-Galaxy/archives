# Introduction
Your understanding of Jedi philosophy thus far has probably consisted of the Jedi Code, the three pillars from which the Jedi draw strength, and the laws of the order, all of which are taught in the academy.
These are some elements of group structure and Jedi lore, but they do not address manners of behavior or the core values of our community.
The Jedi Order has officially recognized a series of values that detail the intricacies of Jedi philosophy and how it applies to the Jedi Order as a ROBLOX community.
They present a standard of behavior and a belief system that plants the seed to produce the absolute best Knights through our progression system.
This study has been written to dive deeper into your understanding of the Mystics’ approach to Jedi philosophy.

# Section 1
Outlined as the most sincere elements of this philosophy are the Jedi Virtues.
These virtues offer the Jedi a level of reasoning that leads them to concentrate their minds on what is within their control.
This is one of the core attributes of the Jedi and one of the most important for progression: Self-Control.
Discipline is one of the Three Pillars of the Jedi, and a significant majority of the practice of discipline lies in the efforts of self-control.
A Jedi will face many trials and obstacles in their journey, but one thing they always maintain control of is their own mindfulness.
In this state of mindfulness, for which we utilize meditation to assist us, a Jedi finds serenity in making reasonable decisions.
A Jedi who sought to free themselves from all disturbances and pursue virtue has found mindfulness.


	To find the aforementioned reason, one must be committed to the Jedi Order and the practices of meditation, which clear one’s mind.
However, this understanding of oneself and this understanding of the environment must be in the present.
To practice the ways of the Jedi, one must commit themselves to the Jedi Order.
However, in lore, it is a lifelong endeavor that outlines one of the next core virtues: Commitment.
A fool believes the last Jedi trials are at the rank of knight; the Jedi’s trials are never-ending.
The difficulties arise at random; they evolve, and so must the Jedi.
And it is this lifelong endeavor that brings on one of the other important virtues, Patience.
A Jedi must not pursue the quickest path to knighthood, the quickest path to success, or the quickest path to victory.
It is through patience and the Force that the Jedi transcend.



# Section 2
Intertwined with the living Force lie some of the most important Jedi virtues that Jedi Masters pursue to amplify their connection with the Force.
Beginning at a young age, Jedi are taught one of the most simple yet challenging virtues to adhere to: inner Peace.
Developing inner peace takes practice and hours upon hours of meditation every day.
Acting on your emotions will spark the darkness inside you.
It throws the Jedi's soul into chaos, making them vulnerable to the dark side of the Force.
Outbursts of emotion must be withheld, as they are taboos for the virtues.
These outbursts breathe life into the temptation to act out in fear and anger, thus suffering.

Finding inner peace helps the Jedi find reason and logic to act on what’s important: the here and now.
It allows the Jedi to make good judgments, which in turn helps Wisdom, arguably the most important virtue, establish itself in the Jedi.
It is the combination of one’s experience, virtuous behavior, ability to build a general sense of knowledge, and ability to make good decisions that make up the building blocks of Wisdom.
However, all these things have no meaning unless they are applied to the day-to-day life of a Jedi.
Before wisdom is even considered the pursuit of a Jedi, they must adhere to the associated virtue of Passivity.
A Jedi’s soul must be steady, orderly, and completely virtuous; it mustn’t be influenced by the concerns of others.
In defending our values and those who cannot defend themselves, the Jedi may make the first strike.
This wouldn’t be the vice of aggression, but it would be active defense, as long as the strike is made out of compassion for others and not hatred.
There are very few emotions to act on, but one of them would be compassion.



# Section 3
Our audience must be vast, so to reach the maximum number of people, it is important we practice the virtue of Benevolence.
As Jedi, we represent the Jedi Order in its wholeness, and in doing so, we must practice compassion for those throughout the community and amongst ourselves.
Kindness is an action as much as it is an aspect of our emotions.
Acts of kindness present our intentions clearly, allowing proper representation of the Jedi Order.
The importance of this virtue is equivalent to its practice within the Jedi Order.
Joy is a similar virtue but pertains to employing humor to establish a certain camaraderie among fellow Jedi and help them relate to one another.
Witty humor is an element to assist in teaching younglings, used by the wisest Jedi masters as they understand children respond well to a certain lightheartedness amongst the seriousness of Jedi religious practitioners.


	To be fully virtuous, you must continuously make choices day-to-day honorific to these virtues, but it cannot be expected immediately of all Jedi.
You must be open to bettering yourself, recognizing any choices you make that go against these virtues, and learning from your mistakes.
It is the ongoing trial of knighthood.
It is in practicing these virtues that the lifelong trial of a Jedi begins.
However, sometimes individuals fall into the temptation of their emotions and commit serious taboos known as vices.
Those who purposefully go against these virtues, defying the Jedi Code with intent, would be immoral and could be considered outright vicious, committing vices repeatedly and on purpose.
This would describe a dark Jedi, a Jedi significantly corrupted by dark side tendencies.
That is when they must be reminded of the Jedi virtues and where they’ve gone wrong.



# Section 4
In essence, an act of virtue is an act of love for oneself and the values of the Jedi.
To love oneself means one can put mindfulness on the world around them rather than concern themselves with their own interests and ambitions.
This "love" is not the attachment and selfish kind of love, but unconditional love to the people they protect—to their civilization, their community, and their order.
These values are essential to attunement with the Force, and they provide the foundation of thought for the Jedi Order.
