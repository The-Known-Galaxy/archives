# Introduction

Ice Image was a Force Ability created by the descendants of exiled Jedi and Dark Jedi on the planet Kesh.
These Force-users were known as the Doomed and they developed this special ability.
Ice Image allowed beings to witness ongoing events on planets they were on and was used to monitor the Lost Tribe of the Sith.
The Doomed also used it to learn about the fauna and creatures of the planet.
The leader of the Doomed, Kaliska, had revealed to Princess Takara Hilts of the Sith that the ability had led them to observe the developments in regions that were run by the Sith Tribe.
