# Introduction
The Jedi Order used a certain aspect of the Force, this was named ‘Sense’.
After mastering Control as Initiates, Padawans expanded their abilities through Sense.
This allowed them to connect with the Living Force, using the Force as an additional sense.
The discipline included four main abilities: life detection (prima vitae), Sense Force (tactus otium), post-cognition (tai vordrax), and projected telepathy.
Even though other Sense abilities existed, these were the most important to Jedi teachings.
