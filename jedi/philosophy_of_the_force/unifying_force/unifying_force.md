# Introduction

The Unifying Force was one of the four main aspects of the Force.
It wasn’t widely accepted like the others, but it was strong.
The Unifying Force was said to have surrounded all the stars and through this, it connected with all living and non-living things in the universe.
One of the main philosophies of the Unifying Force was to focus more on one’s destiny rather than the present.
Acolytes of the Unifying Force would always pay attention to everything in case it altered their future.

The Unifying Force was neither Dark Side nor Light Side, it was balanced.
Those who were adherent to the Unifying Force’s philosophies were more prone to having visions of the future.
Darth Sidious was a follower of the Unifying Force; however, as a Sith, Sidious manipulated the Force to cause destruction and conspire.
However, Sidious still believed there was only one Force, the Unifying Force.
Jedi Master Vergere believed in this philosophy; she once said to Jacen Solo, “the Force is everything, and everything is the Force.”.
Lord Kaan of the Sith used the word “twilight”.
They believed that the Force wasn’t biased to one side, it cherished both sides.
Most people didn’t accept the idea of the Force supporting either Light or Dark, especially people like Luke Skywalker and Darth Plaguies.
However, the views of the Unifying Force were similar, though not the same, to the Jed’aii and Jensaarai’s traditions.
Both of the Orders drew power from both the Light and Dark Side.
