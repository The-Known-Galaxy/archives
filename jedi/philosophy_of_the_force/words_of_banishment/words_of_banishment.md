# Introduction

Words of Banishment was an uncommon Force ability, once used by the Jedi Knight Samuro to imprison an evil source.
Centuries before the Battle of Yavin and the Clone Wars, Samuro used the ability to imprison an energy vampire by the name of Countess Rajine and zombify her followers.
Upon using this ability, Samuro knew the consequence of the ability resulted in death.
Jedi Master Mace Windu ventured to Rajine’s planet many centuries later in search of missing Clone Troopers.
He was captured and imprisoned by Rajine but stumbled across a Jedi Holocron that belonged to Samuro.
Z-18, who used to belong to Samuro, helped Windu escape with the Holocron and used it, along with the spirit of Samuro, to free the followers of Rajine by reciting the Words of Banishment.
Rajine’s followers turned on her and proceeded to kill her.
