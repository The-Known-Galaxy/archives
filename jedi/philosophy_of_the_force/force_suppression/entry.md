# Introduction

Crafty Force sensitives used the dubious Force power known as Force suppression, which affected the psyche.
It permitted someone who was Force-sensitive to use the Force to persuade others that they were cut off from the Force itself.
As a result, it helped to both lower an enemy's resistance to the use of the Force and to neutralize a wide variety of Force powers, including but not limited to; Force speed, Force valor, Force barrier, Force immunity, Force fury, Inspire, energy resistance, and even battle meditation.

The Old Sith Wars used the term "Force breach" to describe this technique's advanced proficiency.
Instead, the moniker was used in the Cold War to describe the capability of rupturing targets' shatter points to inflict catastrophic damage.
