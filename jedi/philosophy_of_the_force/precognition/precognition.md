# Introduction

Precognition, commonly known as Foresight, was an ability that allowed the user to peek into the future and witness upcoming events.
Anakin Skywalker utilized this power to predict incoming attacks.
Jedi Master and High Councillor Sifo-Dyas were also skilled with this power.

Lifeforms of the Chiss species were naturally born with precognition, which they used to pilot their ships through the Unknown Regions.
This ability, however, was only available to Chiss children, since it faded as they grew older.
Vahâ€™nya was one of the exceptions to this rule, as she kept her Foresight ability past her childhood.
