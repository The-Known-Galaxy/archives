# Introduction

Anti-Force was a term conjured by the great Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker.
Anti-Force was said to have defied the Force and was the complete opposite.
Similar to the Force, the anti-Force was a transcendental energy field that confined a whole new Universe-Waruâ€™s Universe.
The anti-Force was so powerful that when Waru was stranded in his universe, the only way for him to get back was to destroy the Force that held him as a prisoner.
He drained the life of a group of sentient beings while they were on a pilgrimage.
Otherspace was a different dimension where the anti-Force was said to flow.
A Dark Side Prophet was said to have entered otherspace and used the anti-Force to revive after death.
