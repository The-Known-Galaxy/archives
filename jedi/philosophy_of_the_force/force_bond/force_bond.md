# Introduction
Force Bond is a link between two Force-sensitives who are able to form connections in the Force to an extent that both are able to communicate and coordinate during battle and is used to strengthen one to another both physically and mentally.

Force Bonding, however, refers to the Force ability in which connections with the Force are able to be formed.
The degree of the connection solely relies on the Force-sensitivity of both users, the stronger they are in the Force, the stronger the connection will be.

# Section 1
Commonly seen within the relationship of a Jedi Master and a Padawan, Force Bond often occurs between them, even through great distances.
More powerful bonds occur between relatives.
It was also believed that near-death occasions cause bonds.
The bond is also possible between Force users who are on opposing sides, Light and Dark.



# Section 2
Master Zez-Kai Ell mentioned that if one cannot reverse the bond, turning away from the Force is the only way to break it.



# Section 3
Some Force users are able to use the connection in order to communicate.
For instance, Darth Revan and the Rakata, he used the Force to remove the Rakata Language from them in order to make the Rakatas understand the Galactic Basic Standard to help him find the Star Forge.

Jedi Master Kreia often teaches her Padawan, Meetra Surik, using Telepathy, an ability to mentally communicate with others.
Surik used the bond to feel her desires with knowledge.



# Section 4
Force Bonding is believed that it manifested itself with similar abilities and techniques such as the Battle Meditation.
Not many Jedis are able to form connections due to it being forbidden to form deep relationships among others.

Sentinel Bastila Shan performed Battle Meditation to the point where she formed a bond with two fleets commanded by Admiral Varko and Admiral Forn Dodonna during the Battle of Rakata Prime .



# Section 5
The bonds formed within these Force users make them some of the notable users of Force Bond.
Namely, Darth Revan and Bastila Shan, Master Kreia and Meetra Surik, and Master Vos and Aayla Secura.
