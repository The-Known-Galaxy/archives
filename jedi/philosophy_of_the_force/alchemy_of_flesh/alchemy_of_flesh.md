# Introduction

Alchemy of Flesh was a very unusual and unnatural Force ability that, throughout history, has only been used in the Jed’aii era.
Jed’aii Ranger Lanoree Brock was said to have possessed the ability to create living beings from cells.
Brock had used her own flesh to create a living being that had milky eyes and limbs growing blood that was forming veins.
It had no mind in the beginning, and no one could tell if it even felt pain.
