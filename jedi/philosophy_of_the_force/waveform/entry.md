# Introduction

Used by the sentient species known as the Selkath, Waveform was a Force ability that allowed users to improve their telekinetic abilities by exploiting the surrounding wave patterns of the environment and nature.
The ability was inspired by the oceans of Manaan and was much like the ability Alter Environment, but it was more so for personal gain in the Force.
