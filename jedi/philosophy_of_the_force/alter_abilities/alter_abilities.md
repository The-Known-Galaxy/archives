# Introduction

Alter Abilities encompass all Force abilities that are used to impact the surrounding area.
As Jedi Seer Sabla-Mandibu writes in the book ‘The Jedi Path’: “...Without Alter, you are like a mud limpet - perceiving your world but incapable of touching it.
With Alter, you will grow arms and legs.”.
While Younglings learn Control and Padawans focus on Sense, Jedi Knights focus on the study of Alter.

Some powers Seer Sabla-Mandibu notes are: Telekinesis - Moving objects using the force; Affect Mind - AKA Mind Trick can override the impulses of an undisciplined mind; Force Injure - Self explanatory; Alter Environment - With this, you can control the natural world summoning pillars of fire strikes of lightning and hailstorms to name a few.

More advanced Alter techniques were also taught to Jedi as well including Battle meditation - The ability to touch the minds of your troops and boost their morale while confusing the enemy (After Darth Maul’s defeat on Naboo and before the Clone Wars, the Jedi High Council rushed many Jedi to learn this ability.); Combustion - Using telekinesis to cause objects to explode; and the Art of the Small -  Almost completely hiding your Force presence, to name a few.
