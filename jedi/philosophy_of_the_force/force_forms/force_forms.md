# Introduction

Force forms were the four battle mediations that only the most focused and skilled mindset Jedi could use.
Force forms were the alternative to lightsaber combat and enhanced other’s combat skills.
Jedi Consulars tended to use Force forms to enhance their connection and abilities to use the Force.
Force forms made Jedi more powerful and they were able to go beyond what most combatants could, it enhanced their combat skills.
There have only been four forms known by the time of the First Jedi Purge.

# Section 1

The first form (Force Channel) was the only form that did not require one to take the Consular path.
It was common amongst the Jedi to learn this meditative stance and it barely improved one’s connection to the Force whilst having no vulnerabilities.

# Section 2

The second form is known as Force Potency.
This form was used solely for offense, it boosted a Jedi’s ability to use the Force for an attack.
However, it was powerful and could be used against powerful opponents, but it left the Jedi exhausted.
This form worked well for Dark Side users because offense stems from anger and hatred, which the Dark Side excelled in.
However, it was ok for a pure Jedi to use this form to end battles that were getting too out of hand.

# Section 3

The third form was Force Affinity.
This form was widely accepted within the Jedi Order and was more commonly used by Jedi.
However, it required the user to be focused on the Force.
The user must overcome the distractions for them to relax in their connection to the Force even in fights that were the most deadly.
It gave the user a peaceful state of mind.
This form allowed Jedi near to boost their stamina and wear out their opponents quicker as long as no harm came to the user.
It allowed Jedi to recover their lost strength and defend themselves easily against tired opponents.

# Section 4

The fourth and final form was Force Mastery.
It did not require a master of the Force, but someone who act like one.
However, those who had stronger connections to the Force tended to use this ability better.
It could enhance Jedi’s physical abilities and weaken their opponent’s defenses.
It caused the users to weaken and were more prone to attacks.
It was almost a mind trick, it sometimes led people to believe that the user was extremely powerful with the Force when they might not be.
However, it did require the user to have some strong connection to the Force to utilize this form.
