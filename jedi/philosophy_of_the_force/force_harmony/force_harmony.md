# Introduction
A light side Force ability known as "Force Harmony" allowed a group of Force users to combine their Force energies into a single, potent manifestation of the light side.
Users were shielded from dark side powers and could completely sever opponents from the dark side thanks to the ability to bathe them in light side energies.
This ability was used by Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa Solo, and the unborn Anakin Solo to remove the revived Emperor Palpatine from the dark side, forcing the Force storm he had summoned to spin out of control and consume him.

# Section 1
A group of willing Force users could manifest the strength of the light side through the use of the Force ability known as "Force harmony," which is found in the families Control, Sense, and Alter.
Once activated, it bathed the users in light-side illumination and served as a defense against dark-side powers.
Even though the person who started the technique felt slightly strained, the power could be maintained almost indefinitely.
The users would be bonded together by the Force in all its ferocity for the duration that the ability was in use.
They would receive a complete understanding of the Force as the light side's energies flowed through them in waves.



# Section 2
Only as many other Force users as their Force energy would allow the initiator to connect to the chain.
The power could not eliminate the dark side, but it could divert its users' attention, make it more difficult for them to carry out their tasks, and in some cases, completely cut them off from the dark side.
By enveloping the users of dark side powers in waves of light side energy, Force harmony could also stop them from using those powers.
Force storm and other naturally difficult-to-control powers were particularly vulnerable to this interference.



# Section 3
The chain's users' proximity to one another, their Force power, and their blood affinity were all variables that could influence how strong this ability was.
The initiator needed to be skilled in telepathy and life sense to begin the Force harmony.
A group of Force users in a Force harmony chain could use the transfer of light-side Force energy to relatively strong Derriphans, creatures of the dark side, to defeat them.



# Section 4
Luke Skywalker was converted to the dark side by Emperor Palpatine after his resurrection as a clone in the year 10 ABY, and he later served as his apprentice.
Leia Organa Solo, Skywalker's identical sister, went to Palpatine's flagship, the Eclipse, and brought her brother back to the good side.



# Section 5
When Palpatine summoned a Force storm at Pinnacle Base that was so destructive it destroyed the New Republic fleet, Skywalker, and Organa Solo combined their Force energies to envelop Palpatine in a wave of light side energy.
The twins easily cut Palpatine off from the dark side, causing him to lose control of his storm, helped by their closeness as twins and the power of Organa Solo's unborn third child.
Palpatine and the Eclipse were both destroyed by the storm, but not before Skywalker and Organa Solo managed to escape the doomed ship unharmed.



# Section 6
Force harmony could be started by Old Jedi Order Jedi Knights and Masters like Ood Bnar, Arca Jeth, Thon, Vima-Da-Boda, Taj Junak, and Yoda.
The ancient Sith Lord Freedon Nadd, a master of both Jedi and Sith skills, could also perform Force harmony.
Also known to have the ability were top-tier members of the Emperor's Shadow Guard under the command of Inquisitor Valin Draco.



# Section 7
The Tedryn Holocron was the source of Leia Organa Solo's initial knowledge of the skill.
Bodo Baas, the holocron's gatekeeper, informed her of a prophecy about Skywalker and Organa Solo defeating Palpatine that was told to him by his Master almost a thousand years ago.
Facing Palpatine on the Eclipse, Organa Solo grasped the significance of the prophecy and fused her Force energy with Skywalkers.
He joined his sister after realizing that the only effective defense against Palpatine's dark side energies was pure light.
The twins defeated Palpatine by fusing their abilities with those of Organa Solo's unborn child, Anakin Solo.
