# Introduction

Altus sopor is an old school name for one's ability to boost their focus in wielding the Force.
It was a basic ability under the control area of Force abilities.
At an advanced level this ability could be used for one to integrate into the Force, granting them the ability to go invisible and be undetachable even by other Force-sensitives.
This ability while granting invisibility just like that of Force cloak, are completely different means to the end, Altus sopor focuses on focusing and merging with the Force to the point of invisibility, while Force cloak focuses on manipulation of sound and light to cloak oneâ€™s self.
Advanced mind trick techniques also allowed one to trick people into believing one was never there, however both the two techniques mentioned could easily be countered and not work on other Force sensitive people, while Altus sopor could and was able to trick other wielders of the Force.
Even if one was unable to bring it to such an advantaged level, its ability to help boost focus meant it was able to help one's other abilities in the Force be stronger.
