# Introduction

Hibernation Trance was a lesser form of a Force Technique known as Morichro, capable of keeping an individual on the verge of death, appearing deceased to most unless examined more thoroughly.
Although it had its limitations, individuals could stay in this trance for many days without the need of assistance.

# Section 1

As mentioned above, Hibernation Trance was capable of masking someone’s lifesigns, appearing dead to most.
Anyone using this trance only needed to consume 1/10th of the air a normal sentient would need to survive.
The amount of time someone could survive in this trance depended on both the environment and resources available.
While Hibernation Trance lowers someone’s breathing by 9/10ths, it does little to change the need for liquids and nutrients to survive.
Naturally, locations with more moisture in the air would allow someone using this trance to survive longer, and the opposite would apply in more arid environments.

# Section 2

As one would expect, Hibernation Trance would be used in cases where one would wish to feign death or survive for an extended period of time.
Many Jedi used this ability to survive close encounters with death or to covertly infiltrate important locations.
Individuals such as Cade Skywalker used this ability to survive catastrophic events, in Cade’s case the Massacre of Ossus, where many Jedi of the Legacy Era fell during a last-stand against the newly risen Sith.
Others such as Kreia, K’Kruhk, Ikrit, Bela Kiwiiks, and many others have used this technique to feign death or survive for an extended duration of time in the hopes of rescue.
