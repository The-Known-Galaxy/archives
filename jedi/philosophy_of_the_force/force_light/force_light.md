# Introduction
Force Light is a light side Force ability when used against darksiders can dampen their connection to the Force, weakening them heavily.
They channel their Force into powerful light side energy that can be used to blast at opponents.
When hit with a blast, it could possibly destroy or weaken the darkness permanently.

During a fight with Abeloth, Luke Skywalker used the Force Light ability giving his skin a glowing gold.
Yoda, Nomi Sunrider, and Thon could all use this ability to direct the energies of the Force itself.
This ability could also be used to purge the darkness in a darksider, usually killing them in the process.
