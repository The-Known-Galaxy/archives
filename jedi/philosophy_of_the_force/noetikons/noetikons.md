INTRODUCTION
“It is more like a virtual intelligence than a holographic recording.
Master Tharis Developed it.” - Vandar Tokare

These specialised holocrons were used to categorically and systematically search through the Jedi Temple Archives whenever it was desired of them.
They are essentially magnifying glasses to those prying for knowledge in the vast catacombs of information collected by the Jedi.
It’s technicalities were designed by Tharis Orne, but physically implemented by Arca Jeth.

HISTORY
These holocrons were special in various ways but ultimately they had the distinct characteristics of wisdom, knowledge and personality embodied in them.
This stemmed from and was inspired by (3) of the greatest Jedi Master’s in the Order.
Their names have been lost to history.

(3) notable Noetikons exist titled the Noetikon of Science, Noetikon of Light and the Noetikon of Secrets each of which pertained to their respective departments.

These were protected within the Coruscant Temple’s archives and could be accessed from almost anywhere.
However, a single mind could not process all it’s information and thus it was best only to tamper with it in search of singular questions.

The Sacking of Coruscant (referred to in the Ven Zallow case study) led to the Noetikons being seized by scavengers.
These constituted the Gand, Black Sun and the Justicars who spread the relics across the Coruscant underworld.

Fortunately, a Jedi Consular, in the hopes of curing her Master Yuon Par of a disease, aimed to find these Noetikons who would most likely contain the knowledge to a cure.

After much difficulty, she discovered the wisdom necessary to cure her Master.
Consequently however, the terminal was destroyed by the Sith.

Jedi Masters under the Barsen’thor, many years later, also sought the Noetikons in hopes of finding information to defeat the Children of the Emperor.
With the consultation of all three, they learned from the Rakata history that Belsavis contained a sleeping army the Esh-kha (both referenced in their respective case studies, refer for more info) that could be used.

# Section 3

CONCLUSION
The Noetikons were escorted back to Tython following their concluded use however, once again after an assault by the Sith Empire, they found their way back to Coruscant.
These powerful tools will soon be recreated within the temple on Ossus.
Never forget the importance of the pursuit of knowledge.
