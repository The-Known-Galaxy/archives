Grandmaster Yoda was one of the people to head to the planet and he spoke to 5 mysterious, yet powerful , figures he is told by them that they are the Force Priestesses as they give him trials to complete.
He finishes the trial as one of them unmasks and vanishes as they only exist in The Force.
Each of the priestesses represent an emotion, they are joy, anger, sadness, confusion and serenity.
Once Yoda finishes their trials they inform him that Qui-Gon Jinn will teach him how to manifest in The Force after death.
