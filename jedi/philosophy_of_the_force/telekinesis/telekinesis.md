# Introduction
Telekinesis is the most common Force technique that allows you to influence your environment by sheer willpower, without using Physical Force.
It was most often used to move objects.
The user then had to track the object in the Force field, imagine what exactly he wanted to do, and then summon the Force to do it.
For this to work, the user had to be confident in himself and his abilities, not feel any doubts and not let anything distract him.
Beginner users of the Force usually had to close their eyes to establish the necessary bond with the Force to perform this technique, but as they trained and gained experience, they did not have to do so.
Moreover, telekinesis was also able to absorb attacks of any kind.
The power of a given Force user was usually determined on the basis of his telekinetic skills - the stronger he was, the larger the object he could carry and use telekinesis in a more advanced manner.

They were few ways to use telekinesis, some of them were as follows:

Moving an object

By exerting one’s willpower on him, one could move him at will.

Force Pull and Push
Telekinetic abilities to use the power that could have caused the material body to approach.
The more someone was trained to use this ability, he was able to move heavier and heavier objects.
In combat, this ability could be used to snatch a weapon from an opponent’s hand, throw him from a balcony, or pull him to hit him at close range.
On the other hand he could use the Force to push the opponent against something or an object towards him.

Force injuring
This ability allowed the user to press the opponent’s organs or body telekinetically.
If he did not resist, it was possible to crush the victim’s heart or respiratory tract, numb them and inflict significant organ damage.
This would have caused the victim unbelievable pain and suffering and even killed him.


Force Strangling
It is one of the abilities commonly used by the Dark Jedi and the Sith to clamp the victim’s larynx, thereby disrupting the air supply to the lungs.
It was also possible to clamp harder, which even resulted in a crushing of the larynx.
