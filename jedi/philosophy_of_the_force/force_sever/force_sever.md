# Introduction
Arguably the greatest punishment the Jedi Order could sentence to a member of the Order was Force Sever.
Force Sever was an ability capable of severing one’s connection to the Force permanently.
To a Force-sensitive, there is no greater punishment other than death that can be bestowed upon them, to have themselves cut off from the Force.

# Section 1
The ability commonly referred to as Force Sever has been described as similar to having one of your senses removed, such as your sight, taste, touch, or smell.
An accurate description, as often Jedi and other Force-sensitives use their connection to the Force commonly.
The Force was ingrained into the lifestyle of a Jedi or any Force-sensitive, and many do not realize how often they rely on it.
To have one’s connection to the Force so completely and utterly broken would uproot any Force Sensitive’s perception of life and the world around them.



# Section 2
Force Sever was among some of the strongest Force techniques that Jedi could use; however, it was used sparingly.
This technique was rarely used, even when exiling someone from the Jedi Order.
Many Jedi understood the severity of such a punishment, and few wished to ever inflict it upon others and most definitely not upon themselves.
In extreme circumstances, where the greatest of threats – not only to the Jedi but to the Force itself – would be used to cut one’s connection to the Force.
There have been a few extraordinary cases of its use, such as when the Jedi Exile unintentionally used Force Sever to cut herself from the Force due to the pain she felt after the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator at Malachor V.
Other Force Users known to have used this ability or been affected by it were Kyle Katarn, Jacen Solo, Ulic Qel-Droma and many others.
