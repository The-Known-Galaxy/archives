# Introduction
A disturbance in the Force was an unusual and uneasy sense that Force users develop when something feels erroneous.
These disturbances could range from a petty fluctuation to an all-out psychological trauma that can cause an individual actual pain and sometimes a mental shock.

A very recognizable and well-known disturbance was a Wound in the Force.
These were very simple to recognize because they only occurred when the most calamitous events and deaths happened.
Even Force adepts could sense them.
Not only did death affect ripples in the Force, but alignment shifts were strong too.
Examples of Wounds in the Force could be: an increase of power, in a specific area, or a decrease.
Disturbances in the Force generally stemmed from Dark Side abilities and would attract specific Force-users.
These Dark Side disturbances could also destroy the flora and fauna of the area.
It could also turn creatures to the Dark Side, it corrupted the great Terentatek and Storm beats.
It affected their minds causing the Terentatek to become immune to Force abilities.
Disturbances could happen during an unnatural event caused by the Force.
A more commonly known event was when Kyle Katarn faced the Reborn soldiers and noted that their presence felt peculiar, this was because they were artificially suffused with the powers of the Force and so when a Force-wielder was in their presence of the Reborns, they could feel the odd sensation of the Reborn’s powers.
