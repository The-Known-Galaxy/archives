# Introduction

The Ones were a powerful family of Force users who were the sole inhabitants of the mystical planet called Mortis.
The family consisted of the Father, the leader, and his two offspring, the Son and Daughter.
The Son represented the Dark Side of the Force, while the Daughter represented the Light Side.
The Nightsisters honored these two siblings as the Twin Deities, but the Father was also adored in various religions.

More than a million years before the Clone Wars, the Celestials lived in the galaxy, beings capable of massively reshaping space.
Thuruht, the oldest of the Killik hives, states that "the Ones are what the Celestials become." According to Thuruht, the Ones coalesced out of a geyser on an unknown tropical planet.
The Ones initially lived in peace and harmony in their home near the site of the geyser.
However, the Son and Daughter eventually disobeyed the Father's orders not to drink from the Font of Power or bathe in the Pool of Knowledge, respectively.
This resulted in the siblings channeling the essence of the dark and light sides of the Force, leading to them fighting each other for millennia while the Father kept the balance.

# Section 2

A few thousand years ago, a young woman arrived on the planet by unknown means and became the Servant to The Ones.
She eventually became the Mother, managing to persuade the Son to use his destructive nature for a constructive purpose.
However, as she grew old and was no longer able to keep the peace between the siblings, the Ones resumed their fighting.
As a result, the Mother snuck a drink from the Font and bathed in the Pool, transforming into Abeloth, the Bringer of Chaos.
She attacked both the Son and Daughter, forcing them to bow down to her.
The Father eventually saved his children and left the planet, stranding Abeloth behind.

The Daughter and Son later enlisted the help of the Killiks, joining their hive mind and lending them their power in the Force.
Together, they created Centerpoint Station, Sinkhole Station, and other devices to imprison Abeloth.
The Father moved his family to Mortis to keep the Force in balance, but Abeloth managed to escape periodically for hundreds of thousands of years.

# Section 3

The Ones encountered Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who were brought to Mortis by the Father to verify if Skywalker was the foretold Chosen One.
After successfully doing so, the Son used the opportunity and attempted to kill his father with the Dagger of Mortis, the only device capable of slaying the Ones.
The Daughter, however, sacrificed herself to save her father, causing the balance of the Force to come undone.
The Father died after a brief but brutal combat with the Son, weakening the Son sufficiently for Skywalker to kill him.
