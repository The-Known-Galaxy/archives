# Introduction

Floating meditation was often used by the Jedi.
This technique allowed the person to float several inches off the ground by using the Force.
Sometimes, objects that surrounded the person also floated around them.
This technique was often referred to as ‘Rising Meditation’.
In the past, Revan used this technique when he was being retrained with the Jedi Ways on Dantooine.
Within this, objects, chairs, and a datapad surrounded him, as well as when he was lifted in the air.
As well as that, Galen Marek also used this technique to find Vader.
