# Introduction

Floating Meditation, otherwise known as Rising Meditation, was a meditation technique used by the Jedi for a big part of their history, dating to before the Mandalorian Wars.
Often, while using this technique, objects around the user would also levitate.

Floating Meditation was used by a variety of powerful Force users, most notably Revan during his re-training on Dantooine and Luke Skywalker on multiple occasions.
Jedi like Bastila Shan and Barriss Offee also utilized this power.
Additionally, some Jedi, like Jacen Solo, thought contact with the ground during meditation could be distracting and preferred Floating Meditation instead.
