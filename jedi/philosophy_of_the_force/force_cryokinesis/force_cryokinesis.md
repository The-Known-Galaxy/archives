# Introduction
Cryokinesis was a powerful Force ability that allowed the user to utilize the Force to draw heat away from a being or an object, which caused it to freeze.
Despite the ability being used to remove heat, it could not be harnessed and used to absorb.
The ability allowed the user to remove all sources of heat from their blood and the target would become more frangible and piercing to touch.
