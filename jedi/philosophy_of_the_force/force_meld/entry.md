# Introduction

Force meld, also known as Jedi meld or battle meld was a technique where multiple Force users joined minds together through the Force.
This allowed the users to draw strength from each other.
It was also a refined version of battle meditation known to the ancient Jedi.
While it could influence both Force-sensitives and non-sensitives, the meditation focused mainly on coordinating and improving the Force-sensitives of either side of the Force.

Due to there being fewer Force-sensitive entities than non-sensitives in battles, there was less of a demand for the Force Meld.
Because of this, Force meld was believed to be easier to master since the number of practitioners within the New Jedi Order was almost half of the practitioners from the old order.
Anakin Skywalker redeveloped the technique for the New Jedi Order during the Yuuzhan Vong War.
This allowed Jedi fighting in the war to act as a single entity.
With the coordination of Jacen Solo, Force meld would play an important role during the Mission to Myrkr, helping boost the efficiency of the Myrkr strike team.
Jaina Solo fine-tuned Force meld as a starfighter tactic that was used in her Twin Suns Squadron.
Not long after, Madurrin used the technique as an inter-squadron coordination tactic.

Prolonged use of the technique caused users to have strange behavior such as finishing othersâ€™ sentences and thoughts, due to the Meld allowing them to see into the minds of others.
Obi-Wan Kenobi had given a warning that it required a Master of great power and connection with the Force to create a single entity state without destroying the minds of everyone involved.
One of the biggest drawbacks of Force meld was one of the major elements that led to the Dark Nest Crisis.
The enhanced power of Force meld worked two ways, one being where the entity could influence a large number of minds.
However, with more power, there would be a great disruption in the Force and could overwhelm the participants.
If the pain was caused by the minds of those being touched, it would bring disastrous effects to everyone involved.
Which could be to a degree that would cause those involved to lose control of their minds and become ignorant to any outside threats.
The majority of the light side users could prevent participants from slipping to the dark side, but if the participants were divided in thoughts the meld could become a liability rather than an asset.
