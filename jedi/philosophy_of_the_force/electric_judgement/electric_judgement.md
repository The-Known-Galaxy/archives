# Introduction
Electric Judgment, also known as Emerald Lightning, was a Force ability wielded by Jedi.
The user could control the intensity of the lightning, and usually incapacitated their opponents with it.
This ability was forbidden within the Jedi Order, but was used by some Jedi like Plo Koon and Jacen Solo.

# Section 1
The Electric Judgment had a yellow to orange or even green energy, instead of a blue to purple or even white one.
Despite this, it was very similar to the Force Lightning of the Dark Side, except that Jedi drew their power from determined justice and mostly just stunned their opponents instead of killing them.



# Section 2
The Dark or Sith variant of this ability is known as Force Lightning.
Another known variant is the Force ability 'Kinetite'.



# Section 3
In the Jedi Order, this ability was uncommon and classified as a forbidden Force ability, as it closely resembled the Force Lightning of the Dark Side.
However, there were Jedi like Plo Koon who studied this technique.
When Plo Koon went on a mission in which a criminal named Dreed Pommel kidnapped and threatened a young girl after killing her entire family, he shot a hand of lightning at his head until he eventually passed out.
Plo Koon then reported to the Jedi Council, describing himself as calm and emotion-free during the incident.
The council told him to think about whether it was right to use the Force ability, which Plo Koon said it was.
He felt it was right to know his own power and developed it into a controlled side of himself.
He eventually recorded all his studies on the Great Holocron, under the name Electric Judgement.
