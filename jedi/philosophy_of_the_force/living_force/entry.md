# Introduction

The Living Force is a fundamental energy that permeated the galaxy and powered all life.
This force worked in tandem with the Cosmic Force to create the Force, which was a field of energy that kept the galaxy together.
This was the duality and unity of forces that maintained harmony between fundamental aspects of life, and the Living Force was a symbiotic aspect of the Force that fed off of the Cosmic Force.
The Cosmic Force connected itself to the Living Force through midi-chlorians, which were organelles within cells that fed off the life forms they lived in, and granted them the ability to connect with the Force, and in some cases even manipulate it advantageously.
Once an organism died, it would be turned to the Cosmic Force, completing the cycle of the Force.

Each being also possessed its own life-essence, but certain people who were sensitive to the Force interpreted the field differently than anyone else, or other Force-sensitives.
While certain life forms such as the Jedi utilized their gift from the midi-chlorians to aid others, the Sith pursued personal power and often rebelled against the natural order of the Force in favor of creating imbalance for their own power.
Anakin Skywalker was an important figure in the Force as well, due to him being born as the Chosen One or the prophesied being who would bring balance to the Force.
Anakin did this by killing Darth Sidious while under his rule as Darth Vader, after he had been misinformed and manipulated by the Sith.
This action brought balance to the Force after a time when there had been little balance.

# Section 2

All beings were given at least some amount of Midi-Chlorians in every cell in their body, which lived within the host symbiotically.
These formed the foundation of all life in the galaxy and allowed beings to perceive an interconnected tapestry of life after death, which fell into a tunnel that led into the Cosmic Force.
Thus after death, a beingâ€™s energy was transferred from the Living Force to the Cosmic Force, continuing the cycle of life and death.
However, if a being fully learned to accept oneself with all flaws, and become emotionless, content, and humble, as well as rejecting the dark side of the Force while knowing it is still a part of them, they could transfer their consciousness into the real world as part of the Living Force, thus granting them immortality, usually as a Force Ghost.
