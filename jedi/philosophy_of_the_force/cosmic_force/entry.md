# Introduction

Cosmic Force, also known as the greater Force, was described by Jedi Masters as a unifying form.
Through Living Force, it was made possible for the phenomenon of Force Ghosts.
During the Clone Wars, Qui-Gon-Jinn explained how he was able to appear in front of Yoda as a Force Ghost.
He was able to do this because the Living Force directly fed into the Cosmic Force through the midi-chlorians.

# Section 1

In 18 BBY, Darth Vader was consumed by the power of the Cosmic Force when he poured bota into the chest plate of his armor.
Some time passed and Jedi Jax Pavan was introduced to Chan Dash by his friend Den Dhur.
During this encounter, he felt a surge of Force power running through him.
Because of this, he was able to experience a metaphysical vision of the entire galactic whirlpool and felt some sort of connection to it.
After the experience, he realized that the Force had granted him a gift, which was a connection to the great unifying force that many Jedi Masters referred to as the Cosmic Force.

# Section 2

During a meeting with some officers aboard the first Death Star in 0 BBY, Vader came to the conclusion that the Cosmic Force’s capabilities outweighed even that of the Death Star.
He came to this conclusion after Admiral Conan Antonio Motti claimed that the Death Star was indestructible, thus implying that they could use it for defense.
This later led to Vader using Force choke on Motti when Motti mocked Vader’s capabilities and his beliefs in the Force.
