# Introduction
Force Convection was a strong force ability that allowed its users to amend the body’s chemicals and caused their skin to burn with immense heat.
It was powerful in terms of battles, for it could severely injure and even kill opponents without even hurting the user.
Mastering the ability required deep concentration and was used by Jedi martial artists, who knew of its power and ability to attack opponents while the practitioner was unarmed.
It would set an enemy on agonizingly hot fire and burn them, either causing serious injury or death.
