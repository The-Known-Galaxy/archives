# Introduction

All Knights of the Order were instructed in the methods required to conduct the Meditation of Emptiness, otherwise known as Empty Meditation.
This practice was a way for one to shed their emotions to create self-balance and center oneself in the present.
During the Meditation, memories were disregarded and ignored so as to create an aura of internal clairvoyance that would guide them to serenity and harmony.
Many practitioners also found that it was a useful technique to combat mental assaults and influences.
