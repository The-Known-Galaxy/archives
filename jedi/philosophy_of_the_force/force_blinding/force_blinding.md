# Introduction
Force blinding was a telekinetic Force power used by the light side.
When someone used the technique, a blinding flash of energy emerged from the user’s hand.
The flash of light grew exponentially and would harm a target’s vision and cause temporary blindness.

This technique was a powerful tool that a Jedi could use to obscure an enemy's vision, making it difficult for them to spot and attack the Jedi or anyone else in the area.
However, a trained Force-sensitive could defend themselves against this technique by using Force sight.
Even so, if a Jedi was able to blind an unexpecting enemy before they used Force sight, the blind could still be effective.
The technique was primarily known to be a light side power, but both Dark Jedi Yun and the Force apparition Dark Mara were able to effectively use it.
