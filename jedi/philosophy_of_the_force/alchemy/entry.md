# Introduction

Force Alchemy was a powerful technique that allowed the user to concentrate the Force into a physical form.
This technique was harnessed mainly by Nightsisters and worked similarly to Magick and could consolidate power.
One of the most common aspects of Alchemy was the Water of Life, which the Nightsisters used as a healing ability by using an ancient creature only known as the Sleeper to create it.
Nightsisters werenâ€™t the only alchemy users, some Sith possessed interesting alchemy abilities that allowed them to achieve many things.
