# Introduction

Vitali was a Force maneuver that was most notably performed by a Sephi named Tey Sirrek or so he claimed.
Tey Sirrek was caught robbing from a Bpfasshi Truthslayer and was chased by Jedi Knight Vildar Mac.
Tey was investigating the murder of V'kara, however, he was spotted by Mac, who had assumed that Tey was behind the murder and proceeded to attack him with a lightsaber.
Mac was in shock and demanded that Tey gave him an explanation for how he could dodge Macâ€™s strikes.
Tey claimed that he had mastered Vitali, which Mac quickly dismissed and the Sephi then proceeded to use an ancient chemical substance, that was passed down to him from his ancestors.
He used the substance to knock out the Jedi for a brief period.
