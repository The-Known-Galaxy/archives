# Introduction
Introduced by the Fallanassi people, Force Immersion was a special Force ability that drew from White Current and would allow the user to become undetectable.
Those whose minds were weak could not detect the users.
However, if one was vigilant and had a strong mind, they could pierce through.
Those who mastered the ability had the capability to use it on other beings or even objects to make them undetectable.
