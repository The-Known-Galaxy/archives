# Introduction
On Dathomir and the Forest Moon of Endor, different life forms used totem magic to use the Force.
Force users on the moon developed a reliance on material objects to aid in their access to the Force because they had little to no contact with practitioners of other Force traditions, such as the Jedi Order.

# Section 1
Dulok sorcery, Ewok shamanism, and Gupin magic were some totem magic forms used on Endor.
These disciplines appeared superficially different, but their underlying principles were the same.



# Section 2
To enhance their inherent Force abilities, practitioners of totem magic occasionally used Force artifacts.
The Season Scepter, the Shadowstone, and the Sunstar were some examples of these artifacts on Endor.



# Section 3
The Nightsisters of Dathomir were also known to use a form of totem magic; they were known to create small idols of the people they wanted to harm and, with great effort and the expenditure of spirit ichor, infuse them with the life force of the target through a hair and a roiling cauldron filled with the "waters of life." They could inflict pain on the victim represented by the totem by sticking it with needles or even dropping it into a boiling pot.
Mother Talzin used this method against Count Dooku during the Separatist assault on the Nightsisters during the Clone Wars, and she kept a lock of his hair as a souvenir.\
