# Introduction
A Force ghost was a Force spirit of a deceased Force-sensitive that had passed on and had become one with the Force.
To achieve being one with the Force, the Force-sensitive needed to achieve the power to do so.
It had also been used by the Sith, such as Darth Bane who created an apparition of himself, although it looked more solid than how a normal Force ghost usually would look.
A Force ghost was able to communicate with a person, visibly or invisibly.
Such apparitions also make their own choice whether they wanted to look clear or hazy.
This led to Force ghosts being able to communicate in multiple ways as well as appear in multiple ways.

# Section 1
A Force spirit or a Force ghost was able to bind themselves to any living being to teach them and guide them.
Such examples were shown by Qui-Gon Jinn, Master Yoda, Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Master Luke Skywalker, and Leia Organa (Also a Skywalker).
A Sith may also be able to achieve the power to become a Force ghost but that has, until now, been impossible as the Sith have only wanted to be immortal, not knowing that they can become a Force ghost.



# Section 2
Force ghosts can become solid on their own will.
They can touch a being or hold something.
Although they can also freely pass through solid matter, whatever it may be.
The first person to learn how to become a Force ghost was Qui-Gon Jinn, who was taught by a Shaman of the Whills, who showed him that immortality wasn’t possible but being a Force ghost was close to it.
Although this was found out, not many Jedi knew about it and so it was a very disclosed matter, only shared between colleagues.
