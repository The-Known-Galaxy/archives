# Introduction
Tutaminis was an ancient Force technique developed by the members of the Je’daii Order in the early days of the Old Republic.
The name itself was used to describe a group of skills which heavily relied on energy absorption, deflection and shielding.
After being discovered, Tutaminis quickly became one of the most commonly taught skills in the Jedi Order due to its wide variety of possible uses, and its defensive potential.

# Section 1
The basic Tutaminis abilities focused on absorbing the energy of the hostile attacks, and conditionally deflecting them back to their source.
Many advanced users of Tutaminis were also able to convert the gathered energy and use it to empower their own, various Force-based attacks.
This way, many Jedi in history were able to single-handedly turn the tides of the battle, as they used their enemies’ energetic strikes against them.
Another common usage of Tutaminis would emphasise a safe diffusion of energy into the harmless atmosphere.
A few talented and experienced masters could also utilise Tutaminis to defend themselves from lightsaber strikes with their bare hands.
Many telekinetic shielding techniques, such as the Force Barrier, or their offensive variants: Force Burst, Force Repulse and even Force Judgement, which used the Force energy as its primary power source, would be expanded thanks to the continuous research and development of Tutaminis.

Even though Tutaminis was widely known amongst both the Jedi and the Sith, only the truly talented individuals who had spent years training could master this skill.
Many branches of Tutaminis have been explored by only a handful of Force users, making it almost impossible to define its full potential.

A majority of famous Jedi during the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War, such as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Shaak Ti, Galen Marek, Nejaa Halcyon, Plo Koon and Yoda, were able to deflect blaster bolts and heat with their hands, to then use the absorbed energy against their enemies.
Furthermore, Plo Koon himself was known to have created and mastered the art of Force Judgement, a technique which allowed him to blast his enemies with golden lightning, a less lethal version of the Sith Force Lightning.
Besides Plo Koon, Yoda also possessed the power necessary to absorb a fully trained Sith’s lightning strikes, and even deflect them back, which made him one of the strongest duelists in the galaxy.
It is worth mentioning that not only the modern Jedi used that skill in battle - one of the unique talents related to Tutaminis was displayed during the Battle of Alderaan, during which a young Jedi named Satele Shan blocked Darth Malgus’ lightsaber thrust and struck him down with a powerful Force Burst, allowing her troops to regroup and gain an advantage over the Sith Empire.

Darth Revan, his apprentice Malak, and the Sith Emperor Vitiate were also able to efficiently manipulate Force Lightning, with Vitiate achieving a definite mastery of this skill under the name of Valkorion.
Interestingly enough, Darth Vader was capable of deflecting blaster energy as well, despite his cybernetic suit designs that made him vulnerable to Force Lightning.
Many speculations arose, that the Dark Lord utilised a special fabric on his gloves to increase their absorption potential.
Even though many famous warriors would use Tutaminis in battle, only a small percentage of all Force users were able to truly learn it.
This art would undoubtedly impact the way of waging wars, and to this day is considered one of the most crucial Force techniques to ever be created.
