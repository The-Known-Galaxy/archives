# Introduction
Similar to Animal Bond, Life Bond was a Force ability that allowed the users to connect with other people mentally.
Users would be able to connect to other’s minds and were capable of using a very limited telepathic ability.
However, when one of the people died, the other would go into a violent frenzy as seen when the Dark Jedi Gorc and Picaroon Boodle connected to each other’s mind using Life Bond.
