# Introduction
Force Speed was a common Force ability that allowed the user to enhance their physical speed and caused them to see events in slow motion.
It also enabled users to dodge attacks more easily with faster and more exact counterattacks.
In some cases, it even led to the ability to run on vertical surfaces for a while.
If a Force-user was skilled enough, they could practically vanish from their previous position.
However, Force Speed drained a force user’s energy and metabolism, which means it required a longer recovery period.
Force Speed falls under the control aspect of the Force and was a skill taught to Jedi Initiates.
Force Speed was known by a lot of different names, such as “Force run”, “Force dash”, and “Surge”.
