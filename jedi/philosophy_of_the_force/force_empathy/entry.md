# Introduction

Force empathy was a Force power related to Force sense, but it involved gathering impressions of someone’s feelings and emotional state.
Those that are Force-sensitive could sense motivations, hidden feelings, and deeply guarded secrets.

# Section 1

In 24 BBY, Anakin Skywalker went on a mission to Romin where he was able to find a new power within himself.
He felt a sense of euphoria from the Force that he had never felt before.
Thus allowing him to see into the most secret part of the Citizens’ Resistance leader's heart.
Skywalker soon discovered that he could not just manipulate objects, but beings as well.
He told Joylin that he had let Romin’s dictator, Teda escape.
However, to Skywalker’s surprise, Joylin had her own plans to help Teda escape.
She had planned to help him leave the planet with the galactic criminal Jenna Zan Arbor alongside him.
Skywalker then raced to the landing platform to prevent their escape.
Some time passed and Jedi Master Mace Windu congratulated him for alerting them of this new information.

# Section 2

Master Windu assigned Skywalker a new mission at the Senate Building.
While they were there Windu noticed Skywalker’s connection with the Force that had gone beyond objects and towards the inner workings of beings.
Skywalker’s Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, realized this as well and wondered about Windu’s recognition of it.
Since he had only been on Romin with them for a short time during the end of their mission.
Later on, Skywalker witnessed Palpatine’s impressive political maneuvering of beings at his will.
He suddenly realized that Palpatine had done what he did back on Romin.
The strong surge of power made Skywalker come to the realization that the Force could allow him to see into motivations and consequences, including the Supreme Chancellors.
Palpatine was not a Jedi, but he somehow was able to think steps ahead of his opponents while perceiving motivations and outcomes.

# Section 3

In 23 BBY, during a mission on Korriban, Skywalker faced the reality that feelings of jealousy and needing to win could cloud one’s heart and mind.
Which would effectively numb and possibly nullify the Force-sensitives’ capacity to use Force empathy.
It was Force empathy that allowed him to locate his mother Shmi on Tatooine.
However, the whole journey was filled with pain as he sensed the agony that his mother was feeling.
He soon arrived at a Tusken camp where she had been tortured to death.

# Section 4

Master Yoda showed signs of Force empathy during the First Battle of Geonosis when he was able to sense the tension between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker.
The argument between them was because of Padme Amidala’s unfortunate fall from a LAAT gunship.
Soon after Master Yoda decided to intervene in hopes of lessening the tension.
Many other Force-sensitives were able to use Force empathy such as Knight Etain Tur-Mukan, Padawan Jaesa Willsaam, and Ben Skywalker.
