# Introduction

Force Oneness was commonly achieved through death, when a Force-user became one with the Force.
However, it was possible to accomplish Oneness with the Force whilst still being alive.
Even very skilled Force-users rarely corresponded with a living manifestation of both the Light and Dark Side of the Force.
Whilst trying to achieve Force Oneness, it was likely one could succumb to the temptations of the Dark side, and after this, the individual became tools of the Force with a state of calmness.
Very few Dark and Light side users alike achieved this; a few notable examples are Barriss Offee and Luke Skywalker accomplished it naturally more than once.
