# Introduction
Force Stun was a powerful ability, which had the capability to essentially paralyze one’s opponent.
It was used as both a method of retreat and if a Force-user wished to take on an entourage of foes.
It was mostly used by Jedi and they would barely be conscious whilst performing the maneuver.
Similarly to Mind Control, if a being had strong enough willpower, they could resist the effects.
Most of the time it was only used on one enemy, however, there have been some cases where a Jedi has multiplied the effects.
Force Stasis was a branch of Force Stun, where the user could freeze their foe and escape narrow areas.
A more powerful branch of Force Stun was Stasis Field.
Stasis Field was capable of putting multiple enemies into a near catatonic state, which was often used when facing a large number of enemies, escaping, and avoiding any form of combat.
It was used by more powerful Jedi Knights and Masters.
