# Introduction

One of the four forms of the Force, the Physical Force isnâ€™t as worshipped as the others.
The Physical Force allowed its disciples to alter any surrounding objects.
Acts like these required the disciplined Alter Jedi, which were those who shared a strong belief in the Physical Force and act in accordance with its philosophy.
The Physical Force also contributed to two of the other main aspects of the Force; the Living and the Unifying Force.
Those and the Cosmic Force were the four primary and most important facets of the Force.
