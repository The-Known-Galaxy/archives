# Introduction

The Protection Bubble, also known as the bubble of safety, was a Force power thought to be related to Force Protection.
Users of this ability were able to create defensive spheres around their bodies.
It was described as a shimmering blue ball of energy.
This so-called ball of energy could protect the user from a diverse range of attacks such as laser blasts, lightsabers, and vacuums.
The sphere was also able to inflict small amounts of damage upon the enemy.
However, protection bubbles could also be used offensively.
It was possible that if surrounding an enemy, the attacker would then become victim to their own attack.
Due to the amount of concentration needed to sustain the bubble, the user would need to temporarily immobilize themselves to form it and possibly even sustain it.

Darth Bane and his former trainer, Kas’im, had been dueling on Lehon after Bane left the Brotherhood of Darkness.
Because of his leave from the brotherhood, Kas’im was sent to kill him.
Bane was able to overpower Kas’im until he switched to using Jar’Kai.
He lost his ground but was able to get himself up and out of the Temple of Ancients.
Once he got out of the temple he let out a massive shockwave in hopes that he would hit Kas’im in the process.
However, Kas’im used a protection bubble to avoid the shockwave, but his attempts were futile as the temple came crashing down which resulted in his death.
Some time passed and Jedi Master Worror used a protection bubble to subdue Darth Bane during the final moments of their duel on Tython.
Which trapped both him and Bane within the confines of the bubble.
He did this in an attempt to protect Johun Othone from Bane’s Force lightning.
The lightning was not able to penetrate the bubble but ended up killing Worror and electrocuting Darth Bane.

Mother Talzin, who was a Dathomirian Nightsister, utilized a version of the protection bubble during the Battle of Dathomir.
The shield deflected blaster fire from enemy battle droids and was used alongside Force lightning.
Later on, Cin Drallig used the protection bubble to protect himself while he healed during his duel with Darth Vader.
Tash Arranda also used this power as she was holding back opposing forces on Enzeen.
Some time passed and she used the bubble to protect herself from Spore.
However, she was untrained so her bubble only lasted a few seconds before it would collapse.

Sith Lord Azard was skilled in using this technique, and he showed that when he protected himself from an explosion and fall after his duel with the Imperial Knight Treis Sinde.
Sinde had also used a protection bubble when he assisted Mon Calamari refugees on Dac.
Cade Skywalker also used it to protect himself and Deliah Blue after the explosion of Darth Maladi’s lab.
