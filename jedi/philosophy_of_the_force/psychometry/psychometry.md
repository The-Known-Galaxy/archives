# Introduction
Also known as telemetry, postcognition, and tai vordrax, psychometry is a mental Force power of extracting traces of information and the events that surround an object via physical contact with it.
Doing so allows the user to view these events as if they were there, through the senses and the emotions that the object’s owner experienced at that time.
This Force ability is easier to use on personal belongings that saw frequent use, though in turn objects that were only used once or used by several people are harder to use psychometry on, albeit not impossible.
Psychometry is mainly useful for tracking as it serves no real purpose in combat, but it can sometimes fail to provide any information that can be deemed useful.
However, the Sith could use this Force power on living things, to invasively “rip” memories away from others.

# Section 1
Psychometry can possibly taint its user if the object being analyzed has experienced actions tied to the Dark Side with strong negative emotions, including murder or other serious acts of violence.
Because of this possibility, the Jedi Council strongly recommended that psychometry should never be used on corpses, no matter how they have died.
The emotions that living beings feel before their deaths are so intense and powerful that trying to extract anything from these experiences can put a Jedi in great danger.

During the Invasion of Naboo, the Jedi Council looked down upon superfluous usage of psychometry due to the possibility for the user to experience an intense amount of emotion, which can bring them dangerously closer to the Dark Side of the Force.
Also, excessive usage can cause the user’s consciousness to become “trapped,” and in even rarer cases can cause the death of the user.
However, these scenarios tend to be rare and occur only in extreme cases.



# Section 2
Around 1 of every 100 Kiffar, a race hailing from Kiffu that are similar to humans were able to use psychometry, with their Vos lineage having a substantial amount of these psychometrics.
Most Kiffar who had access to this ability chose to become Kiffu Guardians.
Jedi Master Quinlan Vos was a frequent user of psychometry and was known as the most skilled Kiffar psychometric during his lifetime.

When he was a young man, Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker had psychometric abilities, but to an unrefined extent.
However, upon visiting the Valley of the Spirits, his untrained psychometry picked up on the massacre that occurred at the location back during the Clone Wars.
He was able to discern some of the scenes from this massacre as well as identify where Shmi Skywalker, his paternal grandmother, died.
This experience disturbed Luke to the point that he called it “worse than a nightmare.” Years later, Luke Skywalker would use psychometry again, in a more helpful manner.
When Han Solo kidnapped Leia Organa in an attempt to win her over romantically, Luke was able to track Han’s emotions like a hunter picking up an animal’s scent, which led him to Han Solo’s location: a casino where he had won the deed to the planet Dathomir in a game of sabacc against the Drackmaran warlord Omogg.
