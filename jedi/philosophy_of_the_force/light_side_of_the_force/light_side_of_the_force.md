# Introduction
The light side of the Force, also known as Ashla, is popularly affiliated with the Jedi.
In comparison to its darker counterpart, this side of the force encompassed devotion to the Force.
The light side was aligned with honesty, compassion, selflessness, self-knowledge and enlightenment, healing, benevolence, mercy, and self-sacrifice.

# Section 1
Followers of the light side cast out Kreia because she advocated for the person rather than their beliefs about the Force.
She saw any sort of submission to the Force as betraying oneself, so she criticized those who followed the light side for letting themselves die under the so-called protection of the Force.
The main advocates for the light side were the Jedi who attempted to destroy their enemies, the Sith.
As advocates for the dark side, the Sith were seen as those who used their emotions to guide them.
Which took over any wielder and allowed them to achieve unnatural power, as well as having accessibility to immortality more quickly.



# Section 2
The Jedi fought for balance amongst all wielders of the Force in hopes that there would be peace.
With experience, the light side of the Force opened up many doors for anyone considered to be Force-sensitive.
While the Jedi sought out balance and peace, the Sith used their connection with the Force to take over the galaxy.
To achieve harmony with the Force, its practitioners would often meditate to clear their minds of emotion.
Thus ridding themselves of any negative emotions such as aggression, anger, and hatred.
Since Ashla was another name for the Force in itself, it was thought to reference that the light side was the normal nature of the Force.



# Section 3
In contrast to the dark side, the light side was known to be harder to learn and adapt to.
An example would be with combat since dark side powers were aggressive and easily fueled with anger and/or hatred.
This allowed dark side users to progress and grow much faster than light side users.
However, the light siders ended up being more powerful than the dark siders.
Light side Force abilities were all defensive, passive, and/or utility-focused.
Although there were a few light side abilities that allowed one to increase their strength or incapacitate an enemy… only a few of them were actually destructive.
