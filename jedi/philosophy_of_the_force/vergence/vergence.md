# Introduction
Vergence was a nexus point in the Force.
Vergence was focused on places and objects, or very rarely people.
It was somewhere in the galaxy where the Force flowed the most freely.
Those who were capable of using its power could harness a powerful source of concentrated energy.
Vergences could be easily manipulated by powerful Force-users.
There, Jedi tried to find evidence of how the Vergence was created, but none of the estimates seemed accurate.
Vergences could vary in size and could be as big as an entire planet, along with this, Vergences could appear anywhere.
The Vergence was never affected by the laws of time and space, for they could appear outside it.
Vergences tended to show up in any places that previously had a strong presence, such as places where power Force-users gathered or places where tragic events once occurred.
Vergences could expand or shrink at any time and could appear for a mere second or possibly millennials.
Some Vergences were more powerful than others, they could give those in their presence special visions or strengthen certain abilities.
Due to their strength in the Force, most Jedi and Sith built temples on top of or close to the Vergences.
It could also be used as a powerful talisman for focusing on objects.
It was very rare for a Vergence to center around an individual, both Orders never figured out how this was achievable.

# Section 1
There were many identified Force nexuses across the galaxy founded by the Jedi Order.
The great temple on Coruscant itself was built on top of a Force nexus, which contained very powerful nexus energy, located on the mountain known as the Sacred Spire.
It was still contaminated with the Force nexus after it was abandoned during the Yuuzhan Vong War.
Many other temples were built within  proximity of Force nexuses, like the temple on Ilum.
Some nexuses occurred after a series of different events.



# Section 2
When an object is left next to a Force nexus for certain periods, it gets imbued with Force abilities and can become powerful artifacts, such as the ability to boost the user’s awareness and give them faster reflexes and reaction time.
Even those who were not Force-sensitive could use these artifacts.
Some objects that were infected with the Light Side of the Force were that powerful they could purify someone, and artifacts with the Dark Side embedded within could corrupt someone.
The Force-sensitive planet, Spintir, had a Vergence within the Caves of Light and Shadow, it was an ancient cave that experienced a stalemate between the Light and Dark Sides of the Force.
The cave even corrupted a pack of Icewolves who were inhabitants there.
When this was discovered, the cave sealed itself with a band of Force-sensitive beings.
Vergences could even be people like Meetra Surik and Anakin Skywalker was a Vergence in the eyes of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn.
