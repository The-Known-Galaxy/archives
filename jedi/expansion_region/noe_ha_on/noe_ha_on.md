# Introduction
Noe’ha’on is a jungle planet that is located within the Expansion Region’s Piryn Shar Sector.
Fauna on the planet included poisonous insects and k’lor’slugs - known as worm-like swamp predators.
The planet had large fossil beds that preserved the remains of organisms.
Sentient insectoids by the name of Noehons were the known natives of the planet.

# Section 1
The natives lived in communities called welds and were industrializing technology by harvesting their homeworld’s natural resources to craft materials.
Noe’ha’on runs along the Great Gran Run hyperlane and serves as a stopping point for interstellar merchants.
Off-world traders introduced the Noehon people to advanced weaponry which led to heightened violence between and within tribes.
This violence lead to an increased level of anarchy across the planet.
The planet eventually became part of the Galactic Republic and later the Galactic Empire.



# Section 2
The area surrounding the planet of Noe’ha’on was explored between 1000 BBY and 25 BBY.
Which lead was spurred when the Galactic Republic made initial contact with the Noehon species.
The planet laid within the borders of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars from 22 BBY to 19 BBY.
At the beginning of the conflict, the Nineteenth Army of the Republic Military had been tasked with defending the planet against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
Between the years 19 BBY and 17 BBY, the planet was incorporated into the territory of the Galactic Empire.
During the Galactic Civil War, a small group became interested in retrieving and selling a valuable medicine that is only able to be found on Noe’ha’on.
The group went on a dangerous journey to the planet but ended up being captured by a Noehon male when they arrived.
