# Introduction
A planet known as Allanteen Six was located among many other planets in the Expansion Region.
It could be found in the Tynna sector, inside the Allanteen system.
At one point this planet had a population of 500 billion.
Allanteen Six was also part of two different routes, one known as the Corellian Run and another as the Shipwrights’ Trace; many starships could be seen flying past, arriving or departing from the planet.
Despite Allanteen Six being part of Separatist space during the Clone Wars, a shipyard in the same system was still used by Anakin Skywalker to modify his military cruisers.
Many years before these events, a battle was won by the Sith on Allanteen Six during the Jedi Civil War.
This planet was also invaded by Yuuzhan Vong during the Yuuzhan Vong War.
The whole planet was conquered, afterwards Vong’s forces were split in half for an assault towards two different targets.
