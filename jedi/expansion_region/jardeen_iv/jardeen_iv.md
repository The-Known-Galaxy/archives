# Section 1
Due to their alliance, the Empire constructed numerous Imperial bases and facilities, one of these being the Imperial Army training centre on Jardeen IV.
General Arndall Lott, a human male born in 48 BBY, was assigned to Jardeen IV after the Battle of Hoth, was in charge of Imperial Walker controls and tactics, which was immensely crucial to the Empire if they wished for a powerful offence.
The centre trained with All Terrain Armoured Transport and All Terrain Scout Transport walkers.
The centre itself wars guarded by Iolan Gendarr, a fellow human male born in 37 BBY on Commenor, a planet just outside of the Core Worlds.
As the Battle of Endor concluded, all remaining Imperial forces evacuated to avoid the New Republic.
