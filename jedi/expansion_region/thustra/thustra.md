# Introduction
Thustra was a planet located within the Thustra system of the Sumitra sector, which lies within the Expansion Region.
It was the homeworld of a race closely related to humans known as the Sephi.
Up until the Clone Wars, the planet was a member of the Galactic Republic and was represented in the Galactic Senate.
Around 21 BBY, the Sephi ended up betraying the Republic and joined the rebellion made by the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

# Section 1
During the Clone Wars, Thustra was ruled by King Alaric and represented in the Galactic Senate by his nephew Navi.
The Sephi lost patience with the Galactic Republic and aimed to join the rebellion.
These actions prompted Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to send Republic forces to Thustra.
By doing so, Palpatine believed that a small show of force would convince the Sephi to stay loyal to the Republic.
The mission was led by Jedi Generals Tyffix and Tyr, alongside their padawans Cal and Pix.
However, their squad was attacked overnight by suicide bombers.
The attack left many casualties including Tyffix and Tyr, which left their padawans in charge.



# Section 2
Meanwhile, on Coruscant, Palpatine and Master Yoda discussed their fears of what would happen if Thustra were to part ways with the Republic.
Yoda had been a long-time friend of Alaric and hoped that their friendship would be enough to encourage him to stay with the Republic.
When they arrived in Thustra, Cal and Master Yoda went to talk with the king while Pix and Commander Clutch were tasked with staying put no matter the circumstances.
Yoda and Alaric discussed multiple matters regarding the well-being of the Republic and what has started to deter the king away.
The king came to the final conclusion that the Republic was currently full of itself regarding personal gain.
Thus giving him the need to do what is right for Thustra and fall back from the Republic.
Because of this, Yoda and Cal were taken as prisoners to prevent further conflict.



# Section 3
Senator Navi and his aide Moje had been called back to Thustra by the king, as he had a hunch that Navi had strayed the wrong way and betrayed his people.
His fears were right and Navi did not want Thustra to secede from the Republic.
Navi made a plan that would ensure that the Republic was going to be able to overtake the planet.
Moje was sent to speak to Cal and convinced the young Jedi to escape before he would be executed.
Meanwhile, Navi left to meet with Pix and Clutch and told them that Yoda and Cal had already been executed.
He did this in hopes that they would start up a strike against the Sephi forces.
Cal attempted to escape while Pix and the clone troopers attacked the Sephi military, which gave off the appearance that the Republic was trying to kill Alaric and take over the planet.
Because of this, the palace guards attacked Cal and he ended up being killed in battle.



# Section 4
Yoda went to confront Alaric in the castle’s greenhouse as the capital of Thustra continued to fall.
However, Alaric had a trick up his sleeve and pulled out a blaster from under his robes.
He then told Yoda that his death would only empower his people to avenge his death from the Republic scum that stole him from them.
Yoda tried to convince the king otherwise, but he refused and shot a blaster shot at Yoda.
The Jedi Master was able to deflect the bolt into the king’s chest, which ended up killing him.
Before the king died he begged Yoda to remember their friendship as it was in the past, and not how it had become.
Navi was later arrested for his part in the events that went down and Moje was placed on a wanted list.
Meaning that Thustra had successfully been taken over by the Republic and the loss sent a huge blow to the fragile galactic government.
