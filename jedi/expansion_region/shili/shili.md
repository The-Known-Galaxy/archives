# Introduction

Properties and appearance:
Shili is a standard terrestrial planet, supporting unique life and located within the Expansion regions of space.
Its appearance resembles many terrestrial planets with vast plains and grasslands, mountainous terrain, rainforests, and seas.
The planet itself could support most oxygen-based life due to its type I oxygen mixed breathable atmosphere.

Its most notable and outstanding property is its vast grasslands, with turu-grass sporting a deeper red/orange colour, juxtaposing the common green found on other planets.
This colouration resulted in many of the planet’s fauna to develop a red / orange camouflage, such as the feared Akul and the planet’s native species - the Togruta.

Inhabitants and Culture:
Shili served as the homeworld to the famous Togruta species, with notable individuals including Ahsoka Tano and Shaak Ti of the Jedi Order, as well as other Togruta who remained outside of the Order.
Such individuals like Sheel Mafeen - a female Togruta poetess hailing from Shili but residing on Coruscant during the Galactic Empire’s infancy.
The planet was a member of the Galactic Republic since its infancy, thus force-sensitive individuals could be seen commonly being accepted into the Order.
The Togruta’s presence was all over the planet’s surface itself, erecting cities and structures along grasslands and forest valleys, the most prominent being Shili’s Capital - Corvala.

# Section 2

Togruta culture on Shili’s surface could appear barbaric and savage-like to most observing them, however the Togruta have an immense respect for life and were also very sentient and sophisticated at times.
Shili inhabited many dangerous, predatory species, thus they were required to work in large groups of other Togruta to survive.
The most notable predator found on Shili was a large carnivorous quadruped creature dubbed the Akul.
They had extremely large teeth and powerful claws, enough to overwhelm any humanoid lifeform.
It is because of this challenge that the Akul’s teeth were prized possessions of the Togruta species.
Individuals who were able to single-handedly defeat an Akul would wear their teeth as jewelry and headdress, showing their higher status and skill as a result.
