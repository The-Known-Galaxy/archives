# Introduction
Thisspias was a planet that served as a homeworld for a species known as Thisspiasians.
This planet had a mountainous terrain with a good number of large seas and lakes scattered around the planet.
Unlike what could be seen on most worlds, Thisspias’s natural water could often be found not only as extremely blue but as pink as well.
Many types of tiny creatures could also be found roaming on this planet.
During the Clone Wars, Thisspias never decided on supporting the Galactic Republic or the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
Not long after the war, the planet was bombarded and its people became slaves of the newly appointed Empire.
Any resistance from Thisspiasians barely made any impact due to the Imperial forces having advanced military technology in their use.
