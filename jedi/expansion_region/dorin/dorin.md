# Introduction

Dorin was the homeworld of Kel Dors.
This planet had a unique atmosphere, which made breathing impossible for almost all species without some type of breathing device.
Since Dorin's atmosphere had little amounts of oxygen on the planet, the Kel Dors had to wear special types of masks called "Antiox respirators," which were used to help them breathe off-world.
Dorin also stood between two black holes which made transportation to the planet's surface limited and difficult.
Life on this planet could often be found troublesome since the weather was very unpredictable and changed often.
Many structures on the surface had to be heavily reinforced so that they could withstand these dangerous storms.
Most buildings and homes were open for any Kel Dors to be safe from storms.
