# Introduction
Yinchorr is a terrestrial planet orbiting one sun under the Yinchorri system, located in the Expansion Region by the Fellwe sector, containing rocky deserts and small seas with 1% surface water.
Native species of the planet consist of the Yinchorri, a sentient turtle-like species with green skin and immune to telepathic Force abilities.
Notable locations include the Imperial Base, Imperial Royal Academy, the Squall, and the city “Tol-Kachorn”.

# Section 1
The planet is the homeworld of the reptilian species called the Yinchorri.
The species would slowly form rival city-states.
Over time, Tol-Kachorn would emerge as the strongest city-state.
By 500 BBY, Yinchorr was discovered by the Galactic Republic; however, the planet was deemed unimportant due to its insufficient development and lack of resources.
By 33 BBY, the Yinchorri would join the Galactic Senate.
By 3 ABY, most of its population had been wiped out by the Galactic Empire and would soon be the center of Imperial Royal Guard Academy.
After the collapse of the Galactic Empire, the Yinchorri would rebuild their society; however, they avoided galactic politics.
