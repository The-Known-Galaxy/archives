# Introduction

A Desert planet known as Escabar could be found in the Expansion Region inside the Escabar System.
Due to extremely warm temperatures and lack of resources, Escabar had barely any population.
Living conditions on this planet were harsh and unforgiving, however, scavenger species known as Borcatu could be found roaming on the planet's surface.
These species were known to be easily annoyed and aggressive.
At some point, some interstellar spaceports made their way on Escabar and were opened for public use.
While traders continued to arrive and depart, a good number of borcatu kept climbing inside the departing trade ships unnoticed.
These creatures managed to spread across the galaxy by using the same method, however, they were eventually tracked back to their homeworld.
Spaceports on Escabar increase their security to prevent these creatures from getting aboard any more trade ships.
At some point, Escabar was part of the New Republic.
