# Introduction
Valgauth was a terrestrial planet located in the Expansion Region.
The planet was a desolate wasteland that lost its resources due to it being a manufacturing center and was later used as an area to dump garbage and broken equipment.
Droids were the only inhabitants on the planet and were tasked to carry out duties and maintenances.
The constant rain on the planet created a corrosive vapor — created from the moisture in the planet’s atmosphere that condenses and falls back onto the surface — that caused the sensor scans to encounter difficulties in detecting anything.
Vehicles were needed to be steam-sterilized otherwise they would experience malfunctions.
After the Galactic Civil War, an entrepreneur of the Trigdale Metallurgy company, Saujutta-Ok-Topii, bought the planet for Syndicate One and built its headquarters.
The company hid the planet by reassigning it as a moon in the star charts.
