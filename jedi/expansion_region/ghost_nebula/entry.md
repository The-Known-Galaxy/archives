# Introduction

The Ghost Nebula is both a nebula and a sector within the Slice section of the Expansion Region.
The nebula had a size and density great enough to block out light from stars around and within it.
Thus causing it to be isolated from the rest of the galaxy and where the nebula got its name from.
Ultraviolet radiation from the stars within the nebula caused the nearby gasses to create plasma.
This plasma bathed all the planets within its reach with colorful ultraviolet light.

Some of the surrounding planets included Umbara and Atoa, which are the homeworlds of the Umbaran and Atoan people.
During the Clone Wars, the nebula was a crucial supply route.
The Galactic Republic fought against the Umbaran militia for control of their homeworld.
Not long after the creation of the Galactic Empire, the Atoan system was overrun.
This happened after a failed rebellion was led by Garoche Tarkin and fellow insurgents.
