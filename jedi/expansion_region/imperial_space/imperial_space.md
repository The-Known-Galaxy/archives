# Introduction
The Imperial Space was a region located in the Expansion Regions of the galaxy, which also covers the Outer Rim and Mid Rim regions.
Its position on the galaxy’s star map could be easily recognised after finding one of the most important hyperspace travel routes of the area — the Corellian Trade Spine and the Hydian Way.
The Western Reaches area lies in between these two, while the Imperial Space consists of the worlds that have been under the control of the Galactic Empire, and many of its successor organisations, such as Thrawn’s Empire.

# Section 1
Thanks to being situated between the galaxy’s Core Worlds and the poorer but richer, undiscovered resources Outer Rim, this region would quickly be developed, with worlds such as Sullust, Mustafar, Tibrin, or Eriadu serving as potential resource banks.
Many planets that would be a part of the Imperial Space benefited from the two already mentioned and hyperspace lanes which would serve as an important transportation route during the Galactic Empire’s reign.



# Section 2
The history of the Imperial Space begins, along with the pacification of the remains of the Confederacy of Independent System after the Jedi Purge, a considered ending of the Clone Wars.
The famous Western Reaches Operation was launched by mastermind Imperial tacticians, such as Wilhuff Tarkin, Terrinald Screed, and Hurst Romodi, to draw out and finally destroy the Separatist forces.
During the fights, these Imperial commanders had to face not only their droid enemies but as well as many independent pirate gangs which spread across the galaxy.
After this campaign had ended, many worlds such as Mustafar, Tosste, and Sullust were dominated and utilised by the Empire- the best example of this process is Darth Vader’s private stronghold on Mustafar, built on the foundations of old mines and buildings.
After the Battle of Jakku, the Imperial Fleet was separated and controlled by many Imperial Moffs, each of them having their private region of domination.
After the return of Emperor Palpatine, the Imperial Space would be a membership region of many organisations, but none of them would ever be as impactful to this region as the first Galactic Empire founded in the year 19 BBY.
