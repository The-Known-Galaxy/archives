# Introduction

Zaloriis was an expansion region planet that was colonized by the citizens of Fondor.
Around the time of 0 ABY, it was home to Camp Culroon, a research base for the Galactic Empire.
Within the same year the people of Zaloriis tried to join the Rebel Alliance, but Darth Vader did not foresee that happening so he sent a strike force to recapture the planet.

Section One:
There were high winds that prevented a significant amount of life from being sustained on the planet, but there was a place known as the Fantain Mountains.
Which had boulders that were big enough to protect and inhabit some life forms such as Zalorian rock lions.
The natives who did live there respected the open desert and kept themselves as far away from them as possible.

Section Two:
The Imperials soon noticed the value of the Zalorianâ€™s fear of the desert.
With that knowledge, they established a research base within the desert.
This base was run by Colonel Maximilian Veers, who was in charge of an AT-AT program on the planet.
Their vehicles often brewed legends and tales about what may have been lurking within the desert.
Before the battle of Hoth, the operation was governed by Minister Transe Decar.
Not long after the people of the planet requested independence, but Vader had other ideas, so he used Force Choke to kill the Minister.
After Veers was freed from the clutches of the Zalorian Separatists, Vader used the very protocol droid that he had made against him.
Vader then proceeded to send an attack using the AT-ATs towards Zaloriis City, wiping out the Rebel Alliance base residing on the planet.
