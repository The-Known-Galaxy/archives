# Introduction
A barren desert planet in the expansion region, Rhommamool was inherently hostile to life.
It contained little to no water, was prone to scorching temperatures, and had very little native flora species.
However, the planet was rich in valuable minerals, which would be mined and transported by the planet's neighbour, Osarian.
The planet was also located along the Corellian Run, a central hyperspace lane.

# Section 1
Little is known about the Rhommamoolians, which are the planet’s native species.
We do know however that they were extremely hostile towards the Osarians as they had invaded and exploited their planet.
Most of the planet's population would consist of criminals and other mixed races that had been dumped on the desert planet by the Osarians.



# Section 2
The planet was “colonised” by the Osarians early in galactic history, who brought Criminals as servant labour for mining purposes.
Profits from these mines would go on to sustain the lifestyle of wealthy upper-class Osarians.


A major battle was fought on the planet of Rhommamool between the Jedi and Sith during the Jedi Civil War.
The Sith were advancing down the Corellian Run and were only stopped by a Jedi Task Force located at Rhommamool.

Sometime before 25 ABY, a Yuuzhan Vong Officer was sent to the planet to create dissent between the poorer Rhommamoolians and the Osarians/New Republic.
He succeeded, amassing a cult of followers known as the Red Knights of Life.
In 25 ABY, the Red Knights of Life lead an uprising against the Osarian government.
They took over the capital city of Redhaven, launching numerous planetary missiles at the Osarians themselves.
This act resulted in the deaths of millions.
