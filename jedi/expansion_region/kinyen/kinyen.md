# Introduction

Kinyen was a planet that could be found on the Corellian Trade Spine; it served as a homeworld for its native species, Gran.
This world was one of the most beautiful and safest known planets in the Galaxy.
Kinyen’s terrain mostly consisted of large grass fields, forests and mountains.
Barely any natural predators could be found on this planet, offering the Gran to live on a peaceful planet with very little chance of being attacked by the wildlife.
The Gran often focused on building their homes close to each other so that they were never too far from their relatives due to a strong bond to their home and family.
During a crisis, Gran tried to remain peaceful to avoid any conflict on Kinyen.
However, during the Imperial era, one of the Kinyen’s cities was destroyed by the Empire after the Gran declined their request to allow them access to their whole planet.
This violent act caused some Gran to secretly aid the Rebel Alliance in peaceful ways, such as providing some food from time to time.
