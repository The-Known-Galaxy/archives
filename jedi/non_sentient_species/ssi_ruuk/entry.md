# Introduction

The Ssi-Ruuk were a saurian species first discovered in 4 ABY when they, along with their slave race the P’w’eck, invaded the planet of Bakura.
This species lived in the Unknown Regions in the Ssi-ruuk Star Cluster on the planet Lwekk and were distinguishable from other species from this planet due to their long tails and height, which was at around 2 meters.
The average Ssi-Ruuk lived for 100-120 years and were extremely xenophobic, however, they rarely left the Ssi-Ruuk Star Cluster due to their religious beliefs against dying on non-sacred grounds.

The Ssi-Ruuk walked on two strong back legs with their long tail as a supporting mechanism to help their bipedal stance, with two arms supporting three long claws which could be used to rip open their enemies or each other and long teeth which could be equally as dangerous.
For their size, the Ssi-Ruuk were surprisingly strong and fast, with the average adult rivaling a Wookie in strength.
The Ssi-Ruuk did not rely on their eyes to spot their prey, but instead they used their keen sense of smell to track and locate their opponents from surprisingly long distances.
