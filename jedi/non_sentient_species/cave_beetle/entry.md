# Introduction

The cave beetles are a non-sentient species that inhabit the planet of Tatooine.
These insects possessed six legs that increased their mobility.
Jabba Desilijic Tiure, widely known as Jabba the Hutt, considered these beetles as a delicacy.
Porcellus, a cook, used the cave beetles’ carcasses to make beetle broth for Jabba.

Another kind of beetle is also used to make beetle broth—it is known as the rock beetle.
The rock beetle shares the same description as the cave beetle and is also considered a delicacy.
They are often seen at the Rock Beetle Refuge.
During the Galactic Civil War, Porcelluse hired a spacer to hunt and gather several rock beetles.
