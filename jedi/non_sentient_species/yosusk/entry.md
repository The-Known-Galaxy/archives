# Introduction

Yosusks are creatures native to the planet Dromund Kaas.
They are beasts with rocky protrusions on their backs, as their long arms were used to exhume their prey from underground.
Yosusks usually rely on their sense of smell in the darkness, and they were really strong.
When the first Sith arrived on Dromund Kaas, the Yosusks were named “Rock Wardens”.

They were first recorded when the Sith arrived on Dromund Kaas.
At the time of the Cold War, they were a dominant species in the Kaas  jungles.
Mysteriously, the Yosusks started behaving violently, turning wild and attacking personnel; but in due time, they were contained back again safely.
In summary, they were still predominant by the time of the Cold War.
