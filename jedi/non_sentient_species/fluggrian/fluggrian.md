# Introduction

Fluggrians were natives of the planet of Ploo IV.
The surface of the planet was mainly covered with oceans, marshlands, and floating cities that were connected by tubes that would go under the surface level.
Beings were easily able to spot a Fluggrian by its distinct green skin color along with its forehead that looked like a deflated ball.

# Section 1

Upon the Fluggrians discovery of space travel, they stumbled upon a species in their system on a planet named Ploo II.
The species living on that planet were known as the Glymphids.
The Fluggrians and Glymphids would constantly be at war with each other.

On the Fluggrianâ€™s body, they would have purple-like dots.
These purple dots were sensory inputs that formed as purple spikes, the spikes would allow Fluggrians to process information at a high rate.
In addition, Fluggrians have gill-like neckbands that would allow them to breathe oxygen easily.
