# Introduction
Borgle bat is a relatively large flying animal, related heavily to other bat-like creatures due to its webbed hands used for flight.
It’s mouth is a downward-curved beak, however it has teeth and the bottom teeth, specifically, curl upwards outside of the beak.
Covering its face are several eyespots which are presumed to be used for disorientating prey as to where it is looking.
Two large antennas protrude from the back of its head, these have webbing going down from the tip of the antenna to half-way down its spine.
It has two legs, from the ankle to the back of the knee is webbing used for quick turning mid-flight.
Oddly enough, it has no feet on its legs, ending on round stubs of flesh.
The borgle bat is carnivorous, specializing in capturing live prey, taking prey back to its home and slowly drinking the blood from live prey.
Despite being non-sentient, they are smart enough to utilize bones from eaten prey and stack said bones into large towers around its nest for some purpose.
