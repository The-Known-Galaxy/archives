# Introduction
Jabba’s Rancor was a birthday present from one of his henchmen.
The beast was kept underneath a trapdoor in his palace.
His palace was located on the Dune Sea of Tatooine.
Jabba found amusement in dropping people into the pit and watching them get eaten.
The Rancor was transported from the Tarsunt system.
On the Rancor’s way to a merchant named Grendu, killing the crew of the ship.
The ship ended up crashing on Tatooine.
A group of Jawas discovered the beast and immediately alerted Jabba’s servants, Bib Fortuna and BidloKwerve.
The two gave the Rancor as a gift to Jabba for his birthday.
Bib was rewarded with a promotion to Jabba’s majordomo, while Kwerve was made one of the Rancor’s many victims.

Jabba would use his Rancor frequently.
Jabba would end up dropping Twi’lek dancers who resisted him.
Jabba’s Tusken battle talisman ended up falling in there too, meeting the same fate as many others.
Jabba later used it against Luke Skywalker, and accidentally one of his guards.
The Rancor easily ate his guard, but Skywalker was able to stand a chance.
Luke placed a large femur in its mouth, distracting it and letting him go.
The Rancor attempted to get its grip back on Luke, yet out of self defense the young Jedi Knight smashed its hand in a rock.
Luke then lured it under a heavy portcullis and threw a skull belonging to the beast’s first victim smashing the controls for a gate.
In response, the gate pierced the beast, killing it.
Later on Luke would say that although he killed the beast in self defense, he killed it because the Rancor was so abused that it was impossible to redeem it.
