# Introduction
The storm beast was a large part-humanoid species.
It was deformed and corrupted by the dark side of the Force.
This beast lived on Malachor V and possessed several abilities.
These abilities included being able to emit a shockwave of destructive energy and wield enhanced strength.
The beasts stood at 2 meters tall and were covered in green, scaly skin.
They seemed to resemble prehistoric dinosaurs.

# Section 1
In the aftermath of the Jedi Civil War there was little life left on the planet of Malachor V.
The only beings that had lived on the surface were storm beasts and remnants of Trayus Academy.
Due to the lack of inhabitants, the storm beasts were naturally at the top of the food chain.
However, following the second activation of the Mass Shadow Generator, much of the planet Malachor V was destroyed causing most if not all the beasts to die in the process.
