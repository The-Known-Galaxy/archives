# Introduction

One was able to recognize these species from their wide mouths and sharp teeth, not to mention their long furless tail and blazing red eyes.
Nexu preferred to move alone through the woods most of the time, giving them upper hand against their prey.
They could easily approach unseen and almost unheard before launching themselves towards their target with their razor sharp claws.
Due to their fast predatory nature, nexu were often used in Gladiator matches.
It was said that, as long as something was smaller compared to them, Nexu were willing to attack.
These dangerous felines were originally native to planet Cholganna, but were also later found on planets such as Saleucami and Zhanox.
