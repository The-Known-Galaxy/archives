# Introduction

Loth-Cats are a non-sentient species that reside within the grasslands of the planet Lothal of the Outer-Rim.
These feline creatures are carnivores and have a diet that mainly consists of Loth-Rats, which they’re able to hunt with their sharp claws and huge mouth.
Loth-Cats are also part of the subspecies of the Tookas, a feline group of specimens that span across the galaxy though are most commonly found within Coruscant.
Loth-Cats can be easily identified through their definite characteristics of pointed ears and thick tail and can range between the colours of dark yellow, brown or white.

Although these felines can appear to be friendly and cutesy, they can be tenacious hunters and are extremely dedicated to their prey.
Should they be intervened by anyone who showed hostility to them, Loth-Cats would do their utmost best to fend off their assailant.
Considering their nature of living a ‘lone wolf’ lifestyle and hunting for food for a living, it can be quite the challenge to tame them, albeit not impossible.
If one were to overcome the difficulties that come with taming these species, they can serve as great companions.
A prime example of such an occasion would be when Ezra Bridger managed to successfully escape from getting caught by Imperials with the help of a Loth-Cat causing a distraction to an Imperial probe droid.
