# Introduction
Gornts, their homeworld is planet Hetar.
In wild nature species grow up to 1 meter, 4 limbs which act as legs, 2 back limbs are bigger than front limbs, usually their color is dark-green (swamp color) or light-brown.
Those creatures are known in Republic's and Imperial army, in both factions their meat was added.
Before the Clone Wars, the military loved gornts' meat, because it was tasty, their meat was tender meat and it gave you energy and protein.
Their meat juice was known to be a bit sweet and sour, oftenly could be served as canned food, or added in soup.
Gornts were useful not only because of their taste and good amount of vitamins and protein, but as well gornts grew up quickly (took about 1-2 years), they were big and could be grown almost everywhere.
Raising gornts in captivity was a bold and profitable venture, however in imperial times, imperial stormtrooper corps used to force farmers to give them their meat.
In the Empire gornts were even more popular, because clones had to eat more meat due to their lifetime.
Gornts’ meat is popular, as is blue milk which came from Tatooine.
