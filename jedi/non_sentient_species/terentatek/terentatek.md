# Introduction
The Terentatek were large creatures covered by spines, they are similar to Rancors but smaller than them.
Their heads are crowned by a number of long spikes and they have small eyes.
Their upper limbs ended in three clawed digits.
They also had massive claws, almost four to a hand.
The tusks and claws of this creature were highly venomous.
The Terentatek was also known to eat Force-sensitive users.

# Section 1
The first prototype of what would become the fearsome Terentateks was first seen on Tython, a Je’daii Master called Quan-Jang trying to craft a creature able to sense explosives during the Despot War,  the Terenta is alchemically created.
Some sources reported that the modern version of the Terentatek evolved on Korriban, where the dark side of the Force gradually destroyed their shapes and corrupted their minds.
 The Sith Lord Exar Kun was also reported to have made experiments for creating Terentatek through Sith alchemy.
The Terentatek was so powerful and dangerous to the Jedi  that they were often called Jedi Killers, Exar Kun used the Terentateks to destroy Jedi outposts on different planets.



# Section 2
During an event known as the Great Hunt, numerous Jedi traveled across the galaxy and tried to exterminate the Terentateks.
Jedi were often sent in groups of two or three to battle these beasts, this Jedi was mainly chosen by their weaponry skills due to the almost complete Force immunity of the Terentateks.
 None of the hunts organized by the Jedi were completely successful.
However the Jedi seemingly exterminated a majority of the Terentateks, the rest of the existent beasts would be in hibernation until  the Dark Side became bigger in the galaxy and repopulated this one.
Such events included the rise to power of Revan, Malak and the Emperor Palpatine.
