# Introduction

Starweirds were incorporeal anthropoids that resided in the void of space, having no known homeworld.
Starweirds were extremely skeletal and lanky creatures that possessed lengthy claws and white hair that floated around their skull, even when gravity was present.
Starweirds had very pale skin, which was covered by rags that hung down from their arms.
The Starweird’s face was described as being rough and dry, with a mouth of jagged teeth, and glowing eyes.
However, a mystery surrounding theStarweird is that to many witnesses, the Starweird’s face had a high resemblance of their own.
Because Starweirds didn’t consist of matter, that made them resistant to common attacks such as gunshots and lightsaber strikes,  meaning the only way to affect them was by using the Force.
This means a non-Force user who comes into contact with a Starweird will likely perish.
However, force fields will deter them, so carrying them with you whilst travelling in deep space is important.

# Section 1

Despite having legs, Starweirds would always hover, even when above solid ground.
They moved at a speed a little faster than humans usually moved.
Starweirds were believed to be quite an intelligent species, however, they were not known to speak or communicate in any way.
In extreme darkness, Starweirds could see up to around 20 meters, however they were color-blind in those conditions.
Starweirds would always prioritize attacks on Force wielders because of their hatred for them, despite being able to wield the force themselves.
Starweirds will always choose one target and focus on them, even with others around.
Starweirds could use Force abilities such as Force Grip, Drain Energy, Force Sight and on rare occasions Force Lightning!

# Section 2

Starweirds generally appeared around broken-down ships, targeting the spacers that were doing the repairs.
Once the Starweird had been discovered by its target, it would then become enraged and release an extremely loud and high-pitched telepathic shriek that was effective to creatures within a 20 meter radius, and could be heard even through the vacuum of space.
The Starweird’s shriek often caused anything that heard it to flee, with the exception of  few people, who were able to withstand their scream.
The Starweirds then advanced on their target, using their long talons to rip into their skin, decimating their victim.

# Section 3

Because Starweirds were found only in the deepest parts of space, little was known about them.
The Jedi labelled them as a mysterious species that were thought to be physical manifestations of the dark side of the Force, however these assumptions were never proven, due to insufficient evidence.
The Starweird Queen was the most well known Starweird, having attacked many Jedi Council members during the first war between the Galactic Republic and reconstituted Sith Empire.
However, she was eventually defeated by Jedi Master Wyellett after the Jedi went to save his padawan Xerender, defeating the Starweird Queen in the process.
Despite this.
Jedi Master Wyellett was captured by Imperial forces, and was believed dead for many years, until found by his padawan at a shipwreck on Hoth.
