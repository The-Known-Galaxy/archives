# Introduction
Frigosians was a species that was native to the planet Tansyl 5.
Although little is known of the planet’s surface, the atmosphere of the planet is far different than other planets, therefore the Frigosian had to wear breathing masks.
These breathing masks would go around their noses.

# Section 1
Frigosians were distinguishable by their yellowish-orange hair and their circle-like head.
Their mouths had dagger-like teeth, and they had very sensitive eyes.
As a result of their eyes, they wore heavy black goggles to protect them from the light.
The main reason they had such sensitive eyes is because they were a nocturnal species.



# Section 2
The Frigosains only had to wear these goggles in environments that contained light in which the Frigosains were sensitive to.
The Frigosians also developed a language of their own.
Their language mainly sounded like a series of chirps.
