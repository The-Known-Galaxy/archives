# Introduction
The Bordok within the species classification can be further divided into the equine branch of species.
This four-legged creature came from the rich forests of Endor whereas that roamed plentifully.


They could be mounted and used as effective transportation to traverse long distances, and were sturdy if baggage was added to their carriage.
Ewoks used this to great success.

These creatures ranged in colour across many shades of brown, and were nearly identical to horses.
They however differed with the horns on their head that curved and twisted depending on the gender and age of the Bordok in question.

# Section 1
Bordoks through evolution broke up into (2) species, a lesser variation which grew to (1.5) meters whilst a noticeably rarer breed grew to (3) meters or more.
This naturally created hierarchies in their society whereas the bigger Bordoks ruled over the packs that they roamed in.

The Bordoks, despite being non-sentient, were very intelligent and reacted appropriately to various situations.
At night, they were more reactive to predators due to having less visibility but during the day they only used energy where necessary.

The Bordoks looked after and ‘respected’ their riders well, and had an inherent protective tendency towards their young.
The extent of this was so great and noble that often male Bordoks would sacrifice themselves to protect their young from predators.

Princess Kneesaa, a Jari Knitaka was actually recorded as having adopted a Bordok and named it Baga.
Furthermore, toy Bordoks are sold as merchandise in many parts of the galaxy due to their loving nature and appearance.
