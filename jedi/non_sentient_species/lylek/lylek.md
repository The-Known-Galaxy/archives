# Introduction
Lyleks were a large, insect-like species that were native to the planet Ryloth.
They lived in the forests of Ryloth, and had large nests underground.
The Lyleks had many pincers they used for hunting, as well their spiked body that could reflect blaster bolts.
They were one of, if not the most dangerous predators on Ryloth, as they moved in packs and searched for days in order to get food.
The Lyleks communicated with each other through hissing and chittering.
The only way to injure a Lylek was a good shot aimed to the head.

# Section 1
When Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader were temporarily on Ryloth due to their Star Destroyer being shot down, they were ambushed by many hundreds of Lylek that were quickly slaughtered by the Sith Lords.
Soon the two would go into the main hive of the Lylek, where they killed many Lylek including the queen, and proceeded to kill the survivors.
