# Introduction

Boar-wolves, also known as “borras” were a non-sentient species living on Endor.
A borra was normally three meters in height and they had a distinct bristled back.
Borras had extremely thick hair, two tusks, and humped backs.
They were called “boar-wolf” because they looked like a cross between a boar and a wolf.

# Section 1

Boar-wolves were killed by Ewoks for food.
Ewoks were a sentient species also native to Endor.
It was rare for an Ewok to find, kill, and successfully bring back the borras.
They were extremely tough and aggressive and the Ewoks who did were considered to be lucky.
Ewoks even used the material from borra teeth to craft knives, and used them to hunt.
Although boar-wolves were known to be dangerous, they were domesticated by the gorra species which would care for them after their mothers have died.
