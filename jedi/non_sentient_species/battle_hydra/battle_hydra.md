# Introduction

Battle hydras were legendary creatures who settled into the ecosystem of Yavin 4, who were also rumored to grow four heads every time one was cut off.
They were sinuous reptiles with huge leathery wings, usually known for having two heads.
They also held a pair of yellow slitted eyes, along with a long whip-like tail that held a poisonous stinger at the very end.
Their skin was infused with a sith alloy, allowing them to withstand attacks from a lightsaber.
As a contrast to their appearance, these creatures were known to be shy and mindless, and spent most time in hiding.
They tend to travel and hunt alone, rather than travelling in packs.
For most of their existence, they spent time searching for prey, using the thermal sense they get from their vision that they mainly use when scanning for threats.

When catching their prey, the hydra would dive down in swoops, like the condor dragon, and use their multiple jaws coated with razor-sharp teeth to bite into their prey, along with using their claws and the stingers on their tails to poison their victims.
Once the prey succumbed, or died from the poison, the hydra took the corpse back to its lair.
Battle hydras were also known for being influenceable to commands from Force-sensitive dark side users, and using them for diversions or for battles.
The beasts were not known for being hostile towards other individuals unless spurned by the will of a Dark Jedi, even being used by Sith Lords as their close and personal bodyguards.

# Section 2

Battle hydras, before becoming docile, were originally creatures created by the great Sith Lord known as Exar Kun, using Sith alchemy that he studied from the deep depths of Yavin 4.
His original intention for their creation was to be fierce guardians to test his theories.
Due to Exar’s death in the Great Sith War, the battle hydras all split off and retreated into the deep caverns of Yavin 4, becoming not only native creatures regressing to normal predatory behavior, but rare sights to everyone on the planet.
The beasts only emerged from their caves to hunt, mainly spending most of their time prowling the steamy skies of the planet.

# Section 3

For a millennia, battle hydras became forgotten and unheard of, until the early days of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum.
In this time, Exar used the dark shade of his spirit to summon battle hydras to attack Luke Skywalker.
Close to being able to succeed, Luke was able to fend off against the beasts using his lightsaber, until the variant was discovered by Luke’s students.
After this event, the New Jedi Order rarely encountered the beasts.
Without any will to control them, the beasts were known for avoiding sentient-beings and spending most their time in hiding.
