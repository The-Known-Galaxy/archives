# Introduction

Gossans were a small saurian species native to the planet Casell in the colonies region of the Galaxy.
Averaging over slightly 1 meter in height they were quite wrinkly and they had very shriveled heads and thin necks.
Physical appearances were considered important on the planet of Gossams, for they needed to know who was female and male.
Females often had their hair slicked back from their head.
They were bipeds, balancing their frail body on quite small feet.
They also had quite long three fingered hands.
Their lifespan would average around 75 years, which is very short compared to other species.

Known for their shrewd and cunning nature, they served the Commercial Guide, which was headed by the Gossam Shu Mai.
They had found out that they had to work for the Commercial Guide around the Separarist Crisis and Clone Wars time.
Due to their amazing intelligence they were found quite easily around the galaxy, acting like legitimate merchants or sneaky smugglers and law breakers.
However, some Gossams were Force Sensitive but  Force using Gossams just like any other Force using species were extremely rare and are hard to find anywhere you go.
They were roughly 1.25 meters tall on an estimate which is extremely small to the average species and humans.
