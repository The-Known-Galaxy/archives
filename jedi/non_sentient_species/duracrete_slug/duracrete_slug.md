# Introduction
The duracrete slug was found in the underworld of planet “Coruscant”.
The duracrete slug were also called “duraslugs'' and were a non-sentient species.
The duraslugs ate the stone called “duracrete '' and once they had secreted it from their body, it became a part of their shell.
The duracrete slug used it’s tentacles around its mouth to feel its surroundings and these tentacles could grow up to 10 meters in length.

# Section 1
As the duraslug grew older, its eyesight got worse and worse overtime, causing them to become blind.
The duraslugs also used their two power mandibles to consume the duracrete in large quantities.
The armor around these creatures were a tan color and their eyes looked like two small black pebbles.
As an adult, the duraslugs averaged about three to five meters in length, the largest duraslug was ten meters long.



# Section 2
Duraslugs liked to burrow inside of buildings and could cause permanent damage within just a few weeks.
Because of this, the exterminators in Coruscant were constantly trying to eradicate these creatures, and keep them under control.
 In 90 BBY, the initiate named “Sifo-Dyas” said that the duraslugs were trying to convince his friend Dooku to not antagonise their fellow initiate by the name of “Arath Tarrex” about his trip to to Serenno.
