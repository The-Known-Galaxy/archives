# Introduction

The dewback species are large four-legged reptiles that subsisted on an omnivorous diet.
These species are native and well suited to the deserts of Tatooine and so in turn were quickly domesticated.
Adult dewback had heights that reached as tall as 1.3 to 2.1 meters, 2 to 3 meters wide, and an average mass of 815 kilograms.
With these features and among others, the dewback had versatile and useful traits which in turn, made the dewback one of the most praised species on the planet.

# Section 1

Wild dewbacks roamed the vast deserts of Tatooine in packs of two to five and in single-file lines in search of food and water in the day.
At night though, dewbacks will herd together to retain heat and energy due to their cold-blooded nature and cold temperatures.
This action consequently may be the source of their name as dew will form on their backs at night which also acts as a source of water.
Dewbacks had various colored scales ranging from green, red, brown, and grey.
However rare blue dewbacks also existed.
These scales often had mottled scales or even camouflage patterns.
Another important evolutionary feature of the dewback is the dewback’s special melanins contained in a dewbacks hide.
Melanins act as a buffer from the heat from the two suns while also protecting vital fluids which allows them to go days without sources of water and substance.

# Section 2

Once a year, dewbacks will gather at their traditionally mating grounds called the Jundland Wastes.
This area is important to dewbacks and krayt dragons for a particular reason, the temperature of incubation for fertile eggs.
Dewback mating season occurs after the kryat dragon mating season to protect their own eggs.
Sometime after mating female dewbacks will dig their own holes and lay large amounts of eggs.
After this, the dewbacks will scatter once more into the desert and return a year later.
This breeding process is so instilled in the dewback that it is impossible to breed them another way.

# Section 3

Dewbacks are used as a primitive form of transportation and as the locals might say, “it is better than walking”.
These creatures were mostly employed by moisture farmers and security forces.
Notable companies were Imperial sand troopers and Alliance Special Forces as mounts and pack animals.
