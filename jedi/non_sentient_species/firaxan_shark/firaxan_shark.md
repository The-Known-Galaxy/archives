# Introduction
Inhabiting the planet Manaan are a group of non-sentient species known as the Firaxan Sharks.
They have an orange-white skin colour and live within the aquatic areas of Manaan.
It is considered dangerous to encounter these sharks as they are prone to attack anyone that dares to explore the seas and have the misfortune of encountering them.
Also known as Firaxa, it's likely plausible that they were descendants of the Progenitor- an enormous creature that once resided within the Hrakert Rift.
Another distant family member of the Firaxa are the Selkath, a sentient amphibian species that's believed to be part of the Progenitor’s lineage.
Thus, it correlates to the fact that although the Firaxa were known to be hostile, they were never prone to attack a Selkath.
The Firaxan Shark’s prominent weakness is their vulnerability to sonic pulses.
With this knowledge, adventurers that explored the sea would travel with sonic emitters to protect themselves if a Firaxan Shark were to attack.

# Section 1
In the past, scientists had been researching on creating a toxic repellent to provide better resistance against the Firaxan Sharks.
However, in the midst of a mining operation, the Progenitor went into a fit of rage upon finding out the scientists had invaded her territory and harvested her treasured kolto.
This made the Progenitor release a signal in distress.
Afterwards, the Firaxan Sharks and Selkath scientists that heard this signal proceeded to go insane.
The Firaxa proceeded to attack the scientists at Hrakert Station except those that were Selkath, whileas Selkath scientists assaulted other scientists and devoured them.
This piece of history further proves that the Progenitor, Selkath and Firaxan Sharks are interconnected to one another.
