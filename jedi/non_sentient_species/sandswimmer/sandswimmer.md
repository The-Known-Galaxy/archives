# Introduction

Found and feared on the planet of Tatooine, the carnivorous insectoid known as the Sandswimmer was widely considered one of the most fierce predators on the sandy planet’s surface.
Sporting an exoskeleton, this spider creature was able to retain moisture that most beasts would lose due to the intense sun.
As well as this, the Sandswimmer had long legs assorted with bright green-colored fins along its length, allowing the Sandswimmer to ‘glide’ just underneath the surface of the sand.
They did this to sneak up underneath their prey and attack from underneath when the time was right, using their sucker-like mouths to drain the life from their prey.

Typically, the only view people had of the creature were the crests on the ridge of its back that protrude subtly from the sand as well as its eyes.
However, the creature occasionally shows itself to the world above for more reasons than devouring fallen prey.
At times, they would breach the surface and flaunt their fins, flaring and making them wider to attract a mate.
Other times, they would simply come up to the surface to feast on Jawas, who were unfortunate enough to find themselves standing on top of one.
