# Introduction
The ball creatures of Duroon were spherical shaped creatures who were nocturnal and herbivores.
The skin and muscles of a typical ball creature were considered flexible, allowing forming and extruding limbs.
This allowed the creatures to bounce and spring, and even led to them being nicknamed “bouncebeasts.” Ball creatures had a high reproductive rate, and mainly lived and travelled in herds.
Upon discovering new areas, the ball creatures would multiply and split into different herds, and rove across the area to discover and explore new things, as well as make new homes.
This mainly happened during migratory periods.
Ball creatures also had an innate and great ability to sense dangers of all sorts, and because of this, ball creatures were captured and domesticated by contract slaves of Duroon, to act as guard animals.
Ball creatures were timid beasts but however, they would usually flee at the first sight or sign of any predator, and due to them not being smart, some predators used their timidity against them, and caused them to stampede over cliff sides and mountains.
Ball creatures even became popular pets within the Corporate Sector and even became a mascot for the grav-ball team known as the Bonadan Bouncebeasts, by 11 ABY.
