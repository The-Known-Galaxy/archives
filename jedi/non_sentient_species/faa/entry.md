# Introduction

The Faa, also known as Faynaa, were a fast moving non-sentient scalefish species that were native to the Mid Rim planet known as Naboo, and were well known to the Gungans.
Alongside with six other scalefish species, the Faa lived in the waters mainly around the city of Otoh Gunga, which was built beneath Lake Paonga.
They have also been known to be found in the Naboo Abyss, and were found often being preyed upon by the large Colo Claw fish, as well as the Opee Sea killers.
Most Faa scalefish were vicious predators, and often attacked anything on sight.
The typical Faa was known to have a narrow body that had well-stiff, armored skin, and usually ranged from different colors from orange to red.
They also had large tail fins that were usually colored with orange and white, which helps keep their swinging stabilized so they could move in columns with one another.
The species usually inhabited themselves in small crevices, usually being in underwater rocks, also allowing for decent hiding spots to catch their prey from.

Faa were usually only found in deep waters.
They were also very attracted to bright lights, thus leading them to hibernate around the underwater city of Otoh Gunga.
A school of Faa could consist of  thirty scalefish, which proved to be extremely dangerous to lonesome unwitting creatures.
The prey for Faa ranged from all kinds of different species, including Mee, Gorgs, Skettos, shiro-traps, and many more, mainly consisting of the species found living in deep waters, where the Faa usually dwelled in.
Lots of underwater Gungan explorers and hunters, have been known to have been attacked, and even killed by large schools of the hungry scalefish.
This happened usually when they were provoked, but has been known to happen unprovoked as well, due to their vicious behavior and attitudes.
Faa schools of scalefish were not fond of loud noises or bangs, and often dispersed and scattered upon hearing any of the sort, resulting in lots of Gungans to be able to escape.
