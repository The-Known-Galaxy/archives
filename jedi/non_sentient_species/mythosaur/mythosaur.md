# Introduction
Mythosaurs were purported to be equivalent to the size of a small city both in height and weight.
When properly putting this perspective, it’s abnormally large size is devastating in comparison to that of a human being.
These beasts roamed the world of Mandalore for many years before the first Mandalorians walked on it’s soil.
They dominated the hierarchy and fed on lesser species.

The first Mandalorian inhabitants called the Taung arrived under the leadership of a warrior known only in legends as “Mandalore the First”.
He began an epic-like crusade to slaughter the beasts and establish humanity at the top of the hierarchy on the planet.

These inhabitants, despite immense casualties, managed to conquer the beasts with just mere axes and swords.
These crusaders later used the skull of the slain beasts as the symbol of the Mand’alor and Mandalore itself, embedded across economical, and cultural contexts.

This record of events is often criticised by scholars doubting the truth of several tiny human beings with axes being able to kill these monoliths, though it is strictly believed in the culture of Mandalore.



# Section 2
The creatures themselves, other than being gigantic, had (4) large legs to carry it’s circular frame.
It had a chestplate-like sternum which acted as a defensive barrier that protected its heart.
Most notably, it’s facial features, which are imprinted on Mandalore banners, have two horns that protrude and circle around the beasts face toward it’s jaw.
The female and male’s differ slightly in this sense, and that is how they are differentiated.



# Section 3
The first human colonists arrived from Roon, the Mandalorians original homeworld.
They intended to conquer the horned beasts in 7000 BBY and claim Mandalore as their own.
After this successful campaign, the colonists called themselves Mando’ade creating their own language “Mando’a”.
Mando’ade means “Children of Mandalore”.

The Mythosaur, though physically extinct, continued to metaphorically exist in all aspects of Mandalorian culture.
Their bones were used to create mythosaur axes which were used in ceremonial gatherings, their sternum chest plates were used to create a ceremonial mask worn by the “Mand’alor”, their facial symbol was used as tattoos, business logos, and armour decorations.



# Section 4
Interestingly, near the end of the Galactic Republic a business-minded Mandalorian wanted to attract tourists to generate revenue.
He created a massive replica of a Mythosaur skeleton (though not completely to scale, if Mythosaurs were actually the size of cities) and was going to use it at a theme park he planned on creating.

However, the theme park never opened and the skeleton was solid to an Imperial garrison.
The beast ultimately, was an interesting species that did not survive the conquest of humans.
Another species driven to extinction, but has much history to be learned from.
