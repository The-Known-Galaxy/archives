# Introduction

Bormus are large herbivorous creatures that live on the planet Balmorra.
Bormus travel together in herds and are gentle and friendly towards civilians.
Although they are a very calm and peaceful species, Bormus are able to, when threatened, join together and defeat the attacker.
This peaceful species soon became endangered when Imperial forces bombarded the planet and its inhabitants during the Cold War.
The Bormu population went down a lot because of it.
As a result, they have been left vulnerable due to their low numbers and strength.
Only a few Bormu remain.
