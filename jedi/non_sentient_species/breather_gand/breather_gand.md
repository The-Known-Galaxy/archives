# Introduction
The Gand had a rare subspecies known as Breathers.
Breathers were long thought to be an older breed that would eventually either evolve, die out, or become another coexisting species on their homeplanet of Gand.
Breathers possessed lungs like most organisms along with the usual assortment of internal organs that many other humanoid species had as well.
However, this subspecies adapted by only being able to breathe ammonia, hence why they could not survive offworld without respiratory equipment that provides them with their needed gaseous elements.
Exposure to oxygen is similar to being burned from the inside out, with acid coating the lungs, and if it ever were to happen, it would require organ transplants.
If a Breather were exposed to oxygen, they may experience chest pain and various other symptoms from the respiratory system.
As a result of the many symptoms, many Gand that faced the endangerment of offworld exposure were unable to receive proper treatment, possibly due to the unavailability of items to repair the tissue.
Therefore, Breathers had a high mortality rate.
