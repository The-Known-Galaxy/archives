# Introduction

The Anoobas were an aggressive species native to the planets in the Outer-Rim Territories.
They usually travelled in packs, and had a pack leader which was the strongest.
Their habitat was that in the desert and they were quite common as domestic hunter dogs, specifically bounty hunters as seen as Emboâ€™s hound during the Clone Wars.
They had incredibly sharp claws and teeth, with one of the teeth jutting out to form a pike which was used to impale the opponent.
They were exceptionally deadly, and they could even go so far as to eliminate Jedi, as during the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Even Piell was slaughtered by two anoobas, barely being defeated by Padawan Ahsoka Tano.
They were perfect as a tamed hunter as they were both loyal yet incredibly hostile to their foes.
