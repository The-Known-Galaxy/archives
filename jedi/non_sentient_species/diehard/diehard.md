# Introduction
Diehard is a non-sentient species home to the world Atraken.
It’s a very aggressive insectoid that has ten legs and a chitin shell.
The shell made it impervious to blaster fire and other types of energy damage.
It was also immune to poison, radiation, and several viral species.
Due to the insect’s resilience, it survived it’s homeworld being poisoned during the Clone Wars, which earned its name to this date.
It uses its mandibles to attack prey and when it does attack, they attack in swarms.
Once attached to its prey, there were difficulties to detach them from it.
While it can be perceived to be the apex predator, they were in fact prey of another insect, Cidwen.
