# Introduction

Bloodsniffers are lizard-like predators that inhabit the world of Kamar, located in the Wild Space.
Named after their need for blood, they are known for ingesting it every so often due to their metabolism.
Their large consumption of blood provided all the nutrients that they need.
Competition among these species was necessary for their survival.

These predators are small and are known to be deadly since they possess a sharp long tongue for food.
Bloodsniffers often live in small groups and are usually found in mountainous regions.
They hunt their prey by tackling them and use their tongue to pierce their prey’s veins and suck the blood.

During the Imperial Era, a swoop gang — a group of thugs who were known for their swoop bikes and criminal activities — was named after these species called the “Bloodsniffers.” They control the Quence sector in the Outer Rim and are composed of a hundred riders.
