# Introduction
Tookas, also known as "Adoris Feline", were small, feline creatures that had been spread across the galaxy, having been domesticated as household pets, or simply admired in their feral state.
On many planets, including Coruscant, they were seen as pests and usually were hunted down by landlords.
They could often be found on the lower levels of Coruscant, lurking in the sewers and living on alleys.
Tookas were also taken aboard freighters due to their excellent capability of hunting any vermin that may have been causing damage on starships.
