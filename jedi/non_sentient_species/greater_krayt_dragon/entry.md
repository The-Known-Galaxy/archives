# Introduction

The Greater Krayt Dragon was the largest subspecies of Krayt Dragon who was more rare and bigger than the canyon krayt and relatives.
They could grow up to 100 metres or more, requiring ten legs to support their big bulk.
Despite their large size these creatures have been rarely seen due to preferring to spend long periods of time swimming within the sand of their homeworld Tatooine.
Their skin was a black colour instead of the yellow-brown to red that the canyon krayl had.
However, like their smaller cousins they too had pearls inside their gizzard called Krayt dragon pearls.
These pearls, being bigger in size, were deemed more valuable than the standard sized ones.
Their favourite prey were banthas though they loved to prey on sarlacs as a rare treat.
