# Introduction

Kaadu are non-sentient omnivores, also classified as Reptavians that can be found residing in the planets Naboo, Obredaan, and the moon of Rori.
They are of an average height of two point twenty-four meters and can be distinguished due to their billed-shape faces.
These creatures are versatile within the terrain of their home planet whether itâ€™d be on land or sea.
The Kaadu are capable of travelling through these terrains fast and efficiently.
Thus, they are very useful mounts for the Gungans to travel on.
On top of all that, they have perceptive olfactories which can be useful for finding sources of food.

However, being omnivores, their diet usually consists of snails and tlick weed, but are continuously preyed upon by the Zalaacas and Narglatches.
These Reptavians can be found in separate flocks corresponding to their genders up until the mating session.
Despite having recorded roughly three point four million of their kind, it is relatively common for many of their young to not survive due to being preyed upon by other predators as eggs along the fields and riverbanks.

Even though it may not seem like it, the Kaadu were courageous and trustworthy aids for Gungans on the battlefield and during daily duties of patrol.
These mounts were respected by their owner gungans well enough that they were adorned with titavian feathers.
Many stories were also told of how great a bond can grow between a gungan and their Kaadu aids.
It would be no exaggeration to say that a Kaadu and their owner Gungan were inseparable.
