# Introduction

Albeks are a reptilian non-sentient species that are scattered across many different worlds.
They are known to be aggressive, together with the ability to control the Force.
These predators are small, only less than a meter in length, and possessed four claws by their feet, and sharp spikes on their backs.
Albeks usually board and hide in starships that land by their territory.
Getting rid of these creatures was a challenge due to their hostility and ability to use the Force to pull limbs that are in reach.
