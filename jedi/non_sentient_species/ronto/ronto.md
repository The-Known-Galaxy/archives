# Introduction
The ronto is a long-necked beast of burden native to Tatooine.
Rontos are decently tall, at an average of 4.25 meters.
The body, on top of four legs, is about half the height of the neck.
Attached to its neck is a head with a long mouth ending in a beak.
On the sides of the ronto’s head there are two long, front-facing ears, there are actually two more ears above the eyes, but these ears are much smaller than the other two.

Despite the staggering height of the ronto, they are quick to become frightened by sudden movements or loud machinery, like the landspeeders around Mos Eisley.
Due to the ronto’s heavy weight and sturdy legs, they’re tamed and domesticated by the Jawas and used for heavy lifting.
Being 1675 kilograms, average, the ronto is slow moving and requires a great amount of water to stay hydrated.
Since rontos are native to a planet covered entirely in deserts, they are exceptional at shedding excess heat and managing energy effectively, despite their size and mass.
