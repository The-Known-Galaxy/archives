# Introduction

Condor Dragons were a species of flying reptavians that were native to the moon of Endor.
They had bony dorsal ridges with large fangs, as well as red wings with clawed legs.
Additionally, they have  yellow eyes, sharp vision and perch on the cliffs of Endor Moon.
Condor Dragons, also referred to as mantigrues, were predators and carnivores.
Flying in multiple swoops, they would launch themselves from high cliffs and trees at their prey.
They were known for capturing Ewoks, and all kinds of other species that lived on Endor’s moon, and bringing them alive to their eyries.
They were also known for scavenging, and stealing food and certain things from the homes of natives.
Condor Dragons have been known to be tameable and trained as well.
A Tulgha witch by the name of Morag, was known for enslaving a Condor Dragon as her pet, and sending it out to destroy the food sources, such as sunberry trees, which grew out sunberries that kept the Ewok’s nourished and healthy.
