# Introduction

Eopie were non-sentient, quadruped mammals herbivores native to Tatooine.
They usually measured at around 1.75 meters and had a lifespan of about 90 standard galactic years.
These tough creatures were acclimated to the deserts of Tatooine and were usually used as transports or beasts of burden.

SECTION TWO:
The Eopie were also found on other planets and bodies including Saleucami, Zardossa Stix (A moon) and the Jungles near the Black Spire Ruins on Batuu.
On other planets, Eopie were considered a delicacy and was served in some restaurants.
