# Introduction

The Progenitor was a massive female Firaxan shark that lived deep within the Hrakert Rift of Manaan.
Worshipped by the Selkath as a semi-deity, it was considered to be the ancestor of both the Firaxan shark and Selkath species.
Originally thought to be responsible for Kolto production on the planet of Manaan, modern scholars have determined the Progenitor actually grew to the large size it maintains through either feeding on kolto, or swimming around the star map located within the rift.

In later times, the Galactic Republic developed a resource outpost within the Hrakert Rift, in an effort to increase the output of kolto production.
Said actions quickly drove the Progenitor into a rage of exceeding proportions.
The Progenitor quickly rallied hundreds of Firaxan sharks and sent them to attack the station while it drove the Selkath inside the station into a mad blood rage.
Irrationally enraged, the Selkath on the station slaughtered the entirety of the republic forces on the station.
The station maintained a distress signal up until Revan, a Jedi at the time, arrived on the station, cutting his way through fanatical selkath.
Upon destroying the station, the Progenitor quickly grew calm and ceased hostilities.
Thus was told the history of the Progenitor, the ancient forefather of the primary speciesâ€™ of Manaan.
