# Introduction

Cave Jurgoran are non-sentient species that are subspecies of Jurgoran.
They live in dark environments, such as caves.
Cave Jurgoran have brown skin color and developed bioluminescent scales and a reflective hide to adapt to their environment, every creature has its glow pattern, almost undetectable to most, yet another Cave Jurgoran would instantly recognize another.
Like regular Jurgoran, these subspecies are native to the planet known as Dromund Kaas.

# Section 1

It is not known how these subspecies managed to migrate out of Dromund Kaas and get to the caves they were in, but it wasn’t all of the Jurgoran that went to the caves.
One somehow managed to reach the planet Tython, the ancient home of the Jedi.
It is currently unknown how it got there, the Jurgoran questionably lived in Vur Tepe, the Forge, during the Cold War, which occurred after 3653 BBY and ended at 3642 BBY, right after the war at 3643 BBY.
The Cave Jurgoran was awoken by a Jedi Padawan who saved their master from the Dark Jedi Bengel Morr.
That Jurgoran was slain by the Padawan.
Jurgoran is known as the “abandoned tools of war”, they are known as this because, during the cold war, they were used by the Sith to eliminate the Jedi.
Jurgoran became the vicious image of the Sith who came to Dromund Kaas and multiple Sith took the name “Lord Jurgoran” throughout the Empire’s history.
The Jurgoran is known as “the abandoned tools of war” because, after the Cold War, Sith and others found no use for them and left them where they were.
