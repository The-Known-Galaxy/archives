# Introduction

Evarrians were large predators of insecticide, who lived on the planet of Jagomir.
They resided in nests reigned over by a queen, who was protected by 4 Evarrian Hunters inside their nest.
Each year, the Evarrian Queen spawned between four to six new eggs.
After 2 to 3 months, the eggs would hatch into larvae and join the rest of the nest.
Larvae Evarrians became more susceptible to threats until their carapace was mature, but their venom was also more concentrated until their clutches were completely hardened as a defense.
When completely cultivated, Evarrian Hunters could reach up to 4 meters long, while the Evarrian Queen could had a standard length of 7 meters.

# Section 1

Evarrians were multifaceted with segmented bodies, which helped them to quickly move through the Jagomir swamps' mud and water.
Due to their many complex eyes, Evarrians had excellent vision.
They had two, long, sharp claws poking up from the top of their body, covered in toxic venom.
They were covered with a hard carapace.
Not only was the venom paralyzing the prey, but it also caused the inner organs to break up.
Human beings were very sensitive to this toxin.

# Section 2

After the destruction of the Arda I Rebel base and the migration of the Rebel Alliance to Jagomir, much of Evarrian's food source had been removed by the construction of their new Resolute Base.
In conjunction with their increasing famine, the desire to protect their nests caused a growingly aggressive and hostile local nest of creatures.
After the attack on a Rebel scout party, the task of investigating and removing the Evarrian threat was assigned to a group of people.
