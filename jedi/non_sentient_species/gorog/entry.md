# Introduction

The Gorog was a large and bipedal creature of unknown origin spotted in approximately 1 BBY on the planet of Cato Neimoidia.
The creature was used in a large gladiatorial arena on the planetâ€™s city of Tarko-se.
The creature itself was owned by one Baron Merillion Tarko, who was the latest member of a distinctive noble family who had served the Republic for generations.
The creature was of an unknown species and gender.
Its most prominent feature was its colossal size which was estimated as several times that of a Rancor, which appeared to be part of its diet.
The creature had a generally hunched appearance, an incredibly skeletal frame, beast-like lower body, four large boney tusks, two hearts, and a large manacle which was surgically attached to the creature.
The creature eventually broke free of its restraints and destroyed the arena after engaging in a battle with the clone known only as Starkiller following a brief fight with the Jedi known as Rahm Kota.
Historical sources differ on what happened to the creature with some reports saying it died after falling from the massive city while others state it was later killed by the bounty hunting duo of Boba Fett and Xasha in the streets of the floating city.
