# Introduction

Arachne were a non-sentient species of arachnids, native to Endor.
They were distinguishable by their ability to have up to ten legs.
These creatures also had fangs that carried a non-lethal poison.
A breed of arachne called “bone gnashers” were also known to inhabit the Krayt Cult Cave on Tatooine.
This was possible due to the possibility of importing items from Endor to Tatooine.

Section One:
The GeneTech Syndicate had begun an illegal bioengineering program on Talus during the Galactic Civil War.
This was started in order to create an intelligent and powerful form of arachne under the name Parasophic Arachne.
In the beginning, the project was successful, but over time the creations began to overwhelm the creators.
Ending up with the mass slaughter of most of the GeneTech staff.
Corellian Security Forces discovered the situation not long after and quickly destroyed the remaining arachne.
