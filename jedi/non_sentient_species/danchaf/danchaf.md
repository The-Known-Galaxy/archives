# Introduction
Danchaf are a non-sentient species that inhabit the planet of Garban, in the Outer Rim.
These predators are often called “tree goblins” by the Jenets as they only appear in the planet’s forests.
Danchaf are known to hunt in groups of five to fifteen; they hide from trees and stalk their prey.
They are tall and possess claws, scales, and horns.
According to legends, the Danchaf conquered the planet, and only the Jenets stopped them from their rule.
Xenobiologists classified these creatures as non-sentient; however, the Jenets claim that these creatures are intelligent.
