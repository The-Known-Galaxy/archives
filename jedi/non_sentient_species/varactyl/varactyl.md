# Introduction
The world of Utapau was home to an interesting assortment of wildlife, including the reptavian beasts known as varactyls.
Standing at an impressive four meters in height at the shoulder and extending out lengthwise to around fifteen meters on average, this herbivore was adorned with a gorgeous array of blue and green crests and feathers.
These beasts were capable of navigating even the most extreme terrain on Utapau, surmounting vertical slopes with relative ease due to their impressive strides.
Though loyal and intelligent enough to serve as nimble mounts for those who rode them, they were still not considered sentient as they possessed a simple thought process.
However, this did not diminish their capability as dependable steeds.

# Section 1
There were not many variations of the reptavian species being relatively similar across the board.
One subspecies, however, bred and having selective traits narrowed down through generations of varactyls came to be - and were labeled as pijal varactyls.
They were made specifically to be swifter than that of their original varactyl predecessors, adorning crimson feathering.
This was conducted and carried out by the Iltan Clan, who bred these creatures for the Great Hunt on the planet of Pijan, hence the label “pijal” varactyl.
