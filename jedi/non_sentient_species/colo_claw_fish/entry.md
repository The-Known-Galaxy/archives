# Introduction

The colo claw fish is one of the largest creatures known to be found in the deep depths of Naboo’s seas.
The fish had a very long and narrow body that held two rows of bioluminescent nodules on both sides, which it used to attract prey.
The colo claw fish was the second-largest predator, and was even bigger than the Opee Sea Killer and was one of the many several species of eel known in the Galaxy.
The colo also had a crocodile-like head containing a long snout, two mandible-like appendages, along with a long row of venomous fangs, which it used to poison and subdue its prey.
They also had the abilities to unhinge their jaws, allowing it to swallow prey ten times larger than its head, and were also labeled as “indiscriminate feeders' ', due to their abilities to swallow anything that they could.
Their main target of prey were young opee sea killers, which they would swallow alive.
The colo claw fish also had the ability to use an intense hydrosonic screech which would result in stunning prey, allowing the colo to move in for the kill.
