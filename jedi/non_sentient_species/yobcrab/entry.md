# Introduction

Yobcrabs were a non-sentient crab species that could be found lurking in the swamps on the planet Naboo.
One could recognize these creatures from their blue shells and shiny yellow eyes.
Similar to other crab species, yobcrabs had a total of eight limbs along with six legs, which were used to move on the swamp floors.
They also had two sharp claws, which they used to catch their prey.
They often moved in small packs instead of moving alone or in large numbers and usually fed on smaller fish, such as daggerts.
Like many other species, yobcrabs were near the bottom of the food chain and were eaten by Blarths.
