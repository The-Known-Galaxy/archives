# Introduction

The baspoor glider, also known as the “sky swimmer” because of its fish-like appearance, was an omnivore and was often found on temperate worlds, including Belsavis.
The baspoor glider usually lived around the small ponds on Belsavis, and had a physiological structure that allowed it to land on water.
Although it was not gifted with legs, it was known for landing on solid surfaces and not being able to to take off again, leaving it easy prey to some of the bigger animals on the planet.

During the first months of its life, the baby lives on its mother's back.
Although the mother mainly cares for its own needs, baspoor gliders can heal quickly, making it possible for them to survive falling off their mothers backs, and returning to them safely.
