# Introduction

Orobirds were known as a large-bird species that had spread in numbers throughout the galaxy.
These creatures could be recognized from their multicolored feathers and loud noises they often created.
However, these birds were unable to fly or glide in any way.
This feature often made them an easy target to any predators they might have encountered.
Their lack of intelligence also made them vulnerable to any possible poachers.
Despite all of this, orobirds were able to grow in great numbers on numerous planets, especially thriving during the Cold War.
