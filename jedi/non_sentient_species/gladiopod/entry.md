# Introduction

The creature known as "Gladiopod", is classified as a non-sentient being native to Umbara.
The Gladiopod had a total of eight glowing red eyes, as well as four spiked legs.
They also lived in groups, presumably for numerical advantages.
Their faces also consisted of many tentacles that fell to form a beard-like appearance, containing four eyes on each side.
