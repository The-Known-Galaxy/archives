# Introduction

Fefze were an insectoid species that originated from the planet Fef, located in the Glythe Sector.
The most interesting aspect this creature has is that as they form a swarm together they form a sentient intelligence despite that each individual Fefze was non-sentient to begin with.

These insects towered at a metre high with huge black exoskeletons protecting their interior.
Their senses of smelling and hearing are provided by their antennae, whilst also their ability to communicate was done by rubbing and clicking their antennae.
Fefze had the ability to fly due to the two hidden wings under their exoskeletons and if threatened they can curl up into a defensive shell.
However, their digestive system was one of the keys to the survival of their species, since it was easily adaptable and could digest any carbon based organic material making their diet diverse.
They achieved this by releasing a substance onto the food which let out the carbohydrates in the food.
Then the Fefze would eat the carbohydrates leaving a protein rich paste behind of what is left.
The digestive tract is also dubbed as a defense mechanism as they could spit powerful digestive substances at their predators to inflict harm upon them or just distract them.

Because of the lack of food these insects lacked adept appendages, never developed technology and had few exports.

# Section 2

As mentioned before, one single Fefze is not any more intelligent than another insect.
But as they gather together in a swarm their intelligence multiplies.
One swarm of ten to one hundred Fefze could last for centuries which is a very long time when compared to the 10 years that a single Fefze can last for.
Each single Fefze counted for the intelligence of the swarm as a whole.
Fefze swarms begin when they hatch from the same Fefze egg droplet.
Swarms add more members to their ranks by participating in a mating ritual named as a “swarm dance”.
Whilst a random egg droplet would be abandoned in hope that it would form another swarm in the next coming of years.
This “swarm dance” actually has developed into an art form over time.

# Section 3

Swarms throughout the galaxy were hired as entertainers in visual arts, dancing and even as musicians.
Some Fefze farms were recruited into organisations and colonists and food producers because they could create nourishment for other species with their digestive system.
They were also even involved in politics, choosing various sides.
Some swarms were known to be pro Imperialists whilst others were pro New Republic.
