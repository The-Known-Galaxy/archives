# Introduction
Ysalamiri are orange lizards native to the forest world of Myrkr.
The reptiles have four legs and a long tail.
Fully grown Ysalamiri are usually half a meter long.
They hatch from spherical eggs.
Using their claws, Ysalamiri attach themselves to Olbio trees.
They are herbivorous and feed off of the nutrients of Olbio trees.
Multiple Ysalamiri are referred to as “Ysalamiri.” Lone Ysalamiri are referred to as “Ysalamir.”

# Section 1
Ysalamiri are prey to the wolf-like Vornskrs, which are also native to Myrkr.
Vornskrs are Force-sensitive and utilize the Force to detect their prey.
Due to their predators’ abilities, Ysalamiri evolved to produce large bubbles that help them evade detection.
Despite what many believe, the bubbles produced by Ysalamiri do not create voids in the Force, as that would be impossible.
Rather, it is impossible to exert control over the Force inside the bubbles.
When a large group of Ysalamiri work together, their bubbles can grow to be as wide as kilometers.



# Section 2
Due to enemies of the Jedi potentially using the Ysalamiri and Vornskrs against them, the Jedi Order did their best to keep them and the world of Myrkr secret.
While the Jedi were worried about the Ysalamiri, they did admire their tenacity.
The Jedi Order called the second lightsaber form, Makashi, the Way of the Ysalamiri.
Despite the Jedi Order’s best efforts, Ysalamiri would eventually be used to weaken Jedi by the esteemed Grand Admiral Thrawn.
They were also utilized by the Empire of the Hand.
