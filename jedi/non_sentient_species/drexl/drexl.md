# Introduction
Drexl were non-sentient winged bodies as a lizard that are highly muscular all over the body with purple scales.
The Drexl have long necks and short heads combined with a mixture of fangs and snouts.
It was said that adult Drexl would have the approximate teeth length of a human arm.
Drexl were born in a larval period similar to a butterfly, the only exception being that they were 3 meters.
In this stage it was said that they did not contain any means of wings or anything to lift off the ground with.
However, they still contained their nature of being fearless and vicious.
In a larval period the Drexl had a humanoid type body shape, having two legs, and two arms, three fingers, tail, and multiple rows of spines down their back and green like skin.

# Section 1
In the earliest years of the Drexl’s known existence in the Onderon history they were feared predators known to all.
Attacking villages and forcing new ways to keep the village people safe from these feared beings, such ways are constructing the fortified city of Iziz.
Eventually the creatures were tamed and used as transportation, having been trained as mounts.
Later down the road a Drexl larva was used in General Vaklu’s attempt to politically take over the Onderon.
The General used the Drexl to break down the barrier protecting the Queen Talia’s throne room.
Later the larva was eliminated by a Jedi Exile.
Later, Darth Bane also used a Drexl under his control when he made the journey from Dxun to Onderon.
His Drexl also saved his apprentice from the harassment of some Beast Riders.
