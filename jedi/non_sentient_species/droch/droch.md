# Introduction
Drochs were non-sentient, very small insects labeled as “parasitic”.
They would sneakily burrow into a person’s skin and slowly drink off their life energy and intelligence.
As Nam Chorios was their homeworld, a Droch could only gain true sentience after getting into a user’s skin and draining much intelligence from the host.
The species would avoid detection while doing this as they were able to mimic the host's electrochemical fields and tissue composition, essentially becoming a part of the host while doing their act.
Each second they would drain for, the more intelligent they would become.
If they killed them, then they would collect the user’s whole intelligence.
Larger Drochs could even absorb smaller ones for survival and an easier way than finding a host itself.
Whenever they were exposed to light on their homeworld, they would become very sluggish and inactive because the sun was altered by things such as “tsil crystals”.
This would not happen on other planets as they would not have these crystals.
In 702 BBY, a colony of Drochs were found by the Grissmath Dynasty on Nam Chorios.
They would decide to seed the world to create a Death Seed outbreak, which would easily kill the prisoners.
However, it would fail due to the sun fragmentation that weakened the electrochemical bonds that the species had.
This would end in a plague not breaking out because they were only able to grow in the dark.
