# Introduction
Blurrgs are strong two-legged reptilians native to the worlds of Endor and Ryloth.
Blurrgs come in many colors, including brown, blue, and green.
They are used in a wide array of tasks.
Blurrgs are used as beasts of burden and as mounts in war.
Due to their many uses, both domesticated and wild blurrgs can be found on many worlds.
They are omnivorous and are even known to eat their own kind.
Female blurrgs eat their male partners after producing children, similar to a praying mantis.

Blurrgs have two small arms and a long thick tail.
While they have an awkward hunched stance, blurrgs are surprisingly fast.
The Twi’leks often rode blurrgs in battle.
Blurrgs’ sharp teeth and strong tails make them powerful and deadly when they engage in combat.
Blurrgs have no issue biting through metal droids when they fight them, as proven in the Battle of Ryloth during the Clone Wars.
The Twi’leks continued to ride blurrgs into battle well into the Imperial Era.
