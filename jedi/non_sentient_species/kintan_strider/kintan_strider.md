# Introduction

Kintan striders are ferocious creatures with an extraordinary healing ability.
The Kintan striders were native to the Endless Waste of Kintan and were a respected opponent to many generations of the Nikto orders on Kintan.
Despite this, ultimately, the striders went extinct on Kintan from a combination of the Nikto overhunting the creatures and the world's ever-growing pollution.
Before going extinct, the striders were taken offworld, bred, and most notably used as guard beasts by many members of the Hutt Cartel.
Kintan striders generally appear white with large shoulders and long arms that would hang almost to the ground.
Striders utilize more primitive weapons such as clubs, sticks, and poles paired with their exceptional self-healing abilities.
