# Introduction
Dianoga are large cephalopods that are capable of growing up to ten meters in length, but most only get to around five or six.
They have a single eyestalk that protrudes from their body, alongside seven tentacles that surround a fanged maw that contains a sharp serrated probe.

# Section 1
These creatures originated on Vodran and were discovered by the Hutts, prior to the formation of the Galactic Republic.
They soon evolved and gained a natural form of camouflage to disguise themselves against predators.
Their bodies would be transparent when underfed and would reflect the color of the food they ate.
Done by separating the digested food into ducts underneath the creature’s skin, which affected the color of the creature’s flesh.
Dianoga migrated from Vodran by stowing away on garbage ships and were commonly found in trash compactors, garbage pits, and sewers across the galaxy.
They were scavengers and only posed a threat when starving or threatened.
Because they fed off of organic waste, they were sometimes referred to as garbage squids, sewage squids, or trash monsters.

Section Two: 
These creatures would prove to be a nuisance by nesting within bodies of water, sewage systems, and any other large containment of dirty liquid.
Smaller forms of the creature were known to crawl out of toilets.
Although, they have also been proven useful since they help get rid of waste, leaving behind salvageable metals and minerals.
In 22 BBY, there was an outbreak of these creatures within one of the districts on Coruscant.
Up to twenty five residents had reported attacks from the creatures and it was believed that they would spread to the neighboring districts.
The presence of just one of these guys was often a cause for alarm, since they could quickly multiply and pose a larger problem to the people in the area.



# Section 3
One dianoga was known to have gotten aboard the first Death Star, and made its home in one of the garbage compactors.
Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia Organa had arrived at the Death Star in hopes of rescuing Leia.
Not long after they entered the Death Star, they were forced into the trash compactor and were forced to face the creature.
Attacking Skywalker and pulling him under all of the trash and murky water, but was scared away when the compactor walls started moving.
The creature had burrowed into the wall safely until the Death Star was destroyed.
There was another infestation within the palace of Prince Xizor.
Dash Rednar was forced to encounter and fight off a fully grown dianoga while exiting the sewers.
Dianoga could also be found on Anoat.
This is where multiple of them attacked the Rebel mercenary Kyle Katarn.
He searched the sewers to locate Moff Rebus, while furthering his campaign against the Imperial Dark Trooper Project.
