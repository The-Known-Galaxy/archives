# Introduction

Corellian hounds are a white, four-legged, pack hunting carnivore native to the planet Corellia.
Commonly domesticated by gangs, these hounds are seen as intimidating.
They make good attack dogs due to their apparent aggressive behaviour.
Their teeth are capable of extraordinarily fast regeneration, being able to regrow a whole tooth within two days of losing it.
Theyâ€™re white, with their skulls taking up the bulk of their frame.
The skull of a corellian hound is actually the widest part of the body.
