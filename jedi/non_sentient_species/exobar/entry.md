# Introduction

The Exoboar was a dangerous non-sentient creature native to planet Makeb.
These creatures had a somewhat weak eyesight, but extremely strong hearing.
Exoboar could be recognized from its black tough skin and yellow glowing eyes.
They only tend to move during the nights to avoid any carnivorous beasts Makeb may have held, in fact,  Exoboars often roamed with their eyes closed to blend in the dark and hide the bright glow.
For generations, The Hutt Cartel had been in control of the planet Makeb.
Due to this reason, having a visitor on Makeb was not as common as in other planets; this allowed Exoboars to live in peace.
Some, however, tended to hunt these creatures for trophies, and especially for their juicy meat and hard claws.
