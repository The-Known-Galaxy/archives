At 3.5 ABY, the Cliff Wampa was placed on a rocky moon of Gali located in the Cadavine sector, a sector that was inside the Outer Rims.
The Cliff Wampas had many similarities with the Wampas from the icy planet Hoth, they were a Semi-sentient species, they could only live in rocky environments, and they had very sharp claws to help them climb rocky surfaces, hunt for food and dig hard surface areas like rocks.
