# Introduction
The K’lor’slugs were a race of carnivorous worm-like creatures that originated from the swamps of Noe’ha’on.
They were a dangerous invasive species that plagued numerous sites on the planets Korriban and Taris.
These aggressive vermiforms could swallow a man whole and were capable of producing venom, which made extermination efforts difficult among highly infested areas.
They boasted multiple pincer legs and a large tubular mouth riddled with concentric rows of teeth.
These hunters had an excellent visual perception and sense of smell.
The presence of k’lor’slugs were known since the Great Galactic War and have since been included as a holomonster for the strategy game dejarik.

The beasts were widely regarded as pests as their queens could lay hundreds of eggs at a time with a rapid incubation period.
Starship pilots were acquainted with these species as they were known to proliferate in the dark and unsanitary conditions of a spacecraft.
The sound of a group of eggs hatching is known as “a Hutt’s cry,” which was derived from a tragedy during a Hutt’s yearly gladiatorial tournament where a hunter and the Hutt were devoured by hundreds of k’lor’slugs.
