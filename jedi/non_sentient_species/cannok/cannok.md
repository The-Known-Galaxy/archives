# Introduction

Cannoks, a small four-legged creature inhabiting the Dxun moon of the Onderon world.
Despite showing little capacity to deal damage to Humans, they had a strong desire to bite and chew anything they managed to acquire.

These creatures were generally regarded as annoying, polluting ecosystems with their high reproduction rates and tendency to explore in areas they weren’t wanted.

Overall, they were strong biologically and resembled the characteristics of many other four-legged non-sentient creatures.
They travelled in packs and weren’t involved in any particularly interesting historical events.
One however, is that they were transported to Telos IV in an attempt to restore the ecological balance of the world after Darth Malak had eroded the surface of the planet.

# Section 1

The creatures varied between green, yellow and brown colours with dark hues.
They had (2) eyes that protruded outside of their head.
The creatures had long rows of teeth in their wide and hollowed out mouth, which stood awkwardly in front of their four-legged body.
Xaxax were clearly hunters, and used the rows of spikes on their backs to defend themselves.

# Section 2

Surprisingly, these creatures had little to no fear towards basic elements of defence.
This included fire, and small groups of Humans.
They generally avoided small villages, but would single out solo humans, and tear them apart in packs.

Alone, these creatures acted and lived in a pattern, observing their surroundings casually, eating where necessary, excreting and reproducing.

# Section 3

The Cannoks were rather low on the food chain often feasted on by maalraas, boma and zakkeg.
Particularly strong Cannoks could fend off Maalaraas, but otherwise they were dined on regularly.

The Cannoks are a consistent species, existing throughout the Mandalorian wars and other events.
The Mandalorians often left them alone, regarding them as less than worthy of being killed by “skilled hunters.”

The species often caused trouble in the areas they thrived in as they overgrazed plant life, and devoured living creatures below them in the food chain.

Notably, some Cannoks once ate integral parts to a phase-pulse converter whereas a Jedi Exile would respond by killing and gutting all of them to retrieve the parts.

As previously mentioned, they were purposefully bred on Telos IV to rehabilitate the world's plant life, but unfortunately they did the opposite and the population growth of the Cannok destroyed the ecosystem.
