# Introduction

A Krayt dragon was a large reptilian that inhabited the mountainous region of the planet Tatooine’s Deserts.
These reptiles were carnivores, and despite their fierce power and size, they were hunted because in their bellies there were extremely valuable pearls.

The size of a Krayt dragon was an average of 2000 kilograms and up to 45 meters in length.
These beasts lived up to the ripe old age of 100 years old, but their strength did not suffer from age.
Krayt dragons were studied by xenobiologists, who then determined that they were a relative of the Kell dragon.
There were also thoughts of it descending from the mysterious species of Duinuogwuin, but this was never proven.
Even though a Krayt dragon’s teeth were sharp, they couldn’t chew their prey enough to digest it, and thus they ingested stones and rocks that would grind the food to mush within their stomachs.
During this grinding, the stones would become smooth, pearl-like objects known as Krayt dragon Pearls.
The Jedi were able to tune these pearls into focusing crystals, used in their lightsabers, but they were also a commodity amongst jewelers.

Due to a Krayt dragon’s power, the Sand People of Tatooine, also known as Tusken Raiders, used killing one of these as a ritual for joining a tribe.
This was done by leaving a teenage Tusken in the desert, who was only let back in if they managed to kill a Krayt dragon.
Alongside the Krayt Pearls, their bones were thought to have magical abilities and were thus important for the Sand People as well as the Jawas.
These bones, specifically the skulls, were made into carrying bags by the Sand People.
Krayt dragons were also a very important part of Tatooinians’ wedding tradition.
