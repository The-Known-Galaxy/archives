# Introduction

The Spine Dragons were located on the planet Kintan, which was also the native planet of the Nikto.
These Spine Dragons eventually died due to the Nikto, which forced the Spine Dragons into extinction.
Padawan Ki Sazen saved the Nikto people from the Spine Dragon of M’dweshuu, and the Nikto praised her because of that time, and there were stories of this made by the Nikto.
Because of this, the Cult of Ki Sazen was made, as well as the Nikto supporting the Galactic Republic through most of the Cold War.

# Section 1

Spine Dragons were first created when a nova occurred and an extreme amount of radiation of the star M’dweshuu affected some of the species on Kintan, thus causing evolution and then the first Spine Dragon was made.
Spine Dragons were usually unsafe for the Nikto, which led the Nikto to hunt the Spine Dragons, and soon came their extinction on the planet Nikto.
However, Spine Dragons were more known in the New Republic era through holo-serials.
