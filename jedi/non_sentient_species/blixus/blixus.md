# Introduction

The Blixus is a carnivorous cephalopod that hunts on anything small enough to fit in its mouth.
Being gigantic at 6.48 metres in height, 5.67 metres wide and a daunting 13.33 metres long.
It has a long and articulated shell across its back, starting from the tail and ending over its face, providing excellent defense from anything above it.
The shell resembles 2 large fins on its sides, possibly using these fins for submerged locomotion.
Along its belly are 6 large crustacean legs with shells surrounding on each end of the legs, these legs are connected to its body by ball joints which allows the Blixus to strafe side-to-side.
The mouth of the Blixus is located on the underside of it along the belly just in front of the legs.
This mouth is circular in shape with glass-like teeth lining the inside of its mouth, and just in front of this mouth are 2 pincers which are protected with a shell much like the legs are.
At the front of the Blixus are 5 tentacles, capable of reaching behind itself with ease.
These tentacles have several spikes that protrude forward to possibly impale itâ€™s prey.
These tentacles end in pads lined with hooked suction cups to ensnare prey to prevent escape.
