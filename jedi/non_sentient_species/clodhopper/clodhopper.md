# Introduction
Clodhoppers were flightless avians from the planet of Naboo.
Clodhoppers were omnivorous and were rarely ever more than three feet tall.
They possessed strong and durable skin, as well as two forelegs they used for jumping and foraging.
Clodhoppers were known for their capability of giving birth to over two-hundred babies at once, who spend most of their young years eating.
Clodhoppers were prey to Gungans for their durable thick skin, which made a suitable material for numerous instruments known to the Gungan species, as well as their meat for food.

# Section 1
Clodhoppers were transported to other planets across the galaxy centuries before the Battle of Naboo.
This  became banned and punishable by law due to devastation and destruction to other planets, on other planets, including the planet Corva of the Galaanus System.
They were also used in Operation: Clodhopper, where the Army of Life caught and concealed Clodhopper eggs and shipped them to Stend IV in 31 BBY.
Clodhoppers have been known to be tameable and trained, as well.
