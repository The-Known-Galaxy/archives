# Introduction
Can-cell were a flying insect species.
They were known to have parts including quad wings and huge green eyes, and also had skin with a blue and red coloring.
They were known to have an enormous body size, measuring up to three meters, as well as nine feet and ten inches in length.
For comparison, that size is close to touching one side of an RZ-1 A-Wing Interceptor laser cannon to its other.

# Section 1
Another interesting fact about can-cells is that they are not native to a single planet.
These creatures have been seen across various other planets in the galaxy.
Several jungle dense planets have been home to can-cells, such as Kashyyyk, Aleen, Batuu, and even Ryloth, the homeworld of the Twi'lek species.



# Section 2
Even the can-cell have had very beneficial relationships with sentient species on the planets that have hosted them.
One note being that the Wookiees, native to the planet of Kashyyyk, based the Raddaugh Gnasp fluttercraft design on the can-cell looks.
Can-cell, like many other species, were known to be domesticated, mainly by natives from Batuu to use them as pets.
