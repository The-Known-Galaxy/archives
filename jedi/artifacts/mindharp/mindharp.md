# Introduction

The Mindharp is a meter long, fork shaped tool created by unknown means and was believed to have been a device that allowed the Toka to summon an ancient race of humanoids known as the Sharu in order to aid the Toka in their time of need.
Despite what the Toka believed, the Mindharp was built by the Sharu as a means to help reestablish their own intelligence network systems they had purposely hid away from the Celestials.

# Section 1

The Mindharp would be kept inside a hidden chamber of the Great Pyramid in the Rafa systems.
It’s chamber would be guarded by an unnamed entity that would keep watch over the artifact.
Only the Toka priests would have a means of entering the chamber, through use of a key passed down by each High Priest.
Soon after the New Republic was established, Lando Calrissian would be informed of the artifact by Osuno Whett who had told Calrissian he would be the future bearer.
Calrissian would be successful in retrieving the Mindharp though it would soon fall into the hands of Duttes Mer, the governor of the Rafa system.
Duttes would later activate the Mindharp, it’s emanations would set off a chain of events that would change the Rafa System and restore the eons old Sharu civilization.
The event would come at the cost of the Rafa System and its inhabitants, almost all of which would have been destroyed by the event.
