# Introduction
The Kalikori was a Twi’lek heirloom passed down through generations from families.
According to an ancient tradition, each parent made additions to the family artwork, which were shaped to mock the species’ two lekku.
They would be added on over the years with charms and designs which signified the family’s legacy.

# Section 1
In 2 BBY, some members of the early rebellion took on a mission at the Syndulla residence to regain their family’s Kalikori.
The residence was located within the Tann Province on Ryloth which was occupied by the Galactic Empire.
Sadly the mission failed and the Kalikori ended up in the hands of Grand Admiral Thrawn.
After some time passed, Thrawn established a base of operations at the Lothal Imperial Factory.
Thrawn heavily examined the Syndulla Kalikori in hopes that he could use it to destroy the rebellion.
He took the artifact to his office on the Imperial Star Destroyer Chimaera and left it there following his interrogation of General Hera Syndulla.
However, it didn’t stay there long as Jarrus was able to retrieve it and return it to Hera.
In 0 BBY, after Kanan Jarrus’ death, Hera added Jarrus to her Kalikori.
This act made him an honorary member of the Syndulla family.
