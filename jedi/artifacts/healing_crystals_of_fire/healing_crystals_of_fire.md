# Introduction

The Healing Crystals of Fire were one of the Jedi Order's greatest treasures.
They were kept in meditation chambers at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and guarded by Jedi Sages.
The stones were used to completely heal serious wounds.
They were named after the eternal flames that burned within them, and thus could supposedly heal even an individual near death.
The miraculous healing crystals were said to have originated on the planet Aurea and were a gift to the Jedi High Council.
Dark Jedi Xanatos often tried to steal these stones and destroy them in a furnace, but was stopped in time by Master Qui-Gon-Jinn.
Although safely returned to the Temple, they ended up being lost during the Great Jedi Purge.
