# Introduction

Sand People Carving was an ancient monument, which was chiseled in the walls of a cave located in northern Jundland on Tatooine.
The murial depicted that the planet was once a prosperous and fertile planet with four races inhabiting it.
The murial itself was chiseled in four parts, with each part depicting one race.
Of the four races only two stand today.
The first race depicted on the murals had gone extinct.
The second race was the Jawas which had fled in order to seek shelter.
The third race was the Sand people who held brutal wars against the unknown fourth race.
The sand people managed to completely eradicate the fourth race.
It is speculated that the planet which was once so fertile and prosperous in the murals had  suffered a great disaster.
This disaster ultimately created the desert which completely engulfed the planet.

During 3653 BBY Jedi Master Eriz Vossan traveled to Tatooine in order to experience Jawan culture.
However this cultural trip would soon come to an end as Eriz was just a handful of the Jedi who was subcome by the dark plague which was created by Vivicar.
After this encounter, Eriz would become obsessed with the idea of finding the species able to survive the planet's harsh conditions.
He would soon travel to the Sand People Carving as he would be able to figure out that the Tusken Raiders were the only species strong enough to survive on Tatooine.
At the time the Tusken Raiders had a policy of where they would eliminate the weakest in order to have better chances of survival.
Eriz saw this occurrence as a crucial necessity to add to the Galactic Republic in order to have a chance to defeat the Sith Empire.
