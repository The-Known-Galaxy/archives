# Introduction

Star Maps were artifacts left behind by the Rakatan Infinite Empire, drawn upon the dark side of the Force.
Rakatan Star Maps were made out of technology, made to stand to the power of the Rakatan Empire.
The Rakatan Star Map has located the Empire’s greatest achievement, the Star Forge.
The Maps also contained information about certain types of planets and other elements under the Empire.
The Map was made of technology because it allowed them to repair themselves if ever broken/damaged.

The Map was made from Rakatan slaves.
The Map is more like a holographic image that was kept inside a freestanding structure that can also be computer-connected.
Growing up from the base were three arm-like structures holding the orb, whereas the holographic image.
It was made to show the true nature of the Rakatan religion and its dominance.
The Rakatan Star Map is not just one map but many, each different.
Each Map had different starters, meaning it could only be activated by those who were strong in the Force.
There were maps on each planet, for example, Dantooine and Kashyyyk.
They were protected by defense droids and computer systems that could detect those who sought their secrets.
As said, Maps could only be activated by those who were strong in the Force, meaning those who were deemed “unworthy” or either a failure, would be led to death.
