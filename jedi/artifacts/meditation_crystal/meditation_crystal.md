# Introduction
The Meditation Crystal, also called the Altar with the Meditation Crystal, was a large green crystal that was on a platform near Lower Kaleth ruins of Tython.
During the Old Republic era, it was a popular Jedi altar for meditation.
At 3642 VSY, the young Padawan Flingeld of the Jedi Order was sent to Lower Kaleth by his Ithorian Jedi Master Quilljayk, as part of his Jedi exams to use the Force to lift the stone into the air that sat next to the meditation crystal.
He became frustrated and enlisted the help of another padawan who was also in the ruins.
