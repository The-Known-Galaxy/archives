# Introduction

The Golden Sun originates from the water planet Sedri.
The device was adored and treasured by the native species of Sedri.

# Section 1

The Golden Sun was created from connection to the force from force sensitives, through this it was a power source of immensity.
The power of the Golden Sun would be able to activate the powers of the technology that were used by the Sedrians.
Later on, the Sedrians had learnt that the Golden Sun would be able to heal using the force and from cures created by the Sedrians.

# Section 2

The Golden Sun was very vast, many Sedrians who had treasured this device had never seen the true nature and intelligence of the Golden Sun.
During the Galatic Empire era, there was not much information known about the Golden Sun so many people such as the Priest had dismissed this device for its simplicity.

From the Priest’s decision and announcement of the simplicity of the Golden Sun, it was decided that the Golden Sun’s dome would be restricted and would cease operation.
This caused no water to enter the Golden Sun.
Due to limited knowledge of the Golden Sun by the Priest and other Sedrians, the Golden Sun slowly started to collapse with no supply of water.
The Intelligence of the Golden Sun allowed the Golden Sun to interact with the Priest through using Force Telepathy.
This did not work and instead gave rise to troubling thoughts and hallucinations.
The Priest had no awareness as to why.
