# Introduction

The Tarkin Doctrine (AKA Fear Doctrine of Terror, Rule of Fear, Imperial Communiqué #001044.92v) was a message from Wilhuff Tarkin to the Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine.
The letter explained in detail Tarkin’s view on how order must be maintained through fear and terror through the galaxy.

# Section 1

The Doctrine consisted of three primary principles: Territorial Consolidation, Rapid Communication and the Rule of Fear.
Territorial Consolidation focused on the reorganization of local governing into “Oversectors” that could perform much more flexibly, assigning more forces to rebellious sectors, so that rebellions would vanish before they even started.

# Section 2

Rapid Communications focused on reorganizing the HoloNet into a military-used system.
Taking the HoloNet for government use would both prevent “Sector Groups” of rebels from forming, and at the same time let ships be connected by a transceiver to Sector Command, while Sector Command is connected to the High Command in Coruscant, improving the military’s capabilities.

# Section 3

SECTION FOUR:
The Rule of Fear is pretty much self explanatory, but it focused on “Rule through fear of force, rather than through force itself.”.
It focused on creating fear using massive superweapons and displays of power, while not even needing to use it.

# Section 4

The idea that eventually led to the Doctrine was rooted in 29 BBY when Raith Sienar presented to Tarkin (Then a Commander in the Republic’s Outland Regions Security Force) the plans for the Expeditionary Battle Planetoid (A massive superweapon).
Tarkin was very intrigued by this, since he had seen the chaos in the Outer Rim due to a lack of governing authority.

# Section 5

Tarkin first presented the general idea to then Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, which prompted Palpatine to order research that would result in the Death Star Project.
Tarkin presented the complete concept to, by then Emperor, Palpatine, who was very much impressed with the then Moff, not only implementing all of Tarkin’s suggestions, but even rewarding him with the rank of Grand Moff (The first of his kind).

# Section 6

With his rank, Tarkin was given control of most of the Outer Rim territories, more troops under his command to crush resistance and his own superweapon project, the Death Star.
Ironically his doctrine was published in an Imperial book called: “Imperial Handbook: A Commander’s Guide” right before the Death Star, a cornerstone of his Doctrine, along with Tarkin himself were blown up in Yavin 4’s orbit.

# Section 7

Aside from flaws in the Rule of Fear (That let the Rebel Alliance form) there were flaws in the other principles.
According to Wedge Antilles (Rebel Ace), the rebels changed their strategy to raiding on sector borders, thus making two Grand Moffs (Who controlled sectors) start a turf war.
Additionally, Han Solo remarked that bootleg transceivers could be bought from any hustler on Nar Shaddaa, defeating the purpose of the second principle.
