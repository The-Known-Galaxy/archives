# Introduction
The Ryloth Ark is a crest-shaped relic plated with gold that originated from Ryloth.
Sitting atop the Ark was a statue of two Twi’leks.
While on the bottom there were four gold rings that you could place staves allowing any pair to carry the Ark.
There were ever only two arks that were in existence and one of them ended up falling into a crevasse on Ryloth.

During the Clone Wars a Separatist Council member, Emir Wan Tambor managed to gain control of the planet.
One of his tasks was to gather valuables from the planet such as the Ryloth Ark.
In 5 ABY, the Ark seemed to be in the possession of the Church of the Dark Side.
Which was a religion established by Imperial Intelligence after the death of Palpatine.
They kept it on display within a glass display case at Sarcadia Station next to the blood-red Mandalorian armor.
However, it was never known if they owned the original artifact or if it was just a remade version.
Later on, the Ark was lost when the station was destroyed by Grand Admiral Afsheen Makati.
