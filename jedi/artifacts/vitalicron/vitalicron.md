# Introduction
The Vitalicron, a different and more useful form of a holocron, was used by the Voss species, a humanoid species that lives on the Planet Voss.
The Vitalicrons were used in the Cold War era, as it can contain memory and/or visions of those who were able to use it.
They did rituals and healing practices at their Shrine of Healing.
Due to this, memories are stored inside the Vitalicron and once the ritual has been completed, the Vitalicrons are given to the Voss Mystics or some of the most talented healers of the Voss species.
The Vitalicrons were designed to only allow those who stored their memories in them.
Albathius, a worker for the Star Cabal, came to Voss and did the healing ritual himself.
