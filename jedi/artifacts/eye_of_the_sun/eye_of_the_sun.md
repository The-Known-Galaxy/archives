# Introduction
The Eye of the Sun was a defense artifact that was used during the Ruusan campaign which was an amount of seven battles and minor skirmishes that happened near the end of the New Sith Wars.
It was created and used by a group of  Jedi Masters against the Brotherhood of Darkness and later hidden under the ch'hala Heart Tree on Cularin.
The Dark Jedi Len Markus tried to find it in 19 BBY so that he could destroy Cularin by uniting the artifact against the Darkstaff.
The Force-imbued artifact radiated a silvery glow and appeared an eye in the middle when willed, but when it wasn’t, it would stay hidden like a regular rock.
