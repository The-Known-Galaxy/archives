# Introduction

Within the Jedi Temple of Coruscant, there were a set of seven stones that each weighed at least five tons.
Having been inspired by the Gardens of Tâ€™alla these Muntuur Stones were a powerful meditation tool for training Jedi in the ways of Telekinesis.
The stones were kept within the Kuddaka chamber of the temple, allowing any Jedi to test themself by seeing how many they could lift at the same time.
Jedi Master Ferleen Snee is said to have lifted all seven of the stones high above their head before whirling through the sky with only the Force.
If this legend of him is true that would make Snee the only Jedi to have lifted all seven stones.
For a Padawan, even slightly lifting one stone was classed as an achievement while a Knight could lift multiple.
However, it was only the masters of telekinesis that could lift up more than four and Yoda could only lift five after he got to the seven hundred years old mark.
Jedi Master Fae Coven meanwhile was only able to lift six after entering a long and deep meditation.
