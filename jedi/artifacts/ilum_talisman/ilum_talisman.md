# Introduction
The Ilum Talisman was a teardrop-shaped stone that had indecipherable but distinct markings that radiated power to Force users who were near the necklace.
Its former owner who wore it was Jedi Master Val Isa.
The talisman could be worn as a necklace; in the talisman, it had the veins of a crystal that would be visible when light is directed towards it.
