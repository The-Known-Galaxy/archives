# Introduction

The Force-imbued blade was a weapon used by members of the Je’daii Order.
This weapon was the predecessor to the Forcesaber, which later evolved into the Protosaber.
Force-imbued blades were curved, katana-like weapons imbued with the Force, allowing them to cut through most known materials.
They were also impervious to Lightsabers.

# Section 1

Force-imbued blades required no power source, as they took energy from a crystal placed inside.
The power of the Force flowing within them showed itself in multiple different ways, sometimes  altering the color of the blade.
It could also produce an effect similar to lightning or fire.

# Section 2

Such weapons were usually created by members of the Order as part of their promotion from the rank of Padawan.
The process of producing one was quite exhausting, both physically and mentally.
Firstly, the Je’daii would choose a bar of high-carbon metal.
Most people used durasteel for this task, though Madog steel later became the more popular option.
They would then hammer the material into a hilt and channel the Force into it while doing so.
The next step was inserting a crystal into the hilt and meditating on top of the weapon until its parts and the creator became unified.
This process carried the risk of the weapon shattering during forging, but produced high-quality blades worthy of being used in battle.
