# Introduction
The Eyes of Laqasa were a pair of electrobinoculars made with crystalline lenses and a leather headband.
They were named after the Jedi Knight who invented them, Laqasa Trill.
The binoculars were infused with the Force and were the subject of legends that involved illegal acts on the planet of Devaron.
The acts had a direct correlation to Trill’s aim of trying to bring down the perpetrators.

# Section 1
There was a hunter that imported a shipment of repto-simians for illegal hunting purposes, but they ended up breaking free and killing the hunter.
For a continuation of 2 years, they roamed the northern continent of Devaron and erected chaos.
Laqasa Trill visited the planet from time to time but later made a vow to hunt down and destroy the beasts terrorizing her homeworld.
During that time she created the Eyes in order to help the citizens of Devaron defend themselves against the beasts.
She was able to do so by using the varied abilities that the goggles offered, such as camouflage.
Trill hunted and killed them all and used their skins to weave herself a color-shifting cloak.
After the events on Devaron, the Eyes were rumored to be located somewhere within the Blue Mountains.
Which made them a local legend as they were never seen again.
