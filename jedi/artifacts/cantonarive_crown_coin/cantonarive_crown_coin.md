# Introduction
An extremely rare and expensive coin was made in Canto Bight, they named it the Contonarive crown coin.
It was a beautifully handcrafted gold coin that had carvings on it.
During the Imperial rule, the Baron Administrator of Cloud City, Lando Calrissian held the coin in his possession.
He intended to trade the coin for protection against a possible Imperial invasion.
However, things took an unexpected turn when the coin was stolen from Calrissian.
These thieves were planning on giving the crown coin to a crime boss named Wonn Ionstrike for a prize.
However, Calrissian managed to tell them that the coin was far more valuable than they realized and convinced them to return it back to him.
