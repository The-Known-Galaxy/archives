# Introduction
A mindspear is a type of fiber-photon, a dark side-based technological device made by the Rakata.
The Rakata, also known as the Builders, were a humanoid species technologically advanced race that grew early in galactic history.
At some point throughout Star Wars history, agents of One Sith found a number of mindspears from Rakatan ruins in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy.
Sith scientists tried to advance the mindspear but were unsuccessful.

# Section 1
To carry on the use of the Mindspear was the Sith Lord Darth Wyyrlok, giving two mindspears to Nyss Nenn and a Umbaran Sith agent.
The use of the mindspear was well worn on Wyyrlok’s orders of Nenn to awaken the clone of the Jedi Knight Jaden Korr, using the mindspear to transfer Jedi Knight Jaden Korrs’ memories into the clone Nenn had awakened.
As he did that, Nenn wanted to allow the clone he had awakened to replace Jaden Korr and infiltrate the Jedi Order.
It failed, meaning Korr’s Cerean Jedi apprentice Marr Idi-Shael took the clone and used the mindspear to transfer back Korr’s memories into the alteration before the clone was ready to begin the process.
