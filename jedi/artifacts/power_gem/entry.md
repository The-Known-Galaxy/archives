# Introduction

Power gems occurred when an ancient meteor broke apart.
Some chunks left from the debris formed into powerful gems referred to as “power gems.” Power gems seemed to have a high frequency that emitted an aura, capable of disturbing shields.
Power gems were active for a long time, but over time, the gems’ frequency died down, and the power gems became useless.
One of the earlier records of an active search for Power gems was 23 BBY.
Quenelle and Obi-Wan Kenobi were on the search for three power gems named “Lost Stars of Nallastia.” The two searched for the Lost Stars on Nallastia’s moon.
Upon finding them, they used their frequency to destroy an energy field.

Just one year later, in 22 BBY, the pirates of Iridium would use Power Gem shards to get the upper hand when engaging in a battle.
With the shield disturbing ability of the gems, the pirates were able to easily get the upper hand on enemy space freighters.
For a time, it was believed that nearly all power gems in the galaxy were either lost or lost their ability.
However, one of the gems was still intact and active, it was in the hands of an ex-pirate Raskar.
Raskar saw refugees in the Outer Rim Territories, hiding on the planet Antipose.
He was sawing the gem in case he ever needed to use it.
One day, a group of smugglers under the command of the Rebel Alliance retrieved the gem from Raskar via a duel.
The Rebel Alliance was in desperate need to retrieve the gems as it seemed like that was their last hope in defeating the Executor, a Super Star Destroyer.

# Section 2

After joining the Rebel Alliance, Chewbacca and Han Solo obtained the gem and handed it over to the Alliance.
Not long after, the resistance engaged in the Battle of Yavin.
Their main goal was to destroy the Executor.
General Jan Dodonna’s son Vrad took the gem and attempted to break the Executor’s shield.
This action turned out to be in vain, as the Executor's shields, despite being weakened, was up and running.
The gem was drained of all its power, and the Alliance failed to complete its goal.
Had Vrad not committed that brave action against the Executor, the Alliance would never have evacuated the Yavin 4 base.

# Section 3

While there was still a lot of power Ggems, which remained in the galaxy, most of them lost a lot of their power and became somewhat useless.
Most of them crashed on planets and were left buried on the planet's surface.
Another hunt for the Power Gems began during the Galactic Civil War, but they already lost their shield-breaking capabilities.
They could be used to disrupt the shields of small enemy vessels and increase the ability of a ship to dodge much more efficiently.
However, the power gems scattered amongst the galaxy will inevitably lose their abilities and become just simple relics.
