# Introduction

Located within the Interior region of the Hapes cluster on the planet of Gallinore, lived the silicon-based lifeforms known as Rainbow Gems.
Although they were not such beings at first, their traditional forms are primarily the gems, which matured and began to glow from their inner light after many millenia creating their physical forms.
But in their gem forms, they were considered a high-value target for purchases, as even having one could lead to the purchase of a Mon Calamari Cruiser.
The princess of Hapes, Tenel Ka Djo, had a tiara of these rainbow gems which was valued at the price of a small solar system.

Despite these gems being able to obtain a physical form, they could also be used as lightsaber crystals.
Tenel Ka Djo, who also happened to be a Jedi Knight, used some of the gems in her second lightsaber after an incident destroyed her first lightsaber as well as her arm.

As valuable and powerful as they were, they were also nearly untraceable due to the nature of the gems, which led them to being used in a bribe by the Hutts to the Imperial Admiral, Winstel Greelanx in exchange for his plans against the assault of Nar Shaddaa.
The pilot to deliver these gems and collect the plans from the Admiral was none other than Han Solo, who found out the only reason he wanted the gems was so he could retire after the attack and its eventual failure after the rebels created defensive measures for the planet.
