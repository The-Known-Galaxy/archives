# Introduction

The Aeon Engine was a engine designed by Lady Corvax, the device was created in order to harness and absorb the energy from the crescent shaped powerful bright star crystal native and sacred to the Mustafarians.
Lady Corvax constructed the device in hopes to resurrect her deceased husband.
Lady Crovax paid for her actions greatly when the crystal instead of resurrecting her husband spewed out dangerous waves of deadly energy, ultimately terraforming the planet's surface into a volcanic one.
Legends of Lady Corvax's attempt to resurrect her husband even spread to the Imperial era when Darth Vader used the Aeon Engine to restore his wife Padme Amidala back to life.
His plan almost would succeed if it wasn't for one of Lady Corvaxes descendants using the lightsaber of the Black Bishop into the Bright star, ultimately destroying the engine forever.
