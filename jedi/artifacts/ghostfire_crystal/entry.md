# Introduction

While many different types of crystals can be collected across the galaxy, some being more rare than others.
There is one type of crystal that sets itself apart from its crystal counterparts, this is the Ghostfire Crystal.
Growing from rocky forming, but almost invisible spires on mountain peaks across a few planets in the Outer Rim Territories, this crystal has interesting effects that have proven useful when combined with a lightsaber.
It can also be purchased for the high cost of 14,000 credits, making it as valuable as it is rare to even find one.

# Section 1

The effects of the Ghostfire Crystal when used in a lightsaber makes it a challenge to duel against, with the illusions that can form from the motion of the blade creating an afterimage of the wielder’s movement.
It also makes little to no sound and is nearly invisible when ignited, leaving a ghost-like essence surrounding the beam itself, but burns cold like any other saber hence the full name.
The combination of illusions, limited noise, and visibility of the blade can cause any opponent facing it to become disoriented, even those who have high force sensitivity do not know where the blade truly is when it’s constantly moving.
