# Introduction
The Circlet of Saresh was a headband created to boost its user’s abilities in the Force.
However, it was made in a way so that only someone that was committed to the light side of the Force was able to use it properly.
This Circlet was a gift for a Jedi Knight, Guun Han Saresh, he got it from his father when he entered the Jedi Order in the first place.
The Saresh family were known for their wealth and political power, which allowed Guun Han’s father to obtain this headband in the first place.
However, the family was also known for impudence and lack of respect towards anyone from outside the family.
The Circlet went missing when Guun Han met his end during the Great Hunt, he was devoured by a creature called Terentaket during his attempt to take the beast down.
Years later the headband was found by Revan, he may have used it for a while.
It was also possible that the Circlet made its way to the First Jedi Purge.
