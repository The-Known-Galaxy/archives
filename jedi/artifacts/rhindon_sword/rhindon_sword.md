# Introduction
The Rhindon Sword was a ceremonial blade, which was important to Alderaanian culture.
Every upcoming ruler of Alderaan would carry this sword on their Day of Demand, where they claimed their right to the throne.
It signified how, in the past, some had to fight their way to the throne.

# Section 1
This sword was also carried during the coronation of each heir.
When unused, the sword would hang in the Royal Palace.
Princess Leia found the Rhindon Sword quite heavy at first, though she later overcame this with enough training.
The blade was destroyed in the year 0 BBY, along with the rest of Alderaan.
