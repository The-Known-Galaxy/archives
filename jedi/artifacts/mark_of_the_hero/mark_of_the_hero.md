# Introduction
The esteemed Mark of the Hero was a powerful emblem that was awarded to an intrepid individual who demonstrated exceptional valor and gallantry during the intense conflict known as the Galactic Civil War.
This momentous honor was bestowed upon those select few spacers whose unwavering commitment and selfless acts effectively safeguarded the welfare of inhabitants residing in Tatooine's volatile terrain.
The impressive ring, imbued with immense might, was believed to possess the ability to revive its wearer from the brink of demise.

# Section 1
The Mark of the Hero was originally in the possession of a reclusive Rodian hermit who lived in a squill cave on Tatooine.
In 1 ABY, a spacer who was exploring the cave met the hermit and expressed their disapproval of the Galactic Empire.
The hermit asked the spacer to retrieve a squill skull from the mouth of the cave, which they did.
After this, the hermit tasked the spacer with four more heroic acts on Tatooine.
The adventurer eagerly accepted the challenge.
The first task was to deduce who was the target of a troubled bounty hunter.
The spacer showed intelligence and resourcefulness, discovering that the target was the hermit himself.
The second task involved refusing to be corrupted by pirates.
The spacer displayed great honor and integrity by standing up to the pirates and refusing their bribes.
The third task was to kill a ferocious bladeback boar, which required courage and bravery.
Lastly, the spacer assisted a moisture farmer in distress by rescuing his family from the Sennex slavers.
The act of altruism demonstrated the spacer's selflessness and compassion.



# Section 2
After the four tasks were completed, the spacer returned to the hermit and reported their success.
The hermit was impressed with the adventurer's bravery and heroism and declared them the Hero of Tatooine.
In gratitude for their efforts, the hermit bestowed upon them four tokens of virtue: one symbolizing intellect; another representing honor; courage; and the last exemplifying altruism.
These trophies formed a unique spherical sculpture that was a symbol of the spacer's accomplishments.
The hermit also gifted the spacer with the Mark of the Hero.
Through the sands of time, the artifact known only as the Mark of the Hero gained legendary status on Tatooine, as generation after generation reverently bestowed its symbol of courage and valor upon the most daring souls who exhibited such admirable traits.
Those who followed ancient tales often held beliefs that its mystical energies could provide aid to the bares in their moments of greatest strife.
The tale of the Hero of Tatooine and their noble deeds roused many others to bravely shoulder the responsibility of championing the downtrodden against the injustices of tyranny and oppression.
