# Introduction

Archways located in the ruins outside the city of Satikan on the planet Asation were called hypergates.
Two archways ended on the planet Gree, others on the worlds Te Hasa, Malanose and Licha In.
It is unknown to this day where the remaining ones are located.
The gate was activated from the central obelisk, the control point.
The gatemaster, however, had long forgotten the secrets of using such technology.
He had repeatedly tried to figure out how to operate the unique hypergate, but to no avail.
