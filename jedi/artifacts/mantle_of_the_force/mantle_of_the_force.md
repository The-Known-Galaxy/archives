# Introduction
The Mantle of the Force was a powerful crystal that provided a cyan blade to a lightsaber.
This crystal was rediscovered by Suvam Tan and bought by the Jedi, Revan.
Revan bought the crystal from Suvam Tan close to the end of his search for the Star Forge, another legendary crystal called the Heart of the Guardian.
He discovered that the properties of the crystal altered-when put together with another crystal  in a single lightsaber, would improve their force abilities.
