# Introduction
What Master Vodo had created was not an ordinary wooden staff, he created his staff with the help of the Force and imbued a huge amount of power in it.
This staff provided help for the Master while he kept aging and also served as an alternative weapon that he would use in combat instead of his lightsaber.
One day Master Baas’ staff broke while he was having an argument with one of his own students.
Shortly after that he repaired it, but went on without using it in combat for some time.
His former student, Exar Kun, the one he was sparring with earlier, had fallen to the dark side of the force.
Knowing this, Master Vodo began preparing for an encounter with this fallen Jedi.
Master Vodo’s last fight began on Coruscant when he engaged Kun in a duel.
He was able to hold his fallen student off until Kun activated another blade on his double-bladed lightsaber.
Not being able to withstand continuous hits, the staff shattered in pieces again and Master Vodo quickly met his end after that.
