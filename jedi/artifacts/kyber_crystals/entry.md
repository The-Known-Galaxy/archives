# Introduction

The Kyber crystal is most commonly known as the heart or power source of the Jedi’s lightsaber.
The crystal was able to emit a blade of plasma when a laser is projected through it.
These blades are what we call Lightsabers.
The crystal itself is attuned in the force and displays many characteristics of living organisms.
The attunement with the force is what gives the crystal its life-like appearance; being able to produce ressonations that “call” or “sing” to specific individuals.
The crystals are inherently aligned with the light side of the force and have a will of their own.
If a crystal is used by a dark side user - or simply used for the dark side - it will attempt to escape or resist its use.
This characteristic led to those dark side users who sought out kyber crystals as weapons needed some way to bend them to their own will.
This desire led to the practice of “bleeding” the kyber crystal.
Upon being corrupted, the kyber crystal will turn a shade of red or crimson and thus giving the name to the ritual as “bleeding”.
This colouration became synonymous with the Sith and their lightsabers.
Later in galactic history, the creation of synthetic kyber crystals became a more viable option for dark side users to obtain usable crystals.

# Section 1

A kyber crystal can be found on an array of different planets, almost anywhere in the galaxy could be a potential location for kyber crystal formation.
However, the formation and location of kyber crystals are extremely rare.
The crystals are made from organic and inorganic matter, some being able to be found in the cores of stars.
The formation of kyber crystals requires a specific vein of material to be present, this being pure veins of “Kyberite”.
Any impurities whatsoever would render the Kyber Crystal to be considered “False Kyber”.
Typically, the veins of Kyberite would be brought to the surface of planets through tectonic plate movements.
One of the most famed kyber crystal locations was the frozen planet of Ilum.
This planet was rich with caverns of kyber crystals, enough to be kept a secret of the Jedi upon its discovery.

# Section 2

The kyber crystal will remain colourless in its natural state, awaiting a force sensitive being for it to “choose”.
Once the crystal has been found by means of the Crystal Gathering Ceremony or by chance of stumbling across it, the colour will change to suit the finder.
The most common of these colours being Blue and Green, although many other colours could be chosen.
The only known natural colours are: Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Purple, Cyan, Magenta, Indigo and the extremely rare case of Black.
Shades and hues may vary slightly depending on the owner.

# Section 3

The colour of the crystal has significant meaning, and will portray the type of Jedi the owner is.
Blue means they are a guardian, a defender and a peacekeeper.
Green means they are a diplomat, a negotiator and a learner.
Yellow means they are a balance between Blue and Green, typically used by temple guards.
Orange is unique in the way it represents a strong pull to the dark side but chose the light side, some also say orange can come from a partially purified crystal.
Purple represents an owner who uses the slight darkness inside them, and is said to be a blue crystal that bled itself a small amount.
Cyan is a variant of Blue, not much is known about the differences.
Magenta and Indigo have no known meaning.
Alongside the natural colours, other colours have been seen to exist.
White and Red have been observed, but have never been found naturally.
Red comes from the aforementioned Bleeding Ritual or synthetic crystals developed by the Sith, and White is created by a separate ritual known as ‘Purifying”.
The purification process is generally used on kyber crystals that have previously been bled, as a form of bringing them back to the light.
This process is known to be extremely difficult, and requires a strong connection to the light side of the force.

# Section 4

Larger forms of kyber crystals have been found to exist, and the use of kyber crystals in weapons other than lightsabers has been achieved.
The ancient Sith empires had been known to create vast super weapons, all at heart contained a kyber crystal.
Such weapons had extreme destructive capabilities and powerful uses, however, experimenting and working with crystals against their will led to certain side effects.
As mentioned, the crystals have their own will, and will resist any means that are against its will.
This can cause headaches, visions, loss of sleep and insanity in those working closely to the crystals.
Such experimentations led to the creation of the DS-1 Battlestation, the unknown superweapon on Malachor as well as planetary development tools used by the Jedi.
The power behind these large crystals is unstable, and working with them is dangerous to all parties involved, therefore the use of them by the Jedi was ceased and remained a practice of the Sith.

# Section 5

A kyber crystals resilience to the elements led to them being worshipped by species before the Jedi and Sith.
They have a natural resistance to fire and extreme pressure, their intricate structures were seen as mesmerizing and their near impermeability made them appear otherworldly or ethereal.
The Jedi amassed a near exclusive right to all kyber crystals, as their affiliation with the light made them the perfect match.
Some saw this as greed, and lost trust in the Jedi.
Others saw it as the protection of the Galaxy and preservation of the crystals, keeping them from sinister and dark uses.
