# Introduction

This entity was a Monolith of moving technology.
It was launched by the Gree millenia ago who were well known for their expertise in advanced transportation and weapon technology.

The Gree over time descended into a more primitive species, losing the knowledge they once had.
Thus, when the Gray Secant, a massive cruiser filled with ancient Gree technology was rediscovered hovering over Ilum, they were overjoyed to pry into its secrets.

However, they were challenged by both the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic who were in the middle of the Galactic War and also sought its secrets to gain the upper hand.

# Section 1

The spaceship was peculiarly shaped and differed from any cruisers from the nations of 3640 BBY.
This in itself is what drew much attention from many galactic superpowers.
It had a center rung with propulsion systems that fueled the center, and (4) circular pillars that arched downwards and around the center rung.
It was impervious to normal sensory technology and had defensive and transportation capabilities that crushed that of any other starship of the time.

# Section 2

The Gree starship was originally a scientific embark vessel when it was created.
It was used to discover, document, and store information, artifacts and history gathered from all the areas of space it ventured through.

It was however lost on this journey, and the details surrounding this are far and few between.

Once it reappeared over Ilum, the Battle of Ilum later followed.
The Galactic Republic and the Sith respectively, attempted to use the implications of this battle to win over the Gree so that they could retrieve the secrets of the Gray Secant.
