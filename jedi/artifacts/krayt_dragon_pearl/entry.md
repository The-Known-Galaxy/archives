# Introduction

The Krayt Dragon Pearl or more formally known as simply a stone, was used to help feed Krayt Dragons, by either Tusken Raiders (who were familiar with them) or trainers.
These stones varying in size and shape were used so often that they became circular pearls, and this shape alongside its physical properties made it attractive and valuable.

Pearls varied in colour from emerald, blue, crimson, white and black.
Each colour would presumably make it more or less valuable to certain customers.
The pearls had a reflective quality that made it more beautiful and luminous in the light, and it’s outer layer was transparent revealing a bright core in the center.

These pearls worked similarly to a Kyber crystal, and they were actually used in lightsabers.
They had to however be cleaned rigorously and treated with special products to prepare it adequately for the chamber of a lightsaber.
This difficult task made it very rare to see a Jedi with a lightsaber stemming from a Krayt Dragon pearl.

These pearls were incredibly valuable and often sold for over (100,000) credits each.
The Tusken Raiders had integrated the symbol of Krayt Dragon pearls into their culture, and to them it signified a sign of bravery.

# Section 2

The most famous individual involved with this item was Revan, who on one of his many adventures helped a man named Komad Fortuna kill a Krayt dragon for its pearls.
It’s presumed that he gave it to the Tusken raiders as a sign of respect, inserted it into his lightsaber or sold it altogether.

Unfortunately, another notable event includes Bastila Shan’s father.
He wanted to acquire a pearl to pay for his wife’s chronic and terminal illness.
He however died in the process of trying to kill the Krayt Dragon, which is how Bastila Shan came to grow without parents.

Finally, Han Solo used a Krayt Dragon pearl in a gambling game with Lando Calrissian to win over the Millenium Falcon.
This event still sends quakes throughout the casino worlds who often share this momentous story.
