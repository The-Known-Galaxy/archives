# Introduction
The eye of Koda was a gem-encrusted amulet that served as a map.
Named after the legendary Krin Koda, the eye showed and led to the planet which was the host of the Tempresto Temple on Koda's World.
It said that the Eye was bestowed upon Koda by the Tempresto after he saved their lives.
When Koda passed away the amulet passed onto multiple owners and it seemed to become unlucky, bringing the new owners death and misfortune.
