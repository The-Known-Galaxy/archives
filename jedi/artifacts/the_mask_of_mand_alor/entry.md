# Introduction

Mandalorian warrior culture places a strong emphasis on armour and personal identity.
The Mandalorians from their earliest days of taking to the stars have always taken pride in their appearance and identity as a way to spread their name throughout the galaxy and be easily identifiable as some of the fiercest warriors in history.

Of all the Mandalorian relics and trophies in existence, few are as remarkable and memorable as the mask worn by the earliest Mand’alors during the days of their initial conquests and invasions against the Galactic Republic.

The Mand’alor serves as the sole ruler of the Mandalorian warrior culture and has been a traditional position held by all Mandalorians who follow the way of the ancestors since the initial establishment of Mandalorian society.
As such, only the mightiest of Mandalorian warlords has ever had the privilege of donning their hallmark of Mandalorian intimidation.

# Section 1

The mask would be crafted by Mand’alor the First, after he spearheaded the extinction of the mythosaur species, an act so difficult and mighty that the planet the extinction took place on would be named after Mand’alor the First, Mandalore.
He would craft this mask from the bones of a fallen Mythosaur and as a result the mythosaur would forever become the most notable symbol of Mandalorian warrior society.

The mask would be traditionally passed down from Mand’alor to the next worthiest candidate, and this ceremony would usually take place through combat.
Only the most capable of Mandalorian warriors would be granted the right to wear the mask, it was not only enough to defeat the current Mand’alor, but one must then earn and maintain the respect of the various Mandalorian Clans in order to be deemed worthy of the mask.

This tradition would change slightly during the era of Mand’alor the Indomitable.
Where once a warrior would have to defeat the current Mand’alor and overthrow him, the tradition would now allow any Mandalorian who found the mask or was the first to come across it after the death of a Mand’alor to officially don the title.
However, this made the task of uniting and keeping the various Mandalorian Clans in line no less difficult.
This altered tradition would become most notable when Mand’alor the Ultimate, initially a Mandalorian Crusader under the command of Mand’alor the Indomitable, would stumble upon the mask when searching for Mand’alor the Indomitable who had just been shot down over the jungles of Onderon.

After an almost crippling defeat for the Mandalorian Crusaders, Mand’alor the Ultimate took the time to utilize the authority of the mask to rebuild Mandalorian society under a far more unified and traditional military system, and before long, the mask would once again be a symbol of fear across the galaxy.

Mand’alor the Ultimate would don the mask for the entirety of the Mandalorian Wars and the Republic quickly grew to understand the mask’s cultural significance.
When Mand’alor the Ultimate was slain in single combat by the Jedi General Revan, Revan would take the mask into hiding for fear of allowing it to fall into enemy hands.
Such was the importance of this mask that the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders would fall into disarray and be unable to decide upon a new leader, resulting in the Neo-Crusaders disbanding into various Clans and organisations.

The mask wouldn’t be seen again until Revan, after defeating the Sith Lord Malak with the assistance of his good friend and Mandalorian, Canderous Ordo, felt that Canderous Ordo was worthy enough to take the mask and refrain from making the same mistakes his predecessors did.
Canderous Ordo would willingly take the mask of Mand’alor and unite many of the lost Neo-Crusaders and their Clans into a unified organisation under his rule.
These Mandalorians would go on to become instrumental in defeating the Sith Triumvirate, and it was the mask of Mand’alor that allowed Canderous Ordo to do this.

After the defeat of the Sith Triumvirate it was unclear of what became of Canderous Ordo and the mask, we know that in modern Mandalorian society the symbol of rulership changed to the Darksaber, this may be because the mask was lost to history, or potentially destroyed during one of the many Mandalorian conflicts throughout history.

# Section 2

The mask would undergo various changes by its wearers.
Mand’alors would typically feel as if they needed to alter the mask to suit themselves so that they could stand out from their predecessors.
Most notably the mask would be changed by Canderous Ordo, who would paint it black when it was once various shades of gold and bronze.
The original design would be based upon the features of the Taung, and be of a circular shape however Canderous Ordo’s design would be much more human-like and be altered to be almost cube in shape.

# Section 3

During Canderous Ordo’s initial claim to the title of Mand’alor he was forced to unite the Mandalorian Clans like his predecessors had done before him.
During this quest he met one of the last of the Taung species, a dying warrior who disputed the authenticity of Ordo’s mask and denounced Mand’alor the Ultimate as a pretender to the title.
This Taung claimed to be the true Mand’alor and that he was in possession of the true mask, but this was never proven nor discredited.
Canderous would honour the dying Taung by wearing his armour as his own and modifying the mask to fit the Taung’s armour.
