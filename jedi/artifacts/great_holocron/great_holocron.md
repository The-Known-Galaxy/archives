# Introduction
The Great Holocron was an ancient and significant artifact of the Jedi Order.
It is a transparent dodecahedron with twelve standard pentagonal faces.
The artifact itself consists of several crystal facets that show the inner-workings and are held by sturdy electrum frames.

# Section 1
Kept within the halls of the Jedi Archives in Coruscant, it is the most valuable artifact of the Order and is usually seen as the centerpiece of the Great Library.
Encouraged by the Jedi Masters, younglings were able to explore the Holocron’s vast knowledge and secrets, though easily accessible by all members of the Jedi Order, members who wish to use the artifact are only given the knowledge that the Holocron deems the user is capable to wield.
It is also believed that unlocking its secrets was impossible even by the likes of Grandmaster Yoda or Master Jocasta Nu.



# Section 2
Following the rise of the Galactic Empire and the Great Jedi Purge that followed it, this artifact has been lost and is presumed captured by Darth Vader and the 501st Legion during the raid on the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.
Eventually, on 40 ABY it was recovered by the New Jedi Order and was relocated to the Jedi Academy on Ossus under the watchful eye of Master Tionne Solusar.
Though skeptical if the artifact is indeed the one in Coruscant, she continued to update its knowledge and information.
