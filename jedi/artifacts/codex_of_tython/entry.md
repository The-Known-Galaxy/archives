# Introduction

The Codex of Tython, a Jedi holocron that has an unknown creation date but was founded in 1 ABY.
The codex was made up of fragmented pieces that, if connected, would make the shape of an icosahedron.
The information inside included over a millennium of technological information and advancements, images and recordings of several worlds and cultures and even the schematics for a tractor beam strong enough to move asteroids.
The codex was rumored to be one of the oldest secrets the Jedi Order held.

# Section 1

One of the fragments of the Codex was found on Dantooine by a Rebel agent.
They found the piece after crashing their landspeeder into a cache of Jedi relics.
After the agent had seen some of the technological advancements the fragment held, he felt the best option was to deliver it for the Republicâ€™s use.
This task however, would have trouble as the discovery of the Codex was now known to the Galactic Empire shortly after its discovery.
The agent was making his way to a space port to travel when he was engaged by multiple stormtroopers led by Captain Adrick of the Galactic Empire.
The agent was luckily saved by a Zabrak Jedi named Drakka Judarrl.
Judarrl used the Jedi ability of illusions to make a diversion for the agent to escape.

# Section 2

Once the agent and Judarrl were able to get to a safer location, the Jedi explained the Codex and how it was not completed.
There were three other fragments that were needed in order to unlock the Jedi holocron in its entirety.
The agent had to obtain the others from people such as Grand Admiral Andal Sait, Nightsister Axkva Sait and even Dark Jedi Mellichae.
Once the agent was able to complete this quest and reassemble the Codex.
Judarrl received it to study the secrets within with Rebel Alliance agents standing guard to protect her.

# Section 3

This great victory that the Republic had did not live on for long.
Shortly after obtaining the Codex it would be stolen from Judarrl by an ISB agent of the Empire to be successfully delivered to Grand Admiral Andal Sait and his Imperial-class Star Destroyer the Blackguard.
The Admiral would only use the Codex schematics of the tractor beam and install it to his star destroyer.
