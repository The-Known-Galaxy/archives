# Introduction
Heart of Fire was a stone known to be found on Planet Kiffu.
The stone was commonly a red shiny and glowing stone, though some were blue.
These blue stones were often worth more and prized due to this fact.
It was a part of Kiffu tradition to give one of these stones to someone they care about or love.
It was believed the stones held parts of the receiver's and giver's spirits.
Jedi Master Quinlan Vos gave one to his Padawan Aayla Secura for their birthday, before the stone was then given to Xiaan Amersu once they grew up.
The stone would be returned to Quinlan later on when they returned to the Jedi Temple with Amnesia.
Another one of these stones would be given to Kiffar bounty hunter Sintas Vel by her husband Boba Fett.
She kept the pendant for many years till her disappearance.
Boba’s granddaughter Mirta Gev was asked to read the stone to see what happened to Sinta, however, she was unable to.
They would find a former Jedi posing as Kiffar to read the stone, giving them a lead that would reveal she was alive and encased in carbonite.
Boba and Mirta would recover and then revive Sintas on Mandalore.
Despite being both blind and amnesiac once she awakened, she asked for the stone straight away.
Boba would buy a larger stone but this would contain his memories since he left her.
She would refuse the stone at first before then reading it after Mirta married Ghes Orade.
