# Introduction
Jedi credits were metal tokens.
They were given solely to Jedi Masters and close family members of said Master.

# Section 1
Jedi Credit could also be referred to as Jedi Medallions, or Jedcred for short.
Jedi Credit was usually made of metal and had the Jedi Order logo imprinted on it.
The credit itself was not massive.
It reached the size of a regular coin.
When a Jedi knight reached the rank of Jedi Master, not only would they receive a Jedi credit, but his close family members, his students, as well as his master would receive said credits.



# Section 2
It would appear as if most Jedi did not acknowledge their Jedi Credit.
It seemed like Jedi Credit was only a badge of recognition, which served no function at all.
Jedi Thame Cerunial placed his Jedi Credit in a copy of the Jedi training manual, “The Jedi Path,” to keep his credit safe and undamaged.

The Jedi Credit was not completely useless as a Corelian pilot Corran Horn received it from his father, Valin Horn, who inherited it from his father, Nejaa Halcyon.
Corran was unaware of his grandfather's legacy.
Corran wore the Jedi Credit on a golden chain.
Later on, Corran used his Jedi Credit to propose to Mirax.
That same Jedi Credit later became an important heirloom in the Horn family.
However, it would seem like all across the galaxy, the Jedi credit only worked as a badge of recognition and served no purpose, nor did it contain any capabilities to assist Jedi Masters in battle.
