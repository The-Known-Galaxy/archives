# Introduction
The Infinite Engine was a device made by the Sith Lord Darth Revan, whereas it was also a piece of the Rakatan Star Forge.
Throughout Revan’s adventures and failures, such as Revan’s Empire, he took control of the powerful space station, where he used it to control a fleet that served him in a Sith Empire in the Jedi Civil War.
Instead of him taking the whole engine, he only took a fragment of it, due to him learning that it had a far greater potential creating galaxies in even time.

The Engine’s power could manipulate energy and create anything the owner desired; it was a powerful artifact whereas it could create the list of air to food or shelter.
This Engine had a lot of adventures throughout time, where it was also awarded to many Ongree servants of Revan who were placed as the machine’s security, who were protected also by assassin droids to attack those who sought the machine.

Due to the care of the Ongree, Revan taught his servants that their generations should be offered to the Engine that gave its power to the Ongree.
The Machine gave amounts of essential items for the aliens to continue their existence, not leading to extinction.
To show the machine was as powerful as thought to be, it was similar to the Jedi Order meaning when a Jedi dies the Force shall lie with them, whereas the machine would offer the Ongree’s body to the Engine that could absorb their forms of energy as a resting offer of their kind.
