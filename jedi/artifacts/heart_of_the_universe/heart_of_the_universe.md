# Introduction

The Heart of the Universe was a Force-imbued gemstone, created around the Galactic Republic era.
The gem was imbued with great power, but the powers were never truly understood except by the master and creator of this imbued gemstone, Jedi Master Jaled Dur.
Stolen during the Galactic Civil War, it came into the hands of the Dark Jedi Croym.
He kept the imbued gemstone in his tower that resides on an asteroid.
