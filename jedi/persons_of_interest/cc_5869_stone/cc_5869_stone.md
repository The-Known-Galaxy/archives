# Introduction

CC-5869, also called “Stone”, was a clone trooper commander that served as a Coruscant Guard within the Grand Army of the Republic.
He worked within the Diplomatic Escort Group, which meant that he was tasked with protecting and escorting Republic officials and diplomats during dangerous assignments.
He, just like every other clone trooper, was created and trained on Kamino.
Stone was trained in both armed and unarmed combat, reconnaissance, and military tactics.
He wore standard Phase 1 armor that was painted with red to signify the Coruscant guard.
He had a tattoo that read 58 on the left side of his forehead.
While serving in a mission on Florrum, Commander Stone had to serve under Representative Jar Jar Binks, which he found to be pathetic and ridiculous.
But, to follow the chain of command, Stone obeyed the orders given to him, which meant submitting to Representative Binks.
