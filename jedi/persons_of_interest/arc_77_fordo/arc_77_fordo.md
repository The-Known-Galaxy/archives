# Introduction

ARC-77, codenamed “Fordo,” was an Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commando who served as Captain within the Grand Army of the Republic.
He was assigned to a task force led by General Obi-Wan Kenobi in 22 BBY to capture Muunilist which was under full control of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
In the battles and the separatists attempts to take the planet, the Republic forces would soon become triumphant and Fordo along with his group of clone troopers became known as the “Muunilist 10” for their efforts.
In the battle for Muunilist, Fordo proved himself to be a handy instrument to the Republic when he led his troops on a mission to destroy an enemy artillery emplacement, as well as helping Jedi Master Kenobi capture San Hill who was the leader of the operations in the emplacement.
