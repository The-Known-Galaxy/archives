# Introduction
Fi Skirata was a Clone Trooper also known as RC-8015 who was a Commando in Teroch Squad who was later changed to Omega Squad with him serving as the team’s sniper and medic.
The same as every clone Fi started on the water city of Kamino.
He was taught by Kal Skirata when he was in his early years of life and first served in the first battle of the Clone Wars, Geonosis.
In the battle Fi’s entire squad was slaughtered making the Republic reassign him to Omega Squad with his new squadmates RC-1309 (Niner Skirata), RC-1136 (Darman Skirata) and RC-3222 (Atin Skirata).
The squad went on many missions with their first being to the planet of Qiilura to sabotage a seperatist base with Darman ejecting too soon and landing far away from his squad yet finding a padawan by the name of Etain Tur-Mukan.
Darman later met up with his squad once more and with his squad captured Ovolot Quail Uthan yet failed to take out Ghez Hokan without Etain’s help who finally made the Mandalorian meet his match.

# Section 1
His final mission was to the planet of Gaftikar where he was presumably injured due to a notice of his death coming later to the Republic’s attention.
The notice says that he died of Brain Trauma yet some still say they saw him roaming around quite a bit later yet it is thought it is a lookalike.
Still to this day we do not know if he survived this Trauma only he  is the one who knows.
It has also been seen that this person had none of Fi’s humor or joy as he seemed to be sad and lonely which is the complete opposite of Fi’s normal self.
Yet he did have brain trauma after all so we will never know.
