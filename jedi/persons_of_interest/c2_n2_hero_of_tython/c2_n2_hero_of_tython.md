# Introduction
C2-N2 was a golden-plated, third degree service and protocol droid with masculine programming, who served on a Defender-class light corvette.
Created by Automata Galactica, a company that would later merge with Industrial Intelligence in 873 BBY to form Industrial Automaton and produce the R series astromechs, C2-N2 was one of the most advanced steward droids of his time.
Serving with the Hero of Tython for both the Galactic War and prior Cold War, he spent the bulk of his time caring for the Hero’s crew, including Kira Carson, Archiban Kimble, Fideltin Rusk and Lord Scourge.
C2-N2 was not designed for combat, but had effective first aid programming, capable of healing most injuries that arose throughout the war.
As a service and protocol droid, C2-N2 was proficient in a range of tasks, including but not limited to; engineering, cooking, maintenance, surveillance, diplomacy and cleaning.
After the Hero’s disappearance following the invasion of the Eternal Empire, C2-N4 and the Hero’s crew separated, with C2-N2 eventually arriving on the Alliance world of Odessen where he would act as a steward and assistant for the Alliance Commander and the various Alliance Specialists.
