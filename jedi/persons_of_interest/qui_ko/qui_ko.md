# Introduction
Qui-Ko was a human male Je’daii Temple Master in the ancient Je'daii Order.
Before he achieved the rank of Je’daii Master, he was interested in the will of the Force and its features.
As such, he studied the Force and wrote many texts on his studies and various visions.
He particularly focused on the study of the Ashla otherwise known as the light side of the Force.
Qui-Ko’s teachings and studies were officially featured in the Archives of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where they were used by many Jedi to compare the newly analyzed teachings of the Force to the old teachings of the Force.
