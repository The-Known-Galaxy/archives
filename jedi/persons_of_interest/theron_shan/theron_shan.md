# Introduction
Theron Shan was a human male under the Shan family.
He was the Son of Satele Shan and Supreme Chancellor Jace Malcohm.
During his time growing up Satele would send him to be trained under her former master Ngani Zho, and would train him to become a skilled duelist until Ngani would eventually realize that Theron is not force sensitive.
Because of this he had to be exiled from the Jedi Order.
Even though he couldn’t become a Jedi he still found other ways to support the Jedi; He ended up becoming a republic soldier and would very quickly rise the ranks during his life with the republic.

# Section 1
Theron would eventually become a field agent for the Republic and would rise the ranks very quickly.
During his time as a field agent, he was sent on a mission to spy on the Empire who were rumored to be working on a superweapon called the Ascendant Spear.
This led to the Sith finding out about his agent's existence, capturing them in the process.
This led to them finally confirming that they are indeed working on a superweapon that could be a major threat to the Galaxy if they ended up finding a way to escape.
His former master Ngani Zho sacrificed himself to let them escape with their lives.
This led to a confrontation with Theron and a Sith lord known as Darth Mekhis, The duel was Fierce but resulted in Theron's victory, Theron would then prepare to fight back and attempt to destroy the Ascendant Spear with the help of Jedi Master Gnost-Dural.
He would become successful and would leave the planet a hero of the Republic, He was awarded the Cross of Glory for eliminating both her predecessors and the enemy would nickname Theron the threat known as Technoplaugue.



# Section 2
During the Rise of the emperor, the Republic found itself in a difficult situation again, resulting in the emperor creating a whole new Empire known as the Eternal Empire.
This new threat would be a massive problem for both the Republic and the Empire, who would team together to create the Alliance which resulted in them putting their differences aside for the greater good and working together to take out the Eternal Empire.
Theron played massive roles in the Alliance and created many game-changers during the war, such as taking place in many missions, engaging in spy work to spot traps, and other things that brought importance to their war efforts.
But the most important part he did in the war, was when he tricked the Eternal Empire that he was betraying the Alliance resulting in the Eternal Empire letting their guard down and revealing many of their secrets.
Eventually, he was told about the location of the superweapon known as the God Zildrog.
With this information, Theron was able to use this knowledge and bring it to the Alliance, resulting in its destruction.
