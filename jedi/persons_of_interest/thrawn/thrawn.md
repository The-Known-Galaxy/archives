# Introduction
Grand Admiral Thrawn, known as Mitth’raw’nuruodo to his people, and his core name simply Thrawn, was a male Chiss born on the planet Csilla most known for his cutting-edge brilliance in martial logistics, eruditism, and his renowned skill in warfare.
His rise across the Imperial ranks despite the infamous speciesist military policies of the Empire is a true testament to his capabilities.
He was the only alien Grand Admiral to have ever existed at any point in time.

# Section 1
His long span of careers first began in the Defense Force of the Chiss Ascendancy where he served as an officer, fervently displaying his brilliance in logistics, tactics, and martiability.
Despite his natural talent, many among the Ascendancy would abhor the idea of pre-emptive and or preventive strikes, even with the early presence of Yuuzhan-Vong already appearing from amongst the Unknown Regions.
With his constant incursions beyond Chiss territories, he would encounter the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, who had the double-identity of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine.
After the two came to know the extent of danger posed by the Unknown Regions, they would effectively agree to silence the Republic movements in the region by destroying the Republic exploration ship Outbound Flight, killing many Jedi in the process as they may draw the ire and attention of the Yuuzhan-Vong.



# Section 2
Due to his repeated offenses, Mitth’raw’nuruodo would be exiled from the Chiss Ascendancy into a far-flung uninhabited planet within the fringes of the Ascendancy’s borders, eventually being encountered by Navy Officer Voss Parck in the Unknown Regions and brought to now Emperor Palpatine.
Having taken note from Thrawn’s adept experience within the Ascendancy, he would approve his admission into the Imperial Navy despite the ongoing speciesist policies of the Empire limiting aliens to a bare minimum.
As the Galactic Civil War sparked and went ahead, Thrawn would rapidly rise through the Imperial ladder, eventually reaching the rank of Grand Admiral.
He was fully aware that defending the Ascendancy as an Imperial officer would be far less difficult and more coordinated than returning to the Chiss altogether.
He would form a secretive empire of his own in the Unknown Regions amassing men and resources as a bulwark to the Yuuzhan-Vong.



# Section 3
By the year of the Battle of Endor, Thrawn would still be heavily occupied in the Unknown Regions as the Emperor fell, the Imperial officers disintegrated into shambling warlords and the Second Death Star’s fall.
He would return in 8 ABY, bringing an armada of 6 Imperial Star-Destroyers among other ships forming a military confederation on the fringes of the fledgling New Republic’s borders launching devastating raids and attacks upon the important worlds and assets of the region.
Any hope of restoring the Empire would not come to be with his very untimely death in 9ABY at the hands of his Noghri bodyguard Rukh.
Despite this, there are many rumors surrounding his empire in the Unknown Regions and tales of his clones in hiding, preparing to defend the known galaxy from threats in the unknown.
