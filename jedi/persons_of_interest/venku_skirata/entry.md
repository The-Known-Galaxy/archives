# Introduction

Venku Skirata, a Male Force-sensitive Human, born on the planet of Mandalore in the Outer Rim, 20 BBY, they were born from a Jedi Knight mother in Etain Tur-Mukan and a clone father in secret from the Jedi Order.
The father was a clone commando, RC-1136 known as Darman.
Due to Venku’s mother being a Jedi, Etain was fearful of telling anyone about her pregnancy and eventual birth of Venku on the planet of Mandalore, so that he may be raised by his  grandfather, Mandalore Kal Skirata.
The clan of Kal, would refer to Venku as Kad as that is what his father Darman said he would have named a child before he even knew that Venku was his.
He would not be raised by his mother or father, with his mother dying during Order 66 even though she had left the Jedi Order, she tried to intervene when seeing clones and Jedi fighting, leading to her death from a lightsaber.
Venku’s father would remain alive, Order 66 hadn’t changed Darman’s love for both Venku and Etain.
He worked within the Empire, secretly looking for ways to keep his son safe from the Imperials, due to his Force sensitivity, which caused him to be highly in danger at all times.
Venku would be raised in the culture of Mandalore.

# Section 1

Before Venku had been born, Kal Skirata had seeked out Ko Sai, who was the Kaminoan responsible for the clones accelerated growth.
Clones were made to grow quickly into adults, becoming one in just a few years, so they’d be ready for battle quickly.
He bargained with Ko Sai and managed to gain a few sequences of the growth genes after allowing Ko Sai to study Venku’s genome.
Ko Sai would eventually take their own life but this had allowed many of the Skirata including Venku to have a normal growth span, letting them experience proper life.
When Venku was just a newborn before Order 66 he did get to spend time with his mother and father, his mother would stop by whenever her duties as Jedi General were over and eventually after a year of Venku’s birth, Darman would be told of his fatherhood.
Venku became a very emotionless child at a young age, he was able to sense his mother’s death.
His father had the ability to possibly escape Coruscant during Order 66, and flee to Mandalore to begin life as a father.
However, he stayed to help an injured clone commando, a fellow Skirata known as Niner, which caused his capture, and an immediate reassignment to Imperial ranks.
Darman never got to fill the duties of his fatherhood.
As Venku was raised he would adapt his name as Kad given to him by his father.
Working as a farmer until eventually growing up and forming a political faction which seeked the regrowth of the Mandalorians, he’d be known to many as Kad’ika and became fairly known.

# Section 2

During his later years, around the time of 40 ABY, his existence had become known by the likes of the current Madalore, Boba Fett, who had been informed of Venku’s political views and was even interested in knowing if Venku was in pursuit of the Mandalore title.
However Venku himself was actually a big supporter of Boba having the title, Boba’s second hand Goran Beviin took quite a liking to Venku’s views and used them to advise Boba when it came to leading the Mandalorians, believing in unity between the many clans when time came and to also to make Mandalore generally a better place.
Boba Fett was asked to take in Venku's advice when Fett struck a deal for a blood sample of a Skirata member to help cure his accelerated ageing.
Venku would come into contact with Boba Fett who was technically his uncle, handing him the previously mentioned Skirata’s bone marrow in order to help Fett bypass his ageing problem, doing so because Fett had actually begun to follow his advice and make changes on Mandalore.
Venku would also assist Fett a little bit more, finding them a translator, that being Bardan Skirata for Fett’s granddaughter Mirta’s pendant, which as a result helped Boba Fett discover more information about his dead wife which, he highly appreciated from Venku.

# Section 3

Venku and Bardan Skirata had established a good relationship.
When Jaina Solo arrived on Mandalore, looking to be taught how to fight like a Mandalorian by Boba Fett, she met the two, Bardan would reveal himself to have been a former Jedi Knight, Venku would be told about his sensitivity to the Force and of who his mother and father truly were and, how valuable Venku would be to the Empire if they found him.
With the possibility of Venku being used to create a new clone army if he was to be captured, Fett was also not aware, due to his nature he could have quickly turned Venku in for a huge reward.
Once Venku knew of his existence more, he proceeded to aid Jaina in increasing her talent in Mandalorian combat.
Eventually she would use these skills to take on her brother, Darth Caedus.
Jaina and Venku would spar in lightsaber combat, Venku using both his mothers sabers.
These spars would greatly help Venku understand himself more and Jaina to become more skilled in the ways of Mandalorian combat, which she used to eventually take on her brother.
