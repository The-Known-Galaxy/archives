# Introduction
Awdrysta Pina was a human Male Jedi Master, choosing to study under the Consular path, one of three distinct schools of thought members of the Order were able to study under following their ascension to Jedi Knight.
Typically, Jedi Consulars preferred diplomatic resolutions in conflicts, and would only refer to combat as a last resort.
They were able to achieve what Guardians did through combat through words and mediation.
However, Master Pina exhibited traits that are not typical of a Consular.


Master Pina had a great taste for battle, and enjoyed fighting on the battlefield, both traits that are very uncommon amongst the Consulars.
He was very proficient in combat, wielding two Force-imbued katanas created in the forges of Vur Tepe.
The blades emitted a soft green glow and were set with emeralds, giving him the alias of "The Green Blade".
Unfortunately, these blades would disappear following his demise.
Despite his craving for battle, Pina still believed that Society needed Order and structure to function properly.

# Section 1
Pina eventually achieved the rank of Master, and soon after Grand Master, due to his exceptional combat prowess and wisdom.
He would spend most of his time away from Ossus, but would be summoned back to the Jedi World to lead the Order in the war against The Legions of Lettow.

Formed by former Jedi Knight Xendor, The Legions of Lettow were a group of force-users who studied under the Bogan, or the Dark Side of the Force.
Xendor would sneakily form the Legionnaires on the planet of Lettow, but the group were soon detected by the Jedi Council.
Deeming this group a threat, Pina led the offensive on many fronts during the war.
He was eventually able to trap Xendor on the planet of Columus, where he was able to slay him.



# Section 2
Pina would eventually meet his demise at the hands of Arden Lyn, the former lover of Xendor, and the newly appointed leader of The Legions of Lettow.
Lyn had used a Talisman that her ex-lover, Xendor, had given her, to shatter Pina's blades and hurl the shards at him.
Adamant, Pina would use the last of his strength to stop Lyn's heart using morichro.
This attempt on her life failed, as Lyn was rescued by a few unknown individuals.
Master Pina would end up dying on the planet of Irkalla following their engagement in 24,500 BBY, his famed blades disappearing with him.
Despite this, The Legions of Lettow were led to a rout.
His duty to defeat all those involved incomplete, and his cravings for combat quelled.
