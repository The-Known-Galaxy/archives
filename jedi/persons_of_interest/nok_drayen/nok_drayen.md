# Introduction
Nok Drayen was a human male born on the planet Dubrillion, during the Great Galactic War.
Nok Drayen was a lesser Smuggler, known by almost no one, and Nok Drayen had no plan to be anyone.
Using a proton torpedo full of Nerve Toxin he stole from the Imperial Navy, Nok Drayen killed off an entire station's worth of people at the Shadowport of Mandellia, where he was credited with killing off half of the Hutt Cartel members in a single night.

He then took off with all the credits and treasures from the station, turning him into one of the wealthiest criminals in galactic history and he used this wealth to forge his own crime syndicate.
Due to what he did at Mandellia, he became feared throughout the underworld, leading to him being given an entire quadrant of the galaxy.
He later gained even more power by destroying and annexing the Rath Cartel and the Vanderhelm Combine during the Syndicate war.



# Section 2
Nok Drayen was present on the smuggler's moon of Nar Shaddaa in 3653 BBY during the “Cold War”, where he and other smugglers discussed how their interests would be affected now the Sith Empire had forced the Republic to surrender.
This was also where he exposed a businessman called Naatu and executed him on the spot.
He then introduced a Sith lord called Darth Angral to the group, who was there to negotiate with them.



# Section 3
Later in  3653 BBY, Nok Drayen was betrayed by one of his Lieutenants who infected him with a ravenous disease that ate away at much of his skin and his right eye.
He replaced the missing parts of his skin and his eye with cybernetics, however, the disease was still destroying his internal organs.
Outraged, Nok killed not only the Lieutenant that infected him but all of his other Lieutenants just to make sure there were no other traitors among them.



# Section 4
Nok had his doctor named Chelah secretly freeze him in carbonite so that he may prolong his death and so that his daughter, Risha Drayen, could try to find a way to cure him of this disease.
She would keep her father’s prolonged existence a secret until.
In 3643 BBY, Risha would decide that it was finally time to reveal the truth, and took her father’s carbonite block to Nar Shaddaa, where Chelah would unfreeze him.
During this short reunion between Nok and Risha, Nok gave Risha the Crown of Dubillion, and told her to retake the crown for herself.
However, she refused and her father spent his last few moments cursing her and telling her how disappointed he was before passing away.
