# Introduction

Count Dooku was a human male, born on the planet Serenno circa 102 BBY.
Dooku was known for his tall and slim stature, allowing him to be very agile on the battlefield.
The infamous Dark Lord was known as a lightsaber duelist, and was very prominent in using Form II, Makashi.
Dooku was slain circa 19 BBY, by Anakin Skywalker in lightsaber combat.

# Section 1

Count Dooku wasn’t always a Dark Lord of the Sith.
Dooku was originally a member of the Jedi Order, trained under Master Yoda of the Jedi High Council.
During his time as a Jedi, Dooku managed to climb the ranks and become a Jedi Master.
When Count Dooku was a youngling, he attended his Initiate trials, hoping to be the chosen Padawan of Lene Kostana.
During the Initiate Trials, Dooku battled a fellow youngling named Sifo-Dyas.
Dooku battled him with one hand behind his back, blindfolded and defeated the youngling.
Though Dooku’s victory was seen by Lene Kostana, she chose Sifo-Dyas over Dooku.
This choice angered Dooku, but soon he was chosen by Grand Master Yoda, which lessened his upsetting attitude.

# Section 2

Count Dooku became disillusioned by the Jedi and their philosophies, he believed that they were corrupt and he wished to leave.
Dooku went to his home planet of Serenno, and claimed the place of Count, overthrowing his blood brother.
Once Dooku had become the new Count, he also inherited his family goods and fortune, becoming immensely rich.
Master Yoda was soon informed by the Count, as he had told him he is leaving the Jedi Order, making him the twelfth member of The Lost Twenty.

# Section 3

Though Dooku was rich and powerful, he was rarely seen by the public eye.
Many theories were created by people about what he had been doing at this time.
During this mysterious period of Dooku’s life, he was encountered by Darth Sidious.
Sidious believed that Count Dooku could be a powerful leader of the new Sepratist Army, and asked Dooku to be the commander of the new army.
Dooku was eventually convinced to join the Dark Side, as Sidious used his hatred for the Jedi order and their philosophies to turn the once Jedi.
During Dooku’s time as a Sith, he led the Sepratist Army to battle against the Clone Army.
During his time as Sith, Dooku enlisted Asajj Ventress, his newfound apprentice of the Dark Side.
He was also trained by Darth Sidious, where he learned how to manipulate the force in dark ways.
Dooku’s life came to an end by the hands of Anakin Skywalker, in the year 19 BBY.
