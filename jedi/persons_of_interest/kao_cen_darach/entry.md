# Introduction

Kao Cen Darach was a Jedi Master who was born some time before 3681 BBY, fighting in and ultimately perishing in the Battle of Korriban, dueling alongside his padawan and future Jedi Grandmaster Satele Shan.
Darach held the rank of Jedi Battlemaster but due to his extreme philosophy against all forms of the Dark Side, received a relatively inglorious posting to the garrison monitoring the ancient Sith world of Korriban.
On this assignment, Darach and Shan encountered the famed smuggler Nico Okarr who tried to purchase stolen Sith artifacts from scavengers in the Korriban ruins.
As Darach and Shan returned to the orbital station, a large contingent of the Resurgent Sith Empire emerged from hyperspace, jamming the station’s communications to prevent any warning of their return reaching the Republic.

# Section 1

Darach, Shan and Okarr were joined by Corporal Jace Malcom, a Republic Trooper aboard the station, who aided the party in repelling Sith forces.
Upon reaching the hanger and attempting to flee, Darach was confronted by Vindican and Malgus, two Sith who had boarded the station.
After dueling the duo, Darach ordered Shan, Okarr and Malcom to flee, taking Shan’s dualsaber to aid in his battle.
Darach defeated Vindican, but due to a range of factors was killed by Malgus moments later.
His sacrifice allowed Okarr’s ship to escape the hanger, and Shan ultimately warned the Republic of this new threat, marking the beginning of the Great Galactic War.

# Section 2

Darach was a Zabrak who demonstrated immense mastery of both lightsaber combat and the Force, being capable of wielding three blades simultaneously against two opponents.
Darach was also extremely talented in the use of Force Telekinesis, throwing large debris throughout the duel with Malagus and Vindican.
