# Introduction
As the population of the Esh-kha horde grew, an unprecedented event occurred, the birth of Hallow Voice.
He was born while the current patriarch was still well and healthy, and so there were now two patriarchs living at once.
However, Hallow was somewhat unusual, as he spoke with wise words about coexistence with unknown species, wanting to make friends with them instead of exterminating them.
However, since this way of thinking was completely new to the people, they had to split into groups in which Hallow could experiment with his approach.
During this time, the Esh-kha went on many rampages, which were noticed by the Empire.
The Rakata then attacked the people to stop their raids, which claimed some of their slave worlds.
A little later, the Rakata also attacked Hallow Voice and his group, but instead of fighting them, he begged for mercy and hoped that they would spare his people.
However, the Rakata led on and captured Hallow Voice, taking him to the Rakata prison world called Belsavis.
There he was held in Statis with the rest of his kind.
There he remained imprisoned for thousands of years until the beginning of the Cold War.
During that war, the Empire attacked the Republic prison facility, awakening some Rakata.
The Barsen'thor was also army-seeking to fight the threat posed by the Emperor's children.
When the Jedi learned of the Esh-kha, a Rakata named Lhunu contacted the Jedi Consul who would help him undo the deeds of his people by freeing Hallow Voice.
However, the Emperor's children learned of the plan and tried to stop it by killing Hallow, but to no avail.
Hallow Voice was not bitter after all the thousands of years of captivity, but became one with the spirit of cooperation.
In freedom, Hallow tried to change the brutal instincts of his cousin, Esh-kha.
