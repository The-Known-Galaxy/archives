# Introduction

PREFACE
Krin D’bis is of the same species as Plo Koon, a Kel Dor.
After joining the Almas Jedi Academy and progressing through the order she followed the Guardian path and successfully underwent her Jedi Knight trials.

The female Jedi Guardian has an interesting history, and made friends with a Jawa Consular named Akial.
Her history has been documented to her, and the Consular’s involvement in the Dorumaa incident.

# Section 1

NOTABLE HISTORY
Krin D’bis was a gifted individual in terms of combat training and thus was naturally led towards the Guardian path.
She passed her Knight trials in the heat of the Clone Wars, which ultimately was a premonition to the incident she’d be involved in on Dorumaa, the moon of Almas.

D’bis, due to her talent and calm stature was chosen to represent, alongside Akial, the Academy on Dorumaa.
A massive celebration took place, but this was orchestrated by the Metatheran Cartel, an organization that engaged in both legal and illegal pursuits.
They often conflicted with the ‘trade federation’ during these pursuits.

The celebration was conducted to show appreciation towards a squadron of individuals who had prevented a virus from engulfing the Caarite homeworld.
They had saved millions and thus it was warranted.

The Consular Akial was chosen alongside the Guardian to provide an all-rounded approach to the representation.
The Academy believed the (2) would be good for eachother, the Consular for negotiation and the Guardian for practical defence.

The (2) Jedi also capitalised on the opportunity of the celebration and attempted to recruit new students into the Academy.
They also spoke philosophically about a Sith cult called the Believers and what threat they posed.
Characteristically, Krin D’bis sought to destroy them whilst the Consular stated that they should be strategically observed first, then hunted down systematically.
The Metatheran Cartel’s illegal activities were also discussed.
This included their involvement in the destruction of the ch’hala tree grove.
Due to this, D’bis argued that despite the celebration, the hosts should not be responded to with a lowered guard.

PERSONALITY & TRAITS
With the records available, it is clear that D’bis reflected her combat ability in her speech.
This meant that she was both ferocious, and impulsive.
Despite this though, she acted patiently and responded to situations appropriately.
There is nothing particularly unique, but she was a good Jedi that embodied the principles necessary to be one.

CONCLUSION
Souleth’s author note: Krin D’bis isn’t nearly as well-known as Plo-Koon and yet her story can be found in most of our lives.
Not all Jedi are heroes that will be written in stone, most of us are and will be found in the shadows.
There’s nothing wrong with that, to serve and to do what is expected is a heroic duty.
It does not need to be beyond that.
