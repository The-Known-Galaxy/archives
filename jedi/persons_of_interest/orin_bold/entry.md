# Introduction

Orin Bold was a male Human moisture farmer residing on the desert planet of Ord Mantell.
Widowed and raising his daughter, Nella Bold, Orin managed a moisture farm near the Ten Mile Plateau.
Despite the arid and harsh conditions, the Bold family's business provided a crucial resource to nearby colonies - water.
Their solitude was disrupted by the arrival of Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn, marking the beginning of a pivotal series of events.

# Section 1

Orin Bold's life on Ord Mantell was characterized by solitude and resilience.
As a widower, he raised his daughter, Nella, in the challenging environment of a moisture farm.
Their isolated existence was further complicated by the tragic loss of his wife, who fell victim to the fearsome Mantellian Savrips.
Despite these hardships, Bold managed to sustain the moisture farm, providing much-needed water to nearby colonies in the arid landscape.

# Section 2

Bold's struggle to maintain his farm took a perilous turn with the rise of Baron Taxer Sundown, who sought to take over the property.
Sundown's intimidation tactics and malicious actions against customers caused the farm's decline.
In response, Orin Bold employed his mechanical skills to build a makeshift army of war droids, attempting to protect his livelihood from Sundown's malevolent schemes.

# Section 3

The arrival of Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn at the Bold farm marked a significant turning point.
Mistaking the Jedi for members of Sundown's militia, Bold's droids attacked, leading to a confrontation.
However, the Jedi's true intentions were soon understood, and Orin and Nella entrusted them with their plight.
The Jedi vowed to help and investigate Sundown's sinister activities.

# Section 4

As the Jedi's investigation progressed, unsettling truths came to light.
Sundown had manipulated Orin Bold's mind and forced him to participate in his illicit endeavors, including the construction of lightsabers for his men.
The shocking revelation of Orin's wife's murder, orchestrated by Sundown, further escalated tensions.
A final confrontation between the Jedi, Sundown, and Orin Bold ensued, leading to Sundown's demise.

# Section 5

After the turmoil, Orin Bold was left to come to terms with the unsettling revelations and the return of his memories.
With Sundown defeated, the immediate threats to his existence subsided.
Bold had to reconcile with his daughter and the memories of a traumatic past.
His mechanical skills and determination remained essential in running the moisture farm despite the leg injury that required him to rely on a crutch.
