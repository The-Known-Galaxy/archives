# Introduction
Revan, a force sensitive male playing important roles as a Jedi and Sith during the mandalorian wars, as well as the Jedi Civil War.
He was born some place in the outer rim around 3994 BBY.
Where specifically he was born is not known.
He would start off as a padawan under many different Jedi Masters.
Later he would achieve the rank of Jedi Knight and critique the orders inactivity during this mandalorian war, between the republic and the Mandolorians.
He led a movement in defiance of the Jedi Council’s wishes.
Changing his name to Revan.
Revan had picked up a fallen mandalorians mask and took it as his own, and promised to not take it off until the mandalorians were defeated.
Now, Revan joining the Republic’s military, he was appointed as supreme commander.

# Section 1
Now that Revan had defeated the Mandalorian leader, Mandalore the Ultimate at the battle of malachor 5 at 3960 BBY, Revan and his also former Jedi friend, Alek, now known as Malak followed the trail of a mysterious Sith Influence on the mandalorian wars to the unknown regions.
There the two had discovered a reconstituted Sith Empire.
The two would turn to the dark side of the force by the Sith Emperor Vitiate.
They were sent back to the republic as advanced imperial agents.
The two new dark lords of the Sith, Darth Revan and Darth Malak broke from the Emperor's control.
They both established their own Sith Empire using the Star Forge.
The star forge was a ginormous automated shipyard that would create the most powerful army of all time.



# Section 2
The two would use the darkside of the force along with the power of the star forge to create ships, droids, and weapons.
This now led to the Jedi Civil war.
Revan, now betrayed by Malak, was captured by the Jedi Knight Bastila Shan.
She would form force bonds with Revan, wiping his mind.
Revan, now his mind wiped, was now given the identity of a Republic Soldier by the Jedi Council.
Revan was now stationed aboard a republic warship.
Revan who recently helped rescue Shan, was taken to the Jedi Enclave and trained as a Jedi Padawan.
Revan had been sent on a mission to locate the star maps.
These artifacts would lead the way to the star forge.
There were five star maps each located on different planets throughout the galaxy.
Unfortunately on one of their missions, Revan and his crew were captured by none other than Malak.
Revan’s true identity as the dark lord of the Sith was exposed.
The crew escaped, yet unfortunately Bastila Shan was captured and turned to the dark side.



# Section 3
Revan and his crew eventually found all the star maps, and entered the star forge without Shan.
They were forced to fight droids and dark side users.
During this a fight broke out outside of the forge between the Republic and Sith Empire.
While the fight was going on Revan found Bastila and turned her back to the lightside and soon after defeated Darth Malak.
A bit of time after, Revan married Bastila but unfortunately his memories forced him to leave his wife and unborn child.
He left them to search for answers in the unknown regions.
He was then captured by the sith, and imprisoned for three years until a former lieutenant of his rescued him.
Trying to kill the emperor after their escape, the lieutenant was killed and he was imprisoned for three hundred years.



# Section 4
Later on, the republic forces would work to help him escape from the emperor.
Revan later took control over the foundry and attempted to construct a new army of droids to defeat the empire.
Unfortunately he died as he was killed by an imperial strike team.
Although as much as he tried to become one with the force, the amount of torture he experienced with the emperor forced him to embrace the dark side and become Revan Reborn.
Revan taking control of the order of revan tried to make an end to the empire and kill the emperor once and for all, but the Jedi Order along with the Empire joined forces to stop him.
After this Revan was able to finally die truly becoming one with the force.
