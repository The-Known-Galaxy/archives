# Introduction
Although much information had been lost about the Old Republic, tales of its most valiant heroes still remain.
One of these heroes of old was Aric Jorgan, a Cathar soldier who served during the Cold War, the Galactic War, and the war against Zakuul.
Born on the planet Rendili in 3673 BBY, Aric Jorgan had red and light brown hair covering most of his body, orange eyes, and orange-brown skin.
It was not known how or when he died.
It was known, however, that he served in the Eternal Alliance after the fall of the Eternal Empire.

# Section 1
Aric Jorgan enlisted into the Republic Military as a sniper and joined the elite squad known as the Deadeyes, eventually becoming the squad’s commanding officer.
At the time of his enlistment into the Deadeyes, the legendary squad was led by Commander Vorne, whom Jorgan held in high regard.
The squad would often be tasked with conducting “decapitation strikes,” which entailed the elimination of enemy officers before an assault that left the enemy leaderless and unorganized.
It was said that the Deadeyes would sometimes wait weeks just to get a kill.
In his time in the Deadeyes, Aric Jorgan was reported to have racked up over a dozen confirmed kills.
Eventually, Jorgan would achieve the rank of Lieutenant in the Republic Military and be assigned to Ord Mantell, leaving the Deadeyes in the capable hands of his former executive officer Torve.



# Section 2
Transferring to Ord Mantell was an intelligent career move on Jorgan’s behalf.
Among Jorgan’s new subordinates was Felix Iresso, with who Jorgan would more often than not clash on policy.
Sometime in 3643 BBY, a shuttle carrying a ZR-57 orbital strike bomb was taken down by the Mantellian Separatist Movement, a force bent on achieving Ord Mantell’s independence from the Republic.
The Mantellian Separatist Movement would then steal the bomb, which was capable of destroying entire islands.
This caused the Republic to send in a Special Forces Division known as Havoc Squad, which was led by Harron Tavus.
Among this squad was a new recruit and an unnamed Sergeant.
Jorgan and the Sergeant would work together in finding the location of the said bomb, along with executing three of the Separatist’s leaders.
During this time, the bomb had been moved, and Commander Tavus had ordered Havoc Squad to retrieve it, except for the rookie Sergeant.
When all communications with Havoc had been cut out, Jorgan ordered the Sergeant to follow his squad and track down the ZR-57.
This led to the disarmament of the bomb and the defection of the other members of the Havoc Squad to the Empire.
Following this, Jorgan would be blamed and demoted as a scapegoat.
The Sergeant would be promoted to the rank of Lieutenant and placed in charge of the Havoc Squad.



# Section 3
The newly reformed Havoc Squad was tasked with hunting down the old members, who had defected to the Sith Empire.
Havoc Squad would disrupt and ruin the traitors’ plans on Taris, Nar Shaddaa, Tatooine, and Alderaan, eventually defeating Tavus himself.
Afterward, when the Cold War got hot, Havoc Squad was tasked with tracking down and destroying the Imperial superweapon known as the “Gauntlet.” They would then fight in the Battle of Corellia, where Havoc Squad reclaimed the Bastion, a Republic stronghold on the planet, and captured the Imperial General Arkos Rakton.
Each member of Havoc Squad, Aric Jorgan included, was awarded the Gold Crescent for this action.



# Section 4
While deployed with Havoc Squad, Jorgan would receive information that his former squad, the Deadeyes, had been captured by the Sith Empire and forced into slave labor.
With the approval of his Sergeant, he pursued his former squad’s tracks with interference from Republic Strategic Information Service agent Zane.
In time, Jorgan would find all of his former squadmates, finding the last few on Hoth after two had died from the cold.
Jorgan would also learn that Senior Agent Zane was intentionally planting hundreds of Republic soldiers into POW camps in the hopes that one of them would lead him to the mythical station Dusk 9, which was never found.



# Section 5
Four years after the Battle of Corellia, the galaxy was attacked by the Eternal Empire of Zakuul.
Early in this conquest, the commander of the Havoc Squad was declared MIA.
Most of Havoc’s members went their way with Jorgan being the only member to remain in active service.
Due to this, Jorgan was promoted to the rank of Major and given full command over Havoc Squad.
During this time, Jorgan would become disenthralled with the Republic due to the way it was run by the then Supreme Chancellor Saresh and its inaction against the Eternal Throne.
Jorgan would later take Havoc Squad to Zakuul, the capital of the Eternal Empire, on an unsanctioned mission to plant wiretaps on various listening outposts.
While on Zakuul, Jorgan would meet the Alliance Commander and would work with them, with the Alliance being a conglomerate of people both from the Republic and the Empire, Jedi and Sith as well, attempting to take down the Eternal Empire.
After the success of this mission, Jorgan would return later to disable the GEMINI frequency, with the mission being a near-total failure, Havoc suffering near destruction.
Afterward, Jorgan would fully commit to the Alliance’s cause.
It was unknown what he had done afterward, when he died, how he died, or where he died.
