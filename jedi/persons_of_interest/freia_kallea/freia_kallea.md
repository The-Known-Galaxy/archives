# Introduction
Freia Kallea was a human woman who originated from Brentall IV, and she lived during the Sith Civil Wars.
This particular woman was known for discovering profound hyperspace routes; the most notable one she discovered was the Hydian Way, which spanned the entire galaxy.

# Section 1
The approximate years that Freia lived was around 3700 BBY.
Her first ventures through the galaxy were working as a female pilot and mapping out areas of the galaxy for hyperspace routes.
Eventually, Freia discovered a new route called the Hydian Way, the most significant hyperspace route in the galaxy.



# Section 2
After all her momentous discoveries, she became a noblewoman and opened her trading enterprise.
The enterprise was called the Kallean League and lasted for a long time, even after Freia's untimely death.

For the next 3000 years of her life, her story was told through a five-hour opera called Kallea Cycle.
It was performed in venues such as the senate building on Coruscant and her home planet Brentaal IV.
It was later turned into a holo-film and was viewable to most people across the galaxy who were connected to central technology and networks.
