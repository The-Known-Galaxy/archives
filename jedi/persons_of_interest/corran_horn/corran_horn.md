# Introduction
Corran Horn, a male human from the planet of Corellia, being an investigator for the Corellian Security Force, an Ace for the Rogue Squadron in the Rebel Alliance, and then a Jedi Master of the New Jedi Order which was formed by Luke Skywalker.
Corran Horn was descended from a great family of Corellian Jedis known as the Halcyon family which have served their homeworld for many hundreds of years, but have passed since the Old Republic.

# Section 1
Corran Horn was not an ordinary Jedi.
He did not have the power to use telekinesis, as he was born with a liability due to his bloodline to do so.
However, because of this, he was in exchange for better proficiency with telepathic abilities such as mind tricks.
Despite having the inability to use telekinesis he had a rare ability called Tutaminis, the ability to absorb energy.
With that ability, he was able to convert energy from other sources to give him a momentary augmentation in his abilities.



# Section 2
Corran Horn would later have a seat on the reformed High Jedi council after the Yuuzhan Vong war ended.
He had two children, a son named Valin Horn in the honor of his father, and a daughter named Jysella Horn in the honor of his wife's grandmother.
His two children would later become Jedi Knights in the order as they grew older.
Subsequently, Corran Horn would also go on to re-establish the formation of the Corellian Jedi once more, constructing a Jedi Enclave on Coronet City in Corellia where he would teach a number of Jedi in the Order's ways.
