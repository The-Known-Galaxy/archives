# Introduction
Anakin Solo was a Human Jedi Knight from the New Jedi Order who was born to Leia Organa Solo and Han Solo in 10 BBY, on the planet of Nespis VIII.
He was born a year and half after his siblings who were twins, Jacen and Jaina.
He was named after his grandfather, Anakin Skywalker, who was also known as Darth Vader.
At first, Anakin was about to be named Han Solo Jr.
after his father, however his mother, Leia made the decision to name him after her father, Anakin Skywalker.
She made this decision since she wanted to justify her father’s name, and she also thought it would help her overcome her unease of Darth Vader by looking at her   son, to look at what her father could’ve been.

# Section 1
As a youngster, Anakin was afraid of falling into the dark side and becoming a Sith himself.
He was born during a time of great unreliability.
The New Republic was overlooked with the revitalization of Imperial factions under control of the reborn Lord of the Sith and Galactic Emperor Palpatine.
One day, Palpatine touched Anakin while he was in the womb of Leia.
The Emperor also tried to control the body of the fetal child, making an effort to encourage his spirit into a more powerful guise.
However, Han Solo shot the Emperor and killed him before he could complete his mission.
Even though this occurred, the dark spirit of the Emperor went towards Anakin.
However, the Jedi Knight known as Empatojayos Brand protected him and sacrificed his life so Anakin could continue his own life.



# Section 2
In the first years of his life, Anakin lived on the isolated planet Anoth which his uncle, Luke Skywalker, and the flag officer of the New Republic, Gial Ackbar, had reinforced to protect the Solo children.
In the planet of Anoth, as his parents were busy, Anakin was taken care of by nanny droids and his mother’s close friend, Winter Celchu.
His parents were allowed to visit every few months.
At the start, his siblings,  Jaina and Jacen, stayed with him on the planet Anoth.
However, once they reached two years old, they went to live with their parents on Coruscant.
Later on, in 11ABY, an Imperial strike team led by the ambassador of the planet Carida, Furgan invaded the planet Anoth and tried to kidnap Anakin.
Winter managed to kill nearly most of the invaders by unlocking the base’s defenses, attacking the Imperial forces on her own.
Soon, Leia and Gial Ackbar, who'd been notified of Furgan’s plans, came and managed to rescue Anakin from the Ambassador’s attacks.
After the kidnapping attempt, he went to live with his parents and siblings on Coruscant.



# Section 3
Since now the Solo children are staying on Coruscant and since the children’s parents are busy, Leia became overburdened in trying to stick to both her motherly and political duties, thus resulting in her deciding to enlist the droid C-3PO, a protocol droid, to care for them.
C-3PO helped in taking care of the twins and Anakin, and proved to be very useful as it met the elements of a parent, whereas it uploaded information concerning the process of bringing up a child and met the challenge of commencing enthusiasm.
As Chewbacca was a very close friend of Han, he also helped C-3PO raise the Solo children after he returned from Kessel along with Han.



# Section 4
A few years went by in 14 ABY.
During the Empire Reborn movement, Anakin and the twins were kidnapped by Lord Hethrir who was the Imperial Procurator of Justice.
He wanted to take the upper hand of their Force powers.
During Anakin’s imprisonment, he became fond of Tigris who was his nursemaid and  also Lord Hethrir’s son.
Hethrir gave the now Force-Strong Anakin to a being named Waru in trade for Waru’s aid.
In time, Anakin’s parents along with Luke Skywalker, managed to rescue the children.



# Section 5
When he turned the age of eleven, he took part in the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 where he became quick friends with Tahiri Veila.
Along with her, they went on many exciting adventures, including the release of the imprisoned Massassi children.
Anakin was one of the most crucial figures in the Yuuzhan Vong War, where he participated in various major battles and evolved useful tactics opposed to the Yuuzhan Vong.
In consequence of his mission to save Tahiri and to assist Vua Rapuung forcing Mezhan Kwaad to speak the honest truth, the Jeedai heresy - a dissident movement which helped end the Yuuzhan Vong War - rapidly expanded among the Shamed Ones.
Later on, Anakin led the Myrkr strike team to conclude the lash of the non-sentient, Jedi-killing Voxyn, where then he sacrificed his life to end the menaces in 27 ABY.
