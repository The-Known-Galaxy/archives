Kestis with his Jedi Commander immediately planned to escape the Star destroyer through the escape pods, both The Jedi were continuously being attacked by their former loyal clone troopers while heading Towards the escape pods.
They managed to make it into an escape pod, but unfortunately Master Jaro Tapal was executed during the last moments, but his padawan Cal Kestis had managed to escape.
Cal Kestis was traumatised with this event, seeing his master die in-front of him.

# Section 2

Even after his padawan Anakin Skywalker became a Jedi Knight, the two continued to fight alongside for several battles.
Kenobi’s charms and calm demeanor as well as the quiet threat of his abilities with a lightsaber earned him the nickname of “The Negotiator”.
During the war, the once thought deceased Darth Maul, had resurfaced with his brother Savage Opress and aimed to create a criminal empire whilst plotting revenge against his arch-nemesis, Kenobi.
The two clashed blades many times on occasion across the Galaxy.
Furthermore, Kenobi was devastated when Maul slew the Jedi’s past love interest, Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore, in cold blood, however remained strong in the conflict.
Nearing the end of the war, Anakin saved his life in a battle over Coruscant, which led to Obi-Wan killing General Grievous on Utapau, however he was betrayed by Commander Cody, following Order 66.

# Section 3

Cal Kestis would go into hiding prior to the Great Jedi Purge, which almost made The Jedi go extinct.
Kestis arrived on Bracca and joined a Scrapper guild to make a living, until one day Kestis would use The Force to save his friend’s life at risk while working.
Kestis’ action would grab the attention of The Imperial Inquisitors, a group of Dark Side Users serving under the Galactic Empire which aimed to eliminate every surviving Jedi.
Kestis would flee the area after a duel with The Second Sister of the Inquisitors, he would then be saved by Cere Junda, a former Jedi Knight who was determined to rebuild The Jedi Order.

# Section 4

Cere Junda revealed herself to be a former Jedi Knight to Kestis, she told Kestis of how she intended to rebuild The Jedi Order, and this could only be achieved if they had got access to a Jedi Holocron located at Bogano which contained the locations of every force-sensitive child across the galaxy.
Cal Kestis would join Cere Junda on her mission, as they believed it was the only way that The Empire could be defeated.
Cal Kestis would encounter a droid mamed BD-1 on Bogano who would help him in his quest for the search of The Jedi holocron and a holo recording left by Eno Cordova to guide him to the holocron, he revealed in order to reach the holocron, kestis had to find the tombs of three Zeffo Sages, it would later be found that Cordova was Cere Junda’s Jedi master.

# Section 5

Cal Kestis wouldn’t find much to work on, the information they were currently holding on were the Zeffo homeworld, their species and a tomb on planet Dathomir.
On Zeffo, Kestis would find a clue, that Cordova had a contact on Kashyyyk, known as Wookie Chieftain Tarruf.
Kestis would travel to Kashyyyk, where he would encounter a conflict between The Empire and a group of rebels attempting to free Kashyyyk from The Empire’s enslavement.

# Section 6

Cal Kestis would manage to recover The Astrium and unlock the vault holding the holocron, but they were ambushed by Trilla Sundari or The Second Sister.
She would steal the holocron and escape with it to Planet Nur, where the Inquisitor headquarters are located.
Cal Kestis would assault the Inquisitor headquarters and defeat Trilla and retrieve the holocron.
Trilla’s former master, would try to convince Trilla to join her in her quest to rebuild The Jedi Order and redeem herself from the Dark Side.
But Darth Vader would shortly intervene and eliminate Trilla for her failure.
Cal and Junda would try to escape from Vader and flee the planet, but they would face immense difficulty in doing so, as far as Cal getting stabbed in the chest.
They would barely make it out of the headquarters, but now with the holocron in their possession, they realised that searching and gathering the force-sensitive children together would only make it easier for the Empire to eliminate the children or even turn them to the Dark Side.
So, Cal would destroy the holocron, leaving The Force to decide the children’s fates.
