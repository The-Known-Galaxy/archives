# Introduction

Kelleran Beq was a human male Jedi Master who served his life to the Jedi Order.
His main job throughout his time as a Jedi Master was to supervise Padawan Learners throughout their Knight Trials.
Beq often had droids assist him with these supervisions; these droids were astromech LX-R5 and protocol droid AD-3.
Both of these droids assisted Beq throughout his time serving aboard the starship Athylia.
He was given the title of “The Sabered Hand” as a Padawan when he was conducting his own Jedi Trials.

# Section 1

Beq was waiting for his student, named Grogu, to arrive from an elevator during the Siege of the Jedi Temple.
He informed this youngling that he was there to save him because of how unsafe it was due to the attack the clones were conducting.
Beq wielded two single lightsabers on both of his hands to ensure his protection of Grogu would occur and be completed well.
The Jedi Master and the Youngling were soon surprised and attacked by various Clone Troopers; however, he still defeated them successfully and managed to make it onto a speeder, and started flying across the skies of Coruscant.

# Section 2

During their journey throughout the Coruscant skies, they were being chased by numerous Republic Gunships.
Beq escaped through a tunnel, which was usually used for a different type of vehicle, meaning the Republic Gunships would not be able to follow them throughout this journey.
Throughout these tunnels, a train began to approach them from the other side of the tunnel, making Beq have to avoid it by making a turn.
The turn that Beq made meant they had entered the station and started journeying to Monument Plaza.
Finally, they both reached their destination.

# Section 3

Beq and Grogu journeyed on their platform to a Naboo yacht and were greeted by numerous Royal Naboo Security guards.
They eventually escaped Coruscant and jumped into hyperspace and began to flee.
