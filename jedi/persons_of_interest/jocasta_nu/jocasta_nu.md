# Section 1

Jocasta Nu's early life is shrouded in mystery, as there is very little information available about her childhood.
However, it is known that she was brought into the Jedi Order during the final decades of the Galactic Republic, a time of relative peace and stability in the galaxy.
As a Youngling, she was raised in a clan with other Force-sensitive children, and it was there that she first began to hone her skills as a Jedi.

Throughout her upbringing within the Jedi Order, Jocasta Nu demonstrated an impressive ability to acquire knowledge and a strong passion for learning.
She stood out as a prodigious student, excelling in her studies of the Force, science, and history, which allowed her to advance rapidly within the Order's ranks.
Upon completing her Knight trials, Jocasta opted to pursue the Consular path, focusing her research efforts on the field of archaeology.
She later joined the Exploration Corps, which granted her the opportunity to traverse the galaxy and accumulate valuable information for the Jedi Archives after obtaining the approval of the Council of Reassignment.

During her travels as part of the Exploration Corps, Jocasta Nu had a fortuitous encounter with a Force-sensitive Miraluka named Jerec.
Impressed with his potential, Nu facilitated his entry into the Jedi Temple for formal training.
Recognizing in Jerec her own insatiable thirst for knowledge, she selected him as her Padawan and imparted upon him her passion for discovering all there was to learn in the galaxy.
Under her tutelage, Jerec flourished and eventually achieved the rank of Jedi Knight.

Nu was promoted to the rank of Jedi Master after Jerec completed his training with her.
She began to perform the duties of an archivist in the Archives, overseeing the collection, preservation, and dissemination of knowledge and information.
Her exceptional abilities in this area eventually led to her appointment as Chief Archivist of the Archives and Library, and she became a member of the Librarian's Assembly.
As Chief Librarian, Nu was responsible for the oversight of the Educational Corps, and she reported directly to the Reassignment Council on all matters concerning this branch of the Jedi Service Corps.

Despite her many accomplishments, Jocasta Nu was not without her critics.
She was known for her stubbornness and her unwillingness to compromise when it came to the preservation of the Jedi Archives.
She was fiercely protective of the knowledge contained within the Archives, and she was often at odds with other Jedi who believed that some information should be made available to the public.
Despite these disagreements, Jocasta Nu remained a respected and admired figure within the Jedi Order.

# Section 3

During the Clone Wars, Jocasta Nu remained a staunch believer that there was more to the conflict than what the Jedi were being told.
As one of the highest ranking Masters to remain constantly on Coruscant, she devoted herself to studying the Jedi Archives and uncovering any information that could shed light on the true nature of the war.
Despite encountering resistance from other Jedi who were hesitant to believe that their own government could be behind the war, Jocasta Nu remained steadfast in her beliefs.
She spent countless hours pouring over ancient texts and other sources of information, looking for any clues that might help her piece together the truth.
Shortly thereafter, the Temple came under attack as Order 66 was executed and the clones turned on their Jedi allies.

Faced with the imminent threat of danger, Jocasta Nu summoned her Padawan, Rayce, to the Archives and entrusted him with several datachips containing information from the Stacks.
She ordered him to flee the Temple and carry the information to safety, knowing that it was too valuable to fall into the wrong hands.

Despite her efforts to protect the knowledge contained within the Archives, however,  Jocasta Nu herself fell victim to the tragedy of Order 66.
When Darth Vader and a squad of clone assassins marched into the Archives and demanded that she unlock the Temple's signal beacon, Jocasta Nu refused, knowing that the authority to do so lay only with the Jedi Council.
In response, Vader used the Force to lift Jocasta Nu off the ground and impale her with his lightsaber, killing her instantly.
It was a tragic end for a Jedi who had devoted her life to the pursuit of knowledge and the uncovering of truth, and her death served as a stark reminder of the dangers that lay ahead for the Jedi Order.

# Section 4

In the aftermath of her death, Nu's loyal librarians attempted to stop Anakin Skywalker and the invading Sith from accessing the archives and destroying all of the knowledge stored there.
Unfortunately, they were all killed in the fighting, and the Sith were able to ransack the archives, taking whatever they pleased.
It was a great tragedy that much of the knowledge and history that Nu had worked so hard to preserve was lost forever.
Her lifeless body was eventually discovered by Grand Master Yoda and Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had infiltrated the occupied temple.
Her name was checked off against the archives records of all active Jedi, and her body was gathered up along with the other fallen Jedi and burned on a pyre at the temple entrance.

Despite the loss of the archives and many of the Jedi, Nu's legacy continued to live on.
Her dedication to the pursuit of knowledge and the preservation of history inspired many Jedi to continue her work, even in the face of great adversity.
Her passion for learning and her unwavering commitment to the Jedi Order and the Force will always be remembered as a testament to the power and importance of knowledge in the galaxy.
