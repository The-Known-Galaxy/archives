# Introduction

Ratts Tyerell, an Aleena, was a famous figure from the planet of Aleen.
He was a professional podracer that earned his fame from his fellow Aleena.
Tyerell appreciated his species as he had them for his mechanics, and he traveled with his family.
Tyerell used abnormally large engines that made him an iconic racer to see.
There was known to be a tiny toy made of his podracer.

In 32 BBY, Tyerell entered the notorious Boonta Eve Classic.
The racer got off to a good start in the beginning.
The race for this Aleena would take a dramatic turn as his accelerator jammed while he was focused on another racer.
Tyerell was speeding to his undeserved fate.
Unfortunately, he met his bitter end as he crashed dead into stalactites.

The death of the hometown hero would stun his local planet.
The Aleena were devastated, and the whole planet mourned his death.
Deland Tyerell, offspring of the late podracer, created a foundation in the memory of his beloved father.
The Ratts Tyerell Foundation was established to make podracing safer while reducing the danger that comes along with it.
The efforts by the foundation caused the Core Worlds to ban the sport entirely.
Unfortunately, the unlucky death of Tyerell helped spiral the decline of podracing.
