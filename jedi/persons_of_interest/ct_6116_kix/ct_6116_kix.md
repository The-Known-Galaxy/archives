# Introduction

CT-6116, codenamed “Kix”, was a clone trooper who served as a medic in the 501st Legion within the Galactic Republic’s Grand Army.
Around the time of 21 BBY, Kix participated in the hunt for the Supreme Commander General Grievous on the planet of Saleucami, under General Kenobi’s orders.
Kix, along with his fellow troopers known as Jesse and Hardcase, tagged along with Captain Rex to scour the wetlands of the planet on BARC speeders.
They were mainly in search of escape pods, which had been reported to have been sent down from General Grievous’s ship.
Sometime after the mission on Saleucami, Kix joined up with Rex and the rest of the 501st Legion in a battle on the planet of Umbara, where he acted as a medic on the battlegrounds which was led under the command of General Anakin Skywalker.
Upon General Kell’s arrival, he relieved Anakin Skywalker of his position, and took place of command.
Kix, along with the rest of the 501st Legion, discovered Krell was working and conspiring against the Republic in secret.
