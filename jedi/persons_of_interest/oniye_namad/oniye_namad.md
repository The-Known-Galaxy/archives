# Introduction
Oniye Namad, a human female who was involved in the Imperial Security Bureau which happened during a precious event that was named ‘The Great Jedi Purge’.
Her role was marvellously important during the Vaklin Insurgency, which occurred in 19BBY.
She had the help of the former Jedi Knight, Anakin Skywalker, who was now known as Darth Vader.
Her task, which Vader helped her with, was to erase any history or presence of the Jedi on the planet of Vaklin.

# Section 1
During 19BBY, the forces that belonged to the Galactic Empire invaded the planet of Vaklin, to help out the Great Jedi Purge.
The planet Vaklin was set on the way the Jedi did stuff and the way of Jedi traditions.
Cho'na Bene, an apprentice, and two other Jedi Masters went against the empire’s forces.
Many people were against the ways of the Galactic empire, so they began to revolt against them.
Due to the fact people were against them, Vader went to Vaklin to stop this happening.
Namada helped out Vader by questioning the people of Vaklin, and destroyed the ancient statue of Jedi Khen Reo.
She informed them of the new Imperial Education Center that will take place where the once-ancient statue was laid.
She then disguised herself as a clone trooper and forcefully killed the Jedi who were there in front of the citizens.



# Section 2
Oniye Namad was amazing at manipulating people, especially shown during the Vaklin Insurgency.
She could easily track down people, and yet again, she presented this to the citizens when she located and tracked them down.



# Section 3
Oniye Namad wore an Imperial outfit.
Her outfit had black boots and a tacky belt.
As well as that, she wore a kepi that belonged to the imperials.
She always used the DC-15x sniper rifle, and she used that sniper rifle when she publicly executed Cho'na Bene.
