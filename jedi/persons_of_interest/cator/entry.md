# Introduction

Cator was a droid stationed in the Jedi Holocron Vault in the Jedi Temple.
The droid was programmed with the sole purpose of preserving the contents of the vault.
Cator was committed to his programming, even staying out of a conflict in the Jedi Temple to protect the vault.
Despite the Jedi Order's demise, Cator stood guard over the vault, protecting and preserving it until one fateful evening, when Chief Librarian Jocasta-Nu snuck back into the Jedi Temple to retrieve a small holocron containing all known force-sensitive children in the galaxy.
After Jocasta retrieved the information, Darth Vader found the Holocron Vault and the droid started a brawl with Cator, in which Cator was eventually defeated, but before that, Cator did a bioscan on the being and gave Jocasta the identity of Darth Vader Anakin Skywalker.
