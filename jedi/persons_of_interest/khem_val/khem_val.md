# Introduction
Khem Val was known as the greatest shadow assassin on Urkupp until Tulak Hord challenged him to a fight, which he won.
Since then, Val has fought alongside his master's apprentice, Ortan Cela, and companion, Veshikk Urk, devouring a great many Jedi in Yn and the Battle of Chabosh.
Because of the great amount of conquest Hord produced, Val feasted all the more, creating a bond between the two.
Centuries later, however, the story of Khem Val was no more than a mere legend.
Tulak Hord abandoned him in the tomb of Naga Sadow on Korriban, where he trapped him in a stasis field guarded by such powerful energy that not even the strongest Sith could free him.
Thousands of years later, at Zash's request, he was freed by a Sith acolyte.
When he learned that Tulak Hord was dead, he raged and tried to kill the acolyte, but to no avail.
So now he had to serve the acolyte, who later became known as Darth Nox, the heir of Aloysius Kallig.
As the acolyte's power grew, Darth Zash called back her apprentice.

Arriving, Zash told her that she would soon die, and therefore planned to take the body of her student.
As Zash completed the ritual and was about to transfer her spirit into her apprentice's body, Khem Val attacked her to save his ruler, and so with slipped the spirit of Zash into Val and had to share the body from now on.
The spirit of Aloysius Kallig saw this as a betrayal of Tulak Hord, and promised to expel Khem from his body one day.
Zash planned to take the bones of Tulak Hord and use the energy in them, which was the same energy Khem had trapped Val in, to expel Val from his body.
Kallig told Khem about Zash's plan; she tried to replicate the ritual with a Rakata spirit prison and capture Khem Val.
When the ritual began, Val proved too powerful, and eventually, Zash was the one who was pulled into the box.
Through the time of the Eternal Empire, Khem had earned the respect of Ak'ghal Usar, for his service to Tulak Hord.



# Section 2
Khem Val saw Kallig as not capable of carrying on the legacy of Tulak Hord and planned to devour him.
But in time he began to respect his master and changed his mind.
Val went from being a servant to a devoted enforcer of Kallig.
Since Khem Val was a Dashade, he believed in honor and willingly served his masters.
This belief formed a strong bond, forcing Zash to serve Kallig in the body of Khem Val.
Khem felt honored when he was allowed to announce his master's ascension to Sith Lord and a Darth.
Val was trained as an elite assassin to be a killing machine, the embodiment of death and destruction.
He enjoys killing force users, plus he is quite powerful, cunning and, ruthless, which allows him to assassinate even the strongest.
He is also often given to bragging, as over the victories of Yn and the Battle of Chabosh, where he killed thousands of Jedi.
Although brutal and bloodthirsty, he was true to his word and believed in honor.
When he traveled with Lord Kallig, he often agreed to honorable decisions and agreement, then declined when his trust was abused.
