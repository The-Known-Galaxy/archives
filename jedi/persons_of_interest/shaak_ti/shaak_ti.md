# Introduction
Shaak Ti was a well-respected Jedi Master during the Clone Wars era.
The female Togruta was one of the best Jedi in the order and was given a seat on the Jedi High Council after the death of Master Yaddle.
Shaak Ti was a Jedi Consular, yet she wielded a blue lightsaber which was unique as most wielded a green.
She was an impressive diplomat but also a very skilled Jedi when it came to lightsaber combat.
Shaak Ti was regarded as one of the order's greatest duelists in this era and was well versed in all lightsaber forms, yet excelled in the form Makashi.
She was a proud member of her order’s Jedi Assault team and was deployed on many missions, such as rescuing Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Padmé Amidala from captivity on Geonosis.

# Section 1
Shaak Ti was born on the planet Shili as a Force-sensitive infant and brought to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to study the ways of the Jedi.
Like most Jedi of this era, she spent decades studying in the Jedi Academy until she graduated and became a Padawan.
She would eventually take her Jedi Knight trial and pass successfully, becoming a Jedi Knight.
She would then continue to study the ways of a Jedi Consular while also serving under the Council of Reconciliation.
While Shaak Ti developed her diplomatic skills and Force abilities as a Jedi Consular, she would continue to enhance her impressive duelling skills with the lightsaber form, Makashi.
Shaak Ti stood out to the Jedi High Council, and she was elevated to the rank of Jedi Master.
A few years before the Clone Wars had begun, Jedi High Councillor Yaddle was killed and Shaak Ti was offered her seat on the Jedi High Council.
She was a suitable replacement for the Jedi Master and would continue to serve throughout the Clone Wars.



# Section 2
Throughout the Clone Wars, Shaak Ti was deployed on Kamino and oversaw the training of the army for the Grand Republic.
She acted as a representative for both the Jedi and the Republic itself.
While Shaak Ti would remain on Kamino, she was the defender and overseer of the next generation of clone troopers.
She was also involved in numerous battles during the war.
This included the Siege of Kamino and the Battle of Coruscant.
It was here that she defended Chancellor Palpatine and fought bravely, defeating several IG-100 MagnaGuard by herself and holding her own impressively against the Jedi Killer, General Grievous.



# Section 3
As the end of the Clone Wars was visible, Shaak Ti was stationed back at Coruscant inside the Jedi Temple.
As Order 66 began and the new Sith Lord, Darth Vader, raided the temple with his clone army, Shaak Ti managed to escape the temple barely with her life.
As Coruscant was completely taken over by the newly formed Galactic Empire, she fled the planet and eventually would take up refuge on the planet of Felucia.
It was her that she began to train many Felucian Force sensitives as well as Padawan Maris Brood.
Eventually, she was tracked by Lord Vader, who sent his secret apprentice Starkiller to find Shaak Ti as a test of skill.
Upon arriving on the planet, Shaak Ti engaged Starkiller in an intense duel as she intended to stall while her Padawan and other students could flee the scene.
While Shaak Ti seemed to be getting the upper hand in the duel, she was outmatched when it came to Starkillers raw Force abilities.
Knowing her defeat, she warned her opponent of the Sith’s nature to betray each other and chose death by falling into the abyss.
