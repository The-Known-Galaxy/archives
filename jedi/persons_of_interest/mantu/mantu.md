# Introduction
A male bounty hunter that operated during the Clone Wars.
He stood out from the others of his kind since he was known to be cruel and cold-hearted.
His behavior destroyed the stereotype that all Selkaths were peaceful.

# Section 1
Mantu’s success caught the attention of Count Dooku as he was called in to fight against other bounty hunters.
Dooku told them what the challenge entailed and took all their weapons as soon as they entered.
For the first two rounds, Mantu was able to successfully escape.
The ease of the challenges diminished when they approached the third round, which was in a room sealed off by electrified ray shields.
The remaining bounty hunters needed to reach a switch hidden behind a small ray shield that would deactivate the shields surrounding the room.
They also found a serum provided by Moralo Eval that would give the recipient immunity to the ray shields.



# Section 2
The bounty hunter that went by the name of Derrown, quickly gave himself the serum since his body’s physiology would not reject the serum.
Mantu and the other bounty hunters quickly escaped, but they soon realized that they weren’t finished with the task at hand.
During the attempt to escape, Mantu got a slight shock by one of the ray shields headed towards them.
The other bounty hunters used him as a bridge to get across, but before he could make it up, he was electrocuted, causing him to fall to his death.
