# Introduction

Jedi Master Stellan Gios was a Jedi High Councillor during the era of the High Republic.
He was a very skilled combatant and Force-user.
Stellan Gios joined the Jedi at a young age and became close with Jedi Masters Elzar Mann and Avar Kriss.
The three were inseparable at the time.
Elzar Mann caused a lot of mischief and Stellan would be the one to stand up for Elzar and Avar, claiming it was a team effort.
Elzar and Avar were a lot closer to each other due to the intimacy they shared, but Elzar always said Stellan was the polestar of the three, after all, Stellan never shied from the spotlight of the Jedi.
He was a very optimistic Jedi and had an obsession with teaching, he was good at it.
At one point in his career, he successfully trained a bright Padawan, Vernestra Rwoh.
Vernestra was around fifteen when she became a Jedi Knight, making her one of the Order’s youngest Knights.
Thanks to Stellan.

# Section 1

Stellan was highly respected amongst the Order and eventually the Galaxy.
He was present for the Valo Fair hosted by the Supreme Chancellor and witnessed the surprise attack.
During the siege on Valo, Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh was critically injured by the Nihil Tempest Runner, Laurna Dee.
Stellan rushed to her side and aided the unconscious Chancellor.
Camera droids all gathered nearby to see the empathetic Jedi mourn over the Chancellor’s injuries.
For the first time in a long time, the Jedi were seen to have the capability to feel emotions.
Afterward, Stellan Gios was respected in the eyes of the Republic.
During a Council meeting, Elzar Mann interrupted and requested on Lina Soh’s behalf that Stellan visit the Chancellor.
Due to the compassion, he showed for Valo Lina Soh asked Stellan if he wanted to be the “poster child” of the Jedi Order and their conflict with the Nihil.
Gios didn’t have time to respond, an incoming transmission came in for the Chancellor.
Elzar and a few other Jedi managed to track down the Nihil base on Grizal and attacked them.
They found Master Loden Greatstorm there and he and his Padawan, Bel Zettifar, served side by side for the last time.
Loden was eventually turned to dust at the end, which was when Stellan Gios arrived.
After seeing what happened to Loden, Stellan was afraid for the first time since he was a child.

After the battle on Grizal, Stellan reached out to Vernestra and complimented her for her efforts on Valo.
Later on, he reunited with her face-to-face.
However, he wasn’t aware of the upcoming tragedy.
Avar Kriss went off to find the supposed Eye of the Nihil, Lourna Dee and left Starlight Beacon without the Council’s approval.
This enraged Stellan and the next time the two talked they said things that they had regretted saying.
Stellan was then made the Marshal of Starlight Beacon due to Avar’s actions and oversaw the station for a while.
Several attacks happened simultaneously on the Echerta system, Aleen, Yeksom, Japeal, and Tais Brabbo.
Stellan took in many refugees.
During this, he suffered from terrible nightmares and insomnia.
Sadly, he had every right to be fearful.
There was an ancient darkness of the station that they were unaware of.

Several Jedi such as Indeera Stokes, Orla Jareni, Nib Assek, and Regald Coll.
All of which were killed by this dark force.
An ancient species known only as the Nameless had been smuggled aboard Starlight Beacon by several of Marchion Ro’s most loyal raiders.
These raiders also allowed a shipment of Rathtars to go wild and almost destroyed the passengers’ chances of leaving.
On top of all this, Starlight Beacon was attacked by the Nihil and split in two.
Stellan and Elzar helped everyone escape into ships.
Sadly, the gentle Wookie Jedi, Burryaga Agaburry, was lost.
Elzar made a costly mistake and killed the only people who could save them.
He tried to fix his mistake, but he couldn’t do it on his own, luckily Stellan came down just in time to help him.
Stellan had no other choice but to send Elzar to safety and remained on the falling Starlight Beacon.
He told Elzar that he would be right behind him and would evacuate once Eiram was out of harm’s way.
Unfortunately, it was too late and Stellan had to save the city of Eiram by sacrificing himself to prevent the station from hitting the city and killing hundreds of innocents.
He landed the station in the ocean and was killed in the process.
His death inspired many Jedi, especially Ezlar, who mourned over his friend’s death and vowed to be the best Jedi possible for Stellan.

# Section 3

Stellan Gios was a skilled practitioner of lightsaber combat and the Force.
He could use an ability that was very rare in the High Republic known as mind touch, which allowed him to control the thoughts of others and he loved to teach.
However, he was considered the voice of reason and was a loyalist of the Jedi Order.
He abided by almost every single one of their laws.
Unlike Elzar and Avar, Stellan let the Jedi define him and almost control his every thought.
However, he was jealous since Avar and Elzar shared a stronger connection to each other.
He managed to veal his vulnerability so that not even his best friend Elzar could see until he let his guard down on Starlight and told his friend everything.
The true Stellan had vanished for years, only to be reborn on Starlight Beacon.
