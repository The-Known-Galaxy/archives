# Introduction

During the Clone Wars, there was a combat droid bounty hunter who went by the name ‘C-21 Highsinger’ who was part of Krayt’s Claw which was a group of bounty hunters consisting of Boba Fett, Latts Razzi, Dengar, Bossk and Oked.
Almost nothing at all was known about him before he joined Krayt’s Claw and started gaining attention.
Sometimes the Sith Apprentice, Asajj Ventress took part in the syndicate’s work yet she broke up with the group after the Mission To Sorenno which went horribly wrong after the person they were meant to save (Jedi Master Quinlan Vos) didn’t want to go with Ventress as he learnt that she had killed his master, Tholme.
The group ended up fleeing after Master Vos sided with Count Dooku and pursued them.

One other mission that the Krayt’s Claw went on was the Mission To Quartzite.
Before the mission even began, the team met up at the Mos Eisley cantina on Tatooine and one of the group’s members with the name Oked was killed due to attempting to speak to Asajj Ventress who killed him due to his anger over Ventress ignoring him.
After that, Ventress agreed to join the group as Boba Fett had blackmailed her into joining.

# Section 2

The origins of C-21 Highsinger was mostly unknown but  it is thought that he had been a singular manufactured model as there has never been anything similar to him seen anywhere in the galaxy before yet it is completely unknown who made him due to him serving no master, yet serving himself with whatever he wanted to do.
