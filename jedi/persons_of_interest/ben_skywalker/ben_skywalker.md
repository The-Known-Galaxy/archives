# Introduction

Ben Skywalker, born in 26.5 ABY, was the son of Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker and Jedi Master Jade Skywalker, which means Ben is the grandson of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala.
Ben did not spend much time with his parents, because they were part of the New Jedi Order and fought in a lot of wars.
That is why he was taken care of by his uncle and aunt, Han Solo and Leia Solo.
Ben stayed at the Maw, a shelter where many young Jedi apprentices stayed.
Because of Ben's strong connection with the Force, he could feel the pain that comes from the wars, this caused Ben to close himself from the Force for many years.

In 35 ABY, Ben got involved in one of the many galactic crises.
There has been a new discovery of a new species in the Unknown Regions, namely, the Killik species.
When Ben and another few Jedi Knights felt the call of the Killik through the Force they tried following it to the Unknown Regions.
One of the Killiks tried turning Ben against his mother, but luckily Ben’s parents found it out before something bad could happen.

# Section 1

In 40 ABY, Ben Skywalker was at an age where you could call him a teenager, together with his older cousin Jacen Solo, who basically was Ben his master because Solo taught Ben to open up to the Force again and, but still was not a true Jedi since Solo did not finish any of the Academy tests.
Ben and Jacen went on a variety of dangerous and risky missions, Ben went on these missions with cautiousness, because he was in his teenage years which could let him turn to the Dark Side of the Force due to the hormone rushes, typical for a human teenager.

Luke Skywalker did not think that Jacen Solo was teaching Ben enough, that is why Luke invited Ben to the Jedi Temple Sparring Arena, hoping that Ben would realize he needs more intensive Jedi training, in the Jedi Academy.
Ben had a modified Yuuzhan Vong vonduun crab armor on, his father told him to take it off and then duel him, as he did, Ben realized this was the first time they would duel with live blades.Luke did ask for a duel with his son, yet he didn’t ignite his lightsaber.
While trying, Ben did not succeed in making his father ignite it.
Luke did not even ignite his saber while Ben played dead after a fall.
Luke used Ben’s poor combat skills as a reason to quit the Galactic Alliance Guard, but Ben refused.
After the long-lasting duel, in which Luke did not ignite his saber, ended, Ben found out that his father's saber was missing a power cell.
