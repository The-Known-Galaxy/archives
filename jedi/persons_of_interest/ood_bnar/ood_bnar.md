# Introduction
Species and early life:
Ood Bnar was a Neti, Master of the Jedi Order and Scholar.
His species, the Neti, were tree-like in appearance and nature.
His body held the ability to shape and manipulate itself, which he used very rarely other than to maintain his humanoid appearance.
He shared with his species an extremely long lifespan, as Bnar would demonstrate, living for thousands of years within the Order.
Bnar would be born as a seedling on the Neti homeworld of Ryyk, however very quickly was orphaned and lost on the planet Myrkr.
The rest of his youth was spent inhabiting this planet, until many years later the Jedi Order approached and recruited him after detecting his Force-sensitivity

Achievements within the Order:
Bnar would quickly navigate through his training, and eventually became a Jedi Master.
During his time in the Order he dedicated his time and effort into expanding his own and the Order’s own knowledge, becoming a revered Jedi Scholar who famously would study about the Dark side of the Force.
He did this by completely severing himself from the topic of his own studies, making him one of the very few Jedi who could study the Dark side of the Force without falling to the Dark side itself.
His extensive knowledge of the Dark side of the Force would indirectly assist the Order in the elimination of practitioners of the Dark.


Throughout his time in the Order he built a relationship with another long-lived individual - Jedi Knight Odan-Urr.
Odan-Urr would participate in the Great Hyperspace War of 5000BBY, upon its conclusion he would return to Ossus and the Order, and built the Great Jedi Library.
Bnar and Odan-Urr would often be seen interacting with one another in their studies, and often instructed Younglings together.
Odan-Urr was anointed Head Library, and Bnar would assist and act as his understudy.



# Section 2
Bnar was incessantly encouraged to construct his own holocron with the purpose of holding his knowledge of Jedi lore, as well as his discoveries from studying the Dark side of the Force.
At 1,000 years he would eventually create the holocron, take precautions to ensure that its contents would only be seen by the Jedi.
He installed a holographic mimicry inside of the Holocron to serve as its gatekeeper.
The relic was passed down throughout the generations of the Jedi Order, ending up in the hands of and teaching several Jedi crucial information.

Bnar, at some point in his career, agreed to take a young woman named Shaela Nuur as his student and apprentice.
Nuur would excel in her training, similarly to her master previously, and would impress Bnar with her ability to grow, learn and progress.
Bnar found her extravagant and deserving, so upon her constructing her own Lightsaber, he gifted her his rare brown-coloured lightsaber crystal - known as Bnar’s Sacrifice.
Nuur would eventually graduate from her training and begin her own journey within the Order, and Bnar would be left student-less for the remainder of his career.



# Section 3
Ood Bnar’s Demise:
Bnar eventually met his demise in 10 ABY, before this however he had been involved in a hostile interaction with Exar Kun, rendering him immobile.
He had used his tree-like abilities to shape his body to be significantly larger in order to protect a plethora of artifacts that Kun was aiming to retrieve.
Ossus was also soon to be targeted by a shockwave that would have devastated the planet.
Bnar would ultimately survive this tragedy, however the planet suffered significantly as radiation plagued the surface of Ossus and Bnar would enter a century-long hibernation on Ossus.
The Jedi were unable to reconstruct their libraries and temples on the planet any longer.
Even though the planet held more Jedi survivors, no one would find Bnar in his current state until 10 ABY.



# Section 4
After centuries of its existence, the holocron Bnar had constructed had found its way in the possession of Luke Skywalker, who was being directed to Ossus by the holocron.
Upon their arrival, they discovered the planet and its new inhabitants - the Ysanna tribe.
Skywalker had unfortunately been followed by two members of Palpatine’s Dark Side Elite, and a vast number of Empire troops.
Conflict would ensue, and the significant presence of Force-sensitivity - specifically from the Jedi - would awaken Bnar from his hibernation.
Bnar would join the conflict, defending the Jedi and the Ysanna tribe members, however would be eliminated alongside the darksiders.
The Jedi Master was unable to leave behind much more knowledge to the Jedi than the holocron, however upon his death he appeared to leave a small seedling behind in his place - Ood Bnar’s descendent.
The collection of ancient sabers would also help Skywalker’s attempt to rebuild the Jedi Order.
