# Introduction

Eeth Koth was a Zabrak Jedi Master born in the violent slums on the planet Nar Shadda, who was found to be Force-sensitive at the age of four.
He also served on the Jedi High Council around the final years of the Galactic Republic.
He was well known for his discipline, as well as most Iridonian Zabarak, and allowed him to tolerate all kinds of both physical and mental suffering.
This allowed him to survive the harsh elements and environments of Nar Shaddaa, and was even deemed to be too young for Jedi training at the age of four.
Harnessing natural abilities and being exceptionally strong in the Force, Eeth Koth was granted Jedi training due to his capabilities, and was brought to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.
Koth succeeded in many things, as well as becoming a member of the Jedi High Council, and serving as a Jedi General in the Battle of Geonosis, as a part of the Geonosis strike team, which consisted of over two-hundred and twelve Jedi.
Eeth Koth was presumed to be dead after a deadly LAAT gunship crash, which he was in along with Tarados Gon.
Eeth would then return to the Temple, and return to his duties.
In efforts to confront the General of the Separatist Droid Army, Grievous, Eeth Koth led a strike team during the Battle of Korriban, leading to Grievous’s capture in the Outer Rim.

# Section 1

Eeth Koth was a devout member of the Jedi Order and had very strong ties to other Masters within, but nothing beat the bond he had with his Padawan, Sharad Hett, who he took in and passed his abilities to.
His bond also strengthened with Mace Windu after their success and completion of the Jedi ritual, the Concordance of Fealty, after the invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY.
Eeth was also trained as a Jedi Guardian and harnessed very skilled abilities in tactical advantage and craft when wielding a lightsaber.
Eeth’s lightsaber contained a green Kyber crystal, producing an emerald blade.
Eeth's greatest strengths, including his capability of wielding the Force proficiently, lay in his ability where he can hone his mind, and use it as a disciplined weapon in emergencies.
While being extremely skilled in duels, Eeth was capable of holding off and facing off against Grievous, while being forced on the defensive with his lightsaber, due to a forearm injury.
Koth demonstrated proficiency as he unleashed a powerful Force ability, resulting in telekinetic blasts, which he used to subdue General Grievous temporarily.
He was also known to use his double-bladed green lightsaber in duels and sparring bouts among his fellow Jedi.
