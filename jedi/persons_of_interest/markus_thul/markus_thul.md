# Introduction
Markus Andarius Thul was a member of the House of Thul, a noble house of Alderaan which was founded 3.5 thousand years before the beginning of the Galactic Empire.
Before the Aldeeran civil war, Markus was a very powerful member of the house.
His drive to conquer his homeworld became more apparent when he allied himself with the Sith, hoping they would help him achieve his dream of ruling Alderaan.
With every rising conflict in the Alderaan civil war, Markus began to distrust the empire's alliance and feared that the house of Thul was gonna lose its way by following every Imperial order they gave out.
In 3642 BBY Markus attempted an attack on the inside of Castle Organa but he was quickly stopped and imprisoned by Capitan Balic Cormac.
During his imprisonment he was visited by the new lieutenant of the Havoc Squad to find Bex Kolos, a former member of the Havoc Squad before switching over to the Sith.
Markus was the only one who knew about Bex's whereabouts and so he pleaded to the new lieutenant, he begged the new lieutenant to save his daughter and wife who he had a feeling would be betrayed by the empire..
Luckily for Markus, the lieutenant agreed to rescue his wife and daughter, and after sneaking into the house of Thul, Altana and her daughter reunited with Markus in House Organa.
Upon meeting his wife and daughter Markus gave away the location of Bex and was set free by the lieutenant, with this exchange Markus promised that he and his family will be in debt to the Havoc squad and the family fled from Alderaan to Chandrila.
