# Introduction
Nadia Grell was a female Sarkhai who was born in the year of 3664 BBY.
She was born to Tobas Grell who was a senator in the Galactic Republic, and Maykia Grell who died at Nadia’s birth.
She grew up with an interest in diplomacy due to her father’s occupation as a senator.
Later, on the planet Quesh which was a toxic planet located in the hut space, she met a Jedi.
The Jedi Consular found Nadia, a strong force-sensitive, who was treated like an outsider due to how rare it was for a Sarkhai to have the Force.
Her father then knew how much raw power Nadia held comparing her to the Jedi.
With his death, she was taken into the Order to be nurtured as a Jedi, upon her father's will.
She also took over her father's position, as the senator, sometimes leaving to take on these duties during her training.

# Section 1
Nadia and her master were meditating on their ship when a Lieutenant bursted into their room to inform them that their ship’s navicomputer had been sliced.
Nadia's master had a vision of Rishi that compelled them to change their destination to Rishi.
A Twilek on board called Zenith informed them about Rishi, that it was a planet filled with piracy and gunrunning, a safe haven for them.



# Section 2
As Nadia's master had gone missing for some time, she gathered the support of her master's old allies to help in the effort to find her.
While she was searching, she was promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight within the Jedi Order.
During her search, she met Master Gnost Dural and helped him in his efforts to start a new hidden Jedi colony hidden from the world on Ossus.
