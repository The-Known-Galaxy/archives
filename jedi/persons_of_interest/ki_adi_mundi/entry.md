# Introduction

Ki-Adi-Mundi was a well-renowned Jedi Master who served on the Jedi High Council during the Clone Wars era.
The Cerean male was a well-respected Jedi who was often confided in by both the Master and Grandmaster of the order.
He was regarded as one of the best Jedi of this era due to his impressive skill, sense of justice and great knowledge on the battlefield.

# Section 1

Ki-Adi-Mundi was born in 93 BBY and was discovered at the age of four by Jedi Master An’ya Kuro.
He was one of the few Jedi that was permitted to join and train in the Order after infancy.
Ki-Adi-Mundi would then spend decades as an apprentice to Jedi Grandmaster Yoda until he reached Knighthood.
Eventually, Ki-Adi-Mundi would return to his homeland to free his people from a gang of raiders and would go on to become the Jedi Watchman of the Cerean sector.
Ki-Adi-Mundi would also infamously be given an exception to the Jedi ban on marriage due to the low-birth rate of the Cerean species.
He would have numerous wives along with many children, which he loved deeply but prevented himself from forming intense attachments.

During the Clone Wars, Ki-Adi-Mundi acted as a military General in a variety of battles.
He was an asset to the republic due to his great wisdom and experience.
Ki-Adi-Mundi played an important part in the return of Geonosis, as the Galactic Republic attempted to reclaim the planet and destroy the Separatist droid factory.
The Jedi led his squad viciously through the resistive natives and droids to victory, whilst suffering severe casualties.
As Ki-Adi-Mundi continued to be involved in many more battles, it did not take away from his duties as a Jedi High Council member.
He would be sure to attend every meeting and to work alongside his colleagues in decisions and strategizing against their enemies.
As the war began to conclude, Ki-Adi-Mundi was one of the few Jedi who started to grow weary of Chancellor Palpatine and his deception.
Unfortunately, it was not enough to prevent Ki-Adi-Mundi's death at the hand of Order 66 from his troopers.

Ki-Adi-Mundi possessed both great skill and wisdom that few could rival.
He was considered to be one of the greatest swordsmen in the order; as he obtained knowledge of all 7 forms while excelling in form II.
He was also one of the leaders of the Jedi Assault Team alongside Mace Windu; and he was deployed on numerous dangerous missions such as rescuing Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala from their captivity on Geonosis.
