# Introduction
Gorga Desilijic Aarrpo, a powerful Hutt crime lord and the nephew of Jabba Desilijic Tiure, played a significant role in the criminal underworld.
Rising to prominence during the Clone Wars, he became the leader of the Desilijic clan and represented it on the Hutt Ruling Council.
After Jabba's death, Gorga inherited his uncle's criminal empire and expanded it further, surpassing even Jabba's achievements.

# Section 1
Gorga was born on the Hutt homeworld of Nal Hutta, the child of an unknown sibling of Jabba Desilijic Tiure.
He became the leader of the Desilijic clan alongside Jabba and earned a position on the influential Hutt Ruling Council.
Despite being Jabba's nephew, Gorga's voice carried some weight on council matters, although not as much as his uncle's.



# Section 2
During the Clone Wars, the Hutt Ruling Council enlisted the services of the bounty hunter Cad Bane to track down Ziro the Hutt, who possessed sensitive information about Hutt activities.
Gorga served on the council alongside Jabba and other Hutts.
On one occasion, Gorga unwittingly encountered Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was undercover as a Zygerrian guard, during a visit to the slave markets on Zygerria.
Later, Gorga appeared at the Bilbousa Bazaar, unknowingly passing by Obi-Wan again, this time disguised as the bounty hunter Rako Hardeen.



# Section 3
During his time on Tatooine, Gorga became enamored with a Hutt named Anachro, the daughter of his enemy, Orko the H'uun.
Seeking to win her favor, Gorga hired the renowned bounty hunter Boba Fett to eliminate Bar-Kooda, a pirate kingpin harassing Orko's freighters.
Gorga's plan succeeded, and he celebrated his impending marriage to Anachro by consuming Bar-Kooda's corpse.
However, their honeymoon was disrupted when Anachro was kidnapped by slavers on Skeebo.
Gorga once again turned to Boba Fett to rescue her.
Although complications arose, including accusations of murder and a clash with Ry-Kooda, Gorga managed to reunite with Anachro.



# Section 4
Despite incurring a significant debt due to Boba Fett's services, Gorga's business acumen enabled him to amass a substantial fortune.
He owned casinos, restaurants, and cargo haulers, which contributed to his wealth and influence.
Gorga was also involved in a black market operation, trading precious ulikuo gemstones from Kip with a silent partner.
While he believed his wife, Anachro, was unaware of this venture, she was, in fact, aware and ambitious.
Gorga even had a palace on Tatooine that resembled his late uncle's.
Following Jabba's demise, Gorga sought to inherit his uncle's treasure ship, the Spirit of Jabba, along with its valuable contents.
However, he faced obstacles as other individuals, Gizman and Spiker, reached the vessel first and engaged in a confrontation.
In an attempt to escape, Gizman and Spiker threw Jabba's priceless collection of Mendacian Funeral Urns at Gorga, causing him to lose one of the most valuable treasures.



# Section 5
Gorga Desilijic Aarrpo was a money-focused and scheming Hutt, fully embracing the nature of the Hutts' pride in their deceitful ways.
He skillfully engaged in skimming and outright theft while ensuring the continuity of his criminal enterprise.
Gorga's physical appearance included an average Hutt build.
His head had a square shape, and his green-tan skin, along with his turquoise eyes, made him visually distinct.
During the Clone Wars, Gorga wore a unique headset combining a speaker and monocle.
The monocle, positioned over his right eye, had a hinged lens that could be rotated, resulting in a distorted look for his eye when in use.
