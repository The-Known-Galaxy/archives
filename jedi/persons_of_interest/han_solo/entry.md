# Section 1

Han Solo became a smuggler and fell in love with Bria Tharen, a commander in the Rebel Alliance.
Bria had to leave Han due to her important responsibilities in the Rebel Alliance.
After a while, Han Solo went to the Imperial Academy on the planet Carida, at the academy he learned his skills as a pilot.
At flight school, Han’s records were miscellaneous: he gained excellent piloting marks, however, his academic record was under par, as he gained a number of offences and lack of performance reports.
He was expelled, however, he saved a Wookie named Chewbacca from an Imperial officer holding a neuronic whip for resisting arrest.
In appreciation, Chewbacca promised a life debt to Han for saving him with his life, whereas Chewbacca protected Han Solo for the rest of his life as they two had an unbreakable friendship.
As he was expelled from the Imperial Academy, he became a smuggler once again with Chewbacca on Han Solo’s side.
He also owned and piloted the famously known Millenium Falcon as he won a game of Sabacc, a card game, against Lando Calrissian, soon to be a friend.
In time, he became one of the best smugglers in the whole galaxy.

While he was on the run from Imperial officers Han Solo met up with the Rebel Alliance, with respect to Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Princess Leia Organa, whom Han Solo helped save from the Death Star.
Han Solo helped Luke Skywalker terminate the Death Star when it struck the Rebel’s base at Yavin 4, where they had kidnapped Leia Organa.
Eventually, Han became an unconfirmed member of the Rebel Alliance, where he fell in love with Leia.
In 8 ABY, Han Solo married Leia Organa, where they had three children named: Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin.
The New Republic had many enemies throughout the years of their first existence, Han was always on the move, occasionally with Luke Skywalker, also known as Leia’s brother.
Alongside his wife, and the faithful friend Chewbacca, his journey followed on, which led him to become the greatest known smuggler.
Although his demise may have come, his legacy and greatness will live on forever in the hearts of all who rebel against their enemies.
Before all that, as he was born on the planet Corellia, Han Solo was orphaned as a child.
His earliest memories were of him being found by Garris Shrike in a Corellian spaceport, with no other memory of his life before.
Garris Shrike was a bounty hunter, who raised Han and collected other orphans to raise, Shrike used them for tricks and stealing, training them to become thieves in his secret operation.
In the beginning, Han was made to go out as a beggar, using his young and innocent appearance to catch people’s attention.
As he grew older, he learned how to pickpocket for stealing by practicing it on a droid of Shrike’s, then he got sent out to the streets to do that.
At this time, Han made friends with a female Wookie named Dewlannamapia, nicknamed Dewlanna, who served food as a cook on-board the Liberator troopship, Shrike’s ship.
Dewlanna raised Han as her own, taught him the language of the Wookies named Shyriiwook, and took care of him when he became ill.
Han went on missions with Garris Shrike to participate in uncountable scams and illegal activities under Shrike’s command, his missions also included asteroid mining scam and swoop racing.

Han Solo deeply wanted to know further about his parents and his family.
All that information was kept hidden by Garris Shrike to keep Han in control.
He never got to learn about his bloodline for years.
At one point in time, Dewlanna learned that Han Solo was from the well known House of Solo, as that was, he ran away from Garris Shrike on the planet Corellia.
Han tried to track down his aunt named Tiion Solo and his cousin, named Thrackan Sal-Solo.
He thought when they’ll meet back again it would be the happiest moment of his life, but he was wrong, his reunion with his family went horribly.
Han’s aunt was housebound and mad, unavailable to leave the house due to old age and illness, while his cousin was a heartless bully.
In the end, he was sold back to Garris Shrike.
Han never learned about his parents, named Jonash and Jaina Solo, until he became an adult.
Han Solo covered up the fact that he was descended from Berethron e Solo, who established democracy in Corellia as he served as the planet’s king.

# Section 4

Han Solo visited many planets following the commands of Shrike.
Throughout a mission on the planet Corellia, Han met and made friends with a half-breed named Brey - a male Human/Nagai hybrid from Corellia - in the Nagai Invasion following closely to the Battle of Endor.
Han’s education was patchy, just like the other children that Shrike used as beggars and robbers.
However, most of the children managed to receive some knowledge from the ship’s computer, on Shrike’s ship called the Trader’s Luck.
Han managed to learn - together with Dewlanna’s help - mathematics, physics, and history by reading in his leisure .
Han earned his stay for Shrike by doing a number of unpleasant jobs, at one time, he participated in a pirate group run by murderers named Lemo and Sanda.
At this stage, Han made an enemy who was a Corellian bounty hunter named Dengar, also called “Payback”.
During one huge race with a large public audience, through the Agrilat crystal swamps, Han caused Dengar to smash into a crystalline plant headfirst, dangerously wiping out the other racer.
As that happened, Dengar held his anger against Han for the rest of his life, later on, Dengar would hunt him down as he was ordered to as a bounty hunter.

# Section 5

Few years went by, at 10 BBY, Han Solo was ready to leave Shrike’s ship in order to start his own walk of life.
He planned to hide aboard the Ylesian Dream, an automatic freighter, to go to the tropical world of Ylesia located in Hutt space.
There he would apply for a job advertised by the Ylesian priests, as he was about to leave, Garris Shrike and a number of his troops saw him leaving while he was saying goodbye to Dewlanna.
The troops tried to catch Han, however, Dewlanna sacrificed herself to them so he could escape, which successfully worked.
Ever since his escape, he continued his journey and soon became the best known smuggler in the galaxy.
