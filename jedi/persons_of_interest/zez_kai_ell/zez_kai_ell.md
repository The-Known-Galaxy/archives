# Introduction

Zez-Kai Ell, one of the remaining Jedi masters and a member who was part of what is left of the Jedi High Council during the Mandalorian war until the First Jedi Purge that dated back around 4000 years before the battle of Yavin happened.
When the Mandalorian war came, the Jedi master’s padawan was one of the many of the Jedi who went with Revan and never came back from it after he fell to the dark side.
However, unlike his fellow masters, Zez-Kai Ell did not blame him for it because he understood the reason his apprentice followed to fight.

# Section 1

After the Mandalorian war ended, he was one of the five masters who summoned and banished Meetra Surik from the order as she was the only Jedi who came for the trials of the Jedis who had gone to war with Revan.
Despite her banishment, Zez-Kai Ell was disappointed with his fellow master's decision as he had thought that they had given away a perfect opportunity, which was to understand why many of their fellow members have left the order and sought the problem within their teachings.

Zez-Kai Ell remained on the Jedi High Council until the Jedi Civil war ended when the First Jedi Purge was shortly about to begin.
By that time, Zez-Kai ElI had already left the order as he had no longer considered himself a Jedi due to disbelief in his fellow Jedis and even himself in the first place.
Nevertheless, he remained loyal and followed his fellow master, Kavar, whose plan was to go into hiding until their hidden threat showed itself throughout the galaxy.

# Section 2

Meetra Surik was captured at first, due to her presence being taken notice of by the bounty hunters around the planet.
When the news came, Zez-Kai Ell hired a bounty hunter named Mira to help him out as he finally came out of hiding as he decided to save what would be one of the last Jedis that was still alive in the galaxy.
After Meetra was rescued, the two had a long conversation regarding topics such as her trials and even to the point, Revan as well.
When their conversation ended and the Jedi Master was asked to come to a conclave on the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine, Zez-Kai Ell agreed and went there shortly.

What was left of the Jedi High Council members gathered with Meetra Surik, Zez-Kai Ell, and with fellow masters on the Jedi Enclave of Dantooine.
Still, they remained with the same plan they had instead of forming a counterattack to the hidden threat, who had already revealed themselves to be the Sith by the time of it and decided to cut off Meetra’s connection to the force as she was a wound within it.
However, before that could happen, they were interrupted by Kreia, who happened to be Meetra’s mentor at the time.
The three Jedi Masters attempted to fight back, only to be met with death by the mysterious mentor shortly.
