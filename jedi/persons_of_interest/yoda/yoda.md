# Introduction
Yoda, one of the most legendary Jedi known throughout galactic history, being a force sensitive male of an unknown species.
He has been known his time for his large wisdom, mastery of the Force on top of his skills in lightsaber combat.
Having trained many padawan’s in his time, Yoda was a very respected member of the Jedi Order.
He held a seat on the Jedi High Council for the last centuries of the Galactic Republic, then serving as Grand Master from before the Clone Wars.
He also gained the title of Master of the Order in addition to Grand Master after the First Battle of Geonosis.

# Section 1
There is not much information about Yoda’s young life, being born in 896 BBY on an unknown planet.
It is said Yoda did not know about being force sensitive, traveling to the core world with a human friend.
They would however, eventually crash on a strange swampy planet where Jedi Master n’Kata Del Gormo found them.
Here their force sensitive nature was revealed and Yoda became his Padawan.
Del Gormo would take them back to his home and train them before the two was rescued.
Yoda travelled to Coruscant so he could continue his training as an Initiate in the Jedi Temple.



# Section 2
Once he completed his Padawan training Yoda became a Jedi Knight, allowing him to go on important missions.
By 96 Yoda had become a Jedi master, then later being elected for a High Council seat.
By the time of 800 BBY he had started training his first student, who would be the first of many to come.
After fighting the Witches of Dathomir he found his second padawan Ikrit on Kushibah.
 Ikrit was strong in the Force though as a knight lost control during a small disagreement and would nearly murder a friend with his saber.
Yoda would risk his own life to stop him and as a result Ikrit would give up on using a lightsaber.



# Section 3
200 BBY Yoda among other masters found the shape of the Force was changing, the High Council agreeing it was the Dark Side was growing.
While some thought it meant the growth of the Sith, Yoda meanwhile thought this could mean the coming of the Chosen One, the one that would bring balance to the Force.
102 BBY Dooku would be found by the Jedi, being trained under Thame Cerulian with some guidance from Yoda himself.
In his later years, only Yoda and Mace Windu were considered equal in skill.



# Section 4
Yoda would go through many conflicts through 33 BBY to 19 BBY, including the Invasion of Naboo, the Seperatist Crisis and the Clone Wars.
Following would be the Battle of Coruscant where despite best efforts the Chancellor Palpatine would be captured before being rescued by Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi.
The Chancellor would than appoint Anakin to the High Council as his representative.
The Invasion of Kashyyyk would follow with Yoda feeling the fall of Anakin to the dark side and the many Jedi deaths from Order 66.
Despite that Yoda was able to survive with help from Wookies Chewbacca and Tarfful, than escape to meet with Obi-Wan and Senator Bail Organa.



# Section 5
Yoda would continue to do his best, fighting Palptine, before being exiled and training on the planet Dagobah.
This planet would be where he would meet Anakin’s son Luke Skywalker.
With some persuasion from Obi-Wan’s spirit he would train Luke, before one year later falling ill.
Struggling to tell Luke about his father, he would die and become one with the Force.
Yoda was a very gifted man and left a big impact on the galaxy, his teachings becoming the basis for what Luke taught in his new Order.
