# Introduction
Nom Anor was one of the most ambitious Yuuzhan Vongs, he was from the Intendant castle's Domain Anor, his contribution for the Yuuzhan Vong War was massive and it helped the species in the war.
Anor was born around 6 ABY and was dispatched as an agent and a saboteur, to prepare for an extra-galactic invasion.
Anor wasn't directly at the heat of the war, he worked behind the scenes and would scout battlefields prior to the battle, ensuring that nothing would disrupt Yuuzhan Vongs in battle and ultimately securing the battlefield for an easier victory.
Anor even managed to manipulate the Imperial Ruling council which led to the council's dowfal.
His manipulative tactics helped cause a lot of discord in the galaxy.

# Section 1
Around 25 ABY, Anor was ranked Executor and made connection with the Intendant caste's Praetorite Vong, as they aided Anor in being an initial force for the Invasion, Anor failed against the elite forces of the New Republic despite Anor's determination to succeed and his will to win.
At the same time of his failed attempt, his destabilization work was starting to uproar a full scale war amongst the planets Osarian and Rhommamool.
Anor would also go out of his way to help the Peace Brigade organization, a group critical of the New Empire's reaction to the Yuuzhan Vong invasion and would later go and help the Yuuzhan Vongs, but they would later switch sides and aid the warrior caste slightly.
Anor wasn't too bothered about this as he had planned to assassinate members of the New Jedi Order with the help of another Yuuzhan Vong, but unfortunately for him their plan failed in the Bilbringi system.
A year later Anor tried to make an alliance with the Hutt species and Yuuzhan Vong species, with this alliance Anor would hope that the species Hutt would be able to convince the New Republic that the next strike of the Yuuzhan Vong would be in Corellia instead in the shipyard in the Fondor System, the New Republic believed this and Anor was able to achieve a victory against the Republic due to a ambushed attack.

After the battle at Fondor, Anor would assist in the invasion of a heavily polluted planet called Duro, he later had plans to sabotage the defensive system in the Yag Dhul systems although his plans failed due to Jedi involvement.
In the year 27ABY, Anor was sent alongside Vergere to stop a Jedi Strike team from killing off the queen of the Jedi-hunting voxyn on the world Jacen Solo.
Anor failed to protect the queen as the Jedi team managed to assassinate the queen, alongside letting Solo escape from the Yuuzhan custody; this act belittled Anor's reputation in the eyes of his superiors.



# Section 3
Desperate to provide a victory for the Yuuzhan Vong's Anor was baited into following a trial consisting of false info made by New Republic operatives and was led by Warmaster Tsavong Lah into a massive battle in the Treskov system.
Warmaster perished against the forces present there.
Anor fled into the underworld of the system where the Warmaster would perish.
Anor chose to lead the Shamed Ones, a group for the Yuuzhan Vong's hiding in the underworld of the system who believed in the Jeedai Heresy.
Upon discovering evidence that the legendary living world called Zonama Sektor was real, Anor teamed up with the Jedi Knight for a short period of time in order to find the planet, although he would eventually betray them and would win the grace of the Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane.
Despite his promotion to a perfect Anor would become disillusioned with Jamaane's rule as he once more took up the role of a Prophet to lead the heretics against the Supreme Overlord as the Jedi and Galactic Alliance made an attempt to retake Coruscant.
Anor's legacy failed however when he was captured by the Jedi, while the Yuuzhan Vong would surrender after the death of Jamaane.
Realizing that his reign is over and that he has nothing more going on for him, Anor remained on a fallen apart starship which would fall apart over Coruscant.
