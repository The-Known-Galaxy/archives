# Introduction

Ivernus was a male member of the Human species.
During his career as an Admiral of the Sith Empire at the height of the Cold War, he demanded the respect of those who served under him.
He was stationed on Balmorra to launch an attack and gain control of it due to its strategic vantage point in the galaxy - close to the Core Worlds and its high weapons production.
The invasion occurred by using the planet's security systems against them, leading to the release of bioweapons such as mutated Colicoids, this achievement awarding Ivernus with the highest medal of the Empire for his key role in planning, but even this didn't make him leave his ship from the planet's orbit.

# Section 1

In 3643 BBY, a reformed version of the original Great Hunt, a competition held amongst Mandalorians, began with the first target being Admiral Ivernus.
Since he never seemed to leave his ship, the competitors of the Great Hunt had a difficult time killing him.
A participant called Mako was able to find a weak link through Lieutenant Major Pirrel, an officer willing to impress Ivernus through his betrayal of his superior, Colonel Sartius.
Pirrel used Hunter, a bounty hunter participant of the Hunt, to sabotage Sartius' missions, drawing Ivernus from his ship, not in an act of appraisal but to execute Pirrell for his incompetence.
Hunter used this to his advantage, killing Ivernus and Murghir, who was a rival in the Hunt.
