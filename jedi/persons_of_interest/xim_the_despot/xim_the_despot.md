# Introduction

“In Eternal Homage to Xim, Whose Fist Shall Enclose the Stars and Whose Name Shall Outlive Time.” - Unknown.

Although an evil man, his followers looked to him as if he were their God.
In his short reign over one of the fiefdoms (large area of galactic space) he conquered much of the Tion Cluster.
This all occurred before the founding of the Republic and thus was outside of their jurisdiction entirely.
He inherited a vast wealth from his father, and used this to fuel his war efforts.

He met an unfortunate and unexpected demise when he was captured at the Third Battle of Vontor by Kossak Inijic Ar’durv, a self-proclaimed leader of the Hutts.
Xim died later simply by rotting away in Hutt jails.
However, the mystery of where he kept his great fortunes is a legend that many still look for throughout the galaxy.

# Section 1

Born on Argai, and raised by an incredibly powerful pirate, it was only natural that he’d enter politics and later become the leader of a criminal empire.
Xim was a vicious boy, murdering many of Cron’s nobility called the Cronese Sweeps in a plight for power.

This earned him a reputation, which he further amplified by subjugating the Livien League, a cluster of various planets.
The scale of this assault is legendary, and speaks volumes to the extent of this boy's power.

Interestingly, Maslovar Tiatiov, the military ruler of Livien at the time, showed Xim various facilities, academies and bureaucracies which led to him being spared as Xim was impressed.
Xim later learned from these academies, and applied their methods in his own armies and fleets using devastating technology such as war droids and beam-tubes.

During Xim’s conquest, he came upon Queen Indrexu who was later written into Xim-related mythology.
Xim - although it is debated - valued this woman very much, and titled an entire six province of his empire under her name.

Within (30) years, Xim had managed to inexplicably have an empire that consisted of thousands of worlds.
This glory was threatened by the rise of a new empire known as the Hutts.
Xim initially did not favour a war with them, but after they claimed the Xim and Tionese would be excellent slaves, he launched a military campaign against them.

# Section 2

The war started promptly, with neither side gaining a footing.
Xim’s armies looted Ko Vari which contained many of the Hutts resources, but their fleet was pushed back with many flagships being lost in the black holes that surround Xo’s Eye.
Strategically, this was a failure for Xim.

Kossak the Hutt realised as the war dragged on that the Tionese were much more capable of fighting a long war of attrition and thus desperately taunted Xim into a battle of ritual combat at Vontor.
Xim, having his pride hurt, accepted and his fleet was defeated by the Hutts at the First Battle of Vontor.
The Second Battle of Vontor ended much the same, except his ground forces this time were absolutely massacred.
Furthermore, the Hutts, being excellent at pirating, were looting and cutting into the supply lines of Xim’s empire, eating away their resources.
This ultimately weakened Xim’s military might.

# Section 3

Ultimately, at the third Battle of Vontor, XIm’s already weakened armies had to face an insurmountable army of Hutt, who had also gathered numerous allies, namely: Klatooinian, Nikto, Weequay and Vodran.
Furthermore, it is rumoured that there were defectors and cowardly traitors amongst Xim’s empire who eroded the might of their army.
With this said, Xim’s army was annihilated.
Xim was captured, and his eyes were cut away.

The Hutts, a truly vile species, paraded Xim throughout their cities as a trophy, and eventually he died in a Varl dungeon.
It is rumoured that he was actually stabbed in the back by one of his own men at Vontor, but it is uncertain.

# Section 4

The Queen of Ranroon, Xim’s famous treasure ship that held his vast wealth supposedly escaped to Dellalt where it is still guarded by an army of war droids and a brotherhood known as the “Survivors''.
These individuals are descendants from the original captains and pilots of the Ranroon treasure ship.
Xim’s empire scattered and fragmented, but still survives partially through the criminal organisation GenoHaradan.

Xim’s treasure has inspired many adventurers, but was actually discovered by Han Solo and S.V.
Skynx who concluded that it’s technology was worthless.

Xim’s reign and the study of it is now known as Ximology, and has inspired books, holoplays and literary collaborations.
