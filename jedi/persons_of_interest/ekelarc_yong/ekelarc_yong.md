As a skilled lieutenant and starfighter pilot, Yong served as Gray Three, flying a BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber in Gray Squadron.

# Section 1

Ekelarc Yong was a human male who joined the ranks of the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the height of the Galactic Civil War.
He became a skilled BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber pilot, earning the rank of lieutenant.
His remarkable piloting skills secured his position in Gray Squadron, a mixed unit comprising Y-wings, B-wing starfighters, and A-wing interceptors, led by the capable Gray Leader, Horton Salm.
Together, they formed a formidable force dedicated to taking down the Empire's Death Star II.

# Section 2

In 4 ABY, the Alliance Fleet, including Yong's Gray Squadron, planned an ambitious attack on the unfinished Death Star II.
The Rebels believed that the Empire was unaware of their intentions and hoped to exploit the superweapon's presumed lack of shields.
However, their hopes were dashed when they discovered that they had fallen into a trap set by the Imperial forces.

# Section 3

As the Alliance fleet arrived in the Endor system, they found themselves facing a formidable Imperial fleet, consisting of numerous TIE/ln space superiority starfighters and TIE/IN interceptors.
The Rebels soon realized that their initial attack run was untenable and called off the assault.
Instead, they prepared to confront the Imperial fleet head-on, waiting for a strike team sent to the moon of Endor to disable the Death Star's shield generator.

# Section 4

As the battle intensified, Yong found himself in a fierce dogfight with two TIE fighters on his tail.
Despite his exceptional piloting skills, his Y-wing was eventually struck by enemy fire, sending the starfighter into a perilous spin.
Rather than succumbing to defeat, Yong courageously used his damaged starfighter as a weapon.
He skillfully crashed his Y-wing into the bridge of an Imperial Star Destroyer, dealing a devastating blow to the enemy.
Unfortunately, Yong perished in the explosion, sacrificing his life for the greater good.
