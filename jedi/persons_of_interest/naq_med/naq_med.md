# Introduction

Naq Med's journey through life was one of many high and low moments.
The force-sensitive human male’s life as a Jedi is not very detailed; he was taken into the Jedi Order a little after his birth around 66 BBY and trained in the ways of the Force, reaching the rank of Padawan.
It would be his separation from the Order however, where he would show his true nature and bravery.

# Section 1

However, it was before the beginning of the Clone Wars that Med would decide to abandon the Order and the vows he took.
His reasoning was that the order had become too connected with the politics of the galaxy, losing their identity in his eyes.
This decision led to him not only going forth and starting a family with his wife and raising a daughter named J’Hara, but also sparing him from being a part of the infamous Order 66 that followed the end of the Clone Wars.
The former Jedi later learned of the extermination through the reporting of now Emperor Palpatine, he believed the Emperor without any doubt.

# Section 2

While it seemed that Med's past was behind him and his future with his family was now his only concern, that would prove to be not the path life would go for him.
Now with the Galactic Empire reigning, a Grand Inquisitor tracked the former Jedi down and attacked him.
During the fight, Med was able to destroy the lightsaber of the Inquisitor and flee from his home to Pam’ba, leaving his family behind.

# Section 3

Now, thirty-one years after the battle of Yavin, Naq Med is still hidden on Pam’ba.
As he knows, being even in contact with his family will spell danger for them, and has secluded himself to this planet for the rest of his days.
However, a surprise for Med would be his great-grandson Karr Nuq Sin finding and meeting him for the first time.
This is when Med would learn about the Jedi hunt no longer continuing, and that his sacrifice of solitude for his family was not in vain.
Shortly after Med’s death, his grandson took his Jedi robes and lightsaber.
Karr Nuq Sin was inspired by his late great-grandfather’s life and the Jedi Order.
So now he would go on through the galaxy as a Force collector, telling the tales of the Jedi and keeping the memory alive.
