# Introduction
Arcann was a Force-sensitive human who was the son of Senya Tirall and Valkorion, the Immortal Emperor of the Eternal Empire of Zakuul.
Arcann trained alongside his twin brother Thexan since childhood, later fighting together in skirmishes against the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire.
Following the death of his father, Arcann reigned over the Eternal Empire and dominated the galaxy for five years.
His eventual downfall was brought by the formation of a resistance movement against Zakuul.

During their childhood, Arcann and his brother frequently swapped clothes to confuse their servants and irritated personnel for their own amusement.
The twin princes were inseparable, regularly playing with each other, sparring and occasionally running away to live in Zakuul’s Endless Swamp for a month.
They were trained from a young age to become warriors, joining the Knights of Zakuul to gain their fathers’s respect.
Senya Tirall, a former Knight and member of Valkorion's elite guard, often oversaw the training of her two children.
As a prince, Arcann wanted nothing more than to be shown love and affection by his father, but Valkorion’s carelessness led to Arcann’s growing animosity.
His mother Senya loved the twins above all else, though neither Arcann nor his siblings returned her affection.
When Valkorion confined their sister Vaylin on Nathema, Senya set out to leave Valkorion in order to take her children.
Arcann and his siblings laughed off their mother, labelling her as weak.

In 3636 BBY, the twin princes led several brief raids on the border worlds controlled by the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire.
During the attack on Korriban, Arcann was severely wounded by an explosion which scarred the left half of his face and severed his left arm, requiring cybernetics to be fitted.
Following the twins’ return to the Eternal Throne, Arcann demonstrated his resentment in an attempt to murder Valkorion for his indifference.
Thexan swiftly intervened, only to be struck down by Arcann in a fit of blind rage.
Arcann cradled Thexan in his arms, deeply regretting the death of his closest companion.

In the same year, the Outlander was brought as a prisoner before the Eternal Throne.
As Valkorion offered to share his power with them, Arcann used it as an opportunity to attempt an assassination on his father a second time.
The assassination attempt was successful, though Arcann pinned the murder of the Immortal Emperor on the Outlander.
Arcann sensed Valkorion’s essence had clung onto the Outlander and condemned them to be frozen in carbonite.
He ascended to the Eternal Throne and appointed his sister Vaylin as the High Justice, immediately declaring an open war with the rest of the galaxy.
The ensuing conflict crippled the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire within a year, allowing Arcann to thrust heavy sanctions upon the galactic powers, as well as forcing them to pay tribute to Zakuul.



# Section 5
During Arcann’s time as a prince, the leader of the Scions of Zakuul, Heskal, foreshadowed a great catastrophe.
Arcann detested the Scions for their fanaticism surrounding their Force visions and ordered their complete eradication after assuming the Eternal Throne.
Four years after the fall of the Core Worlds, the Outlander was breached from carbonite freezing by the Sith Intelligence Minister Lana Beniko and assisted by Zakuulan defector Koth Vortena, which infuriated the Eternal Emperor.
The fugitives acquired the ancient Gravestone, a warship that rivalled the Eternal Fleet.
The Outlander established the Alliance against Zakuul on Odessen and was henceforth known as the Alliance Commander.
After discovering the Alliance headquarters on Odessen, Arcann launched an invasion which resulted in a space battle near the planet.
Subsequently, Arcann was defeated by the Alliance Commander and the Gravestone destroyed the fleet attacking Odessen.
In Arcann’s absence, Vaylin usurped the Eternal Throne and declared herself the Eternal Empress.
Arcann’s failure against the Alliance confirmed Heskel’s prophecy regarding the decline of the Eternal Empire.



# Section 6
Following Vaylin’s demise, Valkorion’s spirit attempted to possess the Alliance Commander.
As Valkorion battled the Alliance Commander in their own mindscape, the essence of Arcann materialized to assist the obliteration of Valkorion’s spirit, whom he viewed as the true enemy for manipulating him.
Approximately a year later, it was revealed that the Sith entity Tenebrae, who used Valkorion as a host for centuries, had reemerged.
In the mindscape of Satele Shan, the faces of Tenebrae were confronted by all the people that he had manipulated or murdered over centuries.
Arcann and his family were present at the standoff to join in the entity’s permanent destruction.
Upon meeting his brother, Thexan offered him forgiveness for his past wrongdoings.
Arcann’s final battle alongside Revan, Meetra Surik and the Alliance Commander saw the last remnant of Tenebrae annihilated.
