# Introduction

Taron Malicos was known to many as a great Jedi Master that was advanced in both tactical planning and saber combat during the Clone Wars.
However, during the rise of the Empire, the years of isolation and survival on the wicked planet of Dathomir would stray Malicos from the light into the dark abyss the planet emits.
Leaving him to be buried along with Dathomir’s history.

# Section 1

Taron Malicos was a Force sensitive human male, he had gray hair, blue eyes, and fair white skin.
In the Republic Era he was known as a logical and great General, leading his army of clones through many great battles.
It was during the rise of the Empire when his personality took a more aggressive turn.
His ideals changed to idolizing power as the only way to live, stating that either strength in oneself or death were his only options, after being trapped on Dathomir.
His appearance had even changed, the former Jedi would acquire multiple scars across his body from the Nightbrothers.

In 19 BBY when Order 66 was enacted, Malicos was betrayed and attacked by his fellow clones in a similar way as other Jedi, by surprise and shock.
Malicos had to make a quick decision and kill his own men and escape on his ship, crash-landing on Dathomir and being left stranded.
Dathomir’s fauna and dark presence drove the Jedi to the dark side, as he felt that the power it gave was his only savior from the sinister planet.
It was later that the Nightbrothers had found Malicos, they took Malicos to their current leader Viscus.
Viscus and Malicos would engage each other in a duel that would leave Viscus dead and the fallen Jedi the victor, thus making Malicos the new leader of the Nightbrothers.
Many Nightbrothers would challenge him for dominance of the clan, but all would fall to his strength in the Force.
For his strength was the only thing they would fear and respect.

# Section 3

Now five years after the fall of the Order, the former Jedi Malicos used his experience as a tactician to not only lead the Nightbrothers, but to manipulate the last remaining Nightsister.
He knew that Dathomirian Nightsister Merrin was in pain over the loss of her sisters, and used that pain to persuade her into teaching him the magick art.
Malicos stated that it was the Jedi who conducted the Battle of Dathomir that wiped out the sister, even though it was known to be done by the Confederacy of Independent System to many except the naive Nightsister.
He promised her revenge for the Jedi’s genocide of her Sisters if she taught him magick.
Now that Malicos had both clans in his hand, he decided that expanding his group would be ideal.
Malicos saw the young Padawan Cal Kestis touchdown on Dathomir, feeling his presence in the Force, he decided to disguise himself as a traveler and met the Padawan on the bridge leading to a dark temple.
He told him he was just a wanderer that did not dare go into that temple, for it was filled with sinister energy that would corrupt all.
Kestis would ignore his warning and enter anyway.
Once Cal exited the temple, Malicos asked him how his experience was facing the dark energy.
However, Cal ignored the question and questioned Malicos’s identity, since he was still a stranger to Cal Kestis.
He then revealed himself as Taron Malicos, a Jedi General who had to fight on the cursed planet of Dathomir by tapping into the dark side.
He told Kestis that he too can become powerful as well with the dark side's power if he joins him, if he joins his family as he was alone in dark times.
Malicos’s persuasion was then interrupted by Nightsister Merrin, who had now seen through Malicos and his lies and deceitful nature.
Malicos rebuttals, stating that Merrin let her power control her and she was possessed by it.
Kestis took this diversion to escape from the conflict.

# Section 4

Once Kestis returned to the Dathomir, he came back into contact with Merrin and told her the truth about not just Malicos but who really caused the death of her Nightsisters.
Merrin told the Padawan that Malicos promised revenge if she taught him the magick arts, but now seeing that it was all a lie and meaningless.
They then decided to make a pact to defeat the fallen Jedi once and for all.
Cal Kestis met Malicos in the sinister temple, the dark side trying one last attempt to persuade the stubborn Jedi who did not yield to his manipulation.
The duel starts, Malicos igniting both of his sabers and charging at the Padawan with intent to kill.
The duel would be drawn out and vicious, as the fallen Jedi strength in the Force gave him an advantage.
Malicos sent barrages of rock and boulders at the Padawan during the duel.
When it seemed that a boulder from the wall formation of the temple would finish Kestis, Merrin used her magick to protect the Padawan and assault Malicos.
Malicos deflected the attacks but he was distracted long enough.
Merrin told Kestis to get up and face him again while she disappeared from the fight.
Now with his second wind and Merrin supporting with an energy blast from a safe distance, Kestis attacked Malicos with all he had.
Until Merrin found an opening to Malicos defense and grabbed him, she then did the brutal act of literally burying the Jedi alive under the tomb grounds.
This would leave the Nightsister and Jedi duo victorious, and a horrendous end for the fallen Jedi, Taron Malicos.
