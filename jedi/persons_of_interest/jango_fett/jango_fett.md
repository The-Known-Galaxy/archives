# Introduction
Jango Fett was a Mandalorian bounty hunter, assassin, and father to Boba Fett.
He led the Mandalorians during the Mandalorian Civil War and later became a respected bounty hunter.
He served as the genetic template for the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, where he was killed by Mace Windu.
Jango’s legacy would live on through Boba Fett and the clone army.

# Section 1
Fett was a skilled, thorough, and ruthless bounty hunter, motivated by money and loyalty to the highest bidder.
He kept himself in excellent condition through regular training and possessed vigilant tactical skills.
Fett preferred a subtle approach to his hunting and was known for his cool demeanor and evasive skills.
He followed his moral code, which he deemed honorable, and passed the values on to his son, Boba Fett.
Fett preferred working alone but he sometimes partnered with others, such as Zam Wesell and Rozatta, when necessary.
He was a longer and chose to live alone, never marrying or forming long-term relationships.
When the chance arose to raise an unaltered clone of himself, Boba Fett, he passed on his skills and values.
While Fett cared deeply for Boba, he had no personal feelings toward the other clones, considering the cloning contract as merely business.
Despite working with the Jedi to create the clone army, Fett remained neutral and loyal to his profession as a bounty hunter.



# Section 2
Fett wore Mandalorian armor in the “shock trooper” style, made of less expensive durasteel alloy instead of the traditional beskar plating.
He was armed with custom WESTAR-34 blaster pistols, a BlasTech Dur-24 wrist laser, a Czerka ZX miniature flamethrower, and an integrated Velcity-7 dart shooter with Kamino saberdarts on his right arm.
His left gauntlet contained a Kelvarek Consolidated Arms MM9 mini concussion rocket, and he carried different types of rockets and capsules.
Fett’s gloves had multiple functions, including a field security overloader, wrist-mounted retractable blades, a wrist-mounted grappling hook, boot spikes, and electromagnetic devices to attract his guns.
He had two jetpacks, a compact Merr-Sonn JT-12 jetpack with a warhead missile launcher and a Mitrinomom Z-6 jetpack with a missile/grapple launcher.
Both were favored by Fett and equipped with targeting computers and flight gyros.
His Mandalorian helmet featured a targeting range-finder, a 360-degree field of view, infrared scanners, and sound and motion detectors.
Fett inherited his mentor’s ship, Jaster’s Legacy, which he later replaced with a prototype Firespray-class starship he stole from Oovo IV’s asteroid prison.
Renaming it “Slave I,” he used it for his bounty hunting contracts until his death.
Afterward, the ship passed into the hands of his son, Boba Fett.



# Section 3
Jango Fett was born on Concord Dawn and grew up with his family until the Mandalorian Civil War broke out.
The Death Watch attacked his home, killing his parents and capturing his sister Arla.
Mandalorian leader Jaster Mereel rescued the young boy.
 This led Fett to join their ranks and thus became a skilled warrior.
After Mereel’s death, Fett took over as the new Mand’alor, leading the Mandalorians.



# Section 4
After Jango Fett became the new Mand’alor, he led the Mandalorians and was involved in a battle on Galidraan.
The True Mandalorians were defeated after being manipulated by Death Watch and betrayed by the Jedi.
Fett was captured, sold into servitude, and eventually freed.
Seeking revenge, he retrieved his armor and took vengeance on the Governor of Galidraan and Tor Visla, leader of Death Watch.
Fett then became a bounty hunter and mercenary, leading a solitary life until he met and briefly partnered with Sheeka Tull.
With the Mandalorian Civil War over, Fett distanced himself from his people and continued his career as a bounty hunter, living at the Utland Transit Station.



# Section 5
In the year 32 BBY, Fett was hired to track down the criminal Meeko Ghintee on Outland Station.
He captured Meeko but received a message from a man named Tyranus who offered him a bounty to hunt down the former Jedi, Komari Vosa, leader of the Bando Gora cult.
Together with another bounty hunter, Zam Wesell, Fett went on a mission to find Vosa, which led them to confront crime lord Sebolto on Malastare and then Gardulla the Hutt on Tatooine.
Eventually, Fett defeated Vosa, and Tyranus revealed himself to be Count Dooku, who offered Fett a deal to become the genetic template for an army of clones.
Fett agreed to this proposal and asked for an unaltered clone of himself to raise as his own, that clone became Boba Fett.



# Section 6
Fett played a large role in the development of the Grand Army of the Republic.
He donated his genetics to create the clone troopers and helped to design their armor, which was inspired by his own Mandalorian shock trooper armor.
Fett also assisted to create the flash training program for the clones, using the Mandalorian song “Vode An” to imbue a sense of purpose in them.
He recruited and trained the Cuy’val Dar, a group of Mandalorians and skilled individuals who trained the clone commandos.
Fett oversaw the training of the elite Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commandos.
He also saved a group of “defective” clones, known as the Null class, and proposed they be used as intelligence units.
Fett was also responsible for stopping brutal Battle Circles and helped a clone deserter escape from Kamino.



# Section 7
Before the Clone Wars, Fett was hired by Ashaar Khorda to retrieve the powerful statue called the Infant of Shaa, which Khorda planned to use as a means to destroy Coruscant.
However, Fett was persuaded by Zam Wesell to prevent this disaster.
They saved Coruscant by preventing the statue’s power from being released, and returned it to its origin on Seylott for safekeeping.
In another event, Jango took his son Boba for “flying practice” on an unidentified planet, teaching him to overcome his fears.
He also faced a clone trooper deserter on Atzerri, whom he killed, but when he learned the trooper had a family, he set up an inheritance fund for the deserter’s son.
Fett was also tasked by Tyranus to capture Groodo the Hutt, Senator Rodd of Fondor, and droid engineer Hurlo Holowan.
He also encountered Aurra Sing while hunting Rigorra the Hutt.
Fett successfully completed these assignments and delivered the targets to Count Dooku on Geonosis.
Fett was also hired by the Trade Federation to hunt down the Toydarian named Reti, who had been preying on their assets.
He pursued Reti, but the outcome is unknown, however, Fett survived.



# Section 8
Ten years after the formation of the Grand Army of the Republic, Fett was hired by Viceroy Nute Gunray to assassinate Senator Padmé Amidala on Coruscant.
Fett teamed up with Zam Wesell for the job, but their plot failed, which resulted in Fett having to kill Wesell to protect his own identity.
Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi tracked Fett to Kamino, learned of the clone armies, and confronted Fett.
They clashed in a battle, and Fett escaped with his son Boba on the Slave I.
Kenobi followed them to Geonosis using a homing beacon, and a dogfight ensued.
Fett landed on Geonosis and joined Count Dooku and the Separatists.
Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala attempted to rescue Kenobi; they were captured by Fett who later watched the execution of the Jedi in the Petranaki arena.
During the chaos of the battle between the droid army and the Jedi, Fett confronted Windu but was ultimately killed by the Jedi Master.



# Section 9
After Jango Fett’s death, his clone believed he was unaware of Count Dooku’s treachery and killed twelve Jedi Masters before being killed himself.
Despite learning the truth, the clone continued to serve faithfully under their Jedi Generals.
Fett never lived to see his clones participate in the Clone Wars or witness his son, Boba Fett, continue his legacy as a bounty hunter.
Jango was buried on Geonosis, and his remains were later moved to Mandalore to be buried next to his daughter.
In honor of Jango, the Jango Fett Arena was built in Mos Eisley on Tatooine, and he was respected by some Mandalorian factions.
But he was not held in high regard by the New Mandalorian faction on Mandalore until his legacy was later refreshed.
After his death, Jango Fett’s legacy lived on through his son, Boba Fett, and the millions of clone troopers based on his template.
The clones continued to serve in the Galactic Empire’s military until they became a minority among the increasingly varying army.
