# Introduction
Jewl’a Nightbringer was a female Zabrak and bounty hunter born during the Great Galactic War with her prime during the succeeding Cold War.
Nightbringer was the most feared bounty hunter in her time, known to be ruthless with a high belief in dealing out retribution to those who got in her way.
Jew’la Nightbringer was born in the underworld of Coruscant and lived a life of poverty and violence with constant riots and looting due to the Mandalorian blockade of the Hydian Way.
To survive she was required to depend on her ruthless and natural born fighting nature.
She spent years developing and tuning her skills as a ruthless hunter on Coruscant, and when she had saved enough credits to get off world, stretched her hunts off of the Republic capital world causing her reputation to spread.
In her time collecting bounties, Nightbringer was cited thirty two times by authorities for excessive force, was wanted by authorities in several systems, and ultimately lost her hunting license in Republic space.

Nightbrindger was sponsored to take part in the Great Hunt crica 3653-3643 BBY by a crime lord that at one time had been a target of Nightbringer.
Nightbringers victory in the great hunt was most notable for showing no mercy, bringing no captures in alive.
Nightbringer gained the respect of the Mandalorians who she so deeply despised for causing her pain and suffering as a child on Coruscant.
Her fame and reputation flooded across the galaxy while fear struck the many who could have fallen victim to her hunts.
Proceeding the Great Hunt, circa 3641-43 BBY, Jew’la Nightbringer and other Great Hunt champions were killed by a Republic kill team organized by Jedi Master Jun Seros.
