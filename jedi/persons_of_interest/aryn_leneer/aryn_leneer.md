# Introduction

Aryn Leneer was a force sensitive human female born before 3653 BBY and orphaned on Balmorra.
She was discovered by Jedi Master Ven Zallow at an early age, who would take her into the Temple on Coruscant for both an induction into the Jedi Order and training in the ways of the Force.
Leneer learned quickly that her life was to be dedicated only to the Jedi Order and the teachings.
As Master Zallow taught Leneer, she developed a strong and emotional bond to him, seeing him as a master and a father.
She would build more than one lightsaber, the first one holding a blue kyber crystal and the other two holding a yellow and green kyber crystal respectively.

# Section 1

By the start of the Great Galactic War she was now a Jedi Knight and a member of Havoc Squad with Zeerid Korr.
Together they fought against the Sith Empire for the Republic and she was well respected by the squad for her formidable and well honed combat skills.
On top of this, during the war Leneer spent time developing her empathic abilities, using it to boost the morale of her comrades.
She was a very good friend for the squad, being a shoulder to cry on when needed, bonding with Korr after helping them cope with the loss of their wife and the crippling of their daughter.

# Section 2

When Alderaan was invaded by an Imperial fleet, Leneer was there fighting alongside the planet’s armed forces as well as Satele Shan, holding off the attack and in the end helped turn the tide to repel the invasion.
During the signing of the treaty Leneer was a part of the delegation, being stationed at the High Council Building.
When the temple on Coruscant was attacked by the Empire, she felt the death of her former master and realised what had happened.
She did not take the death of her master very well, and felt that the war should continue and the sith did not want peace.

# Section 3

With some help from Zeerid Korr she would make her way to the blockaded Coruscant and find her T7-01 droid.
There was also a recording of her master’s death and managed to piece the clues together and work out the attack was led by Darth Malgus.
Leneer would find Lagus in the temple and have a fight with him, ending in a stalemate due to Korr.
Unhappy with the result she captured his lover and nearly killed her until she realised the Twi’lek was innocent.

# Section 4

As such she was spared and Leneer fought Malgus one last time.
The battle was long and hard, ending with Malgus being victorious.
Malgus would have likely killed Leneer if he hadn;t noticed that his lover was spared, the two promising to kill the other should they meet on the battlefield.
However, these actions would result in the Jedi Order disowning her for disobeying the High Council.
Leneer would reunite with Korr, finding his farm on Dantooine and staying with him and his daughter.
She would find Malgus once again after him coming to Dantooine.
Leener did find and follow him though realised if she tried to fight him, she would be unable to do it alone.

# Section 5

Following this she would speak to Salete Shan and other masters about the matter, with some masters not believing her words before speaking to the Alliance Commander.
This gained the help from the Commander with Leener piloting the shuttle to Dantooine and safely guided them to the enclave she had found Malgus in.
After many fighting through the enclave, they would reach the ground level where together they confronted Sith Lord Ziliss, killing her two henchmen.
