# Introduction
In the latter days of the Galactic Republic, Saesee Tiin was a male Iktotchi Jedi Master and a member of the Jedi High Council.
Tiin rarely spoke and kept to himself as a student to the revered Jedi Master Omo Bouri.
Despite never desiring to be a Padawan, Tiin rose through the ranks of the Grand Army of the Republic to become a Jedi General during the Clone Wars.

# Section 1
Saesee Tiin was born on the moon of Iktotch and was taught to fly when he was very young.
He seemed to be a natural pilot.
The little kid was turned up to the Jedi Order for instruction at the academy on Coruscant after scouts from the Order recognized him as a Force-sensitive.
Tiin, who was raised in the Jedi Temple, found it humiliating when his innate telepathic powers were mocked by his peers.
While some thought his skills offered him an unfair edge at the academy, Tiin saw them as a disadvantage because he had yet to learn to control them.
Tiin would concede, however, that his powers offered him an advantage during lightsaber combat training because his opponents' thoughts unknowingly disclosed their strategy.
Tiin was despised by his peers because of his unusual powers, and he became exceedingly reclusive.
Tiin attracted the attention of Master Omo Bouri, the Wol Cabasshite Jedi Councilor, as he learnt to zero in on certain thoughts.
Tiin accepted Bouri's offer of apprenticeship after graduating from the academy and became a Padawan.
Master Bouri was a one-of-a-kind communicator, as he used phonemic energy pulses with syntactic contours in a magnetic field he controlled with his mouth.
Because Bouri's brain had gone so far, Tiin was confronted with something entirely new: a brain he couldn't comprehend.
Intrigued, he spent all of his time trying to figure out who his master was and how he could use the Force to boost his telepathy to new heights.
Tiin learnt the notion of entire dedication to the Order from Bouri, who taught him how to control his own mind and filter through thoughts from all over the galaxy.
Tiin became a full Jedi Knight after years of traveling with his teacher and passing the Trials of Knighthood.
Tiin declined to speak at Master Bouri's funeral when he was lost on an ill-fated assignment, and he went into seclusion for a long time.
Tiin chose the path of the Jedi Guardians, developing his talents as a Jedi Starfighter Corps ace pilot



# Section 2
Despite Jedi Mace Windu's encouragement, Saesee Tiin declined to accept a Padawan of his own, despite the value of his own teacher in his life.
Instead, Tiin turned within, looking for methods to use the Force to communicate with his deceased Master.
It's unclear whether Tiin actually did so, but he put a lot of effort into it during his time as a Knight.
Saesee Tiin was eventually appointed to Master by the High Council after a remarkable career.
The Council invited Tiin to join the Council as a long-term member after much discussion.



# Section 3
Tiin remained a Jedi Master and an accomplished pilot for the Jedi Order.
Many Jedi owe their lives to his ability to fly.
Tiin took on the title of Jedi General within the ranks of the Grand Army of the Republic once the Clone Wars began.
Tiin, who was heavily involved with the Order's starfighter fleet, praised Jedi Skywalker's work, saying that the fleet's continual updates were a vast advance over the initial models.
Tiin was one of the first to get an Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor, encouraging the High Council to adopt the boy's changes across the entire Starfighter Corps.
Tiin was pushed into a low-altitude ejection during an early fight while piloting his personal spaceship, the Sharp Spiral, and incurred multiple non-life threatening injuries, including the fracturing of one of his cranial horns.
When the war reached Tiin's homeworld, Iktotch, Tiin rapidly recovered from his wounds and led Master Windu into battle.
Tiin chose a brutal approach to beating the prototype B3 extreme battle droid over Windu's methodical attacks in routing the Separatist Droid Army that had taken root there.
Despite their opposing tactics, the two Masters were able to work together and defeat the planet's CIS troops.
At the conflict, Tiin took part in a number of notable missions, including directing a bombing run during the Battle of Gwori, an assignment over Diado, and the fights of Lola Sayu, Umbara, and Boz Pity.



# Section 4
Throughout the Clone Wars, Tiin's friendship with Master Windu grew stronger.
Tiin and Windu were joined by Masters Kit Fisto and Agen Kolar on an undercover mission to infiltrate the Crimson Nova's base known as the Rig.
The Council dispatched the squad to investigate the gang's participation in a recent spate of Jedi assassinations and the issue of bounties on other Jedi.
Tiin boarded the Rig as a smuggler and joined Windu in the cantina as his colleagues wreaked havoc on the jail level.
The dockhands transferred his cargo into the Rig's storage facilities without informing him, as he had expected; Tiin had foreseen this and had loaded the crates with detonite, causing it to detonate and cause even more confusion aboard the space station when the hangars were demolished.
The four masters encountered the Crimson Nova's leader, Mika, in the station's command deck, where he was joined by his compatriots.
The Masters enlisted the help of the bounty hunters who were guarding the Cathar woman since she refused to submit.
Tiin and Kolar took the control room and uncovered the bounty hunter giving the Jedi rewards while Windu and Fisto headed after Mika.
The Jedi followed their lead on Kh'aris Fenn to Ryloth, where they discovered the Twi'lek had been killed by Quinlan Vos.
Tiin was disgusted by the incident, and he regretted his support for Vos, as it was clear that Vos had sunk into darkness.



# Section 5
Master Tiin was a Jedi first and a General second while serving the Republic heroically.
Being a member of the Jedi Order's High Council entailed a slew of duties, including listening to intelligence briefings and dictating Republic force movements.
Master Tiin was tasked early in the conflict with preventing the transfer of the Rendili Dreadnaught fleet to the Confederacy.
Tiin controlled the Republic fleet alongside Master Koon and Jedi Skywalker, as Koon spoke with fleet commander Jace Dallin aboard the Mersel Kebir.
Master Tiin's orders were plain when Lieutenant Mellor Yago of Rendili's Independent Provisional Government detained Koon and Dallin as traitors: destroy the Rendili fleet if it refused to join the Republic's Army.
The appearance of Master Kenobi and the rogue Jedi Quinlan Vos disrupted the strategy debate, while Skywalker proposed an option.
Tiin summoned his lightsaber and commanded that Vos be imprisoned before boarding his starfighter.
With the Separatist armada joining the battle, Tiin attacked the enemy fleet while his fellow Jedi launched an unconventional rescue effort that saw the Rendili fleet saved and Master Koon rescued.
Tiin returned to his flagship after the Separatists were defeated to deal with Vos.
Tiin sat on the Council of Reconciliation as they tried Master Vos for his crimes after deciding to take him to Coruscant.
While Tiin postponed his judgment to Master Oppo Rancisis, the Council voted in Vos' favor, allowing him to stay in the Order.



# Section 6
As the war progressed, more and more Jedi perished in the battle.
Tiin attended the funerals of Masters Halsey, the six Jedi slain in the bombing of the Jedi Temple, and the mock funeral for Master Kenobi before he went on an undercover mission as a member of the High Council.
During Ahsoka Tano's trial, Tiin pointed out that Tano had been found in possession of nano-droids that had been utilized in the attack, claiming that there was too much evidence against her in the bombing of the Temple.



# Section 7
Tiin was stationed on Coruscant during the closing days of the war, when Chancellor Palpatine announced the relocation of the Coruscant Defense Fleet to the Outer Rim Territories.
Tiin sat in calm observation of the events as his other Masters discussed the repercussions of the move with Senator Bail Organa.
Days later, blasterfire exploded in the sky of Coruscant as the Separatists launched a surprise attack on the capital.
Tiin piloted a squadron of ARC-170 starfighters into the orbital battle between the Republic's Open Circle Fleet and the Confederacy's navy, which was led by the feared droid General Grievous.
He landed in the dying Star Destroyer and led its stranded Jet troopers to capture an enemy cruiser, the Prosperous, when a Providence-class carrier/destroyer crashed with the Impavid during a hyperspace departure.
Tiin leapt out of the lower rear hanger with his clone troops, wearing a customized space suit, and landed on the assaulting Confederate cruiser.
Tiin punched a hole in the ship's landing bay floor, allowing him and his forces to penetrate the ship's interior, eliminate the ship's minor personnel, and take control.



# Section 8
Tiin returned to the Temple after the battle to help coordinate the rest of the war.
However, it wasn't long before Master Kenobi reported Grievous' death on Utapau; this, together with Dooku's recent death, convinced the Council that Palpatine's reign had come to an end.
Tiin traveled to the Chancellor's office with Masters Windu, Fisto, and Kolar in a bid to persuade Palpatine to renounce his emergency powers quietly.
Jedi Skywalker contacted the Masters before they left the Temple and informed them that Palpatine was the mysterious Darth Sidious.
The Masters went to the office to arrest Palpatine, knowing what they had to do.
Fisto spoke briefly with Tiin before the Masters proceeded to the Chancellor's office, noting that he would feel much more at ease if Masters Kenobi, Plo Koon, and Yoda had been present.
Tiin chastised Fisto for this, claiming that they were capable of subduing Palpatine and that they were sufficient for the job.



# Section 10
Windu informed Palpatine that he was being held under arrest when the Masters entered the office.
The Sith Lord charged the Jedi of treason and ignited his own lightsaber moments after the Masters lit theirs.
Palpatine stabbed Kolar before he could defend himself as he sprang at the four Jedi.
Tiin spotted his opportunity when Kolar fell and attempted to strike Palpatine from behind, but was sliced in the waist when Palpatine turned to face him.
Jedi Master Saesee Tiin's life came to an end at this point.
