# Introduction
Cin Drallig, a Force-sensitive male human Jedi Master, was a legend of the Jedi Order, serving as Battlemaster and head of security within the Coruscant Jedi Temple during the dwindling days of the Galactic Republic.
The force-sensitive male had dark blond hair and blue eyes and a light skin tone.
He was born on the planet of Lavisar, known for its rocky terrain which was ideal for mining.
Cin Drallig was trained by Jedi Master Yoda which later on awarded Cin Drallig the title of best Jedi Swordmaster of his time.
Cin Drallig would eventually die and become one with the Force at the hands of Darth Vader in 19 BBY during Operation: Knightfall when Order 66, an order branding member of the Jedi Order as rebels of the republic who were to be killed on site, was given.

Section 2: Personality and Traits

Cin Drallig displayed a tremendous calmness of mind and spirit.
He was characterized as patient, focused, directed, and delineated the members of the Jedi Order in their most refined form.
He was a man who had given himself completely to the ways of the Force.
In spite of his reputation as a great warrior, he also had a great heart.
His humbleness of character led him to dedicate his life to training countless students in the art of the lightsaber.
He led by example and instilled a sense of the Order’s truths and values.
Where numerous masters failed, Drallig was insightful enough to see the potential of his revolting Padawan Serra Keto and led her to make her potential her reality.

On his Great Holocron recording, Cin Drallig revealed some of his personal views on the subject of lightsaber combat.
Even though Darth Maul and Aurra Sing used Form II, Drallig refused to dismiss the form from his teachings, even though other instructors regarded it as impractical.
He was very cautious with Form V, remaining neutral, and made sure whenever it was taught, the learner would know to only use it when truly trying to preserve peace within the Order.
He admitted Form VI being the primary form of the Jedi Order didn’t make it worthy to be the most taught; however, did call it most pragmatic.
Master Cin Drallig discouraged the teaching of cho mok, cutting off the opponent’s limb unless the student knew enough of the person’s physiology, so they didn’t mistakenly slaughter.
Nevertheless, Cin Drallig didn’t leave out that a Jedi should not hesitate in using any form to kill a Sith Lord, and wouldn’t even be frowned upon from using sai tok, a technique to cut the opponent in half.
He went further on to say, a Jedi’s intention shouldn’t be to bring desolation to the Sith, but to conquer the danger the Sith would produce.

Section 3: Powers and Abilities

Cin Drallig’s lightsaber abilities were taught by none other than Master Yoda himself.
Known for his outstanding talents at dueling, Drallig became a phenomenal swordsman, and gained the rank Battlemaster of the Order, due to his unprecedented finesse in lightsaber combat.

During the Clone Wars, Master Cin Drallig was late in age; however, this did not stop him from being one of the top Jedi swordsmen, others describing his skill level as “unparalleled.” Cin Drallig’s skill was so great that even General Grievous’s programmed lightsabers would be no match for the Battlemaster.
 Drallig had created his own unique style of lightsaber combat.
His style consisted of summoning the Force to amplify his speed and relying on irregular and unforeseeable maneuvers.

 Cin Drallig mastered all seven lightsaber forms of combat and his great knowledge of each form was so unprecedented he was considered the most copious lightsaber instructor in the Jedi Temple, second to only Master Yoda himself.
He trained thousands of successful students in each of the forms while displaying an exemplary understanding of each concept and was able to make thorough observations on each form’s strengths and weaknesses.
 Cin Drallig was one of few to master the form Juyo; however, he rarely put it into practice due to its aggressiveness and its user’s potential exposure to the Dark Side.
When Anakin Skywalker was a Padawan,  Cin Drallig never let him study Form VII even though Anakin lamented not studying it.

As the Jedi Temple’s strongest swordsman during Order 66, Cin Drallig was still able to kill an abundance of Clones that attacked him and the Sith Lord Darth Vader made it a mission himself to personally battle him.
Cin Drallig fought exceptionally well, almost defeating the Sith Lord.
Darth Vader the juvenile and fully primed Sith Lord had immense difficulty killing him than he did with the other Jedi during his clearance of the Jedi Temple.
When Darth Vader killed Cin Drallig he had snuffed the Jedi Temple’s final hope.

On top of his mastery of swordsmanship, Cin Drallig was also very powerful and successful in his use of the Force.
During his fight with Sith Lord Darth Vader, he displayed mastery with his use of the Force.
He was very skilled in using Force speed, making him very capable of moving quickly enough to barely be visible to the human eye, overwhelming his opponents.
He also was proficient in using the protection bubble, using it against Darth Vader to protect his Padawan while the Padawan would fight, and at times protect his pupil.
With the protection bubble, he even was able to use it as an offensive tactic, encasing Vader within the protection bubble and inflicting damage to him with Force energy.
The protection bubble was so powerful, Darth Vader wasn’t able to puncture the shield and had to wait until the bubble disappeared to continue fighting.
He was also able to heal himself with the Force.
He used this to restore his Padawan’s stamina while he encased them in the protection bubble and to himself while dueling Darth Vader.
Cin Drallig also exhibited telekinetic proficiency, where he repelled a Force Push from his opponent, Sith Lord Darth Vader, and threw him through a window with a single Force Push.
He also would hover and fling chunks of the ground onto Darth Vader.

Cin Drallig was also a very competent leader who was able to lead the security force of the Jedi Temple throughout the Clone Wars.
Cin Drallig’s leadership abilities were displayed by how he led the surviving Jedi when Operation: Knightfall started to battle the Clones, even though he was eventually subdued.

Section 4: Origins and Advancements

In Cin Drallig’s early years, he was trained as a Padawan by Jedi High Council member Grand Master Yoda.
Cin Drallig was eventually named the Jedi Order’s greatest swordsman.
During the Clone Wars, Cin Drallig ascended to the rank of Jedi Master and commanded the Jedi Temple Guard.
During his time as a master, Cin Drallig taught younglings lightsaber combat in order to pass his skills onto the new generations of Jedi, such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker.
In the year 31 BBY, a clip of one of Master Drallig’s classes on the seven lightsaber combat forms was recorded on the Great Holocron.

Later on, Cin Drallig was introduced to his controversial and demanding Padawan Serra Keto.
Serra had almost gotten expelled from the Order more than once, due to her non-compliant ways, and all of her Jedi Masters were infuriated.
Cin Drallig took Serra to help her find her balance; he furthered her understanding of the Force and lightsaber skills.
His tutelage inspired them to have a very powerful bond of loyalty for each other.
Even though her disobedience never truly disappeared, Cin Drallig helped her become a better person, causing her to become Cin Drallig’s most accomplished apprentice.

No sooner than 31 BBY, Cin Drallig was promoted from Jedi Master to Battlemaster, which made him the lead lightsaber combat instructor within the Jedi Temple.
Cin Drallig was tasked with overseeing all of the academy’s instruction and electing new instructors.
There was only one Battlemaster appointed at a time, with the exception of the Order’s satellite academies which received a corresponding head instructor, but head instructors were also appointed by the Battlemaster of the Jedi Order on the planet Coruscant.

Section 5: Clone Wars

During the Clone Wars, a galaxy-spanning event, Cin Drallig was in charge of guarding the Jedi Temple.
As head of security, Cin Drallig spent most of his days patrolling the Jedi Temple’s corridors and pathways.
This position also made him responsible for the Jedi Temple Guard and their administration.
As the Clone Wars progressed, Cin Drallig was deeply concerned with the progressive antagonism towards the Jedi from Republic citizens.

Deployed in Coruscant, Drallig made a home for himself inside the Jedi Temple.
Even though he laboriously watched the Jedi Temple, some security breakthroughs still occurred.
For instance, Bounty Hunter Cad Bane was able to stealthily steal a Jedi Holocron from a restricted vault and escape.

In 20 BBY, a couple of years after the war started, the Jedi Temple hangar was the location of an unexpected terrorist bombing, costing numerous lives.
A plethora of protestors, which were all family and friends of the victims, gathered at the stairs to the Temple to disapprove of the Jedi’s involvement in the war.
Circumscribed by two Jedi Temple Guards,  Cin Drallig stood before the crowd while Anakin Skywalker revealed a hologram of a suspect, Jackar Bowmani.
While Skywalker revealed the Holocron, Bowmani’s wife Letta Turmond witnessed the Holocron; meanwhile, Cin Drallig was astounded by young Skywalker’s determination in solving the case but was more alarmed about how vulnerable the Jedi Order had become, and how the image of the Jedi’s bounteous protection had become much too weak.
It was later discovered that Bowmani’s wife was responsible for the terrorist bombing, a woman who fed nano-droids to her husband in order to stage the bombing of the Temple hanger.

Even though Cin Drallig was head of security, he still found time to teach lightsaber combat.
The Clone Wars also placed an urgency on Youngling’s combat training, a higher priority than other skills.
In 19 BBY, after the death of Jedi Mierme Unill, his padawan Zett Jukassa was handed to Cin Drallig while he awaited reassignment.
Under Drallig’s tutelage, the young Padawan swiftly became a capable swordsman at the age of ten.

Section 6: Order 66

In 19 BBY, when Order 66 was initiated, and Anakin Skywalker had now turned into his alter ego Darth Vader, Cin Drallig’s abilities pinpointed him as an essential target for elimination by the Sith Lord himself.
Even though Jedi Masters Shaak Ti and Jurrok administered the Jedi Temple’s fortification that night, Cin Drallig still played a major role.
While Cin Drallig was in the process of giving lightsaber lessons to Padawans Bene and Whie Malreaux, Darth Vader began his barbarous rampage.
Cin Drallig was deep within the Jedi Temple, and prepared for Vader’s coming, and directed Jedi Olana Chion in the Temple’s defense.

Alongside Serra Keto, Cin Drallig engaged the clones and was initially triumphant as he managed to pierce the occupying forces’ upper-level defenses.
When Vader realized Cin Drallig was succeeding, Vader began to hunt for his former teacher.
Entering Drallig’s zone, he found deceased clones and signs of battle everywhere.
Before Cin Drallig could react, Serra Keto tried to take on Vader by herself but was slain.

As Drallig entered the room, he witnessed his former Padawan fall to Darth Vader.
Engaging the Sith Lord in the Temple training hall with his two students, Bene and Whie Malreaux, who were unfit to defeat the Sith Lord.
Vader was able to out-battle both Padawans, choking Bene with one hand and fighting Drallig with the other.

Cin Drallig, Jedi Battlemaster himself, was proved unfit to defeat fully primed Sith Lord Darth Vader.
Shortly after the death of the two Padawans, Cin Drallig went into a short one-on-one exchange with Vader until he was cut down from head to toe.
All Cin Drallig was able to do was look in shock as he fell to the ground and, not long after, expired.
The encounter was recorded by Jedi Temple security camera TR4-121.

Later on, Cin Drallig’s body was found by Grand Master Yoda and Master Obi-Wan Kenobi who returned to the Jedi Temple to resound the emergency beacon and warn all Jedi to flee into exile.
The uncovering of Cin Drallig’s body caused Kenobi great heartache, considering the Battlemaster a great friend.
Shortly after, the surviving Jedi watched the security camera recording of the legendary Battlemaster’s final duel.

With most of the Order almost being destroyed in one night, the newly-founded Galactic Empire needed to conceal the truths for the execution of the Republic’s peacekeepers.
Under the ruling of Emperor Palpatine, Sate Pestage, right-hand man to Palpatine, assembled official reasons for each Jedi’s death.
Within incident report #890-I, filed by Commander CC-1119, was Master Cin Drallig’s death certificate, while Pestage claimed to the public that the Battlemaster had been “killed in combat against Imperial agents.”

Section 7: Legacy

Cin Drallig’s legacy was handed down by Jedi who survived to train others, which included Master Kenobi’s training of Luke Skywalker.

While learning how to cope with his life-sustaining armor, Vader would often reflect on the moments that brought him to become a Sith.
One of the clearest memories were Master Cin Drallig, his prior lightsaber instructor, and his final encounter with the Battlemaster, the night of Order 66.

Master Cin Drallig’s recorded training of the seven forms, recorded in 31 BBY, was uncovered in the Great Holocron by the New Jedi Order, along with other recordings of the Battlemaster.
