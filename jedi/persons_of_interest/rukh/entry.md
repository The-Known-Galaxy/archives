# Introduction

Rukh was a male Noghri warrior who served as the personal bodyguard and later the assassin of Grand Admiral Thrawn.
He was raised while his planet was in chaos and destruction because of a planetary invasion.
Rukh was fiercely loyal to the Thawns empire, which claimed to be restoring his planet back to normal.
After serving as one of the Dark Lord's Noghri Death Guards he was handpicked by Thrawn in 9 ABY to serve as his own personal loyal bodyguard.
Thrawn travelled the galaxy with Rukh by his side protecting him at all times.
They travelled around in the Imperial II-Class Star Destroyer Chimaera.

# Section 1

Rukh soon learned that Thrawn wasnt restoring his planet at all.
It was just a trick to keep Rukh with the galactic empire.
In reality Thrawn was keeping his planet in poor health so they would keep on obeying the Galactic Empires orders.
As soon as he found out, he killed Thrawn with no regret in his mind, for how he treated his people and planet.
The Empire heard that Thrawn was dead and killed the Noghri warrior who was just trying to help his planet.
