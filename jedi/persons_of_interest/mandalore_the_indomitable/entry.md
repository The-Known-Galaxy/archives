# Introduction

Mandalore the Indomitable was a well-respected Mandalorian Warlord amongst the clans before and during the Great Sith War, notable for being a Tuang male.
In 3996 BBY, Mandalore the Indomitable planned an invasion of Tetan space with his Mandalorian Crusaders.
He believed that the seven worlds of the Empress Teta system had been weakened by campaigns going against its occupation of a dark side society, the Krath.
The invasion led to Mandalore the Indomitable confronting the leader of the Krath military, Sith Lord Ulic Qel-Droma.
Qel-Droma convinced Mandalore to pledge his troops and swear a personal oath to serve under the name of the Sith.

Eventually, Mandalore helped plan an invasion of Coruscant to assist Qel-Droma and a Sorceress known as Keto in finally crushing the Jedi Order.
During the invasion, the Sith Lord was captured by the Jedi Order which led to Mandalore learning about Keto’s betrayal against Qel-Droma.
Sworn to his oath, Mandalore searched for Qel-Droma’s partner and master.

# Section 2

After successfully freeing Qel-Droma, Mandalore the Indomitable was given a separate assignment; He was ordered to lead the bulk of Qel-Droma’s forces into a devastating assault against the Republic world of Onderon.
Initially, Mandalore advanced into his assault but experienced heavy resistance and was forced into retreating to a nearby jungle moon, Dxun.
Although his troops successfully retreated, Mandalore was separated.
Surrounded by native predators to the Onderon; Mandalore was killed.
However, his mask was later to be found and used by a Tuang soldier who claimed the title of Mandalore - Continuing the Mandalorian legacy.
