# Introduction
Mon Mothma was a native of Chandrila.
She served in many prominent positions such as being a political figure during the descent of the Galactic Republic, being one of the founders of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and has been the first Chief of State for the New Republic.
She met with Senators Padme Amidala and Bail Organa when the Galactic Empire decided to replace the Republic.
She signed the Correllian Treaty in 2 BBY alongside her fellow Jedi Masters.
They did this to bring restoration to the Republic.

# Section 1
She was born in 48 BBY into a wealthy family in Chandrila.
Her mother was the reigning governor of the planet and her father was an arbiter-general for the Republic.
When she turned nineteen, she was elected to represent the Bormea sector in the Galactic Senate, serving as the youngest senator; soon after, Leia Organa became the next youngest senator.
Mothma was a major proponent of the rights of local systems.
Right before the Clone Wars, she became a member of the Loyalist Committee alongside Organa, Amidala, and Senator Onaconda Farr.
She started a movement to cease the production of clone troopers.
In efforts to try and stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.
Farr was murdered after Amidala’s speech for the cause.
Mothma then resumed working with the Senate while her associates investigated the recent crime.
By the end of the Clone Wars, she served as a member of the Loyalist Committee and signed the Petition of 2000.
This petition made a request that Chancellor Palpatine should reduce his power.
The petition was presented to the Chancellor by The Delegation of 2000, but the Dark Lord made no promises.



# Section 2
In 19 BBY, she attended the funeral for Senator Amidala on Naboo.
She and the Queen of Naboo did not believe that Amidala was murdered during the Rebellion.
For several months after the formation of the Galactic Empire, she urged Senator Organa to speak out against Emperor Palpatine alongside her.
However, she renounced her claims after witnessing the Empire’s subjugation of Kashyyyk, in fear that her people might face the same fate.



# Section 3
Mothma’s views brought her under investigation by ISB, COMPNOR, and even the Emperor himself.
This prevented her from carrying out any more effective plans to undermine the Imperial rule.
She continued to use her senatorial privilege and political contacts to try and strike up a change.
She frequently met with the others on Coruscant and introduced ways to grant relief from Imperial policies.
Over time, she tutored Bail’s daughter, Leia Organa, in political and diplomatic affairs, thus preparing her to succeed her father as the representative of Alderaan within the Imperial Senate.



# Section 4
Palpatine finally lost patience with Mothma’s opposition.
She escaped arrest in 3 BBY with the help of Bail Organa, who had placed a guard with her while she went on to lead an underground Rebellion.
She became the face of the Rebellion and signed proclamations such as the Declaration of Rebellion and A Call to Reason.
A historic moment was over the horizon with the signing of the Corellian Treaty, which formalized relations between Corellia, Alderaan, and Chandrila resistance forces.
Moments later, Darth Vader arrived with his stormtroopers, arresting Mothma and everyone else with her.
Marek was Vader’s secret apprentice and led the Senators into Vader’s trap.
The Rebellion seemed to be doomed before it even began.
Vader attempted to kill Marek, but to his dismay, Marek escaped and later became a Jedi.
He traveled to the Death Star construction site where he defeated Vader and held off Palpatine so Mothma and the Rebels could escape.
The Rebel leaders met on Kashyyyk and later found the Marek family crest, which led Leia Organa to suggest honoring Marek by using it as a symbol for the Rebel Alliance.



# Section 5
In the early days of the Rebellion, Mothma took on leadership roles for multiple missions, including the acquisition of the X-wing starfighter for the Alliance and locating the plans for the first Death Star.
The Destruction of Alderaan brought with it the death of Bail Organa, which led to an imbalance within the Rebellion’s leadership.
Without Organa present to make a rebuttal, Garm Bel Iblis claimed that Mon Mothma was assuming dictatorial powers over the Alliance.
Using this to set herself up in the place of Palpatine.
Iblis left the Rebellion, which formed a rift between its members that had a hard time healing until 9 ABY and the Thrawn campaign.
Mothma was committed to democracy and made her position as Chief of State subject to a vote by the Alliance every two years.
During her time in the Rebellion, she was never challenged.



# Section 6
After the Battle of Yavin, she oversaw the award ceremony for pilot Keyan Farlander.
She presented him with the Star of Alderaan in recognition of his actions during the battle.
Two months later, Mothma reflected on things with Leia Organa.
Organa was tasked with a secret mission involving being a double agent and finding a new base for the Alliance.
Not long after, Han Solo was assigned to meet one of Mothma’s acquaintances but said acquaintance ratted out Solo to Imperial Security and was killed in the process.
Mothma met up with Organa to discuss the operation that she was given.
Organa asked her for clearance codes so she could leak information.
She also reported that there was an issue with Prithi, one of the pilots for Stealth Squadron.
Mothma was present on the bridge of the flagship when the flight launched, preventing a Mon Calamari commander from allowing an unauthorized departure.
"The Commander asked if her orders were to the Rebellion and replied with "Every breath I take is in rebellion to the Empire."



# Section 7
Mothma briefed forces over the happenings of the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY.
 She was uncomfortable with the plans and felt that the Alliance would be tarnished by killing others.
However, she kept her demeanor and led the Rebel forces to victory on Endor, thus destroying the second Death Star and ending Palpatine’s reign.
After the battle, the Alliance returned to a transitional government known as the Alliance of Free Planets.
Mothma built diplomatic and military coalitions to fight what remained of the Empire.



# Section 8
As the Alliance slowly transitioned into the New Republic, Mothma became the Chief of State within the New Republic.
She led the Republic for eleven years, holding together the many factions that sat underneath its leadership.
Mothma’s charisma and leadership proved essential as they wiped out foe after foe, time after time.
The next major issue was the Krytos virus, a biological weapon that was left behind by the Imperials that affected non-humans.
Researchers came to the conclusion that the bioweapon was only curable by large quantities of bacta.
The fallout from this virus tested the newly formed government.



# Section 9
During the hunt for Warlord Zsinj, an aide attacked Malan then quickly headed towards Mothma.
She quickly fled down the stairs and accidentally fell and hurt herself badly.
Before Tolokai could harm her, Malan surprised him and tumbled down the stairs taking them both down.
Mothma had always put the Republic before everything else.
She even advocated for Leia Organa to accept Prince Isolder’s hand in marriage to strengthen the Republic.
In 8 ABY, the wedding of Leia Organa and Han Solo took place.
Shortly after, a painting containing a key for the Rebellion’s spy network resurfaced on Tatooine.
She sent her most trusted to retrieve the painting.



# Section 10
She supported Luke Skywalker while he strived to revive the Jedi Order.
She arranged for him to be given the Rebel base on Yavin IV’s moon.
In 12 ABY, she contacted Kyle Katarn and Jan Ors to investigate the remnants of an Imperial base on Kejim.
They returned to her office and presented Mothma the Artusian crystal.
She then sent them to Artus Prime to do a bit more investigating.
Unlike her years in the Alliance, she did not stay hidden.
During a diplomatic visit to Coruscant, she ran into Ambassador Furgan from Carida.
When he threw what appeared to be a drink into her face as a send-off gesture, the drink turned out to be filled with nanomachines that slowly affected Mothma over time.
She soon decided to resign from her position as Chief of State as her condition got worse.
Then guiding the council to appoint Leia Organa to take her place.



# Section 11
Mothma was nearly killed, but at the last minute, she was saved by Cilghal, who used the Force to cleanse her body.
She was up and moving around within a few weeks, which Leia never thought she would see after she caught the virus.
Leia soon tried to convince Mothma to become Chief of State again, but Mothma refused to take the position.
Despite the help from the Jedi, her condition never fully recovered.
In 17 ABY, she became the acting Chief of State while Leia Organa went to find her brother.
In 18 ABY, Mothma asked Skywalker to help Lando Calrissian find a wife.
She later suggested that Luke and Lando travel to Bakura to find Gariel Captison.
In 19 ABY, she appeared at the signing of the Bastion Accords and was a guest of honor at Luke Skywalker’s wedding.
Her condition continued to worsen, and shortly before the Yuuzhan Vong War, she died in her sleep.
In honor of her bravery, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer was named after her.
