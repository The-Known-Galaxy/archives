# Introduction

Born Shae Vizla, a female human Mandalorian, she earned a reputation as a ruthless bounty hunter working for the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War, undertaking high-risk tasks and operations.
During her partnership with the Empire, she assassinated Republic Senator Keenig, fought alongside the Imperial forces on Alderaan, attacked a Republic political envoy, and infiltrated the Jedi Temple, where she disabled the defense grid, allowing the Sith armada to attack Coruscant.

# Section 1

As a young Mandalorian warrior, Vizla earned a living by taking high-profile jobs for sums of money, without caring about employer intentions.
At the start of the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, an alliance was formed between the Empire and the Mandalorian warrior clans, which was strong under the reign of Mand’alor the Vindicated.
After she assassinated Keenig, her skill was noticed by the Sith Lord Darth Malgus, and she began a partnership with the Sith Empire.
The Empire would utilize her skill and efficiency in major campaigns, including the attack on Alderaan.
Imperial forces led by Darth Malgus invaded the peaceful world but were met by Republic special forces and Jedi Knights.
Jedi Grand Master Satale Shan faced Malgus, consequently defeating him, and leaving him under a pile of rubble.
Malgus escaped, believed to have been saved by Vizla.

Twenty-eight years into the Great Galactic War, in 3653 BBY, the Sith Empire contacted the Galactic Republic asking for the negotiations of a peaceful resolution.
As both sides met on Alderaan to create a peace agreement, Shae Vizla was sent by the Empire to Coruscant, the galactic capital, where she would infiltrate the Jedi Temple and shut down the planet’s defense grid, once again working with Malgus.
She entered the Temple via a high window, whilst a captured Republic shuttle carrying Sith warriors crashed through the Temple entrance.
With the main forces distracted, Vizla moved through the Temple, eliminating Temple Security forces, and made her way to the defense mainframe.
After disabling it, the Sith fleet of Darth Angral began laying waste to Coruscant, and Vizla used her jetpack to join the Imperial forces in the lower levels.
At the end of the battle, the Sith were victorious over the Jedi.

The Sacking of Coruscant led to the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Coruscant by the Republic, beginning the decade-long Cold War.
As a mercenary, Vizla climbed to the top of her profession, eventually surpassing Mand’alor the Vindicated in her list of victories.
After her years of success, she started taking fewer contracts, focussing on her duties as leader of Clan Vizla.
By the time of the new Galactic War, her clan had withdrawn from galactic events and settled on the remote planet of Rishi.
They built a base on Tracyn Island, where the Mandalorians were free to train.
Although Vizla avoided the war and distanced herself from the other warriors, the locals of Rishi knew of their presence and nicknamed her “Torch.” They had helped the Nova Blades pirates in their relationship with the people of Raider’s Cove, and allied with the Revanites when they arrived in 3642 BBY, but withdrew from the partnership when they found out about the Revanites’ intentions of manipulating the ongoing war between the Empire and the Republic.

# Section 4

By the year of 3637 BBY, the Nova Blades and the Revanites had built a large and powerful fleet.
After learning about the involvement of “Torch” from the files of the Nova Blades captain, Dael Margok, an associate of Theron Shan and Lana Beniko, who were working against the Revanites, travelled to Tracyn Island to get more information but their shuttle was shot down on arrival.
After watching the intruder reach the island, Vizla sent Mandalorians and dangerous fauna to defeat them.
The intruder defeated Vizla’s forces and went on to duel her personally.
Vizla lost, and finding the intruder’s victory honourable, gave over information about the Revanites.
This information would save the Republic and Imperial fleets, who were fighting in a Revanite trap above Rishi.
This led to the formation of the Yavin Coalition between the Republic and the Empire against the Revanites, and Vizla would join the Coalition forces against Revan.

# Section 5

After the defeat of Revan, Darth Marr led the Coalition in pursuit of the revived soul of the former Sith Emperor Vitiate, resulting in the discovery of the Eternal Empire of Zakuul and its plans to seize control of the galaxy.
The Mandalorians fought back, but Mand’alor the Vindicated was killed in battle by Zakuul elite Skytroopers.
After the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire signed treaties with the Eternal Empire, the Eternal Fleet, and Star Fortresses were used to blockade Core Worlds.
Mandalorian clans were either trapped in their worlds or scattered across the galaxy.
Having reached the status of a legend, Vizla was chosen as the new leader, and named “Mand’alor the Avenger”.
She would lead the Mandalorians in a number of victories alongside the Eternal Alliance, including a siege of a weapons factory on Darvannis, providing them with more weapons to use against the Eternal Empire.
After the war had ended in 3627 BBY, piracy was at its peak, and the Mandalorians started to work on securing supply lines.
In 3626 BBY, the Mandalorian flagship Spirit of Vengeance II was attacked by the Hidden Chain, an organization of combined clans including Clan Varad, the Dar’manda, and the Ash’ad.
With Vizla’s trusted advisor Jekiah Ordo on board, along with the Mand’alor, the Commander of the Eternal Alliance, and Jekiah’s brother Rass Ordo, rushed to defend the ship from the attackers.
The Mand’alor went to challenge the enemy’s leader, Field Marshal Heta Kol but ended up defending against reinforcements whilst the Alliance Commander and Rass Ordo faced Kol.
Kol was forced to escape, but not without her forces’ capture of Clan Cadera’s banner, an important symbol of the Mandalorians.
Following the attack, the Mand’alor went to find Indigo, the leader of the Dar’manda, in the fueling station of the mined-out asteroid Mek-Sha, in pursuit of the Hidden Chain but Indigo denied having any knowledge of the matter.
