# Introduction

In 3643 BBY, Balic Cormac and his troops captured a member of House Thul named Markus Thul, who was planning to enter Castle Organa with a group of Imperial commandos.
Balic then took the prisoner to the prison camp on Alderaan to find out information about his hiding place.
Once there, Balic met the new Havoc Squad lieutenant, who was sent to search for Gearbox, one of the Havoc Squad traitors.
Balic provided him with everything he needed, including programming the security door so the lieutenant could enter to interrogate the prisoner.
Markus provided the lieutenant with the information and pleaded with him to save his family.
Balic, however, did not believe that Markus was telling the truth.
He was seen with Pallos Organa after the Havoc lieutenant stopped an Imperial missile fired from Gearbox to destroy Castle Organa.
