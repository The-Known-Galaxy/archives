# Introduction

CT-1409, also known as Echo, was a clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic as an Advanced Recon Commando trooper and member of the 501st Legion.
Born on Kamino, Echo began his journey as a cadet in training and was part of the esteemed Domino Squad.
He wore standard ARC trooper armor with unique blue markings.

During the Defense of Kamino, Echo showcased his exceptional skills by fulfilling a sniper position atop Tipoca City, the capital of Kamino.
Teaming up with fellow clone trooper Fives, he successfully repelled the invading droid forces.
Later, Echo and Fives encountered a group of cadets who had become separated from their unit.
Together, they navigated through the chaos and reached the armory, where they devised a cunning trap for the oncoming battle droids.
Their ingenuity and bravery proved pivotal in securing victory against the Separatist Droid Army, leading to Echo's official promotion to ARC Trooper.

During the critical operation to rescue Jedi Master Even Piell, Echo displayed unwavering dedication and selflessness.
The mission was a success, with Echo and his team successfully infiltrating the enemy stronghold.
However, as they prepared to depart from the planet, tragedy struck.
The shuttle they were relying on for extraction was destroyed in a devastating explosion.
Originally, Echo and his comrades were awaiting extraction by R2, but the astromech droid failed to arrive.
General Skywalker quickly devised a Plan B and led Echo and the others in a daring escape.
Unfortunately, they encountered a group of droids trying to stop them.
In a desperate attempt to protect the shuttle, Echo engaged a droid that had taken control of a laser turret with a riot shield and his pistol.
Echo valiantly tried to neutralize the threat.
However, despite his valiant efforts, the droid's shot found its mark, causing a catastrophic explosion that sent Echo hurtling away.
Fortunately, Echo survived the blast but was still captured by the Separatists.
