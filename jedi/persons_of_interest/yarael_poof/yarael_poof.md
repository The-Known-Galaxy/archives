# Introduction
Yarael Poof was a gifted Jedi Master who served on the Jedi High Council before the Clone Wars.
This Jedi was a member of the Quermian species from the planet Quermia.
The Quermian species possessed vastly unique physical features.
They had two brains, long arms and very long necks.
They were often known to be a peaceful yet intellectual species.
Yarael Poof was a powerful Jedi Master who excelled in the teaching aspects of the order and had a massive influence on the future generation of Jedi Knights to follow him.
He also excelled at and had a natural gift in Jedi mind control, which he developed and perfected during his time while being a Jedi.
He was a very proficient force user, yet a skilled diplomat, and duelist.
He was a Jedi Consular, yet he wielded a lightsaber powered by a yellow crystal, which he would then change to a blue crystal.

Yarael Poof was believed to have joined the Jedi Order similarly to its other members.
Upon his birth, the doctors would discover the baby to be force sensitive, sending this information to the Jedi Order on Coruscant, who would soon dispatch recruiters to collect the child and bring them back to Coruscant.
As time passed, Yarael Poof would quickly reach the rank of Initiate, was selected by a master and go on to pass his trials, and was knighted as a Jedi Knight.
It was here he would go on to study the role of a Jedi Consular and advance his skills with the force.
 He was very powerful in the force with abilities such as telekinesis, but specialised in force mind control.
This is the ability to manipulate the minds of the weak-willed through persuasive language, hallucinations and more.
His skills were soon recognised by the Jedi High Council and he was offered a position at their side.
Yarael Poof would continue being a highly respected Instructor within the Jedi Academy of the order.
He would instruct the next generation of Knights and pass on his knowledge of the force to many other Jedi.



# Section 2
Shortly after the events of the Phantom Menace, the council of the Jedi order assembled to face an immediate threat to the Galactic Republic.
A dangerous Annoo-Dat, known as Ashaar Khorda, had plotted to strike a blow to the senate by attacking one of the Republic’s key worlds.
However, the council learned that this dangerous criminal had come into possession of an artefact, capable of destroying a planet if used correctly.
Jedi High Councillors were positioned on a variety of Republic planets to intercept this coming threat.
Yarael Poof volunteered to oversee Coruscant and ensure its safety.
The Jedi Master would leave the Temple and begin to travel around the planet, allowing the force to guide him to anywhere he needed to be.
Eventually, the Jedi would be guided to Coruscant’s central power generator, as it was here that Yarael could feel a great disturbance in the force and found Khorda present with the dangerous artefact.
Yarael would then find himself working alongside two Bounty Hunters, Jango Fett and Zam Wessel who had also made their way to this location on a mission to track down and eliminate Khorda.
The three of them would quickly defeat the Khorda’s followers but Khorda would manage to catch the Jedi by surprise.
He would stab Yarael with a vibroblade directly into his heart before the bounty hunters could kill this terrorist.
As the device was set up and preparing to release its full energy and decimate the planet, Yarael would reach out with the force and use the last of his strength to manipulate and deactivate the device, dying immediately after.

The Jedi Master would be celebrated for saving the billions of lives that were present on Coruscant at his funeral, which was attended by the Jedi High Council along with his students.
The death of Yarael Poof would leave a hole in the Jedi Council for a duration of time before Jedi Master Coleman Trebor would take his seat as tensions began to grow between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
