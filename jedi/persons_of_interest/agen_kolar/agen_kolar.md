# Introduction

Born a Zabrak and  Force-sensitive, Agen Kolar had an extremely impressive skill set.
After his training, Kolar was regarded as one of the best swordsmen within the Order.
Being compared to Master Yoda himself, Kolar put his combat skill to good use.
A master in Ataru, whilst incorporating Djem-So, Agen Kolar was always known to be an aggressive individual.
Whenever he saw fit, he drew his blade and prepared for combat, even if seemingly unnecessary to other Jedi.
Not only was he a Master of lightsaber combat, he was also gifted in the art of hand-to-hand combat.
One of the most notable examples of this was when he fought a group of cantina-goers without causing them any serious injury.

# Section 1

Agen climbed the ranks at an impressive speed, obtaining the rank of Master in the year 22 BBY.
Also being recognized by the Jedi High Council, Agen was recommended to go and fight Darth Sidious, This, however, was the downfall of Master Kolar, as he died in combat.
Before his death, however, he was also involved in the Battle of Geonosis.
This is where Agen lost his Padawan, Tan Yuster.
Another event Kolar was a part of was the Clone Wars.
As a Jedi General, Kolar was eventually tasked with taking the core planet Brentaal IV.
After being captured and jailed, an ally of Kolarâ€™s ended up freeing him.
One month following the Clone Wars, Agen was given the mission of arresting Jedi Master Quinlan Vos.
After capturing him, he allowed Vos to get away after being threatened with a diplomatic uproar from Aruk the Hutt.

# Section 2

Approximately three years after the war began, General Grievous made a move on the planet of Coruscant.
He also managed to capture the Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.
After attempting and failing at intercepting Grievous' shuttle, Kolar was to remain on Coruscant.
He, along with the rest of the High Council, wanted Anakin Skywalker to take advantage of his relationship with the Chancellor to spy on him and his office.
After revealing himself as Darth Sidious to Skywalker, Mace Windu put together the same group of Jedi that accompanied him on The Rig.
After engaging Darth Sidious, Kolar fell alongside Kit Fisto and Mace Windu, due to a swift stab in the chest, delivered by the Sith Lord.
