# Introduction
Zaalbar, also known as “Big Z”, was an outcast Wookie from the Mid Rim planet Kashyyyk.
Zalbaar was the son of the Wookie Chieftain known as Freyyr.
Zaalbar was considered a madclaw, which in Wookie culture, was a title for dishonor that he received for the attack on his brother Chuundar.
Zaalbar was also a Wookie of a few words, and chose not to speak unless he needed to.
He preferred to let his street-smart Twi’lek companion, Mission Vao, do the talking.
He considered Mission to be his only friend and was very protective over her.
Zaalbar struggled with certain aspects of his life and culture and struggled with explaining it to others as he chose to keep his past life a secret.
He also had a very low opinion of himself, since being cast out from his home world and tribe.
Because of this, he felt pain when speaking about himself to others.
Zaalbar went on many adventures with his companion, Mission, in the lower city of Taris.
When Zaalbar was captured by Gamorrean slavers, Mission showed up with the former Sith Lord, Darth Revan, and rescued him.
Zaalbar then offered a life debt to Revan and stuck to it ever since.

When Revan, along with Zaalbar and his companions, was tasked with finding the Star Maps, one of them happened to be located on the planet of Kashyyyk.
Upon Zaalbar’s return to the planet, many of the Wookie natives were displeased to see a madclaw walking amongst them.
Zaalbar’s tribe was suffering from being taxed and run by the Czerka Corporation.
After some time, Revan and Zaalbar would soon discover that Chuundar, Zaalbar’s Wookie brother, had overthrown Freyyr’s spot as Chieftain and banished him to the Shadowlands, the ground level of the deep dangerous forests of Kashyyyk.
Zaalbar’s true skills lay in combat, which was very helpful in Mission’s case.
Zaalbar considered himself a dedicated warrior and fighter, and was able to wield a variety of weapons, including the legendary bowcaster, a ranged weapon favored by the Wookies.
Zaalbar was considered a guardian by most for his dedication to protecting Mission.
