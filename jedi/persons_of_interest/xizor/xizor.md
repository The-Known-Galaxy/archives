# Introduction

Xizor, a Falleen male, was the head of Xizor Transport Systems and one of the most influential and affluent members of the crime syndicate known as the Black Sun during the rule of the Galactic Empire.
Xizor, known for his lavish tastes and money, was most well known for having a huge palace built in the middle of the bustling and expensive city of Coruscant.
He was a master manipulator and ambitious schemer who was always looking to enhance his authority and influence across the galaxy.

# Section 1

Xizor's ascension within the Black Sun began long before the Clone Wars.
He was already a powerful member of the criminal organization when the war broke out, and he carefully waited out the galaxy-wide struggle.
Once the conflicts ended and Palpatine imposed a new Order, Xizor rapidly became close to the newly-proclaimed Emperor.

Just months after the declaration, Xizor was one of the top candidates to join the Black Sun as a Vigo.
He faced considerable competition from Kaird, a Nediji assassin, for the position.
They battled for underlord Dal Perhi's favor by performing missions for the organization and constructing traps to disrupt each other's objectives.
Xizor's collaboration with Perhi successfully restructured the Black Sun and healed the faction in the aftermath of the Bota catastrophe.
The competition heated up when Kaird set Xizor up to buy a stolen hypergem from a Metellos leader.
Xizor, however, had set up Kaird to come up with the idea and when Xizor bought the hypergem, he took it to Underlord Perhi as a symbol of his loyalty and to turn Kaird in.

Xizor was given one final job to complete for Perhi, believing he had all but secured the post of Vigo: find and rescue the droid 10-4TO.
The robot was being pursued by both the Galactic Empire and a fledgling resistance movement known as the Whiplash, and Perhi desired control of it as a negotiating chip to ensure that the government did not interfere with his organization's criminal operations.
Nevertheless, obtaining the droid was not Perhi's goal for the trip; rather, he was preparing Xizor for assassination by Kaird, who constituted less of a danger to the Underlord's control.

After a brief confrontation with Jedi Knight Jax Pavan and his band of allies, who were seeking the droid, Xizor grabbed Kaird and went into the Manufacturing District with the help of 10-4TO.
Xizor stated to Kaird that he intended to kill Underlord Perhi and replace him with a human replica droid to control Perhi and eventually ascend to the title of Underlord.
He intended to brainwash the assassin into murdering Perhi, but his plans were thwarted when he discovered that his team of scientists had been slain by wild droids.

The Falleen were then escorted to the remainder of Jax Pavan's party, which had pursued Xizor halfway across Coruscant in pursuit of 10-4TO.
Xizor was able to escape the Factory District with the help of the robot, but only after a violent battle with Kaird's faithful troops.
Xizor and his squad then returned to his palace to continue planning his takeover of the Black Sun organization.
Xizor's feud with Kaird, on the other hand, was far from done.
Kaird managed to escape Xizor's clutches and seek vengeance.
He hired bounty hunter Boba Fett to assassinate Xizor, but the Falleen outmaneuver Fett and capture him.
Xizor then used Fett as leverage to pull Kaird into a trap, ultimately killing him.

# Section 3

Xizor's win over Kaird solidified his status as the Black Sun's leader, but it also made him a target of the Galactic Empire.
Palpatine considered Xizor as a possible adversary and his criminal empire as a danger to his  power.
This culminated in a battle between Xizor and the Emperor, which ultimately led to Xizor's demise.
Darth Vader contacted Xizor in 3 ABY and requested a meeting on Coruscant.
Xizor saw the meeting as an opportunity to bargain with the Sith Lord and obtain the Emperor's favor.
Vader, on the other hand, had other ideas.

Vader had uncovered Xizor's participation in the Black Sun's operations on Mustafar, as well as his romantic interest in Princess Leia Organa.
Vader saw an opportunity to destroy a rival as well as a potential threat to his relationship with the Emperor, as well as capture the Rebel Alliance commanders with whom Xizor had been cooperating.
Vader challenged Xizor to a lightsaber duel during the meeting.
Xizor, although a master of unarmed fighting, was no match for Vader's mastery of the Force and the lightsaber, and he was quickly vanquished.
Vader then took advantage of the situation to frame Xizor for an assassination attempt on the Emperor, and Xizor was later murdered by the Imperial fleet.

# Section 4

Xizor's time in the galaxy was brief, but he made a lasting impression.
Among the galaxy's people, Xizor is largely regarded as one of the most intriguing and complicated enemies.
His cunning, charm, and ferocity have made him an unforgettable adversary.
Xizor's power and influence are well-known as the leader of the legendary criminal organization Black Sun, and his activities have had a lasting impact on countless lives across the galaxy.
The legend of the Black Sun has continued to ripple throughout the galaxy in the years since his downfall, proving Xizor's enduring impact.
