# Introduction
Cassa Hun was a force-sensitive Jedi Master.
Hun spent his years serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Cold War with the opposing Sith Empire.
His main responsibility was to train young Jedi Knights to either the path of Jedi Sentinels or Jedi Guardians.
He was very dedicated to teaching the ideals and philosophy of whatever path a young Knight would choose, even going as far as giving additional armor to Knights following the path of a Guardian or an additional lightsaber to Knights choosing the path of a Sentinel.
Cassa spent most of his service between the Republic Navy’s Carrick Station and Coruscant, the capital planet of the Republic.
Friendly Jedi Master, Nimi, was also working alongside Cassa.
Nimi usually directed young Knights to Cassa to undergo their training.
