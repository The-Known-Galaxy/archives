BIOGRAPHY

Darnell Reggs, a human male, was a small cog in the Rebel Alliance machine and secured a multitude of victories for them.
His most treacherous missions began when Rookie One, another rebel pilot, recovered the Corellia Star light freighter.


The contents of the freighter’s inner recordings highlighted Darth Vader’s plans to create advanced V38 Assaults devices that had invisibility cloaking devices.
 The factory that produced these was subsequently destroyed by Darnell Reggs and his team under Admiral Gial Ackbar.

A second mission followed which involved the planet Imdaar in the Dantus Sector.
It had been scouted out that the Imperial Navy was deploying a new set of TIE phantoms into nearby space.
Rookie One had accepted the mission first and would sabotage one of the fighters and return it to the Alliance for reverse engineering and study.

Rookie One was escorted by Reggs and other pilots in a small group of (3) ships.
The squadron engaged (12) or more TIE/IN Interceptors and managed to heroically survive, as well as destroy them.

Despite being outnumbered heavily, this showcased the immense skill of each pilot, and especially Darnell Reggs.

PERSONALITY & TRAITS

Darnell Reggs was an ideal pilot, neither an exceptional prodigy, nor an incompetent rustbucket.
He served diligently under both Admiral Krane and Admiral Ackbar and never disrespected either of the two.

Reggs had made friends with many of his pilots, and formed a good bond with Rookie One, making them a successful pair in the missions they went on together.
