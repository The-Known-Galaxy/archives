# Introduction

Admiral Conan Antionio Motti was a human male who was born to a wealthy and powerful family on the Outer Rim world of Seswenna.
However, his family was considered below Tarkinâ€™s own family by several levels.
He started his military career by earning a commision to the Imperial Academy on the Planent of Prefsbelt IV.
After this, he was appointed to the planet of Anaxes.
However, during his time as a cadet, he was not well known for his academics, but instead for his aggressive and ruthless politics he came to adopt.
The politics he adopted quickly gained him the favor of Emperor Palpatine due to him fitting the type of officers the Emperor wanted to fill the ranks with.
This in turn allowed him to quickly rise through the ranks.
As an Imperial officer he was known to use aggressive force to resolve any issue and any one who stood in his way or his goals.

He started his officer career under Captain Jaim Helaw on the Strike-class cruiser Ion Storm.
This is where Captain Helaw acted as his mentor and allowed him to receive a promotion to First Lieutenant, but after a while he went to the capital planet of Coruscant to work for a brief period.
However, this brief period would allow him to make important contacts that would help him quickly rise past Captain Helaw in rank.
By 14 BBY, he was a part of the Joint Chiefs, where he was considered as one of the possible candidates that would be granted the new rank of Grand Moff, but in the end the rank would go to Wilhuff Tarkin.
By the year of 0 BBY, Motti would be finally promoted to the full rank of Admiral and granted the position of Chief of the Imperial Navy.
At this point Admiral Motti would be onboard the Death Star where he supervised the final inspection of the battle station to certify it would be fully operational.
However, this would not be long before the Death Star was destroyed, killing those onboard, including Admiral Motti himself.
