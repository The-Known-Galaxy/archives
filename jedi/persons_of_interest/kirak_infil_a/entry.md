# Introduction

Kirak Infilâ€™a was a Jedi Master when the Galactic Republic was coming to an end.
His main specialty was combat when he was a Jedi.
The Barash Vow was something that Kirak took, which restricted him from doing anything that was related to the Jedi Order.
Because Kirak was not an official Jedi during the time of the Jedi Purge and Order 66, he was not terminated.
In the future, he wielded a green lightsaber and faced the once-Jedi Knight, Darth Vader.

# Section 1

Because Kirak had a major specialty in combat during the time in the Jedi Order, he was able to put up a fight against Vader.
He was almost able to defeat Vader, by pushing him off a cliff.
However, the Sith Lord was able to repair the damage he had taken, by repairing his suit with the parts from Kirak's droid, Arex.
The two shared one last fight at a city, however, the city's security personnel responded to this by opening fire at both of the men during their fight.
Having their fight interrupted, the furious Sith Lord pushed their attackers down a cliff, however, to his surprise, Kirak tried to use the Force to save them Vader was absolutely surprised when Kirak saved them both from falling off the cliff and being executed when they dropped to the bottom.
Because Vader knew how compassionate Kirak was, he created a massive force flood in the city, to distract Kirak and get him to save them.
The Sith Lord used the Force to grab the once Jedi Mater's lightsaber.
Kirak offered his life in return for the city, and the security's safety.
After ignoring his pleading, Vader broke Kirak's neck with the Force and threw him into the forming lake, where the city and people he tried to save lied.

# Section 2

Karik was a master at lightsaber combat when he was still inside of the Jedi Order as a Jedi Master.
Since he took the Barash Vow, Kirak was to keep his abilities in the Force outside the activities of the Jedi Order, and had to rely on his training droid, Arex, when it came to practising.
Whenever a Jedi died, he was able to feel their presence receding.
Kirak wore trousers with a buckled black belt and trousers.
His lightsaber contained a green kyber crystal, and his hilt was curved, similarly to that of Count Dooku.
Once Kirak was defeated, Vader bled his kyber crystal, causing it to turn red.
Kirak's lightsaber was kept in the Sith Lord's posession until it was destroyed on Cabarria.
