# Introduction

Mandalore the Lesser was a Human who lived and fought during the Cold War and Great Galactic War serving as the head of the warrior clans.
He lived on Geonosis as a Gladiator, like many other Mandalorians gaining prestige through their combat efforts.
However his fate was soon to turn after Imperial Intelligence deemed him worthy of being used as a pawn to gather Mandalorian clans and use them as powerful allies against the Republic.
Imperials managed to rig his Gladiator matches which inherently granted him more power and infamy, eventually earning him the title of Mandalore.

# Section 1

Using his new found position of power, he directed fellow Mandalorians towards the Hydian Way to block it for the Sith - as an act of passion and loyalty.
Although it crippled Republic forces, the Hydian Way Blockade only lasted for a year after being destroyed by smugglers.
This loss proved devastating for the Mandalorians.
However, Mandalore the Lesser had an idea to reunite and vitalize his people; the Great Hunt, a galactic scale tournament to determine the Grand Champion by hunting bounties across the Galaxy.

# Section 2

Unfortunately, for Mandalore the Lesser a victor of the Great Hunt, Artus Lok, challenged Mandalore in a duel in 3653 BBY on Geonosis ultimately winning and claiming the new title of Mandalore.
With time the Mandalorians came to know of the previous Mandalore being used as a puppet by Imperial Intelligence under the Sith, this inherently earned him the title of ‘the Lesser’ through Mandalorian history.
