By the time when Darth Vader was born, along with the new Galactic Empire, Doom continued to serve for them throughout the Great Jedi Purge.
During Order 66, Doom and his 125th Legion proceeded to kill Master Haddon, while Haddon’s Padawan had escaped with a mere inch of her life.
During the reign of the new Galactic Empire, Doom and the rest of the 125th Legion were tasked and assigned to the Reconquest of the Rim, under the command of Darth Vader.
The goal of the Reconquest of the Rim, was to retake many dissenting systems in the Outer Rim Territories.
The Reconquest gained the liberation of 95 planets that served under the order of the new Galactic Empire.
Doom remained loyal to the new Galactic Empire, until his life came to an end by the hands of an assassin on the planet Felucia.
