# Introduction

Languss Tuno also known as “Guss” Tuno was a Force-sensitive Mon Calamari born on the planet of Varn.
Guss would train under the Jedi Order as the Padawan of Jedi Master Lorenn.
Guss failed to follow the path of the Jedi, so he parted ways from the Order.
Guss would take refuge on the planet of Nar Shaddaa.
He would find work under the crime lord Neemogh Hargin.
Tuno would pretend to be a Sith Lord named ‘Lord Struction’ to threaten Hargin’s clients and rivals.
Tuno would make large sums of credits doing this job.
Everything was going swell until he attempted the same move on members of the Exchange.
Hargin had disappeared while Tuno managed to run away safely.

# Section 1

Tuno would eventually take the identity of ‘Jedi Master Wanderfar’ in order to make money.
He would use his limited knowledge of the Order to charge civilians to see their ‘future’.
Everything was running smoothly, until the Order found out and immediately shut his operation down.
Tuno would then begin to work for the White Maw, stationed on the icy world of Hoth.
There, he would be sent to infiltrate Aurek Base to recover a crate of sensors.
A smuggler by the name of the Voidhound would be sent to do the same task by Senator Bevara Dodonna.
When the two met, Guss disguised himself as a Jedi Master taking the post of Major Painn.
Tuno was able to trick the Smuggler into stealing the sensors for him, in order to get on the White Maw’s good side.
Afterwards, Voidhound would confront Tuno on his deception forcing him to confess to everything.
Tuno then helped the smuggler get into contact with Shai Tenna.

# Section 2

Tuno would join the Voidhound’s crew.
Tuno would eventually gain thoughts of possibly returning to the Jedi Order, confessing them to the Voidwolf.
Tuno would later realize he was already where he belonged.
The Voidhound would eventually go missing.
In this distress Tuno had been accepted as a Padawan by Isaac so he could regain his connection to the Force.
Isaac would sadly use Guss as his errand boy, telling him to use the Force in order to receive discounts on his drinks.
Isaac would later permit Guss to join the Anti-Zakuul Alliance after encountering the Commander on Nar Shaddaa.
