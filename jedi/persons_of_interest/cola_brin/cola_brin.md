# Introduction
General Information 

Cala Brin was a female Human Jedi Master.
She was among the founding members of The Jedi Order, following the defeat of the Bogan Je'daii in 25,783 BBY.


Upon the foundation of The Jedi Order, it was Cala Brin who proposed that Jedi should uphold justice, and serve as peacekeepers within the known Galaxy.
With this emotions, passions, fears, or any attachments to the dark were set aside, to properly decide what is just.

Legacy


As a result of the return of the Sith Empire, the Order relocated to Tython at the end of the Great Galactic War.
It was at this point that a hologram of the legendary Jedi Master was discovered.
During the Cold War, the hologram of Master Brin was threatened by Flesh Raiders, forcing Master Yuon Par to send her Padawan, the future Barsen'thor, to save it.
