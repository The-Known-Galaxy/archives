# Introduction

Mission Vao was a blue skinned Twi’lek Rutian female who lived as a street urchin on Taris during the Mandalorian Wars.
She spoke Galactic Basic Standard instead of her native language, and travelled with her close Wookie friend and companion, Zaalbar.
Mission grew up as an orphan and never knew her parents.
She had her older brother Griff to look after her, but Griff was known to be a scam artist, along with a gambler and heavy drinker.
Due to an alien ban that was placed on the upper city of Taris, Mission and her older brother were forced to live in the lower city, resulting in her brother joining one of the lower city’s swoop gangs known as the Hidden Beks.
Due to Griff’s debts and the trouble he had got him and his sister, he officially decided that was not a right lifestyle for her, and deserted her on Taris.

# Section 1

Mission learned how to get by on her own after her brother deserted her.
Despite her harsh abandonment by her brother, Mission knew how to keep herself uplifted, optimistic, and happy.
She was also very good with seeing the best in people.
Upon her adventures, she would eventually encounter a Wookie outcast from Kashyyyk, named Zaalbar.
He was a prime target for harassment to the notorious lower city swoop gang known as the Black Vulkars.
They formed an instant bond with one another after a small scuffle where they defended each other from members of the notorious lower city swoop gang known as the Black Vulkars, and have stuck together ever since.
This resulted in her nicknaming Zaalbar “Big Z ''.
They got by with each other in the lower city for two years with absolutely no word from Griff.
They often went out seeking adventure and fortune in the most dangerous spots of Taris, like the Undercity, the ground level of Taris where the poor were forced to live.
Through Missions adventures, she even befriended Gadon, the known leader of the swoop gang known as the Hidden Beks, and was quick to try to convince Mission and her Wookie friend to avoid the Undercity and other dangerous places.
