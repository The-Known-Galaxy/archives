# Introduction

Tol Braga was a male Kel Dor and member of the Jedi Order who had achieved the rank of Jedi Master.
He was a strong and wise Jedi who held great knowledge within him, he strongly believed in peace and always tried his best to avoid having to slay anyone.
Many younger members of the Order believed Braga became a pacifist after having to be part of the Great Galactic War, however, his opposition to fighting started many years earlier.
Braga's first mission as a young member was to prevent a violent conflict from escalating on Duro.
When he saw what happens when people turn against their own kind, it changed him forever.

# Section 1

The high point during his career in the Jedi Order was when he engaged the known Sith Lord, Darth Sajar in a fight alone.
Not only did he manage to disarm Sajar but also gives his enemy a chance to rethink his previous decisions.
This allowed him to pull Sajar from the darkness and convince him to join the Jedi Order.
Afterwards he took Sajar as his new student to teach him the ways of the Light Side of the Force.

# Section 2

Braga had come up with a plan to capture the Sith Emperor, his plan included infiltrating the Emperor’s fortress and confronting the Sith Lord that way.
Despite the warnings from some Jedi Masters, his mission was approved and Braga remained convinced of succeeding.
Not long after he managed to get inside the fortress, the Emperor confronted him while mocking Braga for his arrogance and foolishness.
The Jedi Master was then knocked out by the Emperor’s lightning.
Eventually, he was able to break free from the Emperor’s grasp, but not without realizing how he allowed his pride to blind him and exposed him to the Dark Side of the Force.
With his broken spirit, knowing he had failed, Braga began serving the Emperor willingly as he believed this was the right punishment he deserved for being ignorant.
