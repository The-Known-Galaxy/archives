# Introduction
Rook Kast was a human female who was the leader of the Mandalorian super commando unit during her time in Maul’s criminal organization known as the Shadow Collective.
After Pre-Vizsla was beheaded by Maul, a good number of Mandalorians including Rook Kast committed themselves to his cause while others resisted Maul’s rule.
During the last few days of the Clone Wars and the beginning of the Siege of Mandalore, Kast was one of the Mandalorians who fought against the Republic’s first wave.
Once most of the Republic’s forces had landed on the city, Kast was forced to retreat while also receiving new orders from Maul.
Her new objective was to lure Ahsoka Tano away from the rest of the Republic’s forces and into the under-city tunnel systems, which she ended up accomplishing.
Kast had Tano cornered with Maul after taking out a squad of clone troopers, including Captain Vaughn.
At the end of the siege, the rest of Maul’s forces along with Kast were arrested after being abandoned by Maul.
