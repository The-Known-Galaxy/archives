# Introduction
Asajj Ventress was a female Zabrak who was born on the planet of Dathomir.
She was a part of the Nightsisters clan.
There was a bounty hunter named Hal'Sted who stole Ventress from her biological mother and her clan mother who is named Talzin.
The bounty hunter decided to raise Ventress on the planet of Rattatak.
One day, her master was killed, so she went out looking for a new one and found one that was a Jedi Master in the Jedi Order, their name was Ky Narec.
Narec was very impressed and was happy with the abilities that Ventress could possess.
They both worked together marvelously and kept the Order and everything going well on Rattatak.

# Section 1
One day, Narrec was murdered and Ventress was revengeful and hated that this occurred and greatly missed her once Jedi Master.
All of this hate and anger brought and led her to the Dark Side.
Within the next few years, she found Count Dooku and became his new Sith Apprentice and a helper in leading the Clone Army during the Clone Wars era.
One day, Dooku tried to assassinate and kill Ventress to prove his allegiance and honor to his Sith Master, Darth Sidious.



# Section 2
Ventress felt very betrayed and disgusted about what her former Sith Master Dooku tried to do, so she decided to return to her cult and her mother Talzin.
She returned to Dathomir, and her mother Talzin, wanted to aid her in getting her revenge on her former Sith Master Dooku.
She used Savage Opress as a puppet in her game to aid in destroying Count Dooku.
Ventress’ mission sadly failed her mission since Opress broke out of her control and came too.
Due to this, she returned to Dathomir.



# Section 3
Due to the fact Ventress tried to assassinate Dooku, he sent General Grievous to Dathomir to destroy it.
It was the Nightsisters and  Asajj Ventress versus the Clone Army and General Grievous.
Unexpectedly, the Nightsisters and Asajj lost and ended up needing to escape as General Grievous and his clone army fully destroyed their base and lots of the locations around them on Dathomir.



# Section 4
Asajj Ventress left Dathomir and decided to become a bounty hunter.
She started this new life by first traveling to Tatooine.
She decided to fully walk to Mos Eisley.
In the cantina, there was a bounty hunter named Oked, and he decided to try his best to take advantage of Ventress, for which he failed so she killed them.
There were more bounty hunters there named Bossk and Latts Razzi, they both realized they would not be able to complete their mission on their own so they decided to recruit Ventress to get help from her during the mission.



# Section 5
Asajj Ventress one day appeared on Coruscant still as a bounty hunter but disguised her voice in a mask she was wearing along with her two dual-bladed lightsabers.
She was excited about hearing about Ahsoka Tano’s bounty that she, unfortunately, had after being set up by Bariss Offee.
She had dropped the bounty after making a pact with Tano to help her clear her name.
She was helping Tano escape without killing any of the clone troopers.
A hooded unknown person knocked her out and took her lightsabers and that was all from there, she was impersonated by the hooded and unknown person.



# Section 6
Asajj Ventress was interrogated by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker after finding out that Tano’s trial would occur.
She revealed to Skywalker that she was the one who was helping Ahsoka Tano and that the only other person that Ahsoka Tano had talked to was Barriss Offee, which made Ventress and Skywalker realize the situation that happened and what they were in.



# Section 7
Asajj Ventress months later received a new lightsaber from the Black Market and decided to continue working within the Bounty Hunter field.
She came in contact with a Jedi Master who was named Quinlan Vos who wanted Ventress’ help in assassinating and killing Count Dooku.
Ventress, during the mission, introduced Vos to the night’s culture and decided to help train him a bit.
During the mission, Dooku kidnapped Vos and took him captive as a hostage.
Due to this, Ventress hired a couple of bounty hunters, as well as Boba Fett.
Vos decided to join the dark side and became Dooku’s Sith Apprentice to become very close to Sidious and Dooku.
Ventress and Vos decided to continue to pursue Dooku and brought him to a Separatist base on the planet Christophis.
Many Republic forces bombarded and went to the location of the Separatist base.
Dooku forces lightning in Vou, however, Ventress becomes in love with Vou and jumps in front of him to stop him from being hurt.
Ventress was dying and Vou was allowed back to the Jedi.
Obi-Wan Kenobi buried Ventress on the planet of Dathomir where her body lay to rot for the rest of Dathomir’s lifespan.
