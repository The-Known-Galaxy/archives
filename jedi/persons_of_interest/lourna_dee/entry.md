# Introduction

Lourna Dee was a green-female of the Twi’lek species who had the title “Tempest Runner” in Nihil, a marauder organization.
She was born around 272 BBY and is unknown when she died.
As she served in Nihil, she earned her title along with the other two, developing more reputation for herself.
A cruiser she commanded would be named after her in honour.
Around 232 BBY, she and Millikob would team with their Tempests against Eyta’s on Ab Dalis in an attempt to raid the organization.
They would be successful for most of the attack.
Afterwards, Pan Eyta would host a celebration in the Nihil's Great Hall, even though she partially ruined the raid.
Marchion Ro would announce a meeting between himself and the three runners, explaining how the usage of any of the described Paths would forever be restricted until the heat from the event died down.
All would agree except for Lourna and would try to convince Marchion to allow her to use the quickest and easiest route for a raid on Elphrona.
Her goal was to kidnap the richest family on Alderaan, the Blythe Family, and use them for ransoming and east credits.
He would agree and give her permission to use the path.
