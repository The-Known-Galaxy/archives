# Section 1

General Grievous was on a rampage throughout the Clone Wars.
He assaulted the Venator, Steadfast, while General Koth and Commander Lock were on it near the Arda system.
The droid attackers would overwhelm the clones as they were split off from their Jedi General.
Since Koth was on the bridge, he ordered Lock to retreat to the escape pods with his remaining forces.
This battle would be an unfortunate defeat for Lock and his men as General Koth would be captured.
