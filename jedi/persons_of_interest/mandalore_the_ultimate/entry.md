# Introduction

Across Mandalore’s history, there have been many leaders who have gone down in history, from Mandalore the Preserver to Mandalore the Avenger.
However, none come close to the prowess and legacy of Mandalore the Ultimate.

# Section 1

A revered Taung Crusader, Mandalore the Ultimate was a great warrior.
He had claimed the mask of his predecessor, Mandalore the Indomitable on Dxun after defeating him in battle, and proclaimed himself the new Mand’alor.
Vowing to return the Mandalorian people to their former glories, he reorganised his forces into the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders and deployed his forces to conquer worlds on the edge of the galaxy; left defenceless and weak in the wake of the Great Sith Wars.
The Republic did almost nothing to combat his conquest, with Mandalore the Ultimate personally leading the conquest of Republic space.

# Section 2

However, despite his greatness as a warrior and conqueror, Mandalore the Ultimate was merely a tool for a greater power.
Behind the scenes, the Sith Emperor was personally influencing the Mandalorians and using them for his own gain.

# Section 3

As the Mandalorian Wars raged on, the Republic saw themselves on the brink of defeat.
However, the Jedi Knights Revan and Malak took a small force of Jedi to assist the Republic.
In a duel of Malachor V, Revan struck the Mand’alor down in a duel.
With his final words, Mandalore the Ultimate revealed that it was the Sith who was truly in control, and this led Revan and Malak on a pursuit of the Sith Emperor, Vitiate.

# Section 4

Revan would take the mask of Mandalore the Ultimate and hide it in a Sith Lord’s tomb on the planet Rekkiad, in an effort to end all Mandalorian aggression in the future.
