# Introduction

Starkiller, originally known as Galen Marek, was a Force-sensitive human male who was taken in by the Sith Lord Darth Vader as his secret apprentice.
He was the son of two Jedi knights known as Kento and Mallie Marek.
Galen was born on the planet of Kashyyyk during the reign of the Galactic Empire, and after the aftermath of the Clone Wars.
Kashyyyk was invaded by Darth Vader and Imperial forces during the duration of the Great Jedi Purge, following the death of both Kento and Mallie.
Vader soon discovered Galen and his strong bond to the Force, and brought him under his wing as his secret apprentice and assassin.
Galen would soon forget about his past life and original name over time, since being abducted from his home world by the Sith Lord.
Galen was well-trained in the Sith arts, and mastered the back-hand saber style as well as the form known as Dun Moch.
In a more secluded way to keep his apprentice secret, Vader bestowed the name “Starkiller” upon him, rather than using his actual identity.

# Section 1

Galen, aka Starkiller, aspired to be one with the Order of the Sith Lords for years.
He truly believed it was his destiny to help Vader kill Darth Sidious and usurp the throne of the Galactic Empire.
Starkiller was tasked with the mission to kill a few remaining surviving Jedi from the Jedi Order, including Rahm Kota and Shaak Ti.
After Starkiller managed to complete his mission, he was betrayed by his master after their confrontation with the Emperor.
Despite this turn of events, Starkiller still remained loyal to Darth Vader, and even went to form a rebellion against the Galactic Empire to foil their operations in help to his old master's plan to dispose of Sidious.
He was even able to convince Mon Mothma, Bail Prestor Organa, and Garm Bel Ilis to join his cause.
But however, the plan was another ruse.
Upon discovering this, Vader had the senators arrested and left Starkiller behind for dead, betraying him once again.
