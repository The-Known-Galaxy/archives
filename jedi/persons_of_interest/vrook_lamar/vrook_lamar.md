# Introduction

Vrook Lamar, one of the Jedi Masters that sat on the High Jedi Council for a long period of service from the times following the Great Sith wars till the First Jedi Purge.
During his early years in his position as a member of the High Jedi Council, he among his colleagues started the event that is known as the Great Hunt, whose purpose was to hunt down the remnants of creatures that belong to the Sith after the recent war had ended.
The Great Hunt was a success but came at the cost of multiple Jedi knights, most notably Duron Qel-Droma.

# Section 1

Following a short time of peace, Vrook served well on the Jedi Council of Dantooine, where he and Vandar Tokare were placed in charge of the Jedi Enclave that served as a Jedi academy on that planet.
At some point, Vrook would later meet a young Meetra Suurik, who would later become the Jedi Exile to many others after many years had passed since their first encounter.
Vrook's opinion on Meetra was that she was just a mediocre Jedi, though Vandar thought of her as a natural leader.

Before the Mandalorian War came, Vrook and his fellow councilors were involved in a case that would be known as the “Padawan Massacre”.
Four padawans were killed except for one, Zayne Carrick, which he was framed for the murder.
Instead in truth, it was their masters who murdered them instead.
On the run, Zayne was able to communicate with the council on Dantooine, where they heard a part of his reason briefly before the transmission was cut off shortly.

# Section 2

After a period of time had passed, Vrook summoned the Jedi Masters that were involved in the case at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where he dismissed each of them and assigned them to different places in the galaxy as he was disappointed along with his councilors that they could not do what the most basic thing a Jedi Master could do: Protecting their padawan.
While the Mandalorian war rages on, Zayne Carrick was able to get clear evidence for his innocence and decided to turn himself into a Jedi Sect that called themselves the Jedi Covenant, to which the Jedi High Council did not know its existence until now.

When that time came, Vrook Lamar led a Jedi Strike team to the Jedi Covenant’s base to answer for their purposes and to save Zayne Carrick.
However, during the process of it, they were taken by Orbital bombardment from Republic space forces that were hacked.
Thus, Vrook had to call off the attack and fully retreat.
Following this particular event shortly, Vrook led another Jedi team to the planet of Cathar to confront Revan’s faction, which they called themselves the Revanchist.
During their time on the planet, all of the Jedis that were around had a vision of which the residents of the planet were massacred by the Mandalorians themselves.

Because of this, Vrook Lamar with his councilors was convinced to sanction the Revanchists' actions in the war.
However, due to its occurrence, many Jedi that had followed Vrook to meet up with Revan’s faction went on to join in the war efforts.
And despite sanctioning Revan’s faction actions, Vrook had a very low opinion of the Jedi who joined him.
After the war ended, Vrook remained in his seat as part of the Jedi Council on Dantooine.
Though, he was also one of the Jedi councilors who was responsible for the trials of Meetra Surik.

# Section 3

When the Jedi Civil war came, and Revan was captured after an attack, Vrook and many of his colleagues reprogrammed him with a new memory and drastically changed his personality as a loyal soldier to the Republic.
He was involved with training Revan when the prodigal Knight started his Jedi training once more, though he was against it.
When an unexpected attack came at Dantooine, Vrook was one of the few Jedi to survive it.

After the Jedi Civil war had ended and the Jedi were on their knees due to a devastating blow to their numbers, of which, only a remaining hundred Jedi were alive by then.
Vrook was the only councilor part of the Jedi Council on Dantooine who did not answer the call for the Jedi Conclave on Katarr.
Which, he saved himself from it after a shocking ill event had happened there.
During the early years of the First Jedi Purge, Vrook took refuge in what were the remains of the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine.

# Section 4

During his time in exile, Vrook allowed himself to be captured by a team of mercenaries who were hoping to take him to prison as they were planning to overthrow the local government of the planet.
Though his imprisonment came to a short, as an unexpected Meetra Surik came to his unnecessary rescue, as she took care of his captors.
Vrook criticized her briefly for ruining the plans in mind but nevertheless, he went on with it and later took part in the defense of Khoonda.

After the small civil war ended, Vrook had a conversation with Meetra, with questions surrounding her trials and her unique connection to the force that had been recovered recently.
He was also asked to join a Jedi Conclave that would be held at the Jedi enclave, to which he reluctantly agreed.
When that time came, Vrook and what was left of his councilors told Meetra the truth about her trials and was deemed as a threat to the force, if not, life itself due to being a wound and an echo within it.
In an attempt to cut off her connection to the force once more, his efforts were in vain when her mentor, Kreia, unexpectedly barges in and stops their process of doing so.
Before Vrook and his fellow councilors could attack her, they all fell to her shortly as she stripped away their force simply with relative ease.
