# Introduction

Lanoree Brock was a Force-sensitive human female born from two Je’daii Masters in 25,818 BBY on the homeworld of Tython.
Brock grew up at the Temple of Arts, Bodhi along with her younger brother Dalien.
She had a protective bond with her brother and would study together at Padawan Kesh, otherwise known as the Je’daii Academy.
She would then set out on a great journey together with her brother once she became a teeenager.
The two would first arrive at the Temple of Force Skills, Qigong Kesh where they would be taught by Master Ter’cay.
Her brother was unable to hear Ter’cey in the Force however, Brock herself was able to expand her own knowledge, learning suggestion, telepathy and control.

# Section 1

Once completing their studies as Qigong Kesh they would continue their journey to the Temple of Martial Arts, Stav Kesh.
Here they would learn from Master Tave the importance of breathing for fighting.
Through the training Brock tried her best to stop her brother fleeing the Force.
However, one training session would lead to Delian hurting his older sister from firing his blaster wildly.
Brock would be warned by Master Lha-Mi that her brother was becoming more unstable and dangerous.
The next temple would be Anil Kesh, the Temple of Science.
She would find her calling her, though would be separated from her brother.
Delian would kill a fellow Journeyman and flee, where Brock believed had died.

# Section 2

Having no choice, Brock continued the great journey and completed it without her brother.
She would end the journey at Mahara Kesh, where she had learned about using the Force the heal.
As a Je’daii Ranger she would be sent off by the council with a fellow Ranger to handle and conflict between the Dessian Mining company and their miners.
She would solve the problem by having both families allow one person of the family to be fostered by the other for a period of 6 months.

# Section 3

Brock would return to Tython, learning that her brother was alive and was leading the Stargazers.
He was attempting to activate a hypergate in the ruins of Old City using dark matter, which could obliterate the whole system.
She would chase her brother from Kalimar, to Nox, to Sunspot before finally chasing her brother into the Old City.
She tried to stop him by pushing childhood memories of them both and the horrors she had seen into his mind, however, Dalien only attacked her in rage instead.
With the Force she was able to stop the knife attacks though once Dalien lept towards the device she had no choice but to kill him.
After the fight, she sensed that she would now be out of balance, though believed she would not fall.
