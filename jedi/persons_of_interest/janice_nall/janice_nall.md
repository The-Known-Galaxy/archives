# Introduction
Janice Nall was the proprietor of Droids by Janice, a droid shop and workshop located on Taris prior to the planet’s near destruction following Darth Malak’s orbital fleet bombardment.
Nall possessed a wide range of droids including two utility droids, T3-H8 and T3-M4 as well as assault droids which were later confiscated during the Sith occupation and reassigned to guarding the Sith base.
Nall sold both utility droids to the amnestic Darth Revan who had previously crash landed on Taris following  the destruction of the Endar Spire, and later offered Revan a refund when T3-H8 short circuited and broke down.
Nall was also a qualified droid technician, building and programming T3-M4 for the Exchange, which was no small feat due to T3-M4’s technical advancement and slicing proficiency.
While her fate is unknown, it is presumed that Nall perished when Malak bombed the upper levels of Taris from orbit.
