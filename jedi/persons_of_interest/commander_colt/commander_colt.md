# Introduction
Genetically crafted on the Kaminoan homeworld, Colt was like any other clone during his time.
At some point along the way during his training and upbringing as a trooper, he was assigned to and promoted to the rank of Clone ARC Commander.
At the same time, he took command of the Rancor Battalion.
Though there are no direct reports of him spending any time in combat or his deployments, it is known that he returned to Kamino and had taken charge of the training of clone cadets, alongside El-Les and Bric.

# Section 1
During the assault on the Kaminoan cloning facility led by the Separatist forces’ General Grievous, Asajj Ventress and the droid forces, Commander Colt led Republic forces against the Separatists.
Though he and his troopers were able to overcome the forces of General Grievous, the same did not occur when confronted with the assassin, Asajj.
Cutting through Colt’s forces, she was able to lock him into a force choke - sending her saber square though his chest and thus ending Commander Colt’s relatively short life.
