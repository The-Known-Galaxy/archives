# Introduction

Syo Bakarn was a male human who was born in the Corellian sector, making him a native of Corellia.
Being born during a time of turmoil, the Galactic Republic would engage with the mighty Sith Order which led to the future Great Galaxy War.
He would have the title of “Jedi Master” under the Jedi Order itself and serve as a healer under the Republic.
Bakarn would be sent to Tython during the Treaty of Coruscant to become a member of the Jedi High Council.
Though Syo was unaware that his body was a host to another personality, the First Son of the Sith Emperor.
The Emperor of the Sith would create a group of strong-but-sneaky agents later known as the “Children of the Emperor”.
Their purpose was to hunt down any force-sensitives and bring them to their leader’s needs.
Like many Younglings, Bakarn was one of them and was stolen away from his unknown family on his homeworld.
He would go through a Sith Academy and do many dangerous rituals to be the first of the introduced within the ranks of the Children of the Emperor.
Syo would be infused with the strength of the Emperor, being bound to his will and mind.
This would make him and give him the title of the Emperor’s First Son.
He would be given back to parents like the other infants.
Eventually as he got older, he would forget about this memory and the Jedi would find him and bring him to their temple.
Bakarn would go through many training sessions and go from Padawan to Jedi Master in a few years.
As a Knight, he would study the ways of healing and become a Consular.
