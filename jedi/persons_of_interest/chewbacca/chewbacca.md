# Introduction

Chewbacca was a male Wookiee, also known as Chewie, and was born on the planet Kashyyyk in 200 BBY.
Chewbacca was best known for his piloting skills and being the co-pilot on Han Solo’s ship which was called the Millenium Falcon.
He was the son of Attichitcuk also known as “Itchy” for short.
Chewbacca was also the husband of Mallatobuck and the father of Lumpawaroo, his son.
The name Chewbacca was a name that carried the name of an ancient hero, the great Bacca, first commander of Kashyyyk, and was the inventor of a sacred sword called the Bacca’s Ceremonial Blade that was a mark of leadership among the Wookiees.
He spoke Shyriiwook, which was a language of the Wookiees, which includes loud growls and muttering.
As his name carried the name of the great Bacca, in the Battle of Kashyyyk during the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War, this supported his role as a leader among the Wookiees.
Chewbacca was a very wise Wookiee, a cultured being of strength, with long lasting loyalty towards Han Solo.

# Section 1

In 200 BBY, Chewbacca was born on the planet Kashyyyk.
During those beginning years, Wookiees hardly ever adventured outside Kashyyyk’s rich forests.
Unlike other Wookiees, Chewbacca wanted to adventure outside Kashyyyk, obsessed with exploration.
As he wanted to explore and adventure, he started with Kashyyyk’s vast forests in the Shadowlands, where he learned to survive.
In his first fifty years, he gained knowledge of the Wookiee culture and received wisdom from his father, Attichitcuk.
It was not that long until he could adventure outside the margins of his green homeworld.
In 150 BBY, when he was 50 years old, Chewbacca went to travel all over the galaxy in a rite of passage named “The Rising Path.” Throughout Chewbacca’s journey, he experienced many adventures across the galaxy where he took on a bandolier and a bowcaster as a discouragement to other beings who wanted to test his strength.
Despite how much he traveled around the world, he would never forget his homeworld Kashyyyk, where he would always try to go home to rest.

When he was younger, before he was 100 years old, Chewbacca was famous for his skills at crossing the wroshyr trees which were fairly tall, and also for how well he could use a hydrospanner.
A lot of the time, he repaired vehicles with his companions, including his cousin Dryanta.
In time, Chewbacca met his wife named Mallatobuck, but he did not know of the Wookiee’s feelings regarding him.
This was because Malla hid her true feelings towards him as she was a shy Wookiee and told herself to not show any respect when Chewbacca saved her from the Trandoshan slavers.
Time went by until Chewbacca’s cousin Jowdrll was friends with Malla, she helped Chewbacca and Malla create a bond between each other.
Their soon-to-be relationship hit a brick when a Wookiee named Tojjevvuk began to fight for Malla’s love.
Chewbacca was forced to duel Tojjevvuk for Mallatobuck’s affection, though Tojjevvuk cheated in the duel as he used his claws which was not allowed for a Wookiee.
Although, Chewbacca’s skills in crossing the tall wroshyr trees proved to be true, which led to Tojjevvuk’s defeat, and at the right time Chewie dropped Tojjevvuk to the Shadowlands where he died due to the vicious creatures of Kashyyyk.

Reaching adulthood, Chewie joined the Claatuvac Guild; a private organisation made of Wookiee scouts and navigators.
The Tree Vikkilynn, also known as the Claatuvac Guild’s headquarters in the Kashyyyk city of Kachirho, were in charge of drafting new hyperspace routes.
In 19 BBY, Chewbacca became one of the most trusted navigators in the guild.
As that was so, Chewbacca also fought beside the Jedi Grand Master Yoda throughout the Clone Wars, but failed.
He was doomed to slavery from the Galactic Empire.
In time he was rescued by the well known Han Solo, and Chewbacca swore a life-debt to Han which made him a partner throughout Solo’s smuggling adventures ever since.
As years went by, in 0 BBY, Han Solo and Chewbacca became a member of the Rebel Alliance and flew throughout the Battle of Yavin.
At the end of the battle, Chewbacca played a part in important triumphs in opposition to the Galactic Empire.
After the launch of the New Republic, Chewie became a guardian for Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo’s children, Anakin, Jaina and Jacen.

In 25 ABY, the beginning years of the Yuuzhan Vong War, was Chewbacca’s death where he sacrificed himself during the Destruction of Sernpidal to rescue Anakin Solo.
