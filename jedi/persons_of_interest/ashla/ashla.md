# Introduction

Ashla was a female Togruta, who was enrolled in the Jedi Academy during the final decade of the Galactic Republic.
Upon achieving the rank of Initiate, she was placed with the Bear Clan.
During her time as an Initiate in The Jedi Order, she would have received instruction from her Clan Leader, Jedi Grand Master Yoda.

# Section 1

Born on the planet Shili in the Shili system, her force sensitivity would begin to expose itself at an early age.
From there she was discovered by an undisclosed member of the Jedi Order and brought to Coruscant to start her training under The Jedi Order.
She was also present when Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi approached Master Yoda about the “missing planet” Kamino.

# Section 2

Although her fate after Operation Knightfall is unsure, her name does resurface during the Galactic Empire period.
However, it was actually former Jedi Padawan Ashoka Tano using Ashla’s name as a pseudonym to avoid detection from the Galactic Empire.
There is no further record of her name so it can be assumed that she was one of the many Jedi to perish during the assault on the Jedi Temple.
