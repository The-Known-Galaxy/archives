# Introduction
Kit Fisto, male of the Nautolan race, was a respected Jedi Master during the days of the Galactic Republic and a member of the Jedi High Council.
Born on the planet of Glee Anselm based within the Sabilon region, he was taken in and trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order.
Throughout his training, he learned the ways of Form I: Shii-Cho with a green-lightsaber.
After becoming a Jedi Knight, he then worked his way to becoming a Jedi Consular held inside the Council of Reconciliation.
In terms of his unique abilities, he was most known thanks to his Nautolan blood to sense emotion through the chemistry in one's body.
He was also known to be insanely advantaged when fighting in water where his lightsaber had been customized to work inside of water via it containing two crystals.

# Section 1
His time in the role of Jedi Consular led to Kit Fisto landing an important role alongside Jedi Master Luminara Unduli as Jedi Advisors of the Supreme Chancellor around 22BBY.
 Not only did he gain this role but at the time he would have now been a member of the Jedi High Council.
With his valuable skills required, Kit Fisto took part in the First Battle of Geonosis 22 BBY, where during this he would be quickly promoted to Jedi General near the end alongside many other Jedi Masters.



# Section 2
As part of the Geonosis Strike Team, containing 212 Jedi, Kit Fisto was one of the estimated 30 to have survived, having shown great ability, leadership, and confidence in battle.
He was even seen with a massive now iconic smile after causing a B2 Battle Droid to fall on top of another battle droid that had the head of a Protocol Droid, showing his ability to appreciate and enjoy the little things even in such a dire situation.
He showed fantastic adeptness in being an army leader, as once the clones of the Grand Army of the Republic arrived he quickly assumed leadership of some and rallied them into the proper beginning of the Clone Wars.



# Section 3
Throughout his time as Jedi General, Kit Fisto took part in many different operations and battles for the Grand Republic, often leading SCUBA clone troopers.
One of his most noticeable missions is his role in the Battle of Mon Calamari.
Assigned by Grand Master Yoda himself, Kit Fisto’s fantastic abilities in the huge amount of water that takes up most of the planet was why he was vital to this particular battle.
Fought in 22 BBY, the conflict stemmed from a rivalry between the races of the Quarrens and the Calamarians who both inhabited the planet of Dac.
The Quarrens had taken sides with the Separatists looking to gain main domain over the world, while Calamarians had reached out to the Grand Republic for assistance, once the Quarrens had reported to have attacked, Kit Fisto and his forces were immediately deployed out to Dac.
The Quarrens were equipped with droid sub-fighters and much other weaponry focused on underwater warfare, with their most deadly weapon being that of the crab cannon, powerful enough to destroy assault ships of the Republic even out in space.
Kit Fisto led his SCUBA troopers alongside support from the Calamarian warriors while often riding a keelkana underwater.
Fisto had an ability which could use the Force to create strong bubbles, which could damage the crab cannon and lead to the destruction.
Fisto caused the cannon to sink further into the ocean, after he dispatched the Quarrens' fire power, he began a series of raids on their output, which stole important information.
Alongside capturing their leaders.
By the end, he discovered the Quarrens had allied themselves to the Moappa who were aiding the Quarrens via telepathic communication.
After putting the Moappa to an end, Fisto helped the Mon Calamari learn how to approach a diplomatic solution.
The racial conflict had come close to an end thanks to Fisto’s efforts, however by the time of 21 BBY, due to more Separatists schemes.
Many Quarrens continued to work with the Separatists, they organised and executed a major assassination of the Mon Calamari’, Yos Kolina.
The peace between the two races was short-lived in this event.
 The Battle of Mon Cala came soon after which Fisto would again be involved in, however with far more help as the conflict was far larger.



# Section 4
Another highly notable event during Kit Fisto’s time in the Clone Wars was the hunt for a traitor in Tipoca City on the planet of Kamino, only a few months after the conclusion of the Battle of Geonosis.
Joined alongside Jedi Master Aayla Secura, the two were assigned a mission in Kamino, the home planet of the clone army to oversee the army’s training.
However, during their stay and visit they discovered multiple dead bodies of clones and proceeded to investigate by speaking to many Kaminoans in the cloning facility, considering it was only Kaminoans who worked in the facility it was a quick realization for Fisto that it was a Kaminoan traitor.
From inspecting the clones as well, they were able to analyse them and found them to have been injected with a nano-virus.
The two concluded that it was the work of the separatists and began to trace down the traitor, as they got closer and closer to finding the traitor they found themselves under siege and ambushed by a squadron of super battle droids.

Caught heavily off guard, Secura ended up falling into Kamino’s vast and terrifying ocean which Fisto quickly jumped into, to give her aid, he dived down and was able to begin helping her get back up to the surface, providing her with oxygen as they made their way back up.
As the two reached safe land again Secura was grabbed by the Kaminoan Kuma Nai, the traitor.
Kuma Nai tried to take Master Secura hostage, pointing an injector of the nano-virus at her, looking to try and demand a ship off the planet, however, Master Secura quickly broke free and injected the Kaminoan with the virus, bringing them to their demise.
Without this discovery and solution from the two Jedi Masters, it may have been very possible that the Grand Republic could have lost their ability to produce clones which would have heavily impacted the war against them.



# Section 5
The mission to Ord Cestus can be considered Kit Fisto’s biggest mission besides his partaking in many battles.
The Jedi Master was appointed the mission to destroy the current production of JK-13 droids, droids known to be ‘Jedi Killers’.
Both Kit Fisto and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, assisted by 4 clone commandos, an Alpha 98 ARC trooper and many recruits were teamed up to go to the planet of Ord Cestus and complete this mission.
The production of the drones themselves was not completely controlled by the Separatists but instead, they had hired the government of the planet to produce them, the Jedi looked to try and sway the government to sign for the Republic instead.
Kit Fisto and his strike force worked to create better soldiers by  training many recruits.
As a plan B measure, they had planned to overtake the government if needed and had also recruited a resistance group known as the Desert Wind.
Kenobi looked to go and persuade the five main controlling families of the government to sign the contract.
Fisto would take up the role of pretending to work under Darth Tyranus, once Jedi Master Count Dooku.
Kit Fisto altered his look and used a light whip as his weapon, assisted by the Desert Wind and the Alpha 98 trooper would purposely capture and then be defeated by Kenobi to win the families trust.
However, an actual turned-Jedi working under Tyranus, Asajj Ventress would expose the strike forces’ fake altercations with one another just before they could get the families to sign a contract.
Kit Fisto and Kenobi would instead have to take the more aggressive route, with their troops and Desert Wind, they besieged the production factories assisted by their troops and an acclamator-class assault ship.
During the siege the two Jedi go to meet up with a X’Ting gangster who had provided the strike force with weaponry, however, this meeting turned into an ambush by Ventress.
Kit Fisto and Kenobi had to fight multiple young X’Ting fighters unarmed.
Fisto was able to eventually get away and then confront Ventress, however during their duel, Fisto was unable to contain a defence when fighting Ventress’s aggressive two lightsaber style, not only that but she had learned how he fights while watching him fight the X’Ting.
He later came close to death, but was able to fall into a river from a dock.
He soon sensed Kenobi was in danger while duelling Ventress, he used the Force to split the dock which made both Ventress and Kenobi fall into the river, leading to Fisto passing out.
His action allowed Kenobi to meet Ventress in a stalemate as they both were not effective underwater, they were unable to use their sabers unlike Fisto.
Before Fisto could reawaken and take advantage of the water, Ventress used black ink to shroud the water and escape.
From there the Desert Wind was able to pressure the five families into signing the contract and with that, Kit Fisto and Obi-Wan had completed the mission.



# Section 6
Kit Fisto alone was a big factor in the first conclusion of the Mon Calamari and Quarren conflict, having won the Battle of Mon Calamari and helped to produce peace talks between the two races.
However, with the Separatists and Quarren’s planned Assassination of the Mon Calamari King Yos Kolina being a success, the peace talks quickly crumbled and the conflict restarted after Senator Padme Amidala was unable to solve and ease the tension.
She and her Jedi escort Anakin Skywalker called to Grand Master Yoda and his Deputy Mace Windu for possible reinforcements for the soon to be civil war, the two decided once again that Kit Fisto would be the best Jedi for the job, he arrived assisted by his SCUBA troops, as well as Commander Monnk and Anakin Skywalker’s Padawan Ahsoka Tano.
The Quarren eventually began their attack on Mon Cala, now fully backed by the Separatists and its droid army.
Fisto, as demonstrated many times, took charge of the water and swiftly helped in dispatching Quarren and droid forces alike.
Fisto then assisted in combating the secret weapon of the Separatists for this conflict, the Hydroid Medusas, powerful, large robotic jellyfish inspired weapons.
Fisto and the rest of the forces tried to concentrate all firepower on the robots however were then suddenly attacked on their other side by the Separatist droids.
As the Mon Calamari and Republic forces felt overwhelmed and had the need to retreat, Fisto bravely fought off many to give them space before eventually retreating himself.
The forces retreated to an underwater cave and lost communication with the rest of the Republic forces up on the surface.
Desperate to get back up to the surface, Fisto volunteered to create a distraction so they could do so.
Despite his efforts however the ship the forces had planned to use to escape backup had been destroyed and eventually the forces split into two, with Kit Fisto taking charge of one, alongside Ahsoka, the eventual new Mon Calamari King Lee-Char, Commander Monnk and, the remaining clones with him, with Senator Padme, Anakin and Captain Ackbar going into the second group.
The two groups spread out with Fisto deciding to settle in a cave and set up an outlook.
Eventually, after seeing his people captured, Lee Char tried to gain the droid army’s attention to show his people he was still living, however, was fired upon by an AQ Series Battle Droid which Kit Fisto quickly fended off.
Suddenly with Gungan warriors arriving to reinforce the Republic, Kit Fisto and his group began a full attack on the droid forces, when the Commander of the droid forces Riff Tamson tried to attack Lee-Char, Ahsoka was able to fend him off until Fisto took over the fight for her, he had his saber knocked off him but was able to continually fend Riff off with hand to hand combat.
Looking for his group to quickly get away, Separatist reinforcements began arriving, Fisto was captured but the others were spared the time to get away thanks to his efforts.
As a prisoner,  he met back up with Anakin and Padme who had also been captured.
Fisto and the others were tortured with eels which Fisto handled with relative ease, seemingly barely phased.
Eventually with Mon Calamari and Quarren forces finally having teamed up after seeing the cruelty of the Separatists they were able to drive the droid army away, which Kit Fisto and the rest helped do so after being freed.
Fisto within this very overwhelming battle played a crucial role in so many moments, with multiple displays of sacrifice and selflessness.
Having fended off the Separatists in multiple situations which stopped possibly the entire force from being captured which led to a hold out long enough for reinforcements to arrive in numbers and for Quarrens and the Mon Calamari to finally work together to win the battle and liberate their home world.



# Section 7
Kit Fisto’s life was surely full of wonder, adventure, tragedy and, prestige.
However, with the Jedi High Council eventually discovering the true identity of the Supreme Chancellor as the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious, Deputy Grand Master Jedi Mace Windu asked Fisto for assistance in confronting the Chancellor alongside Jedi Masters Kolar and Tiin.
Sidious eventually revealed his crimson blade in front of them and rushed at them with insane aggression with the use of Form VII: Juyo, cutting down both Kolar and Tiin in an instant.
Kit Fisto was able to survive the assault and fight alongside Mace Windu for a short while, but Sidious in the end would strike Fisto down, ending his phenomenal life.
He had lived with and had died with a smile, a figure of true kindness for many Jedi to use as an example.
