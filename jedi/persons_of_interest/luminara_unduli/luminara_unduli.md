# Introduction

Luminara Unduli was a Mirialan Jedi Master known among the highest regards of Mirialan Jedi in the history of the Order, with her accomplishments becoming an important stepping stone to her people, and the Order itself.
She would be born on Mirial, a cold and harsh world constantly oppressed by the Trade Federation.
Despite this, her luck would turn upon being discovered as Force Sensitive and would be taken by the Jedi to be trained and raised in the ways of the Force.

```
In the Coruscant Jedi Temple, she would receive training on the ways of the Force and would be noticeably proficient in the way of the lightsaber.
```

Her Mirialan roots would prove time and time again to be the determiner of the decisions based upon her and her decisions as well when she would be chosen as a Padawan by another Mirialan Jedi.
She would construct a green-bladed lightsaber and be powerful with the Force, eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Knight.

```
"Her lightsaber skills were impressive.
```

In battle, her movements were focused and precise, flowing from one to the other.
All Jedi are my brothers and sisters, but only with a few, like Luminara Unduli, do you intuitively mesh."
-Quinlan Vos

```
Adorning her traditional Mirialan robes and her patterned tattoos; a symbol of her constant physical disciplines would be her dominating trademark.
```

Her use of the lightsaber would also be noteworthy, her specialization lying on the use of Soresu with elegance.
She would take up the role of a Guardian within the Jedi Order in keeping with the role of an Ambassador, while also serving as an advisor to many politicians within the Galactic Senate and would be respected as a proper diplomat.

```
She would take a fellow Mirialan, Barriss Offee, as her Padawan continuing the tradition of Mirialan-taking-Mirialan within the Order.
```

With the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Unduli and Offee would serve in many of the conflicts, being orientated around the worlds where the conflict was most deafening and in chaos such as the crisis in Ilum, Nadiem, and Geonosis.
With the fall of her padawan to the Dark Side and the initiation of Order 66, she would be killed in the Battle of Kashyyyk in 19 BBY.
