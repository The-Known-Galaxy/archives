# Introduction

Clone Trooper 6922 (CT-6922 “Dogma) was a Clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic within the 501st Legion.
Dogma was nicknamed ‘Dogma’ due to his unwavering belief and trust of those appointed above him.
This caused him to follow orders to the end no matter what.
Around the time of 20 BBY, the 501st Legion, including Domga, was sent to Umbara to retake the planet.
Originally, the 501st was under the command of General Anakin Skywalker, but due to the request of the Jedi Council and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, he was recalled back to Coruscant.
This in turn, caused the Command to be transferred to General Pong Krell.
However, during their time there it was slowly realized that General Krell was giving orders to cause as many loss of life actions as possible.
Ranging from idiotic frontal assaults on an entrenched enemy to major friendly fire on the 212th.
After discovering the friendly fire incident of the 212th was ordered by General Krell, they decided to arrest the Jedi along with Dogma who continued to follow the General.
After the General exposed he did it on purpose to Dogma, the 501st released Dogma once he realized he was wrong to follow him blindly.
However, after word that their base would soon be overwhelmed they decided to execute General Krell, but when Captain Rex attempted to, Krell used the force to throw off his aim.
This was when Dogma stepped in, drawing one of Captain Rex’s pistols and shooting and killing the Jedi from behind.
After which, Dogma was arrested for killing a Jedi.
