# Introduction
Jar Jar Binks was a Male Otollan Gungan who lived during the time of the Clone Wars.
He held the role of Representative within the Galactic Senate.
He spoke Basic but had a very interesting accent.
He was a very clumsy person and got himself into a lot of trouble.
Even contributing to the fall of the Republic.
His father’s name was George R.
Binks.
	Jar Jar Binks was a very clumsy person and was known well for making mistakes.
His family tried to raise him to be a whaler, but his personality messed it up for him.
One time, he was told to hold the wheel steady while his father was trying to get a whale, but he let go and they crashed and ended up on an island, stranded.
He asked to go out and swim for help, and his father said yes because he hoped Jar Jar would get eaten, but George’s wife stopped him.
	Later, Jar Jar began working in Otoh Gunga.
He took different job paths - both good and bad.
He used to work as a street-side musician but was paid to stop the music.
Later, he joined a group of thieves and was given the job of distracting law enforcement while the other members robbed stores and other places.
After his life of crime, Binks began working for Boss Nass, not because he liked Jar Jar, but out of respect for his parents, and because of the request made by Captain Tarpals, who used to be the leader of the group of thieves.
	Jar Jar Binks made many mistakes while working for Boss Nass such as accidentally letting out the animals at the Otoh Gunga Zoo.
Later, Boss Nass gave Binks a job in the kitchen during a party.
However, unable to prevent himself from making mistakes, Binks exploded the kitchen which resulted in the bubble wall being cracked and water flooding the mansion.
Binks was later punished by receiving the Nocombackie Law, which banished him from Otoh Gunga and, upon re-entering, being killed.
