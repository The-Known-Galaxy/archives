# Introduction
The twins were brothers, both Jedi Knights.
The Twins were born on the planet Boranall, long before the Battle of Yavin.
The Jedi known as Shang-Troy Thanabo took the Twins as his Padawans, after their mother agreed to let them become Jedi Knights.
This meant that they had a potential of obtaining a brighter future due to their capabilities.

# Section 1
Shang-Troy Thanabo took both of the boys as apprentices so he could train them to grow strong in the Force.
The three traveled often.
They fought evil forces, protected innocents, but didn't forget to stay true to the way of the Jedi.
As they traveled, the boys came to regard Thanabo as a father.
During one of their trips, the younger brother fell in love with a woman he met on the way.
However, the older brother loved her just as much as his younger brother did.
It did not take long for the older brother to develop feelings of jealousy towards his younger brother.



# Section 2
Shang-Troy Thanabo tried his best to comfort the older brother, trying to prevent him turning to the Dark Side of the Force.
Despite Thanabo's efforts, the older brother tried to trick the woman into kissing him, using his identical appearances of his younger brother.
The woman quickly foiled the eldest attempt and reported it to her husband.
This filled the younger brother with jealousy and he quickly engaged his brother in a physical altercation.
Sensing that something was wrong in the Force, their former master Shang-Troy Thanabo arrived at the scene, but was not able to calm them down.
A stray lightsaber swing struck Thanabo, causing his death.
Following the death of Thanabo, the Twins' anger increased.
It reached a point at which even the woman they loved could not end the altercation.
At the end, the Twins were both sucked by their emotions that they destroyed the woman they loved and the planet they were fighting on.



# Section 3
Thousands of years after this amazing duel between two brothers, the duel still continued.
The anger they had fueled the fire of a star that was once the world of the woman they both loved.
This story is now told to new Knights to teach them the dangers of letting their emotions control their actions.
