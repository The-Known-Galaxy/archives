# Introduction
Hailing from the planet Shili, Ahsoka Tano was a Force-sensitive female Togruta during the Clone Wars.
Ahsoka would go on to become the Padawan of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker during the wars and would prove herself to be cocky, arrogant, and impulsive.
Still, she would show herself as worthy, intelligent, observant, and skilled in combat and using the Force.
Utilizing Form V, or Shein, she would prove capable of handling herself in many sticky situations against Sith and other hostiles she came across.

# Section 1
Jedi Master Plo-Koon found Ahsoka at the young age of three while on a mission to her home planet.
He would give her the option to go with him to Coruscant, where she would be trained in the Jedi ways, or to stay on Shili; Ahsoka would choose to go with the Jedi Master, even growing a close friendship and bond with him.

Ahsoka's strong Force sensitivity gave her the opportunity to live in the Palace of the Jedi.
This home would provide comfort, wisdom, and friendships that would last a lifetime.
During her time in the Jedi Academy, Ahsoka was placed in the Clawmouse Clan.
This clan would be a group of Initiates within the Order that would progress through the Academy together, improving as one while helping each other to graduate.
After Ahsoka's graduation, Jedi Grandmaster Yoda placed her under the supervision of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, with a personality similar to her own, being proficient in the Force despite his recklessness.



# Section 2
Although Anakin was Ahsoka's master, many others would mentor Ahsoka, providing insight and wisdom.
One of these mentors would be Jedi Master Tera Sinube, a slow yet methodical Jedi Master.
Master Sinube would be a great teacher to Ahsoka despite an antithetical attitude to Ahsoka.
Sinube would teach Ahsoka the value of patience and alternative means to reach one's goal.


During the Clone Wars, Ahsoka's impulsiveness and lack of awareness would cause her to lose her lightsaber.
Too afraid to consult Anakin Skywalker on her failures, she instead turned to Master Sinube, who agreed to help reclaim her lightsaber and redeem herself.
Ahsoka and Sinube's hunt led them to the underworld of Coruscant, a bottomless, dark pit of scavengers, murderers, and thieves.


Ahsoka and Sinube would eventually reclaim her once-lost lightsaber after learning lessons about patience and premeditation of one's actions.
Sinube taught Ahsoka that taking your time and being patient will have advantages as you are more observant and cautious than you would be acting impulsive or recklessly.



# Section 3
While initially an impulsive and overly confident padawan, Ahsoka would grow to become humble, mature, observant, and wise.
At times Ahsoka would even teach her master Anakin Skywalker the perks of patience.
She would often create nicknames for others, some degrading, some attempts at humor.
At first, her relationship with her master Anakin Skywalker would begin informally, and Ahsoka would refer to her master as "Skyguy," a name that would not last long.


After their bond grew and their relationship grew more formal, Ahsoka would begin calling Anakin "Master," as most Padawans were inclined to do.
In response to Ahsoka's original nickname, Anakin would call her "Snips" due to her aggressive and erratic personality.

Utilizing Shein, or Form 5, Ahsoka would be considerably talented for her age.
Deemed initially "rough" by Anakin, she would only improve with combat training.
Throughout her time as a Padawan, Ahsoka would face up against many hostiles.
Some hostiles include Asajj Ventress, General Grievous, Darth Maul, Cad Bane, and many others.

Along with her physical prowess, she also possessed remarkable skill with the Force.
Her connection to the Force allowed her to leap extremely high distances and pull down larger objects than normally possible for Jedi; Ahsoka also possessed a strong Force Sense.
This can be exemplified in situations such as when Jedi Master Plo-Koon was stranded in space and was presumed dead by other Jedi.
However, Ahsoka could sense Plo, leading to his rescue.



# Section 4
Like many Padawans during the Clone War Era, Ahsoka would never become a Knight.
However, unlike many Padawans, it would not be due to the enactment of Order 66.
During a mission on the planet Cato Neimoidia, there would be an explosion within the Jedi Temple.


Ahsoka and her Master, Anakin Skywalker, would be sent to investigate the attack and find whoever was responsible.
Ahsoka and Anakin eventually apprehended the suspect, Letta Turmond, discovering that she owned the nano-droids used in the explosion.

After Letta’s imprisonment, Ahsoka would visit her in prison, where Letta would go on to inform Ahsoka that the droids were given to her by a fellow Jedi.
However, before Letta could go on to reveal 
the name of said Jedi, she was murdered by a cloaked figure.
The figure would then run off, leaving Ahsoka with Letta; the clones would soon arrive at the cell with the immediate belief that Ahsoka had killed Letta.
Ahsoka was arrested after being the only viable suspect at the time of the crime.

After escaping her cell by using the Force to pick up a keycard left outside her cell, she was on the run.
She successfully avoided patrols of clones until she came across a large group of clones that had all been attacked by someone using her lightsaber.
As she picked up her lightsaber, clone Commander Fox would stumble across her and automatically assume her guilty.
He would then sound the alarms while Ahsoka would flee.

Commander Fox, as well as clone Captain Rex and Anakin Skywalker, would also give chase.
Ahsoka would eventually flee the prison compound, narrowly escaping many close encounters with clone troopers.
Forced into laying low, Ahsoka would contact Barris Offee, who insisted she would help by investigating the issue further.



# Section 5
Living in the dark underworld of Coruscant, Ahsoka would come across many individuals that she would have previously considered dangerous.
One of these individuals was a former Sith Apprentice, now turned Bounty Hunter, Asajj Ventress.
Ventress had decided to help Ahsoka because Ahsoka had previously helped to clear Ventress’ name.


To capture the escaped Padawan, the Jedi High Council sent Anakin Skywalker, Plo Koon, and a squad of clone troopers.
As they fled from the pursuing clones and Jedi, Tano utilized a public holo-terminal to contact Barriss Offee.
When she described the warehouse where Turmond obtained the nano-droids to Tano, Ventress agreed to accompany Tano there.
Before they could leave, a clone squad under Commander Wolffe confronted Tano and Ventress and demanded they surrender.
Tano and Ventress succeeded in disarming the clones so they could flee.
They came upon the warehouse and decided to part ways, with Ventress giving Tano her lightsaber.


After the two had separated, Ventress was attacked by a cloaked Dark Jedi.
The figure would defeat Ventress in battle and go on to steal both her lightsabers and clothes.
With this new disguise, the Dark Jedi would hunt down Ahsoka and attack her.
Ahsoka entered the battle confused and distraught as she believed that one of the few allies she had left was now attacking her; regardless, Ahsoka still defended herself.

The cloaked figure would draw out the fight within the warehouse.
Eventually, the Dark Jedi would ignite barrels of explosive gas.
This explosion would knock Ahsoka back and alert the Coruscant Security Force, who was again in pursuit.
Now knocked out, Ahsoka would be left helpless as Commander Wolffe and the surrounding troopers finally caught up to her.
The clone troopers would find Ahsoka lying surrounded by crates of Nano-Droids, which had further proved her guilt for the crime.



# Section 6
Ahsoka was arrested for the bombing of the Jedi Temple and was due to be trialed under the eyes of the Jedi High Council; however, due to the severity of her supposed actions, Ahsoka would be expelled from the Jedi Order and trialed under the eyes of the Galactic Republic instead.
In her defense stood Senator Padme Amidala, with Wilhuff Tarkin representing the prosecutors.

The trial was not going well; all evidence provided had pointed directly toward Ahsoka.
It was clear to Ahsoka and many in attendance that whether or not she was guilty, she would be trialed as such.
However, before the verdict was announced, her former master, Anakin Skywalker, had burst into the trial with new profound evidence.
Anakin had proven Ahsoka's innocence by discovering the true culprit, Barriss Offee.



# Section 7
Confused and shocked once more that an ally had turned against her, Ahsoka was both relieved and sad to hear this.
Considering her new innocent verdict, the High Council offered to reinstate her in the Order as a Padawan.
Ahsoka declined this offer because she felt her trust had been broken or perhaps never there.
She believed she could not continue to live and support an Order that did not trust her.

As she left the Temple on Coruscant, Ahsoka was approached by her former Master, Anakin.
He would try his very best to convince Ahsoka to rejoin the Order, and she instead refused and began a new journey.
