# Introduction

Admiral Trench was an Admiral of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
He is of the Harch species, native to the planet Secundus Ando.
The Harch species is a spider-like species, having 6 arms with 2 legs.
Trench was born over 200 years before the start of the Clone Wars and died at the hands of Anakin Skywalker in 19 BBY.

# Section 1

In his early life, Trench saw action in a number of battles, the most of which included cruiser-to-cruiser combat.
Trench rose through the ranks of a corporate fleet that blockaded the planet Malastare.
Trench was able to defend his lines against a Republic fleet headed by Wullf Yularen dispatched to break the blockade, breaking their ships apart in the process.
Trench was defeated by a Jedi-led team led by Master Kep-She, who vaporized his flagship and appeared to kill him in the process.
Trench, on the other hand, was able to survive the explosions thanks to his species' robust nature.

# Section 2

Trench became a more feared and more respected Admiral during the Clone Wars, where he made a reputation for himself as military leader.
Successfully leading the Separatists into multiple victories, mostly defensive.
Trench mastered holding blockades, which he was seen doing mostly in his career.
This was put to an end with his defeat at the Battle of Christophsis, where Anakin Skywalker was able to outsmart him and use his own torpedoes against him.
The explosion of his ship, the Invincible, had put an end to his life; or so they thought.

# Section 3

About 2 years later Trench re-appeared at the Battle of Ringo Vinda.
He returned as a Cyborg, having lost all 3 of his left arms, an eye and a large part of his skull, maybe even his brain.
At the battle, Trench was in control of the space station of Ringo Vinda, as the Republic tried to push him out.
Anakin Skywalker and the sisters Tiplar and Tiplee were representing the Republic Forces along with many Clone Troopers.
While Trench was watching as the battle was going on, he saw something very strange.
He saw a Clone Trooper, Tup, walking up to his Jedi General and execute her.
This shocking development caused the Republic to fall back holding off the offense.
Trench, wondering what might have happened, contacted Count Dooku, who told him to retrieve the Clone Trooper in question.
Trench succeeded in capturing the Trooper, but eventually lost him after a stealth operation led by Skywalker.

# Section 4

Trench is seen again in 19 BBY leading an offensive movement above Anaxes.
Anaxes is one of the Republic’s key ship manufacturers, meaning it's very important to hold the planet.
The Admiral got the shipyard's production to a stop, which led to the republic deploying a lot of Clone Troopers, including the Bad Batch.
Trench was winning on all fronts and it wouldn’t take long for him to take the rest of the planet.
This was because he had a prisoner of war in his custody, the long thought dead Clone Trooper Echo, or CT-1409.
He was able to cybernetically access Echo’s mind, which allowed him to see all the Republic’s war strategies and create an algorithm that could predict new strategies before they were even made.
After the Republic found out about this, they freed Echo and used him against Trench, which he fell for.
This eventually led to him dying at the hands of Anakin Skywalker.
This marked the end of the life of one of the Republic’s greatest foe’s from even before the start of the Clone Wars.
