# Introduction

A male Force-sensitive Jedi that goes by the name of Grogu was born on Coruscant in 41 BBY and raised in the Jedi Temple.
Grogu belonged to the same species that Grand Master Yoda and Jedi Master Yaddle descended from.

# Section 1

Not long after, he had to flee the Jedi Temple and eventually ended up at a hideout that was run by Nikto mercenaries on the planet Arvala-7.
At the age of fifty years old, he was still considered to be an infant and was sought out by Moff Gideon, who hired a Mandalorian bounty hunter, Din Djarin, to retrieve him.
However, Djarin refused to leave Grogu with the Imperials and aided in his rescue.
After hiding out, Djarin decided to travel to Nevarro to fend off some of the Imperials, to help keep Grogu safe.
During that time, Grogu became a Mandalorian foundling and a member of Djarin’s clan.
This brought forth Djarin’s new mission to bring Grogu back safely to the Jedi.

# Section 2

Both Djarin and Grogu traveled across the galaxy searching for the remaining Jedi.
Former Jedi Ahsoka Tano advised Djarin to take Grogu to Tython, where he could better reach out to the Force.
This was so he would be able to find other people of his kind.
However, Grogu was captured by the Moff’s forces and Djarin ended up leading a mission to rescue him.
The mission was overall a success except for Djarin having to remove his helmet and breaking his creed as a Mandalorian.
He sacrificed his dignity and name to get the coordinates of the Moff’s ship.
He then contacted Gideon and notified him of their eventual arrival to recover Grogu.

# Section 3

Along with Fett, Shand, and Dune captured and took over an Imperial Shuttle to board Gideon’s ship and took Dr.
Pershing as a prisoner.
Bo-Katan Kryze and Koska Reeves had decided to join this mission so that Bo could take the Darksaber from Gideon amidst all the chaos.
Fett had successfully boarded the ship allowing Djarin to find Grogu within the brig of the ship.
The Moff let Djarin approach since it appeared that he had all the resources he needed from the young child.
Not long after Gideon made the first move and tried to strike Djarin with his Darksaber as Djarin was proceeding to pick up and take Grogu.
Despite the Moff’s efforts, Djarin bested him in combat using his beskar staff.

# Section 4

Djarin took both Gideon and Grogu to the bridge of the ship where they met up with the others.
Once they reached the bridge, the ship had been boarded by dark troopers in an effort to hold them off at the bridge.
Gideon later informed Djarin that the dark troopers would only spare himself and Grogu.
However, amidst all the fighting, a mysterious X-wing starfighter landed right outside of the blast doors where the troopers were.
A robed man exited the x-wing and defeated all the dark troopers as he made his way to the bridge.
Djarin started to recognize that the man was none other than Luke Skywalker.

# Section 4

After a long and treacherous journey for both Djarin and Grogu, they decided that it would be best if Grogu returned to the Temple with Luke.
A bit of time passed and they all bid their farewells to Grogu alongside Djarin taking off his helmet and revealing his face to Grogu with a smile.
Grogu was hesitant at first, but then saw his astromech droid friend R2-D2 and was happy to see the droid.
He was then picked up by Luke Skywalker and taken back to the Jedi Temple where he would be trained in the ways of the Force.
