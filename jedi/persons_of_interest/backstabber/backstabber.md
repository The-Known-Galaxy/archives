# Introduction
Backstabber was the name given to a human Tie Fighter pilot that served as the Imperial Executor and legendary Sith Lord’s, Darth Vader, wingman.
Backstabber was a skilled pilot and was a part of the Black Squadron.
During the Battle of Yavin, Vader instructed Backstabber and his colleague, Mithel, to serve as his wingmen when they attacked the Rebel forces' entourage trying to destroy the Death Star.
