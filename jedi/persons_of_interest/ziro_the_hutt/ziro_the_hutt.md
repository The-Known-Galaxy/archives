# Introduction
Ziro Desilijic Tiure was born on the planet Sleheyron.
The exact location and date were unknown.
His parents were Mama and Papa, and he had two brothers.
They were Ebor the Hutt and the father of Jabba, Zorba Desilijic Tiure.
Not long after becoming an adult, Ziro left the Hutt Space and went to Coruscant, where he established his club.
That is where he gained his criminal nickname, Ziro the Hutt, and eventually became the Master of the Hutt Clan, controlling 7-star systems.
Ziro was a 12 feet tall and 10 feet long Hutt male with purple skin color and yellow tattoos.
He also had a son named Hiro.

# Section 1
During the Clone Wars, Ziro conspired with the Separatists to bring Jabba into conflict with the Republic and allow the Separatists to travel on his nephew’s hyperspace paths.
His actions were motivated, as he later admitted, by threats from Count Dooku.
His participation in the conspiracy was to kidnap Rotta and take him to the monastery on the Teth.
However, this plan failed as the Jedi managed to rescue Jabba’s son.
When Jabba was betrayed by Dooku, he severed contact with the Jedi and the Chancellor.

To resume negotiations, Senator Amidala went to Ziro’s headquarters to ask him to talk with his nephew and convince him to join the Republic.
To cover up his conspiracy, Ziro refused to speak any further.
Ziro captured Senator Amidala and tried to execute her, but she was rescued by a clone unit under Commander Fox.
Then they arrested Ziro for treason against the Republic.
In order to save himself, Ziro spoke with Jabba about the Separatist Conspiracy and made Jabba open his territory to the Republic.

Ziro spent many months in prison, but as a valuable figure, Dooku organized his breakout.
The operation was conducted by bounty hunter Cad Bane.



# Section 2
Ziro was imprisoned by the Council of Five Families after arriving at Nal Hutta.
He was freed by Sy Snootles, who pretended to be Hutt’s mistress.
He took her to his father’s grave.
To get to the crypt, you had to know the password, which Ziro knew.
After entering the crypt, Sy, who was working for Gardulla and the other Hutts, killed him.
Cad Bane, who was looking for him, as well as the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Quinlan Vos, were unsuccessful in their mission to capture Ziro.
