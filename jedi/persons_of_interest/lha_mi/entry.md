# Introduction

Lha-Mi was a male member of the Talid species.
Typical of a Talid, he followed a nomadic life and would rather negotiate to find common ground, rather than start quarrels.
Growing up in the Early Hyperspace Age, he trained himself in the ways of the Force by being a member of the Order of Dai Bendu, which sought to understand the Force and midi-chlorians.
Later, Lha-Mi and other Bendu monks brought Force-Sensitive organisations together on Tython.
This contributed to the formation of the Je'daii Order, which sought to utilise the Balance in the Force to rid the galaxy of chaos and evil.
Lha-Mi became one of the nine founding Temple Masters of the Je'daii Order, overseeing Stav Kesh, the Temple of Martial Arts.
To help him with this duty, he had an assistant by the name of Je'daii Master Tave.
As a Temple Master, he was expected to partake in meetings of the Je'daii Masters' Council via holocommunication at Akar Kesh, the Temple of Balance.
By 25,793 BBY, he saw and trained many Je'daii Journeyers, including but not exclusive to Sek'nos Rath, Shae Koda and Lanoree Brock.
This increased wisdom allowed him to warn others about hidden darkness within a Je'daii, something he would use to warn Lanoree of her brother.
Not much is known of Master Lha-Mi after these events.
