# Introduction

T'ra Saa was a female Jedi Master of the Jedi Order, serving during the height of the Galactic Republic and its darkest hours before disbandment.
Being a member of the sturdy and long-enduring Neti species, T'ra Saa saw the great cataclysm known as the Great Jedi Purge during the Galactic Empire's rise under Sheev Palpatine.
Breaking from the Jedi Code in the matter of principle, the great master had fallen in love with Jedi Master Tholme, the Watchman of the Kiffu sector.
Serving as Watchman after the resignation of Master Tholme, Saa participated in defeating the Anzati uprising on Kiffex.
Participating in the Battle of Geonosis, she was one of the few surviving Jedi from the original strike team sent to rescue Obi-wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Padme Amidala.

Later assigned to the investigation of Confederacy piracy on Republic ships near the Corellian Trade Spine,  she had a perilous streak with the loss of a Senator to the bounty hunter Aurra Sing.
While participating in the Battle of Null, Saa participated as a Jedi Healer who was later targetted by the bounty hunter guild known as the Crimson Nova.
Defending the injured, she had utilized the force for pulling down trees to form a great barricade against the incoming flames.
Facing substantial injury, she was confined to a bacta chamber for the remaining duration of the campaign.
After returning to Coruscant, she assisted with recovering the fractured mind of Master Depa Billaba after falling to the dark side on a mission to Haruun Kal.
During the Great Purge, Master Saa, Tholme, and Khaleen Hentz fled from Nar Shaddaa to Kashyyyk.

Eventually, Master Tholme passed, with Saa beginning to take root at his funeral site on Anzat.
Under the formation of the New Jedi Order, Saa made a return, this time residing on the Jedi High Council with Master K'Kruhk and Tili Qua.
During this time, she witnessed the Fel dynasty's requests for the support of the Jedi after the Massacre at Ossus.
During a later battle at the hidden temple on Taivas, Master Saa gave her life to redirect the energy of the temple's crumbling reactor complex at the enemy fleet, allowing the Jedi to escape.
