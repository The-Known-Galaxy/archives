# Introduction

The legend of Shoaneb Culu is well documented considering her immense feats of greatness, and presence across a variety of perilous battles.
She should be considered as a role model to all Jedi who read this article, whether you’re interested in her powerful connection to the Force or her heroic dedication to her people.

Shoaneb Culu was a female Miraluka, who closely resembled the human species but had a higher likelihood of being force sensitive and were essentially blind.
She had embarked on a journey from Alpheridies, her homeworld, to find a Jedi willing to train her.
This was unusual, as she was not sought out by the Jedi as it usually occurs.
Culu’s goal was noble, she aimed to create a Jedi academy on Alpheridies so that her people did not have to travel so far if they wished to become Jedi.

Her goal was completed when finding a Jedi Master named Vodo-Siosk Baas on Ossus.
The Miraluka quickly completed her training and was so talented that she was chosen to act as reinforcements for Qel-Droma on Onderon.

Furthermore, her feats during the Naddist Revolt classified her as a worthy Jedi.
She also learned to ride war beasts, a rare skill.
Even more notably, the Jedi was part of the 10,000 Jedi strong assembly conducted on Deneba to address the growing concerns of the dark side.
The Jedi fought bravely against the Krath during the Great Sith War and at this point in her journey had a very similar road to that of Anakin Skywalker.

She had mastered the S-100 Stinger-class starfighter and wasa brilliant pilot utilising these skills in many space conflicts.
Her brethren called her Jedi-Three.
Sadly, her demise came painfully as Kemplex IX against a Krath sorceress Aleema Keto who destroyed a star in the Cron Drift.
The debris laid waste to Shoaneb Culu, Jedi Qrrrl Toq and Dace Diath.

Despite her parents frowning upon the Jedi Order, she embarked on her quest aiming to create a Jedi Praxeum on Alpheridies at some point.
Her quest was noble, as the journey was truly far for any Miraluka making it a dangerous one by anyone's standards.

Being used to the safe confines of her homeworld, anything beyond it was completely new to her.
The unknown was much harder to traverse over than she had anticipated and she struggled biologically due to her surroundings being solely made of the Force.
She was blind, like most of her species and thus she used the vibrations given off by different objects to maneuver around.
This became very difficult as the environments became more and more unfamiliar.
It however, taught her to be able to sense her surroundings in seconds after having trained it for so long during a tiring journey.

# Section 3

Shoaneb’s journey lasted a year ending at the great Library of Ossus which the Force had attracted her to.
There she discovered Master Vodo-Siosk Baas who took some convincing before he agreed to take her on.

Shoaneb was steadfast, intelligent and curious allowing her to easily navigate the many Jedi texts and becoming a thorough academic.
Unfortunately, she often rained hundreds of questions down on Vodo who misinterpreted this curiosity as a lust for power.
This misunderstanding was cleared up when Culu expressed her noble desire for her homeworld to which Master Baas relieved, taught her all he knew.

This academic talent was coupled with hardship however, as despite being ahead of her peers academically, she fell behind when it came to Force technique.
For months, her training stagnated and Culu began to fear that her dream was just that, a dream.

These concerns gave Culu depression but after a few private seminars with Master Baas she developed a better, more positive perception and understanding of the Force.
She decided not to dwell on these careless concerns, and despite having trouble with constructing her lightsaber and other areas, Culu pushed on relentlessly.

# Section 4

Shoaneb’s perseverance and calm allowed her to pursue more practice in her Force training eventually leading to the Freedon Nadd Uprising that she chose to participate in.
Baas did not believe she was ready (Another similarity with Anakin Skywalker) Instead of becoming frustrated, she calmly stated that Baas was right in his concern but she did not seek glory, only that the Force had attracted her to this planet.
Culu could not deny this feeling, as it had always been right.
Baas, knowing he had misjudged his apprentice, allowed her to go.

The mission began with Culu joining the assembly of Qrrrl Toq, Dace Diath, Kith Karrk and Nomi Sunrider, an incredibly effective taskforce.

# Section 5

The task force was sent to aid Qel-Droma, who had victoriously beaten Queen Amanoa and other sith spirits.
Qel-Droma and his task force had however been ambushed by a new Sith cult called the Naddists during a burial ceremony.
This left the task force in ruins, with Master Aca Jeth being subjected to torture, and the others including Qel-Droma scattered across the battlefield.

Culu’s task force of (5) Jedi arrived in the city of Iziz, believing Qel-Droma to be there, but later discovering he was actually held captive in Oron Kira’s fortress.
The (5) Jedi had to obliterate an army of Dark Side Adepts using Force shields and other techniques as they were heavily outnumbered.
They successfully won, and defeated King Ommin allowing Qel-Droma and his comrades to be freed.

The Sith’s remains including the Queen and others were sealed on the moon of Dxun in an interring ceremony that would prevent their spirits from wreaking havoc.
Culu had shown immense talent in dueling during the battles fought on this planet, and began speeding ahead of her peers in terms of the Force, and dueling ability.
She was a prodigy.

# Section 6

Jedi Knight Culu and her companions were given some rest before being sent into a devastating conflict.
The Tetan Royals, who had learned Sith magic from King Ommin, named Aleema and Sata lKeto and orchestrated a coup in the Empress Teta system.
Their power had begun spreading across that sector, and thus this “Krath Cult” posed a threat to the Republic.

The Republic, after being informed of the danger by Shoaneb Culu, released an armada of Jedi and Republic fleets to engage the Teta system.
The battle was heroic and ferocious but the Tetan Royals created illusions that made their Krath forces use suicide bombing against the Republic fleet.
The Republic alongside many Jedi were absolutely obliterated.
Culu managed to survive the attack on Koros Major, but was among very few.
This devastating defeat allowed the Krath to continue to invade Republic space.
Thus, in response, the 10,000 Jedi assembly was organised on Deneba.
A momentous collection of Masters and Knights alike were informed by Qel-Droma of a plan to infiltrate the Krath and destroy the cult internally.

Shoaneb, accompanied by many oher Jedi, argued against this plan.
Whilst this debate occurred, once again, the Krath ambushed the Jedi with a massive army of war droids.
Although the Jedi won, it wasn’t without cost.
Master Jeth had been killed and Qel-Droma used this death as justification to accept the infiltration plan.

# Section 7

Qel-Droma was amongst the volunteers who executed the plan, and he became a Sith high rank very quickly.
However, after having no contact with him for months, the famous Nomi Sunrider was sent to find him.
She was unsuccessful, and thus Jedi leaders decided to forcefully take him back.
They unleashed an army of warships, Jedi and starfighters upon the Krath on Cinnagar.
Their assault was successful and Jedi-Three presented her uncanny flight abilities, destroying many anti-aircraft guns.
Despite this victory, Qel-Droma, when found and confronted, refused to join back with the Jedi.

# Section 8

The Jedi in this failure retreated back to Ossus to discuss their next move.
While this occurred, newly proclaimed Sith Lord Qel-Droma led a devastating attack on the Republic capital in Coruscant.
Culu and Dace Diath had to fight their once inspiring friend face-to-face.
They managed to defeat the Krath, and Qel-Droma was ironically betrayed by his own SIth and abandoned to fight Nomi Sunrider, Master Baas, Culu and others.

Their immense combined power imprisoned Qel-Droma, but this was short-lived as his Sith Master Exar Kun recaptured him later.
In this conflict, Master Vodo-Siosk Baas was also sadly killed.

Qel-Droma seeking revenge for the betrayal led an assault on Kemplex IX against Keto, the commanding Sith at the time.
Keto was unaware this assault was intended for him, since he was part of the invading fleet.
Qel-Droma knew the assault on Kemplex IX would make a supernova explode, hoping it would kill Keto.

The Jedi were made aware of this plot, and the surviving trio of the task force, Culu, Dace Diath, and Qrrrl Toq volunteered to respond to the distress signals.

# Section 9

The Jedi forces were being eroded as the war dragged on.
Exar Kun’s forces had caused immense casualties.
During a gathering on Ossus, Master Thon expressed that the Kemplex IX distress signals were not to be dealt with since he believed it to be a luring tactic or something else altogether.

The Sith only needed Ossus, they had nothing in the Kemplex IX sector.
However, the task force had already begun investigating the Kemplex IX armada led by Keto.
Culu sensed a great disturbance and before she could react, Keto’s fleet fired on the Cron Cluster cores which activated a supernova that incinerated her, and her famous trio comrades instantly.

A great, and powerful hero, ended in a horrible demise.
She failed to achieve her hopes of creating a Jedi Academy on her homeworld but left a legacy of footprints too large to ever be filled by anyone else.

# Section 10

Shoaneb Culu had prominent brown hair, fair skin and was a generally curious individual.
She became very knowledgeable and focused intensely on her training across the board.
She was kind, dedicated and loving towards the people of her homeworld.

She grew depressed as her training fell behind her peers, but eventually Culu overcame the weaknesses and learned to trust the Force.
From the beginning, she knew Qel-Droma’s mission was a terrible idea, but it did not stop him.

Shoaneb Culu had no eyes, but relied exclusively on the Force.
She rose through the Jedi ranks becoming a prodigy in dueling as a Jedi Knight.
Her Force abilities were uncanny and all of these factors helped her in her battles on Onderon and the SIth War.

Culu was gifted in aerial and space combat, specialising with the S-100 Stinger-Class making her formidable on Koros Major.

Overall, she was a brilliant and talented woman who might’ve been one of the greatest Jedi who had ever lived had she not met an unfortunate demise so young.
