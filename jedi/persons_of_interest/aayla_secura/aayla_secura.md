# Introduction

Aayla Secura, known as Aaylas’ecura to her people, was a Twi’lek Jedi Master born on Ryloth in the year 48 BBY.
She is recognised as the most famous Twi’lek Jedi to have ever served in the Order, with her accomplishments ranging primarily towards the Clone Wars and her incredible feats in the conflict.

"This girl—Aayla—she called me through the Force.
She helped calm me in battle with the wampa.
Could she be…"
"A Jedi?
Perhaps." - Quinlan Vos & Tholme.

She first served as a Padawan under the apprenticeship and tutelage of Quinlan Vos, who taught Secura for sometime until she also came into contact with Tholme, Quinlan’s own master.
Secura and Vos both had their own conflicts with the Dark Side but through all this, she would attain knighthood and persevere through the hardships.
As she was promoted to Jedi Knight, Secura would be rapidly involved in the Clone Wars and its spark, and was one of many Jedi to serve in the First Battle of Geonosis.

Serving in various campaigns, she survived the battles of Hypori and Kamino with swift recognition by the Jedi High Council, which would earn her the rank of Jedi Master just before the beginning of the conflict.
As Master, she would lead the Republic forces in Quell, was valuable in the defense of the Kamino facilities against the Separatist armada, and later on at Maridun.
Her martial prowess and leadership would all be for naught by the time of Order 66, where she would be among the first victims at the hands of her once-loyal clone troopers.

Master Aayla Secura would be remembered by the Twi’lek people and the worlds of where she served to defend or liberate, her legends passed on by generation upon generation.
With such importance do these stories give light to these cultures she had now impacted, and would be inscribed within forever more.
