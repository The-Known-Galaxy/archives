# Introduction
Arren Kae was a female Jedi Master of unknown species that has been known for her part in training the once Jedi and later Dark Lord of the Sith, Revan.
She was one of the Masters Revan held during his time as a Padawan and was one of the Jedi blamed for the Jedi Schism during the Mandalorian Wars and the following Civil War.
Information from Jedi Master 	Kreia suggests Kae has a secret love and child for really a decade.
This was in violation of the rules at that time which stated Jedi should not have children.
Due to this Arren Kae was exiled when the infractions were found out.
The Child’s father was Senator and General Yusanis of Echani, both a famed and a powerful warrior.
Upon exile Revan welcomed her into the Revanchists where she would fight the Mandalorians alongside him.
Kae was assumed to have died during the wars at Malachor V, however, no body was ever found and recovered.
Yusanis would be slain by Revan in the Jedi Civil War, while her child became Meetra Surik’s disciple in her mother’s robes.
