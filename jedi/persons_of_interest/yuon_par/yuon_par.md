# Introduction
Yuon Par was born a Force-sensitive human.
From a very young age, Par found herself training within the Jedi Order.
She went on a discovery mission to Malachor III along with other students; however, they ran into Terrak Morrhage who put a spell on them.
Although they left one of Par’s friends behind, they were able to escape.
At the conclusion of the Great Galactic War, Par ascended to the rank of Jedi Master.

# Section 1
Par was a Jedi Consular who searched for archaic artifacts relating to the Order.
She was the individual that found and recovered the Gharnus Texts along with a holocron that was created by Odan-Urr, a Jedi Master.
However, Par also had great diplomatic abilities which she demonstrated by soothing disputes between the Gamorreans.
These skills also allowed her to become a bloodsister to the Kaleesh chieftain.
Par also taught Initiates a compository class on the history of the Order after they were forced to relocate to the planet of Tython.



# Section 2
During a meeting with her Padawan, Par informed her apprentice about four hologram projectors that were discovered that were created by the founding Masters of the Order.
Unfortunately, they were unobtainable due to Flesh Raiders that began rampaging through the area.
Because of this, she sent her apprentice to obtain them.
The Padawan returned with three out of the four projectors as the fourth one had been stolen.
After she had claimed her student as a Jedi in front of the High Council, she collapsed.
She was transported to a medical facility on Coruscant where she was found muttering about a darkness that would soon come and guide her to the Dark side.
Her Padawan sought out a cure for his Master and went to search for the Noetikons.
After obtaining them, he performed a shielding ritual which cured her.
He also cured many other Masters with the same illness; this act of bravery earned him the title of “Barsen’thor”.
