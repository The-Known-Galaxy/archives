# Introduction

Serra Keto was a female Jedi Knight who served the Jedi in the upcoming years before the Great Jedi Purge.
She was the Padawan of the renowned Jedi Battlemaster Cin Drallig and was considered his prized pupil.
Like her master, Keto was famous for her talents as a lightsaber wielder and was a selfless Jedi who was willing to sacrifice herself on several occasions.
She dueled with dual lightsabers.
During her time as a Jedi, Keto participated in the devastating war known as the Clone Wars.
She served as a Jedi General during her time and, at one point, fought alongside the legendary Anakin Skywalker.
Sadly, like most Jedi of her time, she perished during the raid on the temple at the hands of Darth Vader.
She tried to prevent Vader from killing any other Jedi by dueling him in the data room located in the tower of First Knowledge, but not even she was successful.
She proved a worthy adversary for Vader due to her skills in lightsaber combat; she held her ground, taunting him in the hope that he would make a fatal mistake.
However, Vader used the Force to crush her with a pillar, ending her life.
