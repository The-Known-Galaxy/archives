# Introduction
Born in 41 BBY on the planet Ganthel, was Rae Sloane: A naval officer that swore unwavering loyalty to the Galactic Empire and was steadfast, as well as efficient, in her duties throughout her time of service.
Rae Sloane made several great contributions for the Galactic Empire against the Republic.
Most notably, the Empire’s survival from the repercussions they suffered after the Battle of Endor.
She was known as a fierce and domineering officer among her peers, and it’d be no surprise to find that she steadily climbed her way up to Grand Admiral of the Imperial Navy.
Rae Sloane’s  utmost dedication was due to an incident that had happened to her within her home world.
Sloane encountered a frightful experience with one of the many criminal gangs and barely escaped by the sheer luck of a droid that stepped in to help.
In the future, when the Empire contributed to the removal of these groups, Sloane deduced that the Empire was a force of greater good rather than evil.

# Section 1
As aforementioned, Rae Sloane was essential in the survival of what remained of her subordinates after the Empire’s loss in the Battle of Endor.
Throughout the battle, she kept calm and commanded strategically good moves to her fleet, implementing the lessons and strategies she learnt from her higher-ups.
One instance was when she insisted on letting the rebel forces exhaust themselves in the fight and be destroyed by the second Death Star, successfully reserving manpower.
Sloane was also capable of thinking on her feet, ordering her crew with ease against the adversaries they faced.
Rather than impulsively sending soldiers to their deaths in a counterattack that was doomed to fail, she rounded up the remaining survivors at the Imperial Star Destroyer and ordered them to withdraw in order to live to fight another day.



# Section 2
During Sloane’s time as an officer of the Galactic Empire, she had gotten a grasp of fighting with a blaster and learnt martial arts as a means of being fully capable of defending herself against opponents as well as being capable of killing her enemies.
Her quick thinking also allowed her to escape near-death situations several times and was independent enough to know how to pilot a ship, making her even more difficult to apprehend.
Rae Sloane’s experience as a leader would have let her be able to read the nature of the people she met through the course of her time.
Such skill was essential for her survival in order to differentiate between a friend or foe.
