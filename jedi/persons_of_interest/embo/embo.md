# Introduction
Embo was a Kyuzo bounty hunter from the planet of Phatrong during the Clone Wars.
He wore a large round hat and wielded a bowcaster.
He was hired to be a part of a group of bounty hunters alongside some farmers from Felucia.
The group was tasked with protecting the villagers of Felucia and their nysillin harvest.

# Section 1
While out doing one of his many jobs he and his team ran into Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano.
They all journeyed together in search of a way to protect the farmers and their crops.
Skywalker showed the farmers how to use their tools as weapons while Embo watched from a distance.
Later, Sugi spotted an enemy scout up on a nearby ridge; she sent Embo to take care of him.
He got close to the enemy’s speeder before they arrived and destroyed it with a shot from his bowcaster.
They had multiple encounters but in the end, Embo was the victor.
Skywalker praised Embo for how he handled taking down the enemy.
With the scout having been taken out, the group knew that the pirate’s leader, Ohnaka, would not wait much longer to attack.

Their predictions were right and there were soon dozens upon dozens of pirates on speeders travelling towards the town.
Amidst the chaos, Embo was struck down but luckily Skywalker noticed and ran to his aid.
The rest of the crew helped get him into the barn where he would be safe.
Not long after, the pirates escaped the planet and deemed the once profitable resources unprofitable.
Embo and the others took Sugi’s ship and headed to a Republic Outpost.
At this time, a five thousand credit bounty was placed on Embo’s head for crimes against the Republic.



# Section 3
Around 21 BBY, both Embo and Sugi were at Jabba’s palace on Tatooine.
They ran into the diplomats Notluwiski Papanoida and his son Ion.
After some time, they found out that the pair was searching for Greedo after he had kidnapped Papanoida’s daughters.
Soon after, Embo was with eleven other bounty hunters including Obi-Wan Kenobi, who is disguised as Rako Hardeen, and Cad Bane to fight in Count Dooku’s “Box.” By the end of the challenge, Embo had survived and was taken under the wing of Bane to help kidnap Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.
They strategized and came up with a plan that would require the use of Sinrich’s holographic disguise matrix.
This was used to knock out Palpatine and whisk him away amongst all the chaos.
Their distraction was a success, but unfortunately, they were not able to escape and were soon arrested by Anakin Skywalker and Mace Windu.



# Section 4
Sometime later Embo had been spotted on Tatooine exiting the hut of Boba Fett.
Alongside him was his pet Anooba, Marrok.
They were seen again at Chalmun’s Spaceport Cantina sharing a table with Asajj Ventress.
The reasoning for this is he had accepted a job as a guard for the Hutt Grand Council.
The job was assigned to him alongside Sugi, Dengar, and Latts Razzi when Darth Maul had threatened the Council.
Maul and his brother Savage Opress made a move and attacked the Council.
Embo noticed this and began to defend his employers.
Over time, Maul decided to stop attacking since their enemies were mercenaries and they wouldn’t dare stand in their way unless they were paid to do so.



# Section 4
His next employment involved finding and capturing Rush Clovis on his home planet, Scipio.
Always keeping a close eye on where Clovis would move to next.
He soon attacked Clovis, Amidala, and Skywalker.
The three fled but Embo’s loyal companion Marrok chased them.
The hunter destroyed their vehicle so they would not be able to escape by air, thus forcing them to travel on foot.
Skywalker held Embo at bay until R2-D2 picked the three up with the ship, Marrok, retrieved Embo’s hat and the hunter proceeded to open his comms.
He then contacted Darth Sidious and informed him that Clovis had escaped just as they had planned.
Sidious was relieved and told the bounty hunter that he would take the job from there.
