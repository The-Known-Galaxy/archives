# Introduction
CC-5576, codenamed “Gregor:, was a clone commando who served as captain in the battalion known as the 212th Attack Battalion, within the Galactic Republic's Grand Army.
During the clone wars, Captain Gregor and the rest of his battalion were defeated by the Separatist Army on the planet Sarrish, resulting in giving him severe amnesia.
Soon after these events, Gregor ended up on Abafar, a planet located in the Outer Rim part of the galaxy, where he was taken advantage of for his lack of memory and used as a dishwasher in a diner, owned by Sullustan Borkus.
However, Gregor was found by Colonel Meebur Gascon and the rest of D-Squad, and they helped restore his memory of who he was, and convinced them to aid them on their mission to bring an encrypted Confederate module to the Republic.
