# Introduction

Rig Nema was a female consular Jedi who served as a physician at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.
When the Clone Wars prevailed, Nema had one of her most special patients: Grandmaster Yoda.
He was treated by her because he claimed to hear the voice of Qui-Gon Jinn in his head, who was assassinated by Darth Maul.
The Jedi Council was very worried about Yoda because they didn't think it was possible to talk to the dead at that time.
Master Ki-Adi-Mundi feared that it was a trick of the Sith to deceive the Grand Master and make him vulnerable.
Rig Nema examined Yoda several times to find out what was wrong with him, but he was in good health.
The only thing she noticed was that one part of his brain was more active than others, but this was said to be due to his old age.
Mundi spoke to Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi that Yoda's mind might have been taken over by the Sith Lord Count Dooku, who had been trained by the Grand Master.
When Nema heard of this, she suggested a withdrawal ritual to help Yoda get answers.
However, the ritual was very dangerous because Yoda would have to be put into a tank in which the oxygen would be gradually withdrawn, which would bring him close to death.
In this way, he could enter a state of meditation.
When they decided to perform the ritual, Yoda again heard Qui-Gon's voice telling him to travel to Dagobah to complete what he could not.
However, he should not tell anyone about his journey.
Shortly thereafter, Yoda's vital signs dropped rapidly, and Kenobi ordered Nema to stop the ritual.
Yoda was convinced that he had spoken to the dead, which prompted Windu to ask Nema for her opinion as a doctor.
She declared his physical condition good, but worried about his spiritual one.
When Yoda was back in the infirmary, he asked the doctor for a private conversation with Anakin Skywalker.
When Nema had left the room, Yoda explained to Anakin that he had to get out of here to go on a mission.
When Nema and Windu returned, they only saw Yoda flying away with R2-D2 in his starfighter.

# Section 1

Rig Nema was a Halaisi with golden eyes and yellow skin.
She was very good at her job, checking her patients several times to be sure, monitoring all vital signs at all times, and reporting to any relatives or friends.
She did not shy away from more dangerous procedures like the withdrawal ritual as long as it would help her patients.
She used this ritual on Master Yoda, but had to stop it on Kenobi's orders because his vital signs changed dramatically.
Nema did this reluctantly as she had mentioned the risks and said it would not be easy, but she obeyed.
