# Introduction

Greez Dritus, a Latero male, was captain of the Stinger Mantis during the Galactic Republic’s end and the Imperial Era.
He flew and cooked for former Jedi Cere Junda, aiding her with her quest to revive the Jedi Order.
His gambling habits led to trouble with the Haxion Brood crime syndicate.
Together with Cere, he rescued Cal Kestis from the Inquisitorius on Bracca, and later discovered a holocron on Bogano.
They gained BD-1 and Merrin, a Nightsister.
Greez’ association led to Cal’s capture by the Haxion Brood, and Dritus apologized afterwards.
The crew became a family.

# Section 1

Raised by his great-grandmother Pyloon, Greez learned risk-taking from his parents, who were not around often.
He attended Lateron Space Academy, where he quickly became an excellent pilot.
He once attempted a heist at the Jedi Temple but got scared.
He bought the Stinger Mantis before 14 BBY, leaving Lateron due to Imperial exploitation.
He enjoyed women, fast ships, and gambling.
Before long, he became indebted to the Haxion Brood, causing him to evade the crime syndicate.

# Section 2

After Order 66, Greez was hired by Cere to help in restoring the Jedi Order.
He flew the Mantis, monitored Imperials, cooked, and provided living space.
An ambush on Nar Shaddaa improved their relationship.
The Haxion Brood chased him because of his debt, causing Cere to sell her kyber crystal to help.
In 14 BBY, they rescued Cal from Inquisitors on Bracca.
They found Eno Cordova’s holocron on Bogano and focused on retrieving it.
Greez avoided combat, preferring to stay near his ship.
The Haxion Brood captured Cal, making Greez apologize for his actions.
After they retrieved the holocron, he offered his ship as a permanent place to stay.

# Section 3

During a mission to collect Shroud schematics on Markhana, the Fifth Brother dueled with Cal.
Greez moved the Mantis to the compound’s courtyard, and Cere joined the fight.
Inside, Greez found Cal injured and unconscious.
As Cere held the Fifth Brother with the Force, Greez urged her to help Cal.
When the Inquisitor swung Cere’s lightsaber at Cal, Greez intervened, losing his arm.
Cere trapped the Inquisitor, which allowed Cal to recover.
They brought Greez to the ship and Cere treated his wound with bacta.

# Section 4

Despite his gambling history, Greez was the most careful member of his crew.
He disliked risky planets, feared Merrin, and disliked nature.
He cooked for the crew and maintained a terrarium.
Furthermore, he bonded with Cal over time.
