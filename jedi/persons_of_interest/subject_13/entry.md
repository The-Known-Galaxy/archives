# Introduction

Subject 13 belonged to the species Rakata and was born during the Infinite Empire.
The reason he was labelled ‘Subject 13’ was due to the previous twelve subjects coming before him failing their required tests; however, he did not.
Subject 13 came from the homeworld, Lehon.
He was imprisoned due to the fact of his ability with the Force that most other Rakatas did not have.
He remained trapped in the ‘Mind prison’ for years and years.

# Section 1

During the times that the Sith Empire was being brought back, they seized the Galactic Republic Prison and found out information about the subject named ‘Subject 13’, due to this, they sent their forces to explore the regions and locate and finally free Subject 13, and bring him to the ways of the Empire.
Finally, the Imperials eventually entered the mind prison.
Subject 13 could sense them there and was trying to move his mind from his body inside one of their bodies so he could officially free himself from this trap.

# Section 2

Subject 13 was weakened due to the fact he had been trapped inside of the prison for years, however, an apprentice, Suvaar, entered the prison and had his body taken over by Subject 13, however, he let it happen due to orders he was given by his master, Mohgren.
Due to the fact he took over their body, he finally entered the world again and what happened next was unknown in the galaxy.
