# Introduction

Jake Fenn was a male Je’daii Temple Master serving the Je’daii Order on Tython during the Infinite Empire’s reign.
To help make sure that the Settled Worlds would not fall into the hands of the Empire, he became a General and fought during the Force Wars.

# Section 1

Jake Fenn was a male human born into a strong Force-sensitive family, serving the Je'daii Order on Tython as a Je’daii Master at the height of the Empire’s reign.
He governed the Temple of Arts, Bohdi, prior to 25,808 BBY when he was appointed Je’daii Temple Master.
He guarded the Temple with his one Force-imbued blade, a weapon that could destroy dark side spirits.
Then in 25,793 BBY, when the Devourer, a Rakatan ship, crashed on Tython, Jake and the other Temple Masters meditated to disperse the Force Storm that occurred.
The Force storm was a product of the crashed Rakatan ship.
A Force Storm is a phenomenon that happens when the light side and the dark side are out of balance.

# Section 2

Later on, during the escape of the Force Hound Xesh and exiled Je’daii Daegen Lok, Jake along with some other Je’daii pursued them into coming to a crystal mine.
Jake fought against Lok and was slashed in the chest.
During the fight, Lok sought out Jake’s darkest fear to buy time for their escape.
Seeing how Jake cared for Ranger Zana, he force-pushed Zana off a cliff.
She lived, but the Je'daii Rath had to sacrifice his life for it.
