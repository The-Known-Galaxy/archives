# Introduction
Arasuum was a deity in the ancient Mandalorian religion, known as the sloth-god and personification of stagnation.
The Mandalorians believed that Arasuum tempted their clans to engage in idle consumption.
In opposition to Arasuum, there was Kad Ha’rangir, the god representing the opportunity for change and growth that destruction brought.
According to Mandalorian mythology, Arasuum and Kad Ha’rangir were in eternal conflict.

# Section 1
The Mandalorians who believed in the ancient gods partook in ritualistic warfare to worship Kad Ha’rangir.
They took on the name Mandalorian Crusaders to reflect the holiness of their conflict.
By fighting in the name of Kad Ha’rangir, they sought to earn his favor and resist Arasuum’s temptations.



# Section 2
Over time, the belief in Arasuum and the worship of Kad Ha’rangir diminished among the Mandalorians.
Mandalore the Indomitable declared the act of war itself would be the new focus of Mandalorian worship after he encountered a spiritual vision.
However, the worship of war eventually declined over the centuries.
Despite this, the ancient Mandalorian gods, including Arasuum, were not forgotten.
Millennia later, in 19 BBY, Mandalorian soldier Kal Skirata was aware of their significance in Mandalorian mythology.
 Moreover, Historian Vilnau Teupt mentioned their importance to the early Mandalorians during a speech at the Proceedings of Galactic Anthropology and History at the Brentaal Academy in 24 ABY.
