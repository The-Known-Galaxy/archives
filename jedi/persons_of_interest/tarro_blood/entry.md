# Introduction

Tarro Blood was a human male Mandalorian.
After turning to bounty hunting, Tarro operated during the Cold War and Galactic War.
He was also a competitor in the Great Hunt, acting as a very persistent threat to other competitors.
As the son of Alderaanian nobility, Tarro decided to cut off his lordship to become a Mandalorian-mercenary.

# Section 1

During the First Great Hunt, Tarro Blood was quickly becoming known and feared.
He trained vigorously under the legendary Mandalorian champion, Hedarr Soongh.
After a long period of training, Tarro was the favourite choice to claim victory in the Second Great Hunt.
Ten years later, Tarro Blood decided to participate in the Second Great Hunt.
This time he maintained no honor and was morally abhorrent.
Known for his incorrigible behaviour, sabotaging his opponents at every chance.

# Section 2

A chain of events were set off after Tarro decided to recruit a Rodian bounty hunter by the name of Nails to be his lackey.
The opposing hunter named Braden decided to fulfill a bounty on a fugitive.
While this was happening, Tarro had an accomplice murder one of Braden’s friends.
Unaware of the consequence, he had his lackey eliminate his accomplice.
From then on Tarro kept making constant interference with Braden’s hunts and soon made his crimes aware to his former master.

# Section 3

Tarro met his demise through his final target of the Second Great Hunt.
His target was Jedi Master Kellian Jarro.
Tarro’s attempt to kill Kellian was met with a swift end as the master used a mind trick on Tarro.
Upon being placed into a cell aboard the Aurora, the ship was then attacked by the D5-Mantis Patrol Craft which resulted in the death of Tarro.
