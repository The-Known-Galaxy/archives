# Introduction

Zenith had been part of a resistance cell on Balmorra until it was infiltrated and eliminated by Imperial spies.
After this incident, he traveled through Balmorra in search of members who were carrying out their guerrilla tactics against the Imperials occupying the planet.
For years Zenith carried out this activity, which gave him a great hatred for the Empire, and especially for the Sith governor, Darth Lachris.
He became paranoid and detested citizens who cooperated with the Empire.
Zenith went through a lot with the Balmorran resistance, which made him believe that he would be able to free Balmorra from the Empire forever.
He then ran in the election for leader of the opposition against Tai Cordan, and won.
His victory was achieved through the support of Secretary Varram and the Alderaan refugees he brought home, who voted for him.
He also defeated his competitor, Nalan Fiskin, by publishing incriminating information he found in the journals of the Gray Star.
He performed his duties from the Barsen'thor Defender-class light corvette.
Later, after the Zakuulan conquests, the rise and fall of the Eternal Alliance, the start of the Third Galactic War, and the formation of Task Force Nova, the Alliance commander was informed of a turbolaser shipment that was to be taken to a Republic base on Corellia, but it was raided by the Empire.
Lana Beniko suggested  Zenith, who had been an enemy of the Empire for years, pray for cooperation in getting the shipment safely to Corelliar.
