# Introduction

Shodon Ko, a male bureaucrat, who was a member of the Navigators Guild on the planet Koros Major.
In around 5000 BBY, he became responsible for approving a dangerous hyperspace route called the Goluud Corridor which was brought to light by the travellers, Gav and Jori Daragon.
Whereas, there was a new-found route which crossed the unsteady red supergiant star, also known as Primus Goluud.
Shodon Ko allocated the new route a huge danger, this disheartened the Guild’s visitors from using it anymore.
Unfortunately, a merchant called Lord Ssk Kahorr took a huge risk and directed his drone ship through the Goluud Corridor.

# Section 1

Shodon Ko informed Gav that for his troubles he will give him a nice bonus, sadly enough the ship that was filled with cargo was destroyed by solar flames from Primus Goluud.
Kahoor, who was filled with anger, was determined to kill those who were responsible for mapping out the hyperspace route.
Before he went to finish off with the Daragons, Kahorr murdered and ate Shodon Ko.
The remains of Shodon Ko were described by the Daragons as ‘nasty’.
