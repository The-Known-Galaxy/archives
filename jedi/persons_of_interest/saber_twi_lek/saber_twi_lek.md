# Introduction
Saber was a female Twi’lek operative of The Republic Strategic Information Service, her real name was kept a secret but she was often referred to as ‘Saber’, her alias.
She was active during the Cold War, which was between the Galactic Republic and The Sith Empire.
Saber was part of Ardun Kothe’s team in the SIS (Strategic Information Service), along with “Hunter”, “Chance”, “Wheel” and “Legate”.
Saber would later be betrayed by one of her teammates “Legate”.
 Legate would reveal his true allegiance with The Sith Empire to Saber and Wheel,  and then proceed to attack them.
Unfortunately Saber would be killed.
Legate was said to have been a defector from Imperial Intelligence, and it was proven false after this as he was still loyal to the Sith.
