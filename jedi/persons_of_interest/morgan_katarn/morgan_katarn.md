# Introduction
Morgan Katarn was a Force-sensitive human male who played a crucial role in the Rebel Alliance.
He led the protests on the moon of Sulon against the Galactic Empire and later guided the actions of the resistance.
He gained a reputation for his leadership skills and for his commitment to safeguarding the Sulonese people from the Empire.

# Section 1
It was believed that Morgan Katarn was born on the moon of Sulon, which was under the control of the Galactic Empire.
He was always drawn to the Force and had a strong sense of justice, which led him to become a leader in the local resistance movement against the Empire.
His son Kyle was unaware of his actions, as he had left Sulon for Imperial training.



# Section 2
To protect the Sulonese who protested against the Empire, Morgan arranged for their exodus to the forgotten planet of Ruusan.
During this expedition, he discovered a powerful Force nexus known as the Valley of the Jedi.
He went on to share this discovery with Jedi Master Qu Rahn, as he felt the knowledge of the Valley would be better suited in a Jedi’s hands.
This revelation had a profound impact on Kyle’s path to becoming a Jedi Knight in the future.

After returning to Sulon, Morgan played a key role in organizing the local resistance during the early stages of the Galactic Civil War.
He was a leader in the fight against the Empire's subjugation of the planet.
Morgan organized the local resistance on Sulon during the early stages of the Galactic Civil War and used his knowledge of Sulon’s resources to organize a successful resistance, which slowed down Imperial progress and protected the population.
Despite their efforts however, the Empire emerged victorious and Sulon once again fell under Imperial control.
In the final stages of the conflict, Jerec, an Imperial High Inquisitor, confronted Morgan and sought to use the Valley of the Jedi for his personal gain.
He demanded that Morgan join the Empire and give him access to the Valley of the Jedi, but Morgan refused; as a result, Jerec killed him upon his vehicle Vengeance in the year 1 BBY.



# Section 3
The Rebels declared Morgan Katarn's death a terrorist act, but Kyle Katarn, blinded by Imperial misdirection, blamed them for his father's death.
However, Jan Ors, a close friend of Morgan's, revealed the truth about his death to Kyle, which led to Kyle leaving the Imperial military and changing his beliefs.
Morgan's and Qu Rahn's legacies played a crucial role in Kyle's journey to becoming a Jedi.
Morgan himself had a crucial role in protecting the people of Sulon and delaying the Empire's progress by leading the resistance and utilizing his experience of the moon and its reservoirs.
After the conclusion of the Civil War, the Sulonese honored and remembered Morgan Katarn as a hero who sacrificed himself for their freedom.
