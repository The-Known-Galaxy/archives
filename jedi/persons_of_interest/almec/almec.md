# Introduction
Almec, a male Human Mandalorian from the planet Mandalore, was a prominent figure within the peaceful New Mandalorian faction during the Clone Wars.
As the Prime Minister of the New Mandalorians, he advocated for the faction's peaceful ways and worked tirelessly to represent the interests of Mandalore.
However, his unwavering dedication to his people led him down a treacherous path, as he resorted to establishing a black market trade network during a time of crisis.

# Section 1
Almec was a male Human native of Mandalore, and a vital member of the pacifistic New Mandalorian faction.
By the time of the Clone Wars, he had risen to the position of Prime Minister, holding authority within the Ruling Council of ministers that governed the New Mandalorians' peaceful society.
When Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi visited Mandalore to investigate rumors of a Mandalorian army supporting the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Almec staunchly denied the allegations and expressed his belief in Mandalore's commitment to the Galactic Republic.



# Section 2
After Mandalore was cut off from Republic aid, leading to a shortage of vital supplies, Almec took matters into his own hands.
Fearing for his people's well-being, he established a clandestine black market trade network to smuggle essential goods into Sundari, the New Mandalorian capital city.
This network involved illicit smugglers who brought much-needed supplies to Mandalore.
However, the smugglers resorted to poisoning the people of Sundari by tainting tea with the toxic chemical slabin.
The poisoning affected numerous children, leading to a dire situation for Almec.



# Section 3
The illegal activities of the black market trade network eventually came to light when Republic Senator Padmé Amidala visited Sundari.
Alongside Duchess Satine Kryze, Almec was confronted about the smuggling ring, endangering the lives of Mandalorian children.
Despite initially deflecting blame onto the Death Watch, Almec's role in the network was exposed.

When confronted by Duchess Kryze's nephew, Korkie, and a group of New Mandalorian cadets, Almec was overpowered and arrested for his crimes.
He was subsequently imprisoned for his involvement in the black market trade network and the poisoning of Mandalorian children.

During Darth Maul's takeover of Sundari, Almec was freed from prison and reinstated as Prime Minister by the Sith Lord.
Maul's actions allowed Almec to regain his political standing after Maul eliminated Pre Vizsla, the previous ruler.

As Prime Minister once again, Almec played a significant role in the political machinations that followed.
He falsely claimed that Duchess Satine had murdered Pre Vizsla and became an instrumental figure in Maul's rule over Mandalore.
Ultimately, Almec witnessed the tragic murder of Satine at the hands of Maul.



# Section 4
Almec was a large man with blond hair, fair skin, and violet-colored eyes.
He wholeheartedly embraced the pacifist beliefs of the New Mandalorians, harboring great pride in the reformation of Mandalore's violent reputation.
Despite holding a high-ranking office, Almec remained humble, viewing himself as a servant of the people.
He was a shrewd diplomat and politician, capable of deducing the plans of the Death Watch and foreseeing the potential consequences of Republic intervention on Mandalore.
However, his dedication to preserving Mandalore's well-being led him astray, and he allowed himself to become entangled in corruption and betrayal, endangering the very people he sought to protect.
