# Introduction

Satele Shan was a Force-sensitive human female born on the planet Brentaal IV in 3,699BBY.
She inherited her Force abilities from her family and was inducted to the Jedi order to be trained there for her youngling years.
Her Master Ngani Zho trained her during her padawan years, though she went to the Sith homeworld of Korriban to study under the Zabrak Battlemaster Zao Cen Darach.
She witnessed the recapture of Korriban in 3,681 BBY by the Sith Empire, which she then escaped from the planet by the help of smuggler Nico Okarr and Republic soldier Jace Malcom.

# Section 1

Achieving the rank of Jedi Knight, Shan led the Jedi and her Forces into the Republic military during the great galactic war.
In 3,653 BBY Shan was selected to be part of the delegation that was to negotiate peace with the Sith.
However, the Sith used this as a distraction plan to raid and attack the capital of Coruscant.
The Sith kept the entire world of Coruscant captive until they agreed to the terms of the treety of Coruscant, causing the destruction of the Jedi temple on Coruscant.

# Section 2

After this Shan had the order to move back to their original Jedi temple on the planet Tython.
Shan was then appointed to leadership of the order, or known as the rank of Grandmaster.
Since then Shan guided the Order through many Crises during the cold war whilst training her padawan Shigar Knoshi, a Kiffar that was trained through Knighthood.
