# Introduction
Warren Sedoru was a human male born several decades before 3681 BBY.
He was trained as a Jedi and quickly gained high standing in the Order.
When the Empire recaptured Korriban and began the Great Galactic War, Sedoru was one of the first few Jedi to lead counterattacks.
Warren fought in dozens of battles across the galaxy and scored several early victories against the Sith.
However, he was severely injured in one of the battles, causing his connection to the Force to weaken, and when the war ended in 3653, Sedoru devoted himself to peace.
This included giving up his Jedi Knight rank and becoming a Padawan to the Kel Dor Jedi Master Tol Braga.
Braga recruited his padawan, the Hero of Tython, as well as his padawan, Kira Carsen, to go on a mission to capture the Emperor and redeem him.
He sent Sedoru to Balmorra to obtain a cloaking device.
This cloaking device contained technology that was also used to cloak the Emperor's fortress.
However, since the device was located in the former Balmorran weapons factory, now an Imperial fortress, they needed the help of the Resistance.
The hero managed to retrieve the cloaking device, but had to give some important data from the Empire about their cloaked weapons to resistance fighters.
Returning to Tython to begin the mission, the team was contacted by the Jedi Council who said that a former team member named Jomar Chul had a vision of the hero turning to the dark side.
Chul and Jaric Kaedan were not sure about the mission after this vision and were afraid that it could become reality, but Grandmaster Satele Shan and Master Bela Kiwiiks showed utmost confidence in the hero.
Arriving on Dromund Kaas to infiltrate the Emperor's fortress, they were already expected and the Emperor used his power to lead the team to the dark side.
With no control over his actions, Warren Sedoru, aided by a host of Sith, later attacked the Republic flagship Valiant to kill Admiral Dabrin.
The goal of all this was to preserve the Republic codes.
When Warren demanded them, he engaged in a lightsaber duel with a Jedi who was on board, which the Jedi Knight won.
As Sedoru lay on the ground, the Jedi tried to convert him and return him to the light side, but to no avail.
Admiral Dabrin insisted on executing Warren because the Empire could obtain the military secrets.
The Jedi Knight, however, decided to bring him back to Tython to be healed by other Jedi and redeemed.
