# Introduction
Jaden Korr was a human male Force-sensitive, born on the planet Coruscant and was a member of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker's Jedi Order on the forest moon of Yavin 4.

# Section 1
Not much was known about Jaden Korr’s earlier life but it was established that he was a Force-sensitive at the New Jedi Order and was assigned to Jedi Master Kyle Katarn in 14 ABY along with another Force-sensitive named Rosh Penin.

Later, Korr would participate in multiple battles across the galaxy against a Sith cult called the Disciples of Ragnos whose goal was to resurrect the ancient Sith Lord Marka Ragnos.
Through multiple battles with the cult and earning himself the rank of Jedi Knight, Jaden Kor eventually defeated the leader of the Cult, Tavion Axmis, on the Sith homeworld of Korriban.



# Section 2
During the Second Galactic Civil War in 40 BBY, Jaden Korr participated in a battle against a Corellian superweapon known as the Centrepoint Station, which he murdered over two dozen people by spacing them.
This action proved to take a heavy toll on Jaden, as it was something he deeply regretted.

With this and Korr’s anxiety about his natural affinity for the powers of the dark side, Korr lost sight of the Jedi Order and his path in the Force.
He decided to exile himself on his homeworld of Coruscant until his exile came to an abrupt halt when he was granted a vision by the Force, which directed him to a frozen moon in the unknown regions of space.



# Section 3
Korr would enlist the crew of the Junker, Human Khedryn Faal, and Cerean Marr Idi-Shael to take him to the frozen moon.
When they arrived, they received a distress call from the moon, and upon landing, they encountered Jedi Master Relin Druur as well as a Sith Dreadnaught Harbinger.
Unknowing to Druur and the Harbinger.
They had both travelled forward in time 5000 years from the Great Hyperspace war.

Druur would go on his path to destroy the Harbinger whilst Korr would follow his vision to an abandoned Imperial research facility in which scientists were attempting to create clones with both Jedi and Sith DNA, which was found out to be authorised by Grand Admiral Thrawn.
However, this backfired as the clones had killed their creators and escaped the moon, with Korr and the Junker crew pursuing them.
Korr had also found out that the Cerean Marr Idi-Shael was Force-sensitive, so he decided to take him as his apprentice, and whilst following the clones' trail, he found out that one of the clones had been produced using his DNA.



# Section 4
After a continuous pursuit, the clones were tracked to an ancient Rakatan space station.
When Korr and his apprentice boarded it, they were ambushed by a Sith agent, in which Korr defeated but was killed by his clone.
Marr Idi-Shael had to do some quick thinking and managed to not only preserve but transfer Korr’s consciousness to his clone using a dark side device known as the mindspear.

Once they had escaped the station Korr had time to reflect and learn of his place in the force, he would return to the Jedi Order, continuing a respectful career there.
