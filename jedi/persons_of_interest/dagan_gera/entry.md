# Introduction

Dagan Gera is a humanoid former Jedi Knight who was among some of the best duelists of his time.
He used a yellow, double-bladed saber capable of being split in two and used as separate weapons.
Dagan discovered the planet Tanalorr, placed deep within the Koboh Abyss and became fascinated with it.
His desire to guard the planet and turn it into a training space for new Jedi Initiates was the main reason for his eventual fall to the Dark Side.
After the Nihil marauders invaded Tanalorr and Gera was given the order to retreat, he betrayed the Jedi in favor of his own goals.
This resulted in him losing an arm and being sealed inside a Bacta tank until 9 BBY when he was set free by Cal Kestis.

# Section 1

Sometime during his time in the Jedi Order, Gera defeated the Gen’Dai warrior Rayvis in one-on-one combat, earning the respect of Rayvis’ people.
After Dagan charted a course to Tanalorr, he worked with Jedi Master Santari Khri to create the Abyss Compasses, devices used to navigate the Koboh Abyss.
After Tanalorr was raided by the Nihil, the Jedi Council ordered a retreat from the warzone and the destruction of the compasses.
Enraged by this, Gera murdered multiple of his fellow Jedi and went to retrieve an abyss compass from Khri.
He was defeated in the following interaction and sealed in a Bacta tank.

# Section 2

When Dagan awoke from his slumber in 9 BBY, he immediately engaged Kestis in a duel.
Their match was then cut short by the arrival of Rayvis, who escorted the fallen Jedi away from the battlefield.
Rayvis and Dagan later worked together to kidnap the droid known as Zee, which contained information on the abyss compasses and where they were hidden.
They eventually succeeded in doing so, and Rayvis was sent to collect the last abyss compass.
Meanwhile, Cal Kestis attempted to rescue the droid and was forced to fight Dagan once more.
As Cal seemed to be about to lose to Gera, Bode Akuna stepped in and saved Kestis, alongside Zee.
