# Introduction
Wrecker was a clone commando who served the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars era.
He was a member of a clone force known as Clone Force 99, also nicknamed “The Bad Batch”.
This force was made up of clones that were unique due to genetic mutations.
Wrecker’s genetic mutation was that he was physically much larger and stronger than an average clone trooper.
However, often Wrecker would solely rely on his brute strength to solve problems rather than think things through, unlike other members of this Clone Force such as Tech and Hunter.
The team was perfectly balanced through the variety of skills from each member, such as skill, intellect, strength and more.

# Section 1
Wrecker, like all clones, was created on the planet Kamino to serve under the Grand Army of the Republic.
They were created using the genetic template of Jango Fett, yet during the cloning process, there was an error that resulted in some clones straying away from this template.
Wrecker was one of these clones that developed in size and strength far differently from the other clones.
However, the Republic did see potential and an advantage in this situation, so they chose to collect and create a new clone squad composed of these individuals.
The squad would include Wrecker and three other clones known as Tech, Hunter and Crosshair.
Clone Force 99 would get its name from Clone 99, who gave his life to protect his home world Kamino, during an assault from Separatist forces.



# Section 2
Clone Force 99 was deployed on numerous dangerous missions and was known to never fail.
Towards the end of the Clone Wars, the team started to build up their reputation while also gaining another member known as Echo, a former member of Anakin Skywalker's squad.
The squad was deployed on one last mission under the current Galactic Republic; they were sent to reinforce Jedi Master Depa Billaba’s clone squad and Padawan Caleb Dume, later known as Kanan Jarrus.
As the tide of battle had turned in favour of the republic with Clone Force 99’s arrival, it wasn’t long until the clone force was thrown off guard.
When Order 66 was activated, the clones began to gun down Jedi Master Depa Billaba, Caleb Dume began to run while being pursued by the clones.
The Bad Batch squad chased the Padawan to try and figure out what was happening, while the other clones intended to kill him.
Clone Force 99 did not have the intention of killing the Jedi or carrying out Order 66 due to their unique mutations, which interfered with their ability to follow orders without question.
Crosshair was the only member of the clone force that was significantly affected by the order and had the intention of killing the young Jedi.
While Crosshair would display some resistance, he was still subject to the order that caused him to leave Clone Force 99 when they attempted to leave Kamino against the newly formed Empire’s orders.



# Section 3
Wrecker’s strength allowed him to achieve feats that an average clone simply would not.
He was able to lift a LAAT gunship off a wounded soldier trapped underneath, he could destroy battle droids with his bare hands, and had a passion for using explosives.
Wrecker was an excitable loud character and would act rather clumsy.
While Wrecker did have many strengths, he also possessed some weaknesses.
He did not use his intellect, often relying on brute strength rather than analysing the situation, and he was also  afraid of extreme heights.

Wrecker was a lovable member of the Bad Batch squad and cared greatly about his comrades.
His relationship with the latest member of the squad, Omega, was deeply admirable.
He was protective, playful and very comforting for the young girl, doing his best to make her feel part of the team.
Wrecker even customised her bedroom on their ship, the Marauder, to make her feel more comfortable and at home.
