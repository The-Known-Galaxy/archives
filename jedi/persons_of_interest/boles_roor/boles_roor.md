# Introduction
Boles Roor, a pod racing legend, was a Sneevel.
He used a Bin Gassi Racing Engines Quadrijet 4-Barrel 904E pod.
Roor was notorious for having a lack of clothing throughout his entire life.
He was also known to be quite lazy with the upkeep of his podracer.
Roor hired multiple mechanics, but he put no effort into his podracer other than that.
This lack of commitment resulted in combustion chamber issues along with subpar parts.

# Section 1
In 32 BBY, Boles Roor took part in the infamous Boonta Eve Classic.
The night before the race, the cocky Sneevel wagered against the rookie Ben Quadinaros.
Roor believed that Quadinaros would not even have the courage to enter the race.
This sort of stupidity would cost Roor five million peggats the next morning as Quadinaros showed up the next day.
At least for Roor, this would not be his first time racing in this event.
He was a former two-time Boonta Eve Classic champion.
Unfortunately for him, he would end up placing sixth in this highly competitive field.
He would ultimately choose to retire from the sport after this defeat.
