# Introduction
Max Rebo and his brother Azool were born on the planet Orto.
At some point before 4 ABY, he started a band called the Max Rebo band and began playing for the infamous crime lord Jabba The Hutt at his palace on Tatooine.

# Section 1
Max’s brother Azool would commit acts of theft in the Mos Eisley spaceport, which is under Jabba’s watchful eye.
Max was afraid both he and his brother would be punished for Azool’s crimes, so he told Jabba the truth, and the crime lord made Azool a waiter on his sail barge, the Katana.
For Max’s honesty, no punishment was handed down, and his band was allowed to continue performing for Jabba.



# Section 2
Moving to the events in 4 ABY, Max Rebo’s band was playing for Jabba when Leia Organa infiltrated the palace while disguised as the bounty hunter Bausch.
The Max Rebo band would also accompany Jabba aboard his sail barge to the great pit of carcoon where Luke Skywalker and company were set to be executed.
Skywalker destroyed the sail barge.
Somehow, Max Rebo survived the explosion.
In 9 ABY, he was playing at Garsa Fwip cantina.
Max Rebo was jamming out all over Tatooine whenever he can and is one of the most legendary musicians in the galaxy.
