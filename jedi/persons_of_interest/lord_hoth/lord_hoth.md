# Introduction

Born on the planet of Kaal and into a respected line of Jedi Lords, Rohlan was a human male who was around since the Republic Dark Age.
He had a huge imagination in his youth, including thinking he had the power to end the Sith threat of the galaxy all by himself.
Confident in his dream, he joined the Jedi Order like many in his family before him and soon constructed a lightsaber containing a blue blade.
Rohlan became known as the Knight of Hoth in his teenage years due to repelling an attack on the Corellian Trade Spine from Sith pirates on the planet of Hoth.
After the attack, Rohlan would soon go to the planet of Coruscant, where he would soon receive his title of Jedi Master for his bravery and dedication.
Upon receiving this title, he was also given the title of Battlemaster and became highly respected by all of his students, including notable initiates such as Dree Vandap and Johun Othone.
The tale of Hothâ€™s victory during the Sith attack was told in whispers all around the Jedi Temple.

Soon, the High Council would attempt to raise Jedi Master Skere Kaan as the official scourge of the Sith, Skere would soon defect and become the founder of the Brotherhood of Darkness.
Hoth gathered a group of Jedi Knights and left the temple after realizing the failure of the High Council and soon rallied the banners known under the Jedi Grand Council.
This mustered all kinds of support such as massive forces and allies, even including reigning Jedi Lords from from the Javellin Marches such as Kamparas, Corellia, and Cularin.
Hoth led his massive force against the Brotherhood of Darkness under the banner of the Army of Light.
Hoth made it a goal to recruit as many Force-sensitive individuals, including children, to prevent them from turning to the Brotherhood of Darkness.
