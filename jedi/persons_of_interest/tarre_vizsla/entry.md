# Introduction

Tarre Vizsla was a notable Jedi and legendary Mandalorian who rose to prominence by being the first in recorded history to serve the Jedi Order as a Mandalorian.
Later rising to the position of Mand’alor, Tarre Vizsla was one of the earliest examples of Jedi and Mandalorian unity.

In roughly 1000 BBY, Tarre Vizsla would be inducted into the Jedi Order as a Youngling, though what was unique about him was the fact he was originally a Mandalorian Foundling.
At this time in the Jedi Order’s history, much of the galaxy feared the Mandalorians as bloodthirsty warriors, especially the Jedi.

Throughout galactic history, the Mandalorians had waged numerous wars against the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order and often allied themselves with the Sith Empire and notable Sith Lords such as Darth Vitiate and Ulic Qel-Droma, the decision to make Tarre Vizsla a Jedi was a controversial one at best.

When Tarre Vizsla joined the Jedi Order, he did not forget his Mandalorian heritage, choosing to keep his Clan name and held a staunch belief in the values of the Resol’nare, the guidelines of the Mandalorians.
Tarre Viszla would, upon coming of age, wear a set of beskar’gam, Mandalorian armour, and later crafted one of the most unique lightsabers in history; the Darksaber.

What Tarre Vizsla did during his time as a Jedi is unknown but, he would later rise to become Mand’alor, the leader of the Mandalorians, forever cementing the Darksaber as the mark of of the leader of House Vizsla and later the weapon of the Mand’alor.
It is unknown if Tarre Vizsla was still considered a member of the Jedi Order after becoming Mand’alor, though he was still permitted to carry his lightsaber which was returned to the Jedi Order upon his death.

Tarre Vizsla’s position as both a Mandalorian and Jedi proved to the galaxy that an individual can be both, and stood forever as a symbol of unity between both organisations.
Tarre Vizsla would have a statue erected in his honour on the planet Mandalore and would often be described by other Mandalorians as a warrior of legendary status, despite there being no recorded information on his accomplishments as Mand’alor

Whatever Tarre Vizsla accomplished during his time as Mand’alor forever cemented his place within Mandalorian history, with stories of his greatness being told to young Mandalorians for centuries to come.

Tarre Vizsla’s Darksaber was so highly valued by the Mandalorian people, most notably Clan Vizsla and the Death Watch, that a heist would be launched against the Jedi Temple on Coruscant by Tarre Vizsla’s descendant, Pre Vizsla in order to retrieve the weapon.
This action would solidify Pre Vizsla’s claim to the title of Mand’alor, uniting many of the warrior outcasts under his cause to restore glory to the Mandalorian people, a testament to the legendary status of Tarre Vizsla and the cultural significance of the Darksaber.
