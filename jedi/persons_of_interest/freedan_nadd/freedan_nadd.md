# Introduction
Freedan Nadd was born around 4,000 BBY on the planet of Ossus, The center of Jedi training and historical study at the time, long before that of Coruscant, or Tython.
Home to the Great Jedi Library, built and overseen by the ancient Jedi Master Odan Urr.
Freedon Nadd at a young age would start his Jedi training; having grown up like many of his peers hearing of extraordinary deeds done by Jedi Knights through their command of the force, and those akin.
Nadd ached to stand among the Jedi Knights.
He wanted nothing more than to become a Jedi Knight.
The eagerness, and desire to excel showed in Nadd’s progress.
In what seemed like no time he had forged a deep understanding of the force, and had crafted his own lightsaber.
His lightsaber blade was short, and shined with a bronze hue, as if accentuating the bright fire that burned within Nadd’s soul.
It did not take long for the Masters to take notice of Nadd’s progress.
They were impressed by not only his skill, but his openness to accept universal harmony.
Many of the Masters on Ossus took part in Nadd’s training, even going so far as to have one-on-one training with Odan Urr.
The Jedi didn’t doubt Nadd’s abilities.
Many speculated he was to become a Jedi far sooner than his classmates.
There was one final test he had to do before he became a Jedi Knight.
The test of humility.

# Section 1
Freedan Nadd’s test wouldn’t be one of body, but one of spirit; to see how he coped with failure, and whether or not he could stay true to the ideals of Jedi selflessness.
When the day came for Jedi to become Knights and be inducted into the order.
Nadd believed his promotion was imminent, finally he could stand among the Jedi Knights.
Unfortunately to his elation the Master’s completely passed over him during the ceremony.
The young man felt as if his universe had crashed around him, as if he had been gouged through the chest.
He was outraged.
The thoughts of vengeance slowly made their presence known within his mind, still confused as to what the Masters wanted of him; Nadd sought out one of his masters for advice on the matter.
Matta Tremayane; one of the finest lightsaber instructors of her time, often spending hours on the outskirts of the Ossus city practicing her various lightsaber techniques.
Nadd upon arriving upon the elderly woman was mesmerized at her saber-work.
Her transitions, and moves were flawless and precise.
It was as if the techniques were as natural to her as breathing.



# Section 2
After some time of waiting Nadd approached the woman, furious that she had neglected to acknowledge his presence.
After a rather angrily charged conversation the two engaged in a rigorous duel, though Nadd made a feeble attempt to stop his blade though undoubtedly failed, and with that he had struck down his Master.
Nadd acknowledged his failure, and berated himself for it.
Though he thought Matta was ignorant, and had brought the strike upon herself and he felt no pity for the woman.
In a fit of rage Nadd left Ossus, determined to become the most powerful Sith Sorcerer the galaxy had ever seen, and to make the Masters pay for not granting his Knighthood, as Nadd thought they were inferior to him.
Nadd then fled to Ashuss Ree, an ancient Sith system.
Nadd upon arriving on the planet would find an ancient artifact in the ruins of a deserted temple.
The holocron of King Adaeus, from within he learned of the red-skinned ancient Sith species; where he also learned of Naga Sadao who he would eventually be apprenticed to.



# Section 3
Nadd upon landing on the planet of Yavin IV was set upon by a group of Massassi warriors which he rather easily dispatched before making his way into the tomb of Naga Sadao, those left lead Nadd into the depths of the temple and to Naga Sadao’s preserved body within the tomb to be awakened when one was worthy of his teachings, and power.
Nadd would awaken Sadao from his tomb before asking the ancient Sith to take him on as his apprentice.
Sadao impressed with the young man’s fortitude, and expertise agreed, taking Nadd on as his apprentice.
Sadao would spend years training Nadd, bringing him to his full potential as a Sith Sorcerer.
Nadd upon reaching his full potential challenged Sadao, and with that he struck the ancient Sith down, destroying his body and forcing his frail spirit back into the depths of the inner-workings of the temple.
Freedan after collecting a trove of ancient Sith artifacts once more took to the stars before making his way shortly to Anderaan, a world strong in the force, and harsh; the perfect place for him to start a new Sith Empire.
Nadd using the knowledge he had attained both from the holocron, and Sadao’s teachings would with ease overthrow the Monarchs, before crowning himself KIng; crafting a crown from Anderaanian iron, and turned Anderaanian culture into one steeped in Sith lore, and magic.



# Section 4
The people worshipped the dark-side as the one, and only power in the galaxy, though as the years went on and Nadd’s power grew his body started to grotesquely deform, and strain under his immense dark-side power; his skin becoming pale, his jaw slack, and his eyes transforming into blinding white spheres.
Nadd assisted the Anderaanians in the development of modern technology, both to repel the beasts, and to euthanize those who didn’t accept his teachings.
Along with this Nadd discovered a nearly indestructible crustacean species named the Obelisk; which far in the future Darth Bane would utilize after collecting sith artifacts.
Nadd ruled over Anderaan for nearly a century, though soon word of his exploits, and tyranny reached the Jedi Order who sought to free Anderaan from his rule.
A Jedi strike team was sent to Anderaan, and after a pitched battle Freedan Nadd and his forces were defeated.
Nadd being so strong in the dark-side refused to die, isi spirit refuting to leave the physical plane, and with that he stayed.



# Section 5
The spirit kept a watchful eye on the Anderaanians; influencing the people for many more generations as well as overseeing their practice.
As Nadd’s descendants continued his work of destroying the beast riders and studying Sith alchemy in the works was a plan for Nadd to resurrect himself, teaching his descendants well he hoped to find a student to pass down his teachings too, and to bind his spirit to a physical body.
To ensure that Amaan or Amaanoa would make a worthy body they competed, though as years passed their power was not sufficient enough to carry such a task.
Nadd began to fear that he would never find a suitable apprentice.
Resolving to end the conflict Amaanoa would be overthrown, the Jedi, and Amaanoa’s daughter would overthrow the woman.
One Jedi in particular; Ulek Keldroma interested Nadd especially so.
Nadd ordered Amaan to capture Ulek’s master.
A powerful Jedi named Arka Jeif.
A task Amaan was more than happy to perform.
As Ulek and his Jedi ally struggled to hold off Amaan and his forces all the while desperate to save their master Nadd watched his plans slowly unfurl.
As expected the battle on Anderaan had garnered the attention of not only the Jedi, but force adepts wanting to learn the ways of the Sith.
Two of these adepts were the cousins Aleema, and Sal kito, who personally met with Amaan in order to help them decipher a Sith tome.



# Section 6
Nadd resolved to make them the future of his word, secretly gifting them a horde of Sith artifacts and assisting in their escape.
Ulek then overrunning Amaan caused Nadd to kill Amaan, then he receded back into the temple waiting to be awakened once more.
He knew that what he had set in motion would lead to the destruction of the Jedi.
Following the battle the Jedi attempted to remove Nadd’s influence from Anderaan; moving his remains onto the far-side of Duxaan, and encasing them in Mandalorian Iron.
Freedan continued to haunt the caves of Anderaan, and visit the cousins to assist with their dark-side training, the pair quickly becoming Sith sorcerers, and founding a Sith worshipping cult called the craft.
The two and their cult conquered systems and warred with the Jedi Order.
In the ensuing madness Nadd sought to put the final phase of his plan into motion.
Nadd came across a young Jedi who had an affinity in the force, and a fascination for Sith Alchemy, and Lore.
His name was Exar Kuun.
Nadd then instructed Kuun to make his way to Korriban; the ancient birthplace of the Sith.
Nadd would guide Exar to a nearby cave, making sure he was able to commit wholly to the dark-side.



# Section 7
If Kuun was willing to embrace the dark-side to save his life he was worthy of becoming his apprentice.
Nadd nearly killed Kun, caving in the cave around him, though Kun’s master attempted to interfere.
Nadd in retaliation struck out at Baas would banish his presence, leaving him and Kun alone.
Kun then gave in, losing all resolve and giving in to the dark-side.
Though the process caused him such pain his screams echoed across the stars.
Nadd then lead Kun to the other tombs, hoping for the other Sith to judge him worthy of becoming the next dark-lord.
Kun would make his way onto Yavin IV, the Massassi bringing him into the temple in order to revive himself.
The Massassi prepared the ritual, preparing the ritual.
Kun won the Massassi over, Nadd appearing over Kun before preparing to get his body back, he was overjoyed.
Nadd’s time had come after centuries, and countless failures.
Finally he would have his revenge against the Jedi.
Though not to plan Nadd died a second death, wailing in agony as his spirit faded away into obscurity.
