# Introduction
Ven Zallow was a Jedi Master who was born some time before 3681 BBY, fighting in and ultimately perishing at the hands of Darth Malgus during the Sacking of Coruscant in 3651 BBY inside the Jedi Temple.
Zallow’s most famous student, Aryn Leneer, was closely tied through the Force to Zallow, and was capable of sensing his presence across the galaxy.

# Section 1
Zallow fought during the Great Galactic War, and was stationed in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant as the Republic attempted to negotiate a peace treaty with the Sith Empire on Alderaan.
Little did the Republic know, but this was a deception masterminded by Dark Council member Darth Angral to lower the Republic’s defences and allow a strike against the Capital World of Coruscant.
Darth Malgus and allies including Eleena Daru, Shae Vizla and various Sith piloted a hijacked Republic NR2 Gullyjumper Shuttle through the Temple’s entry, shattering pillars and raining debris down upon the Jedi defenders.
Zallow engaged the Sith attackers in combat, easily cutting down troopers and Sith alike, until he engaged Darth Malgus in a duel.
After a skilful battle, Malgus eventually defeated Zallow, plunging a saber into his chest and watching as the Jedi Master died.



# Section 2
Whilst Zallow was not a Jedi Battlemaster, he was incredibly talented at combat, using a range of Force powers in his duel against Malgus, as well as unorthodox tactics such as using the pommel of his saber to hit Malgus.
Zallow’s death was felt throughout the Order, with his former Padawan, Aryn Leneer, leaving the peace conference on Alderaan to hunt Malgus down.
Zallow was also one of the partners of the astromech T7-O1, who would later join the Hero of Tython in the attack on the Sith Emperor.
