# Introduction

Obi-Wan Kenobi was once a revered Jedi Master before the fall of the Galactic Republic in 19 BBY.
He had a gift with the Force as a young age and was taken in by the Jedi Order to train to become a Jedi.
He was born in 57 BBY on Stewjon, a Jedi Master named Qui-Gon Jinn took him in as his Apprentice and trained him in the ways of the Force.
During the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, Obi-Wan defeated the Sith Lord known as Darth Maul in a duel but also lost his Master in that same duel.
It was also key to note that Kenobi was the first Jedi in over 1000 years to defeat a Sith Lord in combat.
Later on in 22 BBY, Obi-Wan suffered another loss, her name was Siri Tachi, and the Jedi Master had a secret relationship with her while still in the Jedi Order, breaking the Code.
Also, during this year, Kenobi discovered the Clone Army that was being built for the Republic under the orders of a Jedi Master named Sifo Dias, however, this Jedi Master had been dead ten years prior.

Obi-Wan was also captured and almost executed in the Petranaki Arena on Geonosis, along with Anakin Skywalker (His padawan at the time.), and Senator Padmé Amidala.
The trio were rescued by Yoda and the newly constructed Clone Army, however the battle that followed would ultimately lead to the Clone Wars that spread across the Galaxy.
Kenobi fought many battles in the Clone Wars as a Jedi High General, and was one of the last members of the Jedi High Council.

Even after his padawan Anakin Skywalker became a Jedi Knight, the two continued to fight alongside for several battles.
Kenobi’s charms and calm demeanor as well as the quiet threat of his abilities with a lightsaber earned him the nickname of “The Negotiator”.
During the war, the once thought deceased Darth Maul, had resurfaced with his brother Savage Opress and aimed to create a criminal empire whilst plotting revenge against his arch-nemesis, Kenobi.
The two clashed blades many times on occasion across the Galaxy.
Furthermore, Kenobi was devastated when Maul slew the Jedi’s past love interest, Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore, in cold blood, however remained strong in the conflict.
Nearing the end of the war, Anakin saved his life in a battle over Coruscant, which led to Obi-Wan killing General Grievous on Utapau, however he was betrayed by Commander Cody, following Order 66.

Kenobi managed to meet up with Grandmaster Yoda to discover that not many Jedi had survived the attacks, they later returned to the Jedi Temple where they learnt the agonizing truth that Skywalker had turned to the Dark Side and watched as led an attack to kill the remaining Jedi in the temple, he slaughtered Younglings hiding in the Jedi High Council room with no mercy, following orders from Chancellor Palpatine, the ruler of the successor of the Republic, the Galactic Empire.
Kenobi traveled to Mustafar in order to duel the Sith Lord Darth Vader.

Finally, Vader was sliced in half by Obi-Wan, and Kenobi remorsefully left him to die.
While Yoda went into exile, Kenobi took the son of Skywalker and Amidala, Luke Skywalker, to live with the Lars family on Tatooine.
He became a friend of the young Skywalker as he grew up, but he did not tell Skywalker his actual identity.
Kenobi re-emerged in 0 BBY, shortly before the Battle of Yavin.
After Leia Organa, Vader's daughter and Luke Skywalker's twin sister, was captured by the Empire, she contacted him desperately.
Kenobi gave Luke his father's lightsaber and traveled with him to Alderaan in the Millennium Falcon, only to realize that the Death Star had destroyed the planet.
Kenobi entered the Death Star but Darth Vader sensed his presence.
In a duel with his former apprentice, Kenobi gave up his life to allow Luke to escape, vanishing into the Force the moment Vader struck him down with his weapon.

Three years later, his spirit returned to Luke to lead him to Dagobah in order to learn from Master Yoda.
He even carried out his role as a mentor to the younger Jedi beyond his natural life through use of the Force, remaining a significant influence on Luke Skywalker's foundation of the New Jedi Order.
