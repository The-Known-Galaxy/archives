# Section 1
Crosshair earned his nickname due to his exceptional sharpshooting abilities, which set him apart from other clone troopers.
His precision and accuracy were so remarkable that Sergeant Hunter once stated he could hit targets from distances as far as ten kilometers.
Crosshair held his 773 Firepuncher rifle in high regard, valuing it as a trusted tool in his arsenal.

His expertise as a sniper instilled in him a sense of superiority, leading him to harbor a dislike for the notion of collaborating with unaltered clone troopers.
Crosshair's specialized training and remarkable sniping skills contributed to his belief in the superiority of clone commandos like himself.



# Section 2
During the Battle of Anaxes, Crosshair fought alongside his squad, Clone Force 99, as special reinforcements under the command of General Skywalker.
Their primary objective was to retrieve vital intelligence from a Cyber Center, which had the potential to turn the tide of the war.
 As they made their way towards the center, an exchange between Crosshair and Jesse momentarily created tension due to their differing experiences.
However, the situation was quickly resolved, and the squad received a briefing on the mission.
Along the journey, Commander Cody,  sustained an injury, resulting in a leadership dispute between Rex and the other clones, including Crosshair.
Eventually, Hunter officially relinquished command to Rex.
Upon reaching the cyber center, Crosshair took on the responsibility of securing the perimeter while his teammates proceeded inside.
Their successful retrieval of crucial data revealed the surprising truth that CT-1409, "Echo," previously believed to have perished on Lola Sayu, was, in fact, alive on Skako Minor.
With the mission accomplished, Crosshair organized transportation by securing a shuttle to return him and his squad back to the base.
