# Introduction

Vette, formerly known as Ce’na, was a female Twi’lek thief and assassin born on Ryloth during the time of the Great Galactic War in 3664 BY.
At a young age, Vette, her older sister Tiiva, and her mother Diida, fell to the hands of slavers, forcing them to work in the Ryloth mines.
Vette was handed off to lots of slave masters, resulting in her being sold separately from her mother and sister off-world.
As time went by, Vette was soon rescued from slavery by well-known pirate by the name of Nok Drayen, but soon ended up leaving to join the Twi’lek artifact hunters.
She was assigned a job by a rich Duros named Cada Bliss, where she was sent to Korriban, but got caught and jailed by the Sith Academy for being caught sneaking into the temple of Naga Sadow.
She was offered as a gift from Sith Lord Darth Baras, to his Sith apprentice.
Vette then traveled around with her new master for some time, who was betrayed on Quesh by Darth Baras, almost resulting in death.
After some time, out of the clutches of her master, Vette soon was reunited with her gang.

Vette was also known to be an intergalactic and skilled explorer, alongside her title of treasure hunter.
She embarked on numerous adventures, even as a child.
She was able to maneuver tight spaces, and even learned how to disarm traps, and other skills that soon came in handy during her raid on the Gilded Star, where both her and a Devorian con artist named Gault Rennow teamed up to rob the Eternal Empire’s treasury ship containing lots of treasures and other wealth, hidden in deep space.
Being the adventurous and carefree thief that she was, Vette also dabbled with all kinds of goods known to the criminal underworld, resulting in her getting into trouble, or resulting in a bounty being placed on her head.
She was also known to be lighthearted in conversations, despite her carefree attitude.
As a child, all the way up to adulthood, Vette enjoyed pranks, teasing, and mocking people who thought too much of themselves.
Vette was also very favorable to her companions, despite how ruthless they were.
During her time as a pirate and in the Sith Empire, she found herself avoiding unnecessary killing, unless they deserved it.
