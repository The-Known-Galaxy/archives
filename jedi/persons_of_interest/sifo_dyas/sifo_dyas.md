# Introduction

Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, born on the lesser-known planet Minashee, was best known for his involvement in the creation of the Clone Army.
Dyas was the Jedi who originally paid the Kaminoans with the request for an army of Clones to be made for the Galactic Republic.

Dyas was formerly a Jedi High Council member, until he informed the Council of his premonitions that a strong and dangerous enemy was rising and that for the Republic to overcome and win the imminent war, they would need to commission an army to assist the Jedi in their efforts to maintain peace in the Galaxy.
Dyas’ foresight was dismissed by the Council, and the idea of commissioning an army and breaking the peace in the Galaxy led to his dismissal from the High Council.

Despite this setback, he continued his plan unbeknownst to the Jedi.
He went to the planet of Kamino, getting into contact with the Kaminoans.
Upon meeting the scientists, he presented himself as a messenger on behalf of the Jedi Council and Galactic Senate and informed the cloners that the Republic was in need of an Army of Clones.

However, Sifo-Dyas’ dream would soon be completely hijacked by the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious and his apprentice Darth Tyranus.

# Section 2

The Jedi Master was soon shot down in his shuttle, on the planet of Oba Diah, and did not survive the crash.
Due to the death of the Jedi, the two Sith Lord’s went to Kamino themselves in an attempt to take over the project that was started by Sifo-Dyas.

It was from Darth Sidious and Darth Tyranus that the large amount of funding to start off the Clone Army came, and it was also them who hired the Mandalorian Bounty Hunter Jango Fett to become the Clone template.
An inhibitor chip placed into the Clone’s mind (originally an idea of Dyas to prevent them being controlled by Jedi or Sith) was altered to make the Clones fiercely loyal to Darth Sidious.
This inhibitor chip is also what led to the massacre known as the Jedi Purge, or Order 66.

# Section 3

Had Dyas survived the crosshairs of the Sith, it is very likely that the Jedi Purge would never have happened like it did.
The Sith were not great enough in numbers to take on the ever-growing Jedi Order and so it was the production of the Clone Army that led to the unfortunate rise of the First Galactic Empire.
