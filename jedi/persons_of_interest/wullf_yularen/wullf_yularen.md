# Introduction

Wullf Yularen was a human male who served both the Republic and the Galactic Empire.
He established a reputation as a loyal and capable individual during this time.
Yularen was convinced by Palpatine to join the Republic Navy as an admiral during the Clone Wars, where he became one of the youngest naval officers to hold the rank and the naval commander of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker's fleet.
When the Republic got reorganised into the Empire, Yularen entered the intelligence business, acting as the leader of a task group charged with rooting out insurrection inside the government in the newly formed Imperial Security Bureau.
By 0 BBY, he had advanced to the rank of colonel in the Bureau and was serving as the leader of the ISB contingent and a member of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's staff on the first Death Star.
When the Death Star was attacked by the Rebel Alliance, Yularen was aboard, and he died when Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker destroyed the station.

# Section 1

Wullf Yularen was raised on Anaxes by an elite Coruscanti family.
Thull, Yularen's father, was a famed naval teacher who expected perfection from his cadets.
Wullf began researching historical events like the Waymancy Storm and the Pius Dea Crusades with his father at a young age, hoping to follow in his father's footsteps and pursue a naval career.
Yularen attended Prefsbelt IV's old Naval Academy and chose to serve in the Planetary Security Forces over the Judicial Fleet, which was thought to have a weaker military tradition.
Yularen served in the Kwymar Sector Forces.

# Section 2

In 34 BBY, Yularen was part of a Republic task force tasked with breaking the blockade of Malastare, which was engulfed in a fuel allotment dispute with the Corporate Alliance.
Yularen was officially present as a military observer, but his expertise with Sikurd's pirates in the Kwymar sector made him de facto commander against the Sikurdian privateers who made up the Corporate Alliance fleet.
The Republic army was nearly crushed by the Harch Admiral Trench's fleet in the Battle of Malastare Narrows that followed.
Trench was thought to have gone down with his ship, but he later re-appeared in the Clone Wars to taunt the Republic.

# Section 3

Because leaks in Republic law-enforcement organisations regularly tipped off his targets, Yularen's stint with the Kwymar fleet left him preoccupied with discovering corruption and safeguarding security.
He eventually resigned from the sector fleet to seek a career in intelligence as a result of the lack of security.
His family background got him a job as a special agent in the Senate Bureau of Intelligence.
He made a career in this Bureau and his dedication caught the eye of Palpatine.
Palpatine appointed him to an anti-corruption team within the Office of the Supreme Chancellor, which investigated both government corruption and individuals' affiliations to the rising Separatist movement.
Palpatine and the direction in which he intended to take the Republic quickly gained Yularen's admiration.
He became a devoted disciple and a trusted operative for Palpatine's inner circle very quickly.
After the Senate disbanded the team Yularen retired to the planet of Anaxes.
Palpatine was however not willing to let him go yet.

# Section 4

Palpatine enticed Yularen out of retirement when the Clone Wars broke out, offering him a promotion to admiral and a rank in the Republic Navy.
Yularen accepted, deciding to keep as far away from the intelligence community as possible.
He was one of the Republic's youngest officers at the time.
He was deployed to a massive task force led by Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker a year into the conflict.
Palpatine warned Yularen about Skywalker's unconventionality when appointing him to Skywalker's fleet, but maintained that it was the "greatest praise." Yularen would often not agree with Skywalker’s reckless tactics but eventually learned to respect him.

# Section 5

During his time as a Republic officer, he fought numeral battles, including the battles of Christophsis, Teth, Kiros, Bothawui, the liberation of the Zygerrian servants, the destruction of the Malevolance, the battle of Kamino, the Liberation of Ryloth, the assault on Geonosis and many more.
Yularen became a very successful Admiral.
Once the Republic got re-organised into the Empire, Wullf rejoined the Intelligence business.
During the early years of the Empire, Yularen led his own special task group, which was tasked with high-level missions, frequently involving an Imperial senator or other significant figures.
One of these tasks was to look into the names of the signatories of the Petition of 2000, a document delivered to Palpatine by Senator Padmé Amidala on behalf of the Delegation of 2000, a vociferous group of senators opposed to Palpatine's growing power.

# Section 6

Yularen had risen to the rank of colonel in the ISB at the commencement of the Rebellion and had earned a reputation as an excellent leader with unwavering personal loyalty to Palpatine.
As a member of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's command staff, he was assigned to the nearly-completed Death Star I battle station, and due to the presence of ambitious high-ranking officers like Tarkin and Admiral Conan Antonio Motti, he was there to ensure that the station's personnel remained absolutely loyal to the Emperor.
Yularen and other members of the Death Star's command staff, including Tarkin, Motti, and General Tagge, met in a conference room in 0 BBY to discuss the Empire's current status.
For the majority of the discussion, the colonel stayed mute, calmly observing Motti and Tagge argue about the threat the Rebel Alliance posed to the Empire's forces.
Yularen remained stoic even when Tarkin arrived with the news that the Emperor had disbanded the Imperial Senate.
He sat calmly as Darth Vader, who was once Yularen's Jedi commander Anakin Skywalker, choked Motti for his disbelief in the Force's powers.

# Section 7

Right after the meeting, the Death Star got infiltrated by a group of rebels.
They freed Princess Leia out of the detention levels and got out safely with the sacrifice of Obi-Wan Kenobi.
The Empire was able to put a tracking device on their ship, which allowed them to track the rebels to Yavin 4, where their base was located.
Once they arrived there to try and blow the moon up, the Rebels launched an attack on the station, which was successful.
The station blew up and with that Wullf Yularen came to an end.
