# Introduction
Bala Nisi was a force sensitive female human.
She had black hair that she would keep in dreadlocks most of the time.
Nisi was a Jedi Master, and her affiliations were with the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic.
She was also involved in the Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council as she saw membership through the Great Hunt event and the Mandalorian Wars.
While Nisi still held a position on the enclave council on the date of 3964 BBY, she would later lose her position to Master Dorak by 3956 BBY.

# Section 1
During her time, her opinion on Jedi Duron Qel-Droma and his bloodline based relationship to Sith Ulic Qel-Droma was less harsh.
While other Jedi such as Vrook Lamar treated Duron harshly on the matter, Nisi had a different opinion, deciding not to hold the cousins' choice against Duron.
She believed that it is not someone’s or something’s bloodline that decided whether or not they follow the dark path of the Sith, but the choices they made as their own individual.
Nisi was against the situation though when Duron took when his small team of three was sent to Korriban to purge the planet’s terentateks population.
Nisi felt that the party was too small and would fall to the planet's dark influence.
