# Introduction

Anakin Skywalker was a Force-sensitive human male born on the planet of Tatooine to his mother, named Shmi Skywalker-Lars, in the year 41 BBY.
During Anakin’s youth, he served under a mechanic lord named Watto.
As a child, Anakin served him in many ways, such as repairing ships and other forms of machinery to please Watto’s customers.
Because of this lifestyle, Anakin grew up to resent and hate the life he was delved in, as well as life on Tatooine in general.
Eventually, Anakin was discovered by Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi Master who dedicated himself to making sure Anakin was trained in the ways of the Force.
When Qui-Gon Jinn requested to train Anakin, the Jedi High Council declined his request due to Anakin being too old to be trained.
However, Qui-Gon was convinced, as mentioned in Jedi Philosophy, that Anakin was the Chosen One.
Then and there, he decided to take matters into his own hands.
Since his ship missed the parts it needed to enter hyperspace, Anakin took part in the classic Boonta Eve Podracing event, which allowed him to grant Qui-Gon enough money to buy new parts.
Little did Anakin know that winning this would also grant him freedom due to a deal made between Qui-Gon and Watto.
Shortly after this, Qui-Gon Jinn lost his life at the hands of Darth Maul.
This meant that Anakin would be trained by Obi-Wan Kenobi instead.

During Anakin’s time serving as a Jedi, he participated in and was also a huge part of the Clone Wars.
He also participated in many adventures by the side of Obi-Wan Kenobi, but as the Separatist Crisis escalated and threatened the Republic, Anakin was reunited with Amidala and was assigned to protect her in 22 BBY.
Despite being caught up in the Battle of Geonosis and the Clone Wars, both Anakin and Amidala grew very close to each other during their assignment.
Anakin also soon received a cybernetic arm after losing his real one during a battle with Count Dooku.
Days after this battle, Anakin and Amidala were secretly married to each other despite the restrictions from the Jedi Order on any form of romantic attachment.
The Clone Wars continued to rage for a few ongoing years, and with this, Anakin was granted the rank of Jedi Knight.
He was even known as the “Hero With No Fear” to the public for his multiple efforts of heroism and acts of bravery during the Clone Wars.
After receiving his rank, Anakin soon oversaw the teachings of the Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano.

# Section 2

In 19 BBY, Skywalker learned the real identity of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine.
He was Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord who orchestrated the entire Clone Wars while remaining elusive with the goal of ruling the galaxy.
Upon learning this, Anakin reported this finding to Jedi Master Mace Windu.
Master Windu took swift action to this and gathered his skilled Jedi fighters to confront the Supreme Chancellor.
After a brutal fight between Palpatine and Windu, Anakin managed to save the life of Palpatine at the last minute by making Mace Windu vulnerable to Palpatine’s deadly lightning attack.
After this, Palpatine managed to manipulate Anakin into thinking that the Jedi were traitors with a plot to overthrow the Republic.
His fear of losing Amidala to childbirth caused Anakin to stray and believe Palpatine, resulting in him, along with the 501st Legion and the rest of the Clone Army, annihilating the Jedi Order under the command of Palpatine, led by Anakin Skywalker himself.
This operation was called “Order 66”.
Palpatine officially dubbed Anakin from that moment on Darth Vader.
