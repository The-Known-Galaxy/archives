Plo Kloon became a Jedi Master in the order, and soon became a member of the Jedi High Council.
As a Master, Plo Koon became a fighter in the Clone Wars.
During these wars, Plo was assigned as one of the two hundred and twelve Jedi who were assigned to saving Obi-Wan Kenobi from the planet Geonosis.
On their way to save Kenobi, and a few others, Plo Koon found himself in battle with the Geonosians, who were also aided by the droid army.
Due to the unbalance between parties, the Jedi strike team began to fall, many dying due to the onslaught of the droid army.
Plo Koon and the other surviving Jedi were surrounded, but Count Dooku, a Sith Lord ordered the droids to fall back.
Dooku offered for them to surrender, which Plo and the Jedi refused.
Due to their refusal, Dooku was going to order the droids to execute them, but a miracle occurred.
Master Yoda and the Clone army flew down, backing up and saving Plo and the other living Jedi, allowing them to escape safely.

# Section 3

Plo Koon attended a Jedi High Council meeting, where they overviewed and decoded a transmission from Master Chubor, who was the head of evacuation of civilians in Mahranee, which had recently been invaded by the droid armies.
During this transmission, Count Dooku had ordered his army to lay waste to the fleeing civilian convoys, killing Master Chubor and many innocent civilian lives.
Dooku insisted his cause of action was due to the Jedi resistance.
The Jedi Council believed he also opened fire due to the fact that the Jedi forces were too thinned out, leaving many places open to the onslaught of the droid army.
Plo Koon and the Council placed the blame on Count Dooku, and planned to assassinate him, so no more lives would be lost.Master Quinlan Vos was assigned on the assassination mission of Count Dooku, along with Dookuâ€™s ex-apprentice Asajj Ventress.
