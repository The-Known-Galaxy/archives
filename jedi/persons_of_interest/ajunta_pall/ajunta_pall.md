# Introduction

Ajunta Pall was a Jedi Master who would later be credited with starting the foundations of what would become known as the Sith Order and religion.
Ajunta Pall’s story is one of great controversy and tells a tale of perhaps the worst mistake the Jedi Order ever made, which resulted in the indirect creation of the Sith Order and subsequently began a series of conflicts still ongoing to this day in galactic history.

# Section 1

Ajunta Pall began as all young Jedi do, starting his life in the Jedi Academy, eventually being dubbed a Jedi Knight and later rising to the rank of Jedi Master.
Ajunta Pall was not a particularly exceptional Jedi but would have an expressed interest in studying alchemy.
He, along with numerous fellow Jedi, would dedicate their time to the studying of alchemy and conducted many experiments in an effort to progress their knowledge of the Force.
Unfortunately for Master Pall, he would come upon the ability to create life, something deemed unnatural by the Jedi Order.
Ajunta Pall had no malicious intent when discovering this but the Jedi Council saw it as too great a risk and decided to ban Ajunta Pall and his followers from furthering their studies under threat of expulsion from the Jedi Order.
Outraged by the lack of trust placed in them and what was essentially an insult to Ajunta Pall and his followers, the Jedi Master took the exaggerated action of declaring war on the Jedi Order with his followers.
This began a conflict known as the ‘’Hundred-Year Darkness’’.
Ajunta Pall and his followers would use their knowledge of creating life and infuse it with the dark side of the Force to create an army of creatures and followers capable enough of attacking the Jedi Order and the Republic.

Fortunately for the Jedi Order, they were able to beat back Ajunta Pall’s army, capturing the ex-Jedi Master and his followers and exiling them to the far reaches of the Outer Rim.
While travelling the Outer Rim in search of a world suitable enough to live on, the Dark Jedi discovered Korriban, the ancient homeworld of the Sith species.
While scouting the world of Korriban the Dark Jedi would discover the Sith species, while not a particularly intelligent species they had developed methods of employing the dark side of the Force that Ajunta Pall and the Jedi Order had not previously known about.
Ajunta Pall and his Dark Jedi followers were quick to become the authority on the world, utilizing their mastery of the Force and alchemy, the Sith and their Kissai Priests believed the Dark Jedi to be the embodiment of their many Gods and began to worship Ajunta Pall and his followers, labelling Ajunta Pall specifically as a Dark Lord, cementing him as the first Dark Lord of the Sith.
Ajunta Pall would establish the first Sith Empire and conquer the neighbouring worlds of Korriban.

Ajunta Pall and his followers would establish many of the traditions of the Sith that would exist for thousands of years, including the authoring of the Sith code, the creation of the Sith tradition known as the Kaggath and the Sith Academy, which would see particularly Force-sensitive individuals adopted into the newly found Sith Order to train them as fully-fledged Sith, in a somewhat similar manner to the Jedi Academy.
It was known that Ajunta Pall fought other Sith Lords during his reign and his Sith Empire was no stranger to civil war and infighting.
Sith Lords at the time sought to gain the knowledge and power of each other and the tradition of political deception and infighting can be credited to Ajunta Pall’s Sith Empire.
The death of Ajunta Pall would take place but how or when is unknown.
It is theorised that Ajunta Pall was killed by a rival Sith Lord, as it is known Ajunta Pall’s Sith Empire would fall to infighting and betrayal.
He would be buried on Korriban within a personalised tomb, it would be the first tomb within the Valley of the Dark Lords, a place in which many notable Sith would be buried in later years.

The legacy of Ajunta Pall and the mistakes of the Jedi Order would never be lost to the galaxy.
Ajunta Pall’s spirit would live on for another few millennia within his tomb and during his time as a spirit he would grow to be regretful of his actions and the creation of the Sith Empire.
In hindsight he knew he was wrong and sought redemption, redemption that was eventually granted when Revan laid his spirit to eternal rest.
Ajunta Pall’s teachings and the teachings of his followers would sow the foundations of the Sith Order for thousands of years, particularly the creation of the Sith code.
Ajunta Pall would forever be credited as the first Dark Lord of the Sith, a truly impressive title.
