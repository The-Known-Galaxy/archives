# Introduction

Bastila Shan was a female human born in 3,979, years before the Jedi Civil War.
She was born on the planet Talravin with Helene Shan, her mother.
Her mother gave Bastila up to the Jedi order, believing she would have a better lifestyle in the order than where she was now.
She was a gifted jedi with a rare Force ability known as battle meditation.
This would have increased her allies morals while decreasing her enemies morals.
During her time in the order she was sent to capture Malak and Revan as leader of the Jedi strike team.
They were in the middle of a duel when both Revan and Malak were separated during their duel.

As a result, Malak managed to escape to his ship and fire upon Revans ship.
After this both Bastila Shan and Revan were greatly injured but Revanâ€™s injuries were worse.
She used the force to stabilize his injuries, this created a bond between the sith lord and the jedi master.
When they returned to the temple the council decided to erase Revans memory temporarily which reprogrammed revan into a loyal soldier of the republic.
In the final years of the war, Shans Republic ship was attacked by Malak's fleet above the outer rim planet Taris.
She managed to flee the ship alongside Commander Carth Onasis, a republic commander.

She was then captured by a swoop gang known as the Black Vulkars.
Thankfully Revan and Onasis were able to track her location and save her from the gang.
Years later revan and Bastila had a child, which they then got married soon after.
Revan began to get visions of sith threats, fearing that he would put his wife and child's life at risk, soon after these terrible visions he left for the unknown regions to hunt for sith threats.
Bastila and her child continued to survive the era of strife that followed with the jedi civil war.
