# Introduction

Mawhonic was a legendary Gran male podracer.
He utilized a green Galactic Power Engineering Podracer that was maintained by him and his fellow Gran crew.
His GPE-3130 contained a turbo package that assisted his efforts when necessary.
A flaw in his podracer was that his cockpit was open and did not fully enclose him.
Mawhonic was an excellent pilot, but he lost composure when Sebulba started to play dirty.
