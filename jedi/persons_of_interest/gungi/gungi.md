# Introduction
Gungi, a member of the Jedi Order, was a Wookie from Kashyyyk.
His species were known as excellent war heroes.
Gungi was a youngling during the time of the Clone Wars with his friends Petro, Katooni, Byph, Ganodi, and Zatt.
He would spend all of his time with these acquaintances.
A significant trait that he learned from his trials as a youngling was patience, as he had many treacherous encounters with his fellow younglings during his time.

# Section 1
The first of many of his treacherous journeys would be when he and his fellow younglings were searching for their crystals on Ilum.
Once they boarded the Crucible, a Jedi ship where younglings would craft their lightsabers after their crystal gathering.
While they were in space, they were attacked by Hondo and his band of pirates.
After they evaded their attackers, they had to adventure to Florum to rescue Padawan Ahsoka Tano.
This is where he and his fellow younglings encountered General Grievous.
They luckily made it all back to the Jedi Temple alive after their possibly fatal encounter.
Sometime after, he witnessed Jedi Guardian Anakin Skywalker engage in combat with Padawan Barriss Offee during the time of the bombing at the Jedi Temple.
