# Introduction

General Var Suthra was a Republic Strategist who was born some time before 3681 BBY, fighting in the Great Galactic War as a Republic soldier, and alongside Jedi Master Orgus Din witnessed the destruction of the Jedi Temple at the hands of Darth Malgus.
By 3653 BBY, Var Suthra had been promoted to General, and oversaw numerous superweapon projects.
Var Suthra’s projects had been infiltrated by the Sith Lord Tarnis, who having posed as a Republic scientist had stolen many of the schematics and given them to the Sith Empire.
A Jedi Knight who was later to become the Jedi Battlemaster worked with Var Suthra to expose and defeat Tarnis, marking the start of Var Suthra’s role as the Knight’s liaison to the Republic.

Var Suthra and the Knight completed missions across Taris, Nar Shaddaa, Tatooine and Alderaan, destroying or capturing several of the weapons that Tarnis had created for the Sith Empire.
These projects included the Shock Drum, Power Guard and Death Mark Laser, each possessing extremely destructive potential.
Var Suthra was one of the leading Republic Commanders during the Battle for Corellia during the Second Great Galactic War, working once again with the Knight to avoid disaster in Coronet City.
Var Suthra’s close ally and friend, Doctor Nasan Godera was killed during the battle, greatly angering and saddening the General.
