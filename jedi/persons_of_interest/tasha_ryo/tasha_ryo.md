# Introduction
Tasha Ryo was a female Twi’lek Je’daii Journeyer who served the Je’daii Order on the planet Tython at the height of the Infinite Empire’s reign.
The Clan Ryo was an upper-class Twi'lek family, originating in the Ryo Fortress on the planet Shikaakwa, where many members of the Je'daii Order originated from.
Tasha Ryo was trained through the methods of the Je'daii order, where she, and others would recognize her preference for the use of Force abilities, instead of a weapon.
This unique trait would earn her the title of Je'daii Journeyer, due to her proficiency in the usage of the Force.

# Section 1
The trait that made Tasha unique compared to other Je'daii was that she only used the Force.
Her proficiency was shown in the event of an assassination attempt on Volnos Ryo, where she'd locate and counter the assassin with guidance from her abilities.
She would inevitably defeat the assassin, saving Volnos Ryo from death.
