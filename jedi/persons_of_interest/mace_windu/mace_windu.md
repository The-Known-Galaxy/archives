# Introduction

Mace Windu was a Force-sensitive human male that worked on the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Republic.
During this time, he once served as an elected leader of the jedi and a Jedi general of the grand army of the Republic.
He was known as the greatest champion of the order and promoted its traditions amidst the ancient traditions of the dark side of the Force.

# Section 1

When the Seperatist crisis created the Confederacy of Independent systems and the clone army, Mace Windu and the Jedi rallied the defense of the republic and became leaders of the grand army of the Republic.
Mace Windu served throughout many wars and was an overseer of the war effort as well as an advisor to the supreme chancellor Sheev Palpatine.

# Section 2

Throughout the war Mace Windu became suspicious of the chancellor's motives and his near dictating power over the Galactic Senate.
He sent Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to spy on the chancellor in order to obtain information.
As Windus predictions were true, Anakin informed Windu that Palpatine was the sith lord behind all the threats between Padme and plots.
When Mace Windu, Kit Fisto, Agen Kolar, Saesee Tin came to confront the chancellor.
This caused 3 of the 4 Jedi masters to be slaughtered by Palpatine leaving Mace Windu dueling the Sith Lord.

# Section 3

Anakin could sense something was wrong and went to check on the situation, this caused a distraction between the duel.
When Mace Windu was about to strike down the Chancellor and Sith lord once and for all, Anakin ignited his saber and severed the hand off of Mace Windu.

# Section 4

This gave Palpatine the advantage to finish Mace with a shock of Force lightning, throwing him off the building and into the depths of Coruscant, killing the Jedi Master.
Anakin felt much regret for what he had done, but it was too late, Palpatine then gave him the name of Darth Vader, as his Sith name.
