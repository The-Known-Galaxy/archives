# Introduction
Gideon was a clever and formidable human male Imperial Officer who served the Galactic Empire in the Imperial Security Bureau, and later achieved the rank of Moff and after the Galactic Empire fell, he became an Imperial warlord during the era of the new Republic.
During his service in the Imperial Security Bureau, not only was he a regular ISB officer but an officer for the law enforcement and intelligence agency of the Galactic Empire as well.
One of the largest operations he was part of during the Imperial Era was the Great Purge of Mandalorians.
After the great fight they had, Gideon took the Darksaber into his possession, to remind any surviving Mandalorians which side was truly in control.
This ancient blade was previously held by Bo-Katan Kryze, this caused her to chase Gideon from across the galaxy in hopes of regaining the symbol of Mandalorian leadership.

# Section 1
After many years of service in the Galactic Empire and the death of Emperor Palpatine,
Gideon was awarded the rank of Moff in the Imperial army for his actions against the Rebel Alliance.
While the Rebellion was shredding the remains of the Imperial Fleet, Moff Gideon faked his execution for all the war crimes he had committed.
This allowed him to continue his operations and begin reviving the Empire without the fear of being attacked by the new Republic.



# Section 2
After the Galactic Empire fell and the era of the new Republic began, Gideon with his undying loyalty didn’t hesitate to do whatever it took to revive the Empire from scratch.
To do this, he planned on acquiring a valuable asset, a force-sensitive infant, Grogu.
The client and Doctor Pershing were given the task to bring this asset to him alive by any means necessary, he also used whatever was remaining of the Imperial Army to secure it.
With the help of Dark troopers, Gideon managed to bring the asset aboard his Imperial light cruiser.
Gideon did many tests to study Grogu’s abilities and DNA, to understand it better.
A team consisting of Mandalorians and Rebels led by Din Djarin was sent to rescue Grogu from the tyrannical wrath of Gideon and the Empire.
They infiltrated the main hangar of Gideon’s cruiser and advanced while taking down any Imperial stormtroopers and officers.
Djarin was able to eject a squad of Dark troopers into space momentarily, shortly after that -
  - he engaged with Moff Gideon in a melee fight.
Djarin managed to knock out Gideon with
his beskar staff and dragged him on the bridge where the rest of his infiltration team was.
Not long after the Darktroopers arrived back on the cruiser and began spreading out all across the ship.
However, a large portion of them began marching towards the bridge to terminate any trespassers and rescue the Moff.
Things took an unexpected turn when Luke Skywalker’s X-wing arrived on the cruiser’s starboard hangar.
With his green lightsaber, Luke began disassembling dark troopers one by one.
After Gideon witnessed this, knowing his plan had failed, he attempted suicide with a hidden blaster pistol he carried but was knocked unconscious by former rebel shock trooper Cara Dune.
Moff Gideon was eventually taken into custody into a highly secured new Republic prison due to his long list of war crimes and service in the Galactic Empire.
