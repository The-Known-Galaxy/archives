# Introduction

Walon Vau, a male human who eventually would become a Mandalorian.
He was born on the planet of Irmenu and became the heir to the title known as ‘Count of Gesl’.
However, Vau was kicked out of his homeworld, Irmenu, due to the fact he had an affair with a known princess of a neighbouring place.
Due to the fact, Vau was kicked out of his hometown, he eventually would become a Mandalorian soon afterward.
He would be eventually recruited by Jango Fett and joined the rank of Cuy’val Dar and would help in training the Clone Army.

# Section 1

Walon Vau believed that the clones he trained for battle should become Mandalorian when they eventually get older.
He did not treat his clones like Kal Skirata did, he treated them with strict discipline which sometimes included violence due to this being the mandalorian way.
Sometimes he would create fire exercises, fights against one another or even melee matches to prepare them to be tougher than everyone else.
One of the clones known as Atin, decided to fight against Vau, however, Atin lost and for a month was put inside a bacta tank.
The only way he believed he had brought them up right was by putting them through true pain, teaching them what it's like, and being ready for it when it comes to them in an actual battle.

Vau and someone named Skirata often and majourily disagreed with each other's training techniques due to the outcome of Vau’s and Atin’s fight, which put him inside a bacta tank for a month.
Due to the battle that occurred between Atin and Vau, Skirata and Vau had one, almost ending in Vau being murdered by Skirata.
Even if it did not look like Vau cared for his clones, he did, you can see this when Sev, also known as RC-1207 went missing, Vau dedicated himself to trying to find that lost clone.

# Section 2

Walon Vau’s techniques were proven very efficient and effective during the Clone Wars.
Vau had lost three members of his clone group, however, his enemy Skirata had already lost fourteen members.
Once his contract ended when he was a member of Cuy’val Dar, he decided to go back to being a normal citizen.
Kal Skirata surprisingly recruited Walon Vau to help him in destroying the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
This mission put him in close contact with the clone he swore on finding, Atin.
Due to the fact of Atin’s and Vau’s history, Atin swore that he was going to murder Vau one day, but did not as he wanted to keep the mission going safely and securely.

Jedi Knight Etain Tur-Mukan and Walon Vau at the end of the mission decided to work together to stop the terrorist leader, known as Perrive.
Vau showed off all of his superior sniper skills by executing Perrive in one single shot of his gun.

# Section 3

Walon Vau’s former clone, Atin, swore to get his revenge again once he realised the mission was a success and completed.
He one day found Vau and fought him, however, neither of them won due to the fact a Jedi General known as Bardan Jusik separated them both before either one of them murdered the other.
Vau and Atin’s argument seemed to calm down and they resolved their problem on very, very loose terms.

# Section 4

Walon Vau eventually joined a squad known as Delta Squad that was located on the planet Mygeeto.
He had the Delta Squad help him to break into the bank known as Dressian Kiolsh Merchant Bank, where he stole his family inheritance from his family vault.
Then, Vau fell inside of a pit almost freezing to death when trying to escape, however, Skirata and Ordo rescued the almost dead-man.
He gave everything to Skirata to help him in the search for a way to stop the clown’s ageing.

Later on, Vau decided to join Ordo and Skirata on the planet of Mandalore.
When this was happening, a man named Null-10 decided with Vau that when Vau died, someone named Jaing would take care of someone named Mird.

Vau was asked by a man named Zey to keep an open eye on Skirata as he was being currently suspected of treason.
However, Vau betrayed Zey and told Skirata about what he was being suspected of but promised Skirata that this will not be told to anyone or even go anywhere.

Once Order 66 and the battle of Coruscant have finished Vau and Skirata helped each other escape taking some of the clones that had joined the clan named Clan Skirata to a secret location on Mandalore.
Vau decided to majourily help Skirata with his work which was to stop the clone ageing acceleration.

# Section 5

Walon Vau decided to try and find his lost clone, Sev on Kashyyyk however he failed and was unable to find Sev.
Due to the fact, he failed his rescue mission, he went back to the secret location \[Kyrimorut\] that was on Mandalore and returned to the Clan Skirata.
He was disgusted and mad at Skirata as he was allowing Jedi to escape using the route that was for clones that were leaving the empire.
