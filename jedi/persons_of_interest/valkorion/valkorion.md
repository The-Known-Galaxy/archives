# Introduction

Valkorion was a Force-sensitive human male born in ancient Zakuul and the Emperor of the Eternal Empire.
Centuries prior to the Galactic War, the Sith entity known as Tenebrae had possessed the warrior, completely eradicating his mind and taking over the empty husk that was left.
Using his new host body, he meticulously forged his Empire over several centuries, adored by his people as the benevolent Immortal Emperor.
He saw Zakuul as a playground, a place where he could have new experiences without the burden of archaic Sith teachings.

# Section 1

Valkorion was a renowned champion of ancient Zakuul, a planet once home to superstitious nomadic tribes, the leaders of which were Force-sensitives.
The tribes worshipped a pantheon of gods, but at the height of the Old Ways emerged a prophecy of a Demon Saviour that would topple the Old Gods and usher in an era of prosperity.
Under the control of Tenebrae, Valkorion claimed the role of the Demon Saviour, unifying the tribes into his Eternal Empire and launching a campaign against the Old Ways.
The Immortal Emperor assigned the tribal leaders as his first Knights of Zakuul, an order of Force-sensitive warriors that fanatically imposed his will.
From the Knights came a sect known as the Scions of Zakuul, whose Force visions were used in his search for the Eternal Fleet concealed by Wild Space.

# Section 2

Decades before the Galactic War, Valkorion fathered three children with Senya Tirall, a Knight of Zakuul and member of his elite guard.
He lacked compassion towards his children, yet his twin sons Arcann and Thexan aspired to gain his attention.
Valkorion’s daughter, Vaylin, inherited immense strength in the Force, which both pleased and frightened him.
He sent her away to Nathema for mental conditioning, where she faced extreme torture and cruelty for several years.
The Immortal Emperor favoured his eldest son, Thexan, for his calm and collected nature, in stark contrast to Arcann’s impetuous behaviour.
In 3636 BBY, his twin sons proposed to command skirmishes against the perimeter worlds of the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire.
Valkorion only allowed for Thexan to lead the raids, however Arcann joined his brother and by doing so disobeyed his father.
Following the twins’ return to the Eternal Throne, Arcann attempted to murder his father after Valkorion turned his back on them, the breaking point for his years of built-up resentment all due to Valkorion’s indifference.
Thexan intervened, only to be struck down by his own brother while the Immortal Emperor paid attention, ordering his now only son to come with him.
In the same year, the Outlander was brought before the Eternal Throne, leading to Valkorion’s assassination and his death in a blast of Force energy.
The entity that resided in him had survived and clung onto the Outlander, continuing to assume the identity of Valkorion in a series of Force visions and apparitions until the Outlander purged Tenebrae from their mind.
A decade later in 3626 BBY, Valkorion’s likeness was formed in the mindscape of Satele Shan when the imprint of the Sith entity attempted to rebirth himself into the galaxy.
