# Section 1

Colonel Kaplan was a human male who served in the military branch of the First Order during their conflict with the Resistance, a faction opposing the First Order and an offshoot of the New Republic.
Holding the rank of colonel, Kaplan was stationed aboard the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer.
His specific role was within the main control room for Hangar Six, a crucial area for the Finalizer's operations.
Colonel Kaplan found himself on board the Finalizer as it embarked on a mission to the planet Jakku.
The objective of the mission was to retrieve a portion of the map that revealed the whereabouts of the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker.
The First Order sought to find Skywalker, recognizing his significance to the Resistance and the galaxy's fate.
During the operation, the First Order deployed forces to the village of Tuanul, where the retired explorer Lor San Tekka resided.
Despite the First Order's efforts, the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron managed to elude capture, thanks to his trusty astromech droid BB-8.
Unfortunately for Kaplan and his comrades, the encounter resulted in the death of Lor San Tekka.

The situation took a dramatic turn when Poe Dameron was brought on board the Finalizer for interrogation.
Capitalizing on the chaos, FN-2187, a stormtrooper seeking to defect from the First Order, orchestrated Dameron's escape.
The pair made their way to Hangar Six, where they attempted to flee in a TIE/sf space superiority fighter from Bay Two.
However, their escape was hindered by the fact that the starfighter's support cable was still attached.
Petty Officer Thanisson, stationed in the control room, noticed the escape attempt and promptly alerted Colonel Kaplan.
Kaplan quickly grasped the gravity of the situation and ordered the prevention of the TIE fighter's escape, while also notifying General Armitage Hux, the commanding officer of the First Order.
In response to the unsanctioned departure, squads of stormtroopers armed with F-11D blaster rifles and FWMB-10 repeating blasters attempted to shoot down the escaping TIE fighter.
However, FN-2187 skillfully utilized the starfighter's Lb-14 dual heavy laser turret to counter their efforts, eliminating a significant number of pursuing stormtroopers.
Realizing the threat posed by the control room, FN-2187 turned the turret on Kaplan and Petty Officer Thanisson.
A devastating explosion erupted as the turret's fire shattered the control room's windows, throwing Thanisson from his seat.
Both Kaplan and Thanisson lost their lives in the explosion.
