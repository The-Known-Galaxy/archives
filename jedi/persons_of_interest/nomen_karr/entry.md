# Introduction

Jedi Master, Nomen Karr, was a Human who has led a life of obscurity.
Not much is known during his early years except that he became a Jedi Master.
Though you may not think of him as necessary because he never sat on a Council, in truth, he was instrumental with his young padawan, Jaesa Willsaam.

# Section 1

Like all Jedi, Noman Karr began his training at an unknown date in galactic history.
The next time we hear of Noman Karr is after he's granted the rank of Jedi Master.
Karr, much like other Jedi Masters, did not keep quiet about his opinions of the Jedi Order but was a very experienced Jedi Master.
The latter openly challenged the beliefs of the Order.
Before he crusaded against the armies of the Dark, Noman Karr took his first padawan, Somminick Timmns.
Much like his master, not much is known about Somminick Timmns during his time with Karr.
However, we are confident he finished his training shortly after the Treaty of Coruscant.
During Karr's crusade, he took up the pseudonym "Retrost." During this time, Nomen Karr went behind Imperial borders seeking information about this new Empire and the Sith.
During his years, he went undercover and routinely had to use the Dark Side of the Force, either to cement his cover or because he was curious.
From his espionage, Nomen Karr captured Darth Ekkage, Darth Baras's sister, and imprisoned her in Belsavis.
As a result of Nomen Karr's action, Darth Baras became aware of his presence and the two dueled on Nal Hutta.
Resulting in a stalemate; however, the most significant result of the duel would be their relationships.
Darth Baras sought revenge for Nomen Karr's betrayal, and Nomen Karr was certain that Darth Baras had a network of spies within the Republic.

Nomen Karr would continue in his attempts to expose Darth Baras's spies for some time.
However, Darth Baras managed to be two steps in front of him, securing his spy network.
During this time, Nomen Karr heard about a young Jaesa Willsaam, who had the unique ability we have yet to see again, which was to sense one's true nature within the Force.
Nomen Karr would quickly take her to the Jedi and claim her as his Padawan.
However, the Jedi High Council was suspicious of his padawan's power.
The Council decided to send Nomen Karr and Jaesa Willsaam to Tatooine to train highly respected Jedi Master Yonlach and Yul-Li.
During her training with Nomen Karr, Jaesa Willsaam would uncover at least three of Baras's spies, two on Nar Shaddaa and one on Balmorra.

# Section 3

As a result of Nomen Karr's new padawan, Darth Baras also got a new apprentice.
Bara's new mysterious apprentice was carving a path of blood.
Starting with Bara's exposed spies, then turning his attention to finding Nomen Karr and Jaesa Willsaam.
Nomen Karr prioritized hiding his padawan for as long as possible.
However, because of her strong connection to the Force, she could feel the devastation and the butchering of her parents, as well as Master Yonlach and Yul-Li, at the apprentice's hand.
Sometime after these deaths, Nomen Karr challenged Darth Baras to a duel on Nal Hutta, the place this all started; Darth Baras sent his apprentice in his stead.
During their fight, the apprentice taunted Nomen Karr into using the Dark Side, which he didâ€”focusing his rage and hate on defeating the apprentice.
Being fatally wounded during the duel resulted in him turning back to the light.
Imperial Troopers soon came to his aid and stabilized him.
The apprentice promised to torture him as he pleaded to die to save his padawan.
As a result, he turned to the dark side just when Jaesa arrived to duel the apprentice.
As she dueled with the apprentice, he taunted her into channeling the Dark Side of the Force.
When she failed and bowed to him, pledging her allegiance, the apprentice ordered her to kill her former Master, Nomen Karr.
The former padawan decapitated Nomen Karr in 3643 BBY.
