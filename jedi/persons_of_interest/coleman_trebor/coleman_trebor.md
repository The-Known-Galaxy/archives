# Section 1
When the Separatist force became known on the planet Geonosis, Coleman Trebor was one of the many Jedi led by Mace Windu to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi from being imprisoned by the Confederacy of Independent Systems at the Petranaki Arena.
During the battle, Trebor managed to infiltrate the stands, using his green-bladed lightsaber to confront the former Jedi Master Count Dooku with the intention to end his life.
Before he’s given the chance to do so, legendary bounty hunter Jango Fett, who was standing by Dooku at the time, managed to pull out his blasters and open fire at Trebor.
Deflecting two of the blaster shots with his lightsaber, the third and fourth shot eventually struck him, sending him over the balcony and falling to his death.
During Trebor’s brief time on the Jedi High Council before his life ended, Trebor was succeeded by Jedi Master Kit Fisto.
