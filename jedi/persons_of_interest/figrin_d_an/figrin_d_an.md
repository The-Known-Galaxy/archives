# Introduction
“Fiery” Figrin D'an was a male Bith who was the head of the band the Modular Hubs and the more youthful sibling of Barquin D'an.
Working in Jizz music, Figrin played a reed instrument known as a Kloo horn, as well as a percussion instrument called a Gasan string drum.
Like his band mates, Figrin was enlisted with the Intergalactic Federation of Musicians.
Areas of Figrin's profoundly developed mind permitted him an exceptional sharpness when it came to breaking down and connecting with music.
Truth be told, the Devaronian music fan Labria called him potentially the best klooist in the cosmic system.
All things considered, his abilities served to extraordinarily upgrade the quality and prominence of the Modular Hubs' music.

# Section 1
Before The Skirmish of Yavin, Figrin D'an and the Modular Hubs had gone into a selective agreement with the Tatooine wrongdoing master, Jabba Desilijic Tiure.
They would regularly act in the courts at Jabba's Castle and his Mos Eisley condo, however it wasn’t long before they all lamented going into an agreement with the Hutt.
Perceiving Jabba's affinity for executing subordinates that disappointed him immediately, the Modular Hubs started to fear for their lives.
It would just involve time before Jabba chose to make a nibble of the performers, by throwing one down into the prison dwelling place of his pet antipathy.
Luckily for them, an amazing chance was close by.



# Section 2
One of Jabba's adversaries, a Whiphid named Woman Valarian, offered the band 3k credits to perform at her wedding to the Whiphid tracker, D'Wopp.
Figrin concluded that the quick cash would empower them to get off Tatooine and free from the thumb of Jabba the Hutt.
They showed up at the Star Chamber Bistro banquet room within the Fortunate Autocrat Lodging and Club in Mos Eisley.
During one of their set breaks, Figrin took the band's retainer and spent the greater part of it at the club's sabacc tables.
Different artists became seriously concerned.
Because of Figrin betting, their possibilities of getting off Tatooine alive were rapidly waning.



# Section 3
Jabba learned of the Modular Hubs break of agreement and sent a few of his abundance trackers down to the club to disturb the merriments.
As it would turn out, magnificent stormtroopers moreover attacked the party and a gigantic fire-battle broke out.
During the disarray, the Modular Hubs met a party visitor named Wuher who showed them a speedy way out.
Wuher set the ball rolling in a good direction for them with Chalmun-a Wookiee who claimed a close-by saloon where Wuher mixed drinks.
Chalmun employed the Modular Hubs to play two or three gigs at his bar, the next evening.
They were playing out the night when Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi entered the saloon looking for a pilot able to ship them to the Alderaan framework.
They kept on performing at Chalmun's consistently.
Sometimes, Chalmun's nightshift director, Ackmena, would spice up the bar's climate by chiming in with the Modular Hubs' rhythms.



# Section 4
Not long after this occasion, Figrin D'an bet the band's instruments and gear on a hand of Sabacc.
He lost the bet to Labria, yet the Modular Hubs before long persuaded him to win their gear back.
He in the long run succeeded and the Modular Hubs proceeded to play the intergalactic circuit.
