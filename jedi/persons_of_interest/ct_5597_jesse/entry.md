# Introduction

CT-5597, known as “Jesse”, was a clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic under the 501st legion.
Jesse was under command of the 501st leaders, Commander Rex and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker.
He was born on Kamino on 32 BBY and died on 19 BBY.
Jesse was 1.83 meters tall and had brown eyes just like regular clones, as well as keeping his head clean-shaven.
Jesse had a Galactic Republic emblem tattoo that covered most of his face and a similar one on his helmet.
Jesse had a quick reaction when his clone captain got shot in one of his missions.
Instead of being worried and asking what to do, he took the injured Captain to the closest homestead for him to recover.

# Section 1

On one of his missions, he was assigned to hunt for the Droid Army leader, General Grievous.
The hunt occurred on the planet Saleucami on 21 BBY.
Jesse, along with fellow clones Kix and Hardcase, followed the hunt under the command of Captain Rex.
The clones were looking for escape pods that crashed along with Grievous’s starship.
To search quicker, the clones used BARC speeders.
While looking for escape pods, two Commando Droids had injured Rex.
Jesse, Hardcase, and Kix took Captain Rex to the closest homestead so he had time to recover.
Once at the homestead, a female Twi’lek named Suu greeted the clones by pointing a rifle at them.
Jesse and Kix explained to Suu that they needed somewhere to let Captain Rex recover.
After talking, Suu let the clones use her barn.
While the Captain was recovering from his injuries, Jesse led the two clones to Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was leading another group of clones at the time.
Continuing his service to the 501st Legion, Jesse went to the planet known as Umbara, which was aligned with the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
Once Jesse was on the planet, he fought in a battle with Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex.
Once they engaged the Umbaran Soldiers, Jedi General Pong Krell soon arrived.
Pong Krell was the interim leader of the 501st Legion, so with that role, he ordered “Jesse” and the other clones to take over Umbara’s capital city.
An airbase that was close to the capital was resupplying the city’s defenses, although Hardcase, along with fellow clone codenamed Fives, soon infiltrated the base.
Pong Krell’s troops still succeeded in their attempt to make the Umbaran militia surrender, providing the clones with a chance to rest and resupply at the base.
Once Jesse, along with the rest of the Republic troops learned of a Confederate supply ship arriving in the orbit of Umbara, Jesse and Hardcase joined in on Five’s mission of eliminating the supply ship.
In order to board the Confederate supply ship, the three clones had to use Umbaran Starfighters.
Once they were there, Hardcase sacrificed himself by staying behind to blow up the ship.
Jesse and Fives returned and were thrown into jail for disobeying Pong Krell’s orders.
The two clones were going to be executed until Krell revealed who he truly was, a traitor to the Republic.
Once the clones knew about this, Krell was killed, Jesse and Fives were set free and the battle became a Republic victory.
