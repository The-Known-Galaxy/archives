# Introduction

Feln, born on the planet Odryn, was an extraordinary warrior even before he reached the rank of Jedi Master.
He was a Feeorin with orange eyes and blue skin.
Feln was born during a time of conflict on his planet and he grew up in a place of conflict.
Feeorinsâ€™ strength scaled with their age, as time passed.
Feln ended up unifying all the tribes on his home planet.
He reached the rank Exalted; this means that he was the strongest of his people.
Being Exalted, he had access to the Sanctum of the Exalted, which was a sacred place only the Exalted could enter.
Then one day he was found by a Jedi Scout, who discovered Feln was force sensitive.

Feln started his journey within the Jedi Order and quickly climbed the ranks, showing great skill.
He attracted the attention of a Jedi Master named Krynda Draay, who specialised in training upcoming Jedi Seers.
Feln became a Jedi Master and a Jedi Seer; he also was a part of the Jedi Covenant and Jedi WatchCircle.
During his time, he trained a single padawan named Oojoh.
He saw a vision where his life along with the Order was destroyed.
The Jedi, a part of the WatchCircle, all agreed that the person who would bring this fate was one of their students.
They then killed all of their padawans, with only one escaping.
Feln tracked down the last padawan, locating him on his home planet of Odryn.
While chasing the last padawan Feln destroyed the Sanctum of the Exalted, he then died after his people turned on him.
