# Introduction

Xo Lakru was a Jedi Grand Master during the days of the High Republic.
He was of the Anx species and became a Jedi Master in 383 BBY.
He also became a High Councilor.
By 232 BBY, Xo became a Jedi Grand Master and was a part of the Nihil discussion.
Lahru believed that when Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh decided to unite the Republic Coalition and the Jedi Order to attack the Nihil raiders, it was too simplistic.
He claimed that the galaxy was as simple as that.
Eventually, the Order accepted the Chancellor’s offer and sent Jedi Master Estala Maru to assist.
Master Maru informed Xo about Jedi Master Avar Kriss’ plan to examine the body of a Hutt trader who was killed by Nihil onslaughters.
Lahru accepted the request.
