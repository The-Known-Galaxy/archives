# Introduction
The extremely dangerous criminal organization known as the Pyke Syndicate was led by male pyke known as Lom Pyke.
This dangerous and unpredictable Pyke leader was involved in the death of a Jedi Master, Syfo-Dyas.

# Section 1
The Republic sent Dyas on a mission to negotiate with pykes, since they were concerned about their spice trades.
During the negotiations, Lom Pyke received a call from another Jedi, Master Dooku, who introduced himself as Tyranus.
He requested Master Syfo-Dyas to be disposed of as soon as possible for a handsome prize.
Shortly after the pyke leader accepted the deal, Master Dyas was ordered on planet Felucia for another mission.
However, his ship was shot down as he attempted to leave the planet.
Master Syfo-Dyas’ body was taken to the Jedi Master, but unlike Dyas, the former aide of Syfo-Dyas was left alive in pyke’s prisons.
This Pyke leader also took part in Maul’s rising criminal organization known as the Shadow Collective.
Lom Pyke himself was part of the takeover of the Mandalorian capital city, Sundari.
He and other criminal leaders were later on arrested as planned by Maul and Pre-Vizsla, however, the Pykes were able to flee from the planet and return back to their homeworld.
Some time later when the Jedi began investigating the trail Count Dooku had left behind of Syfo-Dyas’ death, he was sent on Oba Diah to prevent the Jedi from possibly ruining his master’s plans.
After being accidentally knocked over by the Jedi, Lom Pyke was killed by Count Dooku before the Sith Lord left the planet.
