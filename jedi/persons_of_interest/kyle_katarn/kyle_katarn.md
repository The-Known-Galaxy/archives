# Introduction
Kyle Katarn was a force-sensitive human male who worked for the rebel alliance as an operative and later as a Jedi for the New Jedi Order.
He was a part of the Galactic Empire until he defected to the Rebellion.
In the Galactic Empire, he notoriously was known as Thorn.
Later on, Kyle Katarn would become a Jedi who wielded a green single-bladed lightsaber and a K-16 Bryar Pistol.

# Section 1
Katarn did not know of his force sensitivity until later on.
He would teach himself the ways of the Jedi as he searched for the Valley of the Jedi.
Eventually, Kyle Katarn would become a Jedi Master in the New Jedi Order and he would be seen fighting in the offensives of the Yuuzhan Vong War.
Finally, Katarn would see himself as a part of the Jedi High Council in the New Jedi Order.
		Born on Sulon 23 BBY, his father created a droid that Katarn thought of as a brother.
He grew to be able to understand the language droids speak.
He lost his mother at a young age and shortly after that enrolled into an Imperial Academy.
He came across many people during his time as a stormtrooper, such as Jan Ors an agent for the Rebellion.
Both came across each other and both were on opposite sides but he spared her life along with many others.
On his last mission, he got the news that his father died in a suspected rebel raid on his homeworld.
Little did he know that his father supported the Rebellion.
Because of the fact that his father was killed by rebels, he grew hateful towards the Rebellion.

Further, while on a pleasure cruise he stumbled across Jan Ors and Lando Calrissian.
It was while on this where Ors showed him footage of her droid captured during the battle of where his father died.
Jan Ors explained to Kyle how imperials staged the attack.
Katarn came to reality and realized what the empire has done, all his years of studying in the academy, he told the rebels imperial tactics.
He then joined the Rebellion, his first mission was to get the first plans of the death star operation name Skyhook.

		As the Empire fell, he joined Luke Skywalker’s New Jedi Order.
As a Jedi Knight, he fought Jerec and his dark Jedi.
Shortly after, Luke Skywalker offered to train Katarn, Katarn denied due to his great fear of the dark side.
Luke Skywalker again offered him a second offer to train him on the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin4, Kyle accepted thinking it would help him control his dark side.
Unfortunately, when 2 academy students fell to the dark side, he feared that he may fall too.
Because of this, he entrusted Luke Skywalker with his lightsaber and returned back to being a mercenary as Jan Ors’ partner.



# Section 3
By the time of the Empire Reborn movement which was under Admiral Galak Fyyar.
Ors was captured by a Dark Jedi named Desann and his student Tavion Axmis, she was apparently killed.
Angered by this, Kyle regained his force abilities by using the power of the Valley of the Jedi.
After their defeat of Desaan, Kyle was promoted to Jedi Master in the New Jedi Order.
In his time in the order, he took upon two students.

		Five years after the Yuuzhan Vong War, Katarn had become a respected Jedi Council member in the New Jedi Order.
