# Introduction
Ardinondu Dipolus Daeruun was a Krex male hailing from the planet Rokirex, and was a general in the Republic military forces among many high ranking officers.
Despite having an intimidating and fearless appearance, the general was not quite into battles.
He also had a passion for researching nature and cultures, art especially, some of his paintings had won contests in the Republic.
Daeruun could often be found enjoying a cup or two of gatalentan tea outside the battles, he would also offer it to his fellow workers and friends.
The general took part in many different military operations such as defending planet Ossus and preventing the location of a hidden Jedi temple being revealed to the Sith Empire.
Failing this mission could have compromised the future of this colony, making this one of the general’s high points during his career in the military.
