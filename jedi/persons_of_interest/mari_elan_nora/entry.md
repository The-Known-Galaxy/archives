# Introduction

If you’re familiar with the Argazdan, Kans sector and Lorrdian species then this individual will fit in nicely with your knowledge.
Mari-Elan Nora descended from slaves who were subjugated during the Argazdan Redoubt.
Naturally, she wanted revenge and to put an end to the subjugation.
She rose to the rank of Jedi Master during the ascension of the Sith Empire and ideally, whilst the enslavement of her people was still occurring.

The Galactic Senate permitted her noble quest, granting her a squadron of Knights and soldiers to lead against the Argazdans in an attempt to acquire freedom.

Nora and her forces fought ferociously after a long battle, acquiring victory in 3670 BBY.
This battle, titled “liberation of Lorrd” sent the Argazdans into a retreat under the infamous Slave Pits.
Nora attempted to capture them, but her forces never returned when sent into those hollow caves.

Nora utilised the Force and sensed an evil of tremendous power lay buried and chose to become a Jedi Watchman that oversaw the processes of the Kanz Sector.
She was later killed in Noremac by slavers, putting an unfortunate scar on her history.

# Section 1

A noble and true woman, who vanquished the relentless Argazdans.
She managed to convince the Galactic Senate, even during a time of war, to spare her enough soldiers to banish the Argazdans away from the Lorrdian population.

Despite the campaign being long against the Argazdans, lasting several months, the valiant lady achieved victory securing freedom for her people, an immensely wise cause.
The remaining Argazdan forces disappeared into the Pitts, and Nora was unwilling to seek them out further after several scouts had not returned.

She had been the Jedi who finally took the power from the Argazdans who had taken over (5) billion Lorrdian lives in their time of enslavement.
Nora was eventually killed by slavers, but immortalised through a hologram that famously portrayed her life.
