# Introduction

Artus Lok, later known as Mandalore the Vindicated, was a Human Mandalorian warrior from the Lok clan during the Great Galactic War.
After the Treaty of Coruscant’s signing the reigning Mandalore decided to create an event known as ‘The Great Hunt’ to increase support after a defeat in the Blockade of the Hydian Way.
The Great Hunt was on a galactic scale; Artus at some point became the Grand Champion of The Great Hunt and challenged the reigning Mandalore - Mandalore the Lesser - to a duel on Geonosis.
Artus successfully defeated Mandalore the Lesser and claimed the new title of Mandalore the Vindicated.
Artus began to consolidate power over the Mandalorian clans, quickly subduing an uprising by Jicoln Cadera to support the Republic.
However, Artus had plans to remain loyal to the Sith.

# Section 1

Respected and revered by his people, Mandalore the Vindicated had many friendships and close bonds within the Mandalorian Clans.
Despite this, he remained loyal to his position, even defeating his close friend Jicoln Cadera after their views had begun to sway on where the Mandalorians’ loyalties should be.

# Section 2

Artus was summoned to Ilum as part of an emergency war council for the purpose of discussing what to do with Malgus’ New Empire.
Mandalore the Vindicated was later presumed dead during the Eternal Empire’s Conquest.
It was rumoured by Mandalorian warriors, from his own Lok clan, to have seen Mandalore the Vindicated being swarmed by Skytroopers.
His disappearance after his last sighting justified that he died on the battlefield.
His death then later caused grudges to be formed with members of clans that were affiliated with droids.
His position as Mandalore was later filled reluctantly by Shae Vizla.
