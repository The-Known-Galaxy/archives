Gar Saxon would join the Empire, becoming the Imperial Viceroy of Mandalore.
Saxon would also become the feared leader of the Imperial Super Commandos.
The Imperial Super Commandos were Mandalorian Warriors who were loyal to the Galactic Empire.
During his time as Viceroy, he would encounter the rebellious Sabine Wren.
Saxon and Sabine would duel together once Saxon had possession of the Darksaber.

The blade was created by Tar Vizsla and had gone through many different owners.
