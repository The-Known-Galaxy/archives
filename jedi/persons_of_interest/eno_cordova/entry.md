# Section 1

Eno had interests in ancient civilizations, with this he would travel and try to find ancient artifacts.
After encountering the ruins of one of the Zeffo's temples on the planet Othorto, he became obsessed with the species Zeffo and their creations.
Zeffo is a planet where the Zeffo would live and create huge statues dedicated to their species sages.
Now the Zeffo's are an extinct species due to them falling to the dark side and corruption.
During the Clone Wars era, Eno Cordova discovered an ancient vault within the ruins on the planet Bogano and while he was meditaiting, he had a foresight into the future and saw the fall of the Jedi Order.
With this knowledge, Eno Cordova knew he had to preserve the future of the Jedi Order.
The first thing he did was hide a holocron containing the location of all force sensitive children within the Bogano vault.
Next he entrusted everything he had learned during his journey to his droid BD-1.
He was hoping his padawan Cere Junda or some other force sensitive would continue his mission if he should fall.
