# Introduction
Kvarn Mandel was a human male known among many star systems for being the head of a successful and promising company, Fabritech.
It specialized in making different sorts of tech, such as control systems for starships.
Their products varied from military grade to commercial use.
The company had the reputation of providing quality products that lasted long and were very effective regardless of the situation a ship was in.
Although Fabritech had sealed a contract between them and the Sienar Fleet Systems, components manufactured in their company were found on ships that belonged to the Rebellion.
News such as these greatly upset Fabritech’s leadership, especially Kvarn Mandel.

# Section 1
Running a significant corporation required a lot from him; however, Mandel always placed his family before anything else.
Even when most of the time his presence was required at the Fabritech headquarters, he made sure to visit his family at least once a month.
Mandel often tended to wear stylish attires and carried himself around very elegantly, giving him the appearance of a gentleman.
While he did possess the strength and harshness to lead such an enormous company, he was very kind-spirited and friendly when it came to talking to people in business terms or otherwise.
He had always been a strong believer in the Galactic Empire, though more after his company began flourishing during the Imperial rule.



# Section 2
He hit the low point when his youngest daughter went missing without a trace.
Several years passed, and no signs or explanations were found, not even by the bounty hunters they hired.
Mandel wanted to assure himself that she must have died by then.
The thought of her sliding into the ranks of the Rebel Alliance deeply feared him.
