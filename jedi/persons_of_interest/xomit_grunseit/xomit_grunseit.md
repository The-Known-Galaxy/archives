# Introduction
A feared criminal organization known as the Black Sun was led by a male Falleen named  Xomit Grunseit.
He had chosen their facility to be located on the planet Mustafar where he also began training and gathering his loyal warriors.
During the Clone Wars, Grunseit and other Black Sun leaders were confronted by Darth Maul, Savage Opress, and the leader of Death Watch, Pre-Vizsla.
He, like other crime organizations, was asked to join their cause.
However, Grunseit refused to become part of their so-called army and proceeded to mock them.
He then tried to order his men to terminate the intruders but one of the guards was killed and thrown on the table in front of all the Black Sun leaders.
The Sith Lord asked one final time for them to join their forces.
Grunseit and the rest of the leaders were beheaded by Savage Opress after refusing the offer for the second time.
