# Introduction
Praven was a Sith Lord and pureblood Sith Apprentice of Darth Angral during the Cold War and Galactic War.
Praven in turn trained Angral’s son, the Sith Lord Tarnis who would later infiltrate the Republic’s secret super weapons project.
During the Sacking of Coruscant in 3653 BBY, Praven defeated Jedi Master Usma, and killed many other Republic combatants.
Praven witnessed the Hero of Tython kill Tarnis, and was dispatched to Tantooine by Angral to take control of one of Tarnis’ projects, the Shock Drum.
The Shock Drum was capable of destabilizing a planet’s core, effectively destroying the planet.
Praven easily defeated Jedi Council member Bela Kiwiiks who was in charge of the Shock Drum’s defense, seizing the weapon and taking Kiwiiks prisoner.
Despite Angral ordering him to activate the Shock Drum and kill Kiwiiks, Praven’s strong sense of honour resulted in him ignoring the order, and instead challenging the recently arrived Hero of Tython to a duel for the codes.
Praven was defeated in the duel by the Hero of Tython, but instead of being executed, the Hero of Tython redeemed Praven, who was then accepted into the Jedi Order as a Padawan.
Praven was present on Corellia during the battle, working once again with the Hero of Tython who had been appointed Supreme Commander of all Jedi Forces on Corellia and ultimately joining the Republic in their victory against the Empire in the Battle of Corellia.
