# Introduction

The Minister for Intelligence, known only as ‘Keeper’ in reference to his past position within Imperial Intelligence, was a human spymaster during both the Cold War and Galactic War.
As the Keeper of Imperial Intelligence, he was responsible for overseeing the running and daily business of the agency, liaising with Fixers, Watchers, Minders and Cipher Agents from the headquarters of the Imperial Citadel on Dromund Kaas.
Upon his promotion, Keeper became the true leader of Imperial Intelligence, answering directly to the Dark Council.

# Section 1

Throughout the Galactic War, Keeper worked closely with Imperial Agent Cipher Nine, initially overseeing their work on the Cartel world of Hutta, before the untimely death of Dark Council member Darth Jadus forced Imperial Intelligence to begin investigating a terrorist cell led by an elusive figure named The Eagle.
After successfully dismantling the cell, and later infiltrating the Strategic Information Service (SIS) through the actions of Cipher Nine, Keeper would move onto his final mission, destroying the Star Cabal.
The Star Cabal consisted of a wide reaching network of infiltrators in both the Republic and Sith Empire, with members in Imperial Intelligence and the SIS, the Cabal strived to end both the Jedi Order and Sith, believing Force users to be too great a threat to the rest of the galaxy.
The Star Cabal used a variety of their resources to cripple Imperial Intelligence, and had Keeper placed under house arrest in Dromund Kaas.
However, despite the dissolution of the agency, Keeper created a coalition of former Intelligence Agents, and with Cipher Nine exposed and destroyed the Star Cabal.
Unfortunately for Keeper, Imperial Intelligence was instead replaced by Sith Intelligence, and the Minister was forced into an early retirement.

# Section 2

Despite being forced into retirement by the Dark Council, Keeper continued to play a minor role in the Empire, once again working with Cipher Nine to rescue former Intelligence asset Watcher Two from a pirate gang on Rishi.
After successfully rescuing Watcher Two and sending her to a private medical facility to remove her loyalty programing, Keeper returned to his retirement on Dromund Kaas.
