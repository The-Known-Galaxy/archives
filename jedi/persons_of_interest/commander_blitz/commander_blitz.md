# Introduction
Created and grown up on the Clone homeworld of Kamino, Blitz was trained and brought up just like any other in his unit.
Sometime along his journey in training, he was assigned to the ARC troopers, training and adapting to gain the skills required for the title - achieving the rank of Commander and serving in the coveted Rancor Battalion.
His duties were similar to those of Commander Colt, in charge of the training and overseeing the growth of the clone cadets.
He did this alongside the aforementioned Colt, and Commander Havoc.

# Section 1
As the assault on the Kaminoan cloning facility raged on, led by the infamous General Grievous and his separatist colleagues, he and a small detachment of ARC troopers were deployed.
Though unlike the other troopers defending their home from the inside, Commander Blitz and his men defended it on the outside.
When the Trident drills attached and dug themselves into the hull of the facilities, Blitz saw the immediate issue and took action against the source of the battle droid’s deployment method.
He led an assault against the drills, taking a good number of them out, as well as the accompanying battle droids.
Unfortunately, he was one of the two only ARC troopers to survive in his detachment, the rest having fallen in the heat of battle.
