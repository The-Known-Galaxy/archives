# Introduction

Dorwin Corvax, commonly known as the Black Bishop, was Lady Corvax's husband.
He died in combat at some time, and Lady Corvax sought to resurrect him using the Bright Star, but instead turned Mustafar into a horrible wasteland.
Her actions also cast a curse on Dorwin, as he got trapped between the land of the living and the afterlife.
The curse could only be broken if Corvax returned the Bright Star back to the Mustafarians, as it had gotten lost after Lady Corvax’s attempt to resurrect Dorwin.
Lord Corvax possessed the capacity to both halt time and teleport as a result of his circumstances.
This helped him greatly in his search for the Star.
During the Imperial Era, he aided Darth Vader in his attempt to resurrect Padmé Amidala.
He actually only did this to snatch the Bright Star away from Vader, as he had tracked it to his possession.
His descendants eventually brought the Bright Star back to the Mustafarians, thus freeing Corvax from his curse and allowing him to move on to the afterlife.
