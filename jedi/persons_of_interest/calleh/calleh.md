# Introduction

Calleh was a Force-sensitive Selkath, having black eyes with blue and grey skin similar to the oceans of Kamino.
She acted as a healer within the Je’daii Order and had undergone her training on the planet Tython.
Later on, Calleh would get to be the mate of Naro, a fellow Selkath.
They shared similar prowess and abilities as healers and in 25,973 BBY they rose to the ranks of joint Temple Masters of Mahara Kesh, the Je’daii Temple of Healing.

At the same time, Tython would be engulfed in a Force Storm, leading all the Temple Masters, including Calleh, to unite and combine their strength to assist Temple Master Quan-Juang with restoring balance to the planet by shifting it back to the light side of the Force.
Subsequently a Force-sensitive offworlder known as Xesh would be escorted to Mahara Kesh alongside several Je’daii that were injured while apprehending him.
These injured Je’daii as well as Xesh would have their wounds tended by Calleh afterwards.
Calleh sympathised with the pain Xesh had to go through as she observed the scars on his body and would continue to heal him with Naro for ten days.
However, the Je’daii Council would decide to exile him to the moon of Bogan due to his strong affinity with the dark side of the Force, which caused the Force Storm.
