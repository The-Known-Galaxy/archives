# Introduction
Species and brief overview:
Odan-Urr was a Daethos male, a long-lived species that possessed a - sometimes - several-thousand year long life span.
Odan-Urr would demonstrate this until his ultimate demise at ~1000 years old.
Odan-Urr was most notable for his position as a Scholar and Jedi Master, having been trained by two Masters himself - Jedi Masters Ooroo and Memit Nadill.
In his career Odan-Urr had two students, Nomi Sunrider, and Freedon Nadd.

Achievements within the Order:
Within his own career as a Jedi, and as soon as a Padawan, he had received several alarming visions from the Force that outlined an upcoming conflict with the Sith Empire.
When presenting this vision to the Council he was only ignored, however he did manage to gain the aid and support of Empress Teta’s own forces.
He joined the conflict in the Battle of Kirrek alongside his master - Ooroo - however Ooroo would later sacrifice himself for the success of the battle.
It is in the aftermath of this Great Hyperspace War where Odan-Urr becomes the sole possessor of a Sith holocron - the first of its kind discovered.

Upon returning to Ossus after the war had ended, he was inspired to create the Great Jedi Library.
This vast structure would hold a plethora of physical knowledge of the Force and topics of interest.
The holocron previously mentioned was housed here for the wellbeing of the Jedi.
He would become the Head Librarian, and his close friend Ood Bnar would act as his understudy.

Continuing with his scholar duties he revised the Jedi Mantra to the Revised Jedi Code.
He found that many of the temple’s inhabitants and the Order’s students couldn’t greatly understand the Code prior to Odan-Urr’s revision.
This piece of work is what Odan-Urr is most revered for, with its existence having a significant presence in the Order until the Great Jedi Purge thousands of years on.
The aforementioned Great Jedi Library, however, would not have this luxury.
