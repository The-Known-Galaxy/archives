# Introduction
Ferren Barr was a male who belonged to the Ikotchi species.
This man had sworn to take avenge on what happened to the Jedi Order, and he swore to do this by dethroning the Sith, who currently ran the Galactic Empire.
Some times, Barr used the force he had to control his followers, and sometimes to assassinate people, such as the Imperial ambassador, also known as Mon Calamari.

# Section 1
Ferren Barr originally began his training as a Padawan learner around the time of the end of the Galactic Republic.
He duelled late Anakin Skywalker many times.
He also participated in the Clone Wars, alongside the Grand Army of the Republic.
He had many brothers and sisters, who were murdered by Clone Troopers on the Coruscant Temple and across the whole galaxy.
When the Sith eventually returned to power and controlled the Galaxy, this led Barr to return into hiding.



# Section 2
Barr was set on finding out the ways the Sith regained control of the universe.
He soon gained the knowledge of what Order 66 was, and the roles that Count Dooku and the clone army once played during the Jedi Order.
Not only that, Barr found out  knowledge of what happened to Skywalker and how he helped with the destruction and murders on the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.
He hacked into software within the Temple and witnessed with his own eyes the murders that were occurring at the time.
He was disgusted also by the fact that other Jedi also fell to the dark side and became ‘Sith Inquisitors’.
He kept his knowledge within a R1-series astromech droid, which he called ‘Endee’.
Barr recruited acolytes to help him out; these acolytes hated the Empire and felt sincere to the Jedi Order.
Barr mainly used the acolytes due to their immense force powers that they had.



# Section 3
Barr and his new followers journeyed to a planet named Mon Cala to serve as Jedi Advisors.
They served as Jedi Advisors to King-Lee Char.
During Barr’s and his followers’ time there, he pleaded to the people of Mon Cala to try to spread hope and openly decline the ways of the Galactic Empire.
The Empire heard of this news, so they dispatched an Ambassador known as Telvar to Mon Cala to, try and de-escalate what Barr was doing.
Barr sabotaged Telvar’s vehicle.
Due to this assassination, the Empire had to invade the planet of Mon Cala, even though Lee Char declined any involvement with the people of Mon Cala and the assassination of the Sith Ambassador.
Emperor Palpatine ordered Vader to track down the Jedi Advisors that belonged to King-Lee Char and kill them, along with the help of the Sith Inquisitors.



Barr used the footage that he had located of Anakin Skywalker assassinating the Jedi on the planet of Coruscant; he used this to educate the acolytes on what the rise and the fall of Anakin Skywalker was.
At first, the acolytes had an idea to avenge the Jedi Order and take down Darth Vader; however, Barr told them to calm down and not go that far due to it not being the proper Jedi way.
He had a plan that would kill the Sith, avenge the Jedi and bring order back to the galaxy.



# Section 4
Barr was made aware by King-Lee Char that he had given Barr’s and his followers’ locations to the Inquisitors due to him going through very distressing torture.
Barr and his followers evacuated the chamber where they were and began flying; they ended up being stopped by an Imperial Submarine, which held Vader and the Inquisitors inside of it.
Two of the acolytes during the invasion of the ship were murdered.
Two other acolytes decided to stay and try to hold off Vader and the Inquisitors, while Barr and the other remaining acolytes left and continued with the task that they had to complete, which was to escape Mon Cala.
A squad of purge troopers and Inquisitors stopped Barr and his followers in the city.
One of the acolytes was cut in half.
Barr realised that the Purge troopers were the last generation of clones before they fully stopped creating clones, and notified the Purge Troopers that technically, the Inquisitors were still Jedi, and due to this, the Purge Troopers had to continue following Order 66 and went to kill the once Jedis, the Inquisitors.
Barr and another acolyte used this as a distraction, and escaped more inside the city, while the Troopers and Inquisitors fought against each other.



# Section 5
Barr knew the remaining apprentice with him was strong with the Force, so he taught them the arts of the Jedi ways knowing that he would unfortunately not be able to complete the training.
Due to this, he ordered the remaining acolyte, known as Verla, to go find Grandmaster Yoda, Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, or even Quinlan Vos.
Now that Barr left his follower, he decided to go confront Vader.
Vader located Barr as he swept through the city and began a duel together.
Vader accused Barr of assassinating the Ambassador, which Barr fully agreed to.
Now that Lee Char knew of what Barr did, he stopped his forces and surrendered to the Galactic Empire.
Barr had originally had the intent to defeat Vader; however he was unsuccessful and was finally defeated and slain by the Dark Lord.
He knew his actions and the knowledge he gained would finally lead to the destruction of the Sith.
Mon Cala was finally taken over by the Imperial military, and belonged to the Empire.
