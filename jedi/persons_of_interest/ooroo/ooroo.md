# Introduction

Ooroo was a Force-sensitive male Celegian, his affiliations during his time alive were with the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic.
Ooroo was a Jedi Master and Jedi Instructor, serving as the manager of the Jedi Praxeum on the planet Ossus.
The poor Celegian would die during the Great Hyperspace War heroically, with the Ooroo Canyon where the Great Jedi Library of Ossus would be built by one of his students.

# Section 1

Jedi Master Ooroo during his time serving the Order had trained many students on Ossus.
Since he was a Celegian, Ooroo had to use a life-support chamber that supplied him with the gas cyanogen.
Cyanogen is toxic to other life forms such as humans but essential to Ooroo and the Celegian species in their homeworld of Celegia, it would be fatal to Ooroo if he were to inhale oxygen as it was toxic for their species.
This restriction inside the chamber did not interfere with his lightsaber combat or communication.
Many of Ooroo’s students had left the planet after their training except for a very well-known Jedi by the name of Odan-Urr, who preferred to study and learn from the Praxeum library instead of exploring the galaxy even well after his graduation to Knight.
Ooroo, who wanted the Draethos Knight to learn the other part of what it meant to be a Jedi, sent them on a mission to restore peace in the Koros System.
The Ruler of the system, Empress Teta needed assistance in ending the Unification Wars that aimed to unite the seven planets of the system.

The two Jedi would be separated during Odan-Urr’s mission in the Koros system till they were both plagued by long-forgotten Dark-Jedi visions.
These visions led to Ooroo following Odan-Urr off of Ossus and to the Koros system to assist the Jedi.
By the time Ooroo had made it to his destination of Koros, the Sith Empire had sent an offensive attack on the Republic.
This move made Ooroo and Odan-Urr have to take arms and lead the forces of Empress Teta on planet Kirreck.
During the harsh battle for the planet, Jedi Master Ooroo and his forces of Empress Tera’s were being pressed by the Massassi warriors.
The Jedi Master then decided to sacrifice himself by destroying his life-support tank and unleashing his cyanogen gas.
The gas had eliminated all the hostile forces in the area, but it would cost the life of the Celegian Master in the process.
For this selfless act, the Jedi would be remembered as the “Martyr of Kirreck”.
After his death, Odan-Urr would see the construction of the Great Jedi library in Ooroo Canyon, doing this in honor of his late Jedi Master.
