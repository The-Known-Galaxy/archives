# Introduction

CC-1010, also known as Fox, was a clone trooper who served as the Clone Commander of the Coruscant Guard in the Clone Wars.
He would be best known for his loyalty and devotion to the protection of the Galactic Chancellor, Sheev Palpatine, and the security of the Republic.
This leaves him and all Clones under him directly loyal to the Chancellor, whilst the rest of the Grand Army of the Republic serves under Jedi Generals.
He would become one of the most decorated clone troopers throughout the span of the entirety of the Clone Wars.

# Section 1

Formed and made from the genetic template of the infamous bounty hunter Jango Fett, CC-1010 like most of his peers, would be trained in the renowned facilities of Kamino, noted for his exceptional performance.
He would then be transferred and deployed within the Republic in the early days of the Clone Wars, assuming the post of the Clone Commander of the Coruscant Guard.
With the progression of the Clone Wars in sway, the Coruscant Guard would supplement the Senate Guard as a peace-keeping force in the volatile capital, and would help in the defense of Coruscant against the Separatist siege.
The Coruscant Guard also played an important role in the safety of many Jedi Ambassadors and diplomats sent to off-world missions.

# Section 2

Fox would retain command of the Coruscant Guard in and after the issue of Order 66, and the formation of the Galactic Empire.
Serving under the newly enthroned Emperor Palpatine, CC-1010 and his Coruscant Guardsmen would secure the perimeter of the decimated temple of the Jedi in Coruscant as the Sith Lord Darth Vader continues his search for Jedi Master Jocasta Nu.
Eventually, his death would be at the hands of his new master, as Vader would execute Fox after his troopers would open fire on the Sith Lord, thinking he was a Jedi.
