# Introduction
Kavar, one of the few remaining Jedi Masters, and member of the Jedi High Council that was alive during the First Jedi Purge.
When the Mandalorian wars came and were in its early stages of fighting, Kavar was involved with skirmishes for the Republic, making his enemies believe that he was the one who would lead the Republic forces, rather than Revan instead.

# Section 1
He would later pull himself out from the war as the High Jedi Council decided to remain neutral throughout the conflict.
Many veterans of the Mandalorian wars wondered what would’ve gone differently had Kavar continued to lead the Republic forces instead.
There is little information about Kavar during the Jedi Civil war, but it is known that he had fought and was considered to be dead at some point as well, but that was far from the truth.



# Section 2
When the Jedi Civil war was brought to an end, only a hundred Jedi remaining were still alive and well.
Despite their best efforts to regain their recovery, one by one their numbers were shortened as each day went by from the shadows.
The Jedi High Council took notice of this, and Kavar, who had the most experience from wars and considered to be the greatest tactician for the Jedi at that time, decisively made the move for them.
His plan made the whole remaining Jedi go into hiding around the galaxy, until the hidden threat that was stalking them was found.



# Section 3
Kavar made his self-imposed exile on Onderon, where he served as an advisor for Queen Talia, who was their leader at the time.
At some point around his exile, he had an encounter with Meetra Suurik who requested him to come over to meet her, but their conversation was interrupted shortly by Colonel Tobin and his men due to the Jedi Exile’s attention that she brought to the planet.
The second time they met was during the time where the planet was in civil war.
Together, they both ended the conflict swiftly.



# Section 4
As the tensions died down for a while, Kavar was met with a curiosity of his supposed apprentice who had many questions regarding her exile and such.
After the Jedi Exile had her answers and asked him to attend a Conclave held on Dantooine, the Jedi Master agreed and went there shortly.
There, he met his fellow Masters, Zez-Kai-Ell and Vrook Lamar.
Unexpectedly, when the Conclave began, the remaining Jedi High Council remained with the same decision and plan instead of formed a counter-attack.
Despite their hidden threat having been found, which was the Sith itself.



# Section 5
He and the others decided to cut off Meetra’s connection to the force.
As she was wounded in the force after what she had experienced at Malachor V, thus deeming her as a threat to life itself.
However, before the three could do so, they were interrupted by Kreia, who was the Jedi Exile’s mentor at the time.
They tried to fight back, only to get their force stripped away from them and lay dead on the ground shortly after.
