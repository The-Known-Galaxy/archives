# Introduction

Carth Onasi, also nicknamed Fleet, was a famous human male soldier and pilot born in 3994 BBY on the planet Telos IV.
He also married and started a family with his wife, Morgana, and their son Dustil.
Carth was also very known for his time serving in the Republic Naval Starfighter Corps, and his love and compassion for fighting in the Republic.
He also fought in some major conflicts, such as the Mandalorian Wars, earning several honors for his showing of bravery on the battlefield.
Onasi served under Admiral Saul Karath, who was also his great ally and mentor during the war.
After the war ended, Carth planned to leave the Navy and return to his family on Telos IV.

# Section 1

One of Carthâ€™s best known traits is his loyalty and heroism.
He held a strong true dedication to the Republic and its ideals way more than he held anything else.
The second thing he held close was his family, which was everything to him.
He then later came in contact with the previously known Sith Lord Darth Revan, and followed his orders to serve the Republic for the greater good.
Carth held a true deep hatred for the previously known Jedi Master, known as Malak, and despised his actions such as betraying the Republic and turning to the dark side.
He soon faced a devastating betrayal from his previous mentor, Saul Karath, which soon would lead him to a path of distrust towards anyone else he came in contact with, and expect the worst out of everyone.
It was only a matter of great time, on Revans adventures, where Carth would soon open up to Revan about his past, and gain trust for him officially.
