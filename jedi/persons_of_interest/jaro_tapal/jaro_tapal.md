# Introduction
Jaro Tapal was a Force sensitive Lasat male and a Jedi Master that served the galactic republic and Jedi order.
He was a Jedi General of the 13th Legion and the Master of a padawan named Cal Kestis.
During the final years of the Republic he had many military responsibilities and was away from the jedi temple most of the time before the Jedi purge.

Despite this he still found time to mentor his padawan in the ships training system, which he and his padawan would train in until order 66.
In the aftermath of the Bracca invasion, order 66 was executed, meaning that all Jedi or force users were declared enemies to the Republic.
Tapal sensed his own commander preparing to fire upon him, which he killed the commander before any damage could have been dealt.

Tapal and his padawan went to the escape pods, in an attempt to flee the clones from eliminating them both.
Sadly, Jaro Tapal was shot many times in the torso before dying in the pod next to his own padawan, before he died he handed his own lightsaber to his young padawan.
Cal Kestis was haunted for many years due to the death of his Master and order 66.
