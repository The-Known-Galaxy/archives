# Introduction
Elzar Mann was a male human who held the rank of “Jedi Master” back in the days of the High Republic.
He was described as very controversial and strict.
As a Jedi Knight, he would end his very strong relationship with a good friend, Avar Kriss, so it wouldn’t distract them from their Jedi life.
They decided to be no more than friends after that.
Kriss would achieve the rank of Master while Elzar was still a Knight, despite his determination for such a high and respected title.
In 232 BBY, Mann was assigned to be a part of the Jedi contingent to the ceremony of the Starlight Beacon, a powerful station-like building created for the purpose of Lina Soh’s amazing work.
Though chaos would occur, when a Byne Guild worker would carry cargo over to the Outer Rim through a hyperlane.
It was torn from hyperspace itself and the debris would emerge and threaten star systems.
This would later be called the Great Disaster afterwards.
Most of the damage would occur in the Hetzel System with around forty billion inhabitants and three different moons.
The Minister of the system would send out a help signal out for the Jedi, who were at the time on the Starlight Beacon.
Hetzal’s distress signal was quickly responded to and the team would head out for it.
Kriss would sense a fragment of tibanna gas in liquid-form going straight for the biggest and most dangerous Hetzal sun.
She called out to the Jedi for assistance in the effort to use the Force and safely move it away from the sun’s path.
Elzar would understand her call and use all his power with the rest of the fellow Jedi to push it.
Eventually, Mann, Kriss and a couple other Jedi would succeed in their effort and save the whole system from complete death.
In the aftermath of the whole Great Disaster event, he would finally gain the title he had also wanted, which was “Master”.
