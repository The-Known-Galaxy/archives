# Introduction
Bo-Katan Kryze was a human born in Mandalore to the noble House Kryze, younger sister to Duchess Satine Kryze.
She is among the most recognisable Mandalorians to have ever existed, proving herself in many allegiances and accords such as the Death Watch, the Shadow Collective, and later as leader of the Nite Owls.
Among many of those who see the waning of Mandalore’s warring heritage, she would join the Death Watch.
A radical terrorist group who wished to divert from the Duchess’ ways of pacifism and the New Mandalorians.

# Section 1
Katan would serve under Pre Vizsla, leader of the Death Watch, becoming his right-hand lieutenant.
Eventually, she along with the other Death Watch would make contact with the infamous Darth Maul and his brother, Savage Opress.
Despite Bo-Katan’s distrust of the Sith due to Count Dooku betraying them before, they would find a common enemy to rally behind; Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi.
With this, they would begin their plan of liberating Mandalore from the Duchess and her pacifists, as the two Sith brothers aligned with them.



# Section 2
Growingly put in dispute with the other members of the Death Watch and the two zabrak Sith brothers, the duel between Darth Maul and Pre Vizsla would be the final straw as the contest ends in Vizsla losing his life and the Darksaber to Maul.
Maul would declare himself ruler of Mandalore afterwards.
Unable to accept his rule, she would free her sister and align herself with her former enemy, Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Despite this, she would not be able to overthrow Maul or prevent her sister from being killed.
By the end of the Clone Wars, she would be able to overthrow Maul with the aid of Ahsoka Tano, former Jedi padawan.
She would be installed as regent of Mandalore thereafter.
