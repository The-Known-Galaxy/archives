# Introduction
Marlo was a member of the Hutt species and was born on Nah Hutta during 997 BBY.
Marlo the Hutt died in the Jekara System around the times of 3ABY and 4ABY.
This Hutt was a hutt who was on the grand council of the Hutts.
Not only that, during the Clone Wars he led the Hutta’s government.

# Section 1
He became a very high rank during the times of the Qunaalac Clan, which is the reason he became a member of the Hutt Ruling Council.
During the 21 BBY era, there were plans discussed to release someone named “Ziro'' from the prisons of the republic with other members of the Hutt council, who are known as ‘Jabba Desilijic Tiure, Gorga Desilijic Aarrpo, Oruba, and Arok’, this happened because the man named Ziro had critical dangerous information about the Hutts.



# Section 2
The man who was named Ziro was brought upon the grand council, along with Marlo the Hutt.
Marlo spoke to the Huttese, who were called Vigo, and asked them if he knew that he was released because of a holodiary he had in his possession.



# Section 3
Sometime later, Ziro escaped from his cell.
Marlo, when he was on Zygerria, was looking for  slaves and witnessed a fight between a servant, Zygerrian, and her master.
Due to this, Marlo attended the servants auctions.



# Section 4
About a year later, Savage Opress, Pre Vizsla, and the one and only Darth Maul came to speak to the Hutt’s Grand Council.
Savage Opress, Pre Vizsla, and Darth Maul offered the Hutt Grand Council a huge alternator saying “If you do not join us, you will all die.”.
However, the council was very defensive and declined the not-so-kind offer, so they called their bounty hunters to protect them.
A bounty hunter named Dengar was pushed into Marlo and he was disgusted.
Marlo escaped from the chamber along with everyone apart from Oruba which is why Oruba was finally killed.
