# Introduction

During the Clone Wars, the Advanced Recon Commando CT-5555, also known as CT-27-5555, later known as ARC-5555, took part in the Grand Army of the Republic.
Because he was a clone, he dubbed himself "Fives." Fives started his training as a clone cadet on Kamino during the early stages of the war between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
Along with his friends in Domino Squad, he acquired the rank of trooper.
He served as a recently trained soldier at a Republic outpost on the Rishi Moon when the outpost came under Separatist attack.
Fives joined the 501st Legion after being selected as one of the two survivors.
Along with CT-1409 "Echo," the other survivor of the attack on Rishi Station, he joined the elite Advanced Recon Commandos after the successful defense of Kamino.

# Section 1

After Jedi General Even Piell was taken prisoner, Fives was sent to Lola Sayu with a group of Jedi and clones to free the General from the Citadel.
Although the squad suffered numerous deaths throughout the mission, including the loss of Piell and the presumed dead Echo, Fives was one of the survivors that Jedi General Plo Koon saved.
During the Battle of Umbara, later in the conflict, Fives participated with the 501st.
He was a significant contributor to the campaign's capture of the Umbaran airbase and destruction of the Separatist supply ship.
The Besalisk Jedi Master Pong Krell, their General, had betrayed the Republic by tricking his clone soldiers into engaging in combat, as the clones eventually learned.
Fives joined in their efforts to apprehend the deceased Jedi as a result.

# Section 2

Fives saw the execution of Tiplar, a Jedi General, by CT-5385 "Tup" while attempting to take Ringo Vinda from the Separatists.
The pre-emptive execution of Clone Protocol 66 set off a series of events that allowed Fives to learn about an inhibitor chip conspiracy, a scheme to obliterate the Jedi Order, and to some extent, the involvement of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine.
Clone Commander CC-1010 "Fox" and a group of Coruscant Guard shock troopers attacked Fives when he tried to warn Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Clone Captain CT-7567 "Rex" after being accused by Palpatine of being a failed assassin.
Fives was slain by Fox and died in Rex's arms after he drew his weapon on Fox, fearing that no one would listen to the information he had acquired regarding the inhibitor chips.

# Section 3

Even though Fives was slain before he could reveal the plot behind the inhibitor chips, his activities impacted how Order 66 was carried out.
Before or after the implementation of Order 66, at least two clones, CC-3636 "Wolffe" and CC-5576-39 "Gregor," removed their chips.
To prevent the information from being leaked, CT-6116 "Kix" investigated, leading him to discover Palpatine's scheme.
He then compelled Dooku to kidnap him and place him in cryo-cycle hibernation, preventing him from future involvement in The Clone Wars and Order 66.
Fives' knowledge of the plot allowed Ahsoka Tano to save Rex and take out his inhibitor chip when the 501st carried out Order 66 against her.
As a result, unlike the rest of the clone army that later joined the Galactic Empire, Rex did not turn against the Jedi.
