# Introduction

Dez Rydan was a former Padawan of Jedi Master Jora Malli.
He was viewed as a role model by the younger Jedi, and so when Dez dueled with his close friend Reath Silas, the other Jedi would become jealous.
When Dez became a Jedi Knight, he was one of the first Jedi aboard the Vessel starship that was destined for Starlight Beacon.
Dez was desperate for an assignment and decided to transfer to Starlight, however, the Vessel didnâ€™t make it to Starlight because of the Great Hyperspace Disaster.
Due to this, the Jedi aboard the Vessel were stranded at an ancient space station.
Dez Rydan was assumed to be dead when he was searching the lower decks and came into contact with a door that closed in on him.
The Jedi on the mission, which had been Padawan Reath Silas, Jedi Master Cohmac Vitus, and Orla Jareni,  assumed he was disintegrated by a few helix rings.
However, Dez was kidnapped by a sentient species known as the Drengir, who were attuned to the Dark Side, and transported to their homeworld with a severe head injury.
The Drengir tortured Dez for days, but because of his head injury, Dez did not feel the pain.
Eventually, Reath found a relay that transported him to the Drengir homeworld where he encountered Dez and the Drengir.
The Drengir tried to manipulate Dez into believing Reath was his enemy, and because of his injuries, Dez did not know who it was.
Before Dez was able to kill Reath, he was saved by Reath, who brought him back to the station.
Dez believed that the Drengir had dampened his connection to the Force, and so he swore the Barash Vow.
He also swore the Barash Vow because he was not able to balance his passion for adventure, and viewed it as a problem because he needed to serve others as a Jedi.
