She was discovered by a Jedi seeker as an infant and was raised within the Jedi Order.
During the Galactic Republic era, she was the padawan to Jedi Master Eno Cordova and ended up later becoming master to padawan Trilla Suduri.
It was during the fall of the republic that Junda had disconnected herself from the force and lost her former padawan Suduri to the dark side.
Now hiding away from the Empire, Junda has made the vow to restore the Jedi Order to what it once was.

Cere Junda was a female belonging to the Human species.
She had black hair, brown eyes and dark skin.
While living in the age of the republic, she wore tan Jedi robes, had long dreadlocks, and was equipped with her green-emitted lightsaber.
During the first years of the empire, she decided to switch to a more civilian look of a black half-jacket, white shirt with black pants,and boots; she also had cut her hair for a perm style look.
While even changing her style of defense from a lightsaber to a DL-18 blaster pistol, proving that she is skilled in both weapons.



# Section 2
During her years as Eno Cordovas padawan, he would describe her as having a brash and impulsive way of thinking; especially when it came to the topic of her character.
Cordova even stated that Junda would escalate fights if she was to be provoked enough during a situation.
However, even with her younger self and personality being it was; Junda did mature and became a more wise and caring person.
Junda became an admirer of the art pieces she saw inside the Jedi Archives.
That admiration later spread to different cultures, arts, and architecture during her time as a Jedi seeker as well.
It could also be listed that Junda had learned and enjoyed playing the hallikset during her padawan years, saying it brought ease to her mind and tension.



# Section 3
During the execution of the infamous Order 66, Junda and her padawan Suduri were able to escape from their once clone trooper allies to a safer location along with several younglings.
However, while trying to lure the Empire away so her padawan and the younglings could escape safely, Junda was captured then sent to Fortress Inquisitorius, located on the moon Nur.
Junda was able to hold firm to the torture and interrogation tactics that the Empire used at their disposal for a while until the infamous Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader had entered to crack the Jedi.
Junda eventually had given up from the torture of Vader and spoke of the location where her padawan and the younglings were in hiding.
After the search and torture of Suduri once caught, she was now converted to the dark side taking the Second Sister title as her name and becoming an Inquisitor.
Suduri in her new form was brought before Junda to mock her and the consequences of her breaking under torture.
Now, seeing her padawan in the worst state she’s seen, Junda snapped.
She tapped into the powers of the dark side and in a mix of anger and regret, killed everyone inside the room except her now turned padawan Suduri.
Junda escaped the moon without her padawan; she was then left alone and hurting after cutting herself off from the force since the incident.
Now at this time, as she had wandered the galaxy, she came across a pilot by the name of Greez Dritus.
Together they managed the upkeep and well-being of the Stinger Mantis.
This is where Junda had also made the secret vow to restore the Jedi Order.



# Section 4
With some years after the fall of the Republic, the execution of Order 66, and the severing of herself from the Force, Junda and her crew had saved a Jedi survivor going by the name Cal Kestis from Junda’s former padawan Trilla Suduri from the scrapyard planet of Bracca.
After some discussion, Junda and Kestis understood each other’s history and what they had in common.
Junda took Kestis to the hidden planet of Bogano, which she knew was the location of an ancient Jedi vault.
This vault included a Jedi holocron inside.
The information inside the holocron being the names of Force-sensitive children all over the galaxy.
This holocron was hidden by Junda’s former Master Eno Cordova and was played by his trusted droid BD-1.
Once Junda had gotten word of this holocron, she thought this was destiny and the key to restoring the Jedi Order to what it once was.
She also decided it was destiny that she would complete Cal Kestis training to Knighthood.



# Section 5
This quest they embarked on took them to many planets in the galaxy in order to unlock the vault's secrets.
During their time together, both Junda and Kestis grew together and stronger.
Both Cal and the previous Jedi Cere even managed to help each other heal from the damage that occurred from the events of Order 66.
Junda had even given Kestis her old lightsaber, which he later combined with his previous Master’s saber during their journey.
They would be successful in opening the vault and accessing the holocron.
However, the Second Sister was able to track them and intercept the holocron for herself and the Empire's use.
The Mantis crew was able to track Suduri back to Fortress Inquisitorius.
After both her former Padawans intense duel with Kestis being the one victorious, the former master Junda tried her best to make amends with Suduri.
This was however interrupted when Darth Vader entered and killed Suduri for her failure in combat.
Junda and Kestis had to escape from the Dark Lord himself or face a similar fate to Suduri.
While during the escape, Junda once again tapped into the dark side of the force to prevent Vader from harming them.
She stopped then fell unconscious after realizing what she was doing.
After their escape from the moon, Junda and Kestis had a discussion on what to do with the holocron.
With the decision being to destroy it in order for the Empire to never get their hands on the information, destroying the clue where the force sensitive children are inside the galaxy, leaving it to fate and destiny to be the decider.
