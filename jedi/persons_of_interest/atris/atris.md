# Introduction
Jedi Master Atris was a Jedi Historian after the Great Sith War in 3996 BBY before ascending to the High Council around 3976 BBY, at the beginning of the Mandalorian War, before entering hiding in 3954 BBY at the start of the First Jedi Purge.
In 3952 BBY, Atris called a Conclave in an attempt to draw out the Sith who had targeted the Order, by having the entire Order gather on the planet of Katarr, home to Miraluka species who were strongly Force sensitive, only to have the majority of the Order consumed by Darth Nihilus, a Sith Lord with the power to devour planets and beings strong in the Force.
By 3951 BBY, Atris had constructed an academy hidden in the farming world of Telos IV, hiding many of the Order's important relics.
During this time, she met with Jedi Exile Meetra Surik who was attempting to hunt down the Sith, yet Atris offered minimal assistance.
Atris was eventually corrupted by the Sith Lord, Darth Traya, falling to the Dark Side before being defeated by Surik, redeemed and exiled from the reformed Order.

# Section 1
Atris rose to prominence when she advocated for the following of the teachings of Master Simikarty, an ancient Jedi who taught that a Master should only have a single Padawan, and that an age limit should be implemented to restrict those who could become Jedi.
When the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders attacked the Outer Rim, Atris joined other members of the Council including Jedi Masters Vrook Lamar, Zez-Kai Ell, Kavar and Lonna Vash in calling for Jedi, primarily Revan and Malak from entering the conflict.
Atris’ friend and hero, Surik left to join Revan’s conflict, deeply wounding her and making Atris bitter and vindictive.
When the war ended, the Council placed Surik on trial, with Atris demanding a punishment harsher then exile, whilst also confiscating Surik’s lightsaber.



# Section 2
Following the end of the Jedi Civil War, after the death of Malak at the hands of a redeemed Revan, Atris summoned the surviving Jedi Order to the planet of Katarr to discuss the Order’s future.
However, Atris attempted to lure the Sith out of hiding by using the assembled Jedi as bait, but was unprepared for Nihilus’ immense power.
Casualties on Katarr included the Jedi Masters Zhar Lestin, Dorak and Vandar Tokare, as well as the entire population of Miraluka with the exception of Visas Marr.
Following this, Atris planned to rebuild the Jedi Order on the planet of Telos IV, taking several Jedi and Sith holocrons as well as training an elite group of Echani handmaidens to aid her in defending and training new Jedi.
However, Atris would be corrupted by the holocrons she had stored, slowly transforming into a Dark Jedi.
Atris would later meet again with Surik, who had ended her exile and was beginning to reunite surviving Jedi to combat the Sith threat.
Atris had instructed one of her handmaidens to steal Surik’s ship, the Ebon Hawk, and had also stolen Surik’s droid, T3-M4, resulting in Surik travelling to Telos IV to reclaim the ship.
Following the deaths of Jedi Masters Vrook Lamar, Zez-Kai Ell and Kavar at the hands of Darth Traya, Surik returned to Telos IV to confront Atris, culminating in a duel that Surik ultimately won.
Atris was held prisoner within her sanctuary on Telos until she was sentenced by the reformed Jedi Council, composed of Surik’s former companions she had trained as Jedi.
Atris was, much like Surik years earlier, exiled from the Order and lived out the rest of her days seeking redemption.
