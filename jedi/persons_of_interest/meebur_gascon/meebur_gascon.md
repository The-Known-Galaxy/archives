# Introduction

Meebur Gascon was from Great Zilk.
He was a Zilkin that served the Grand Army of the Republic.
This colonel served with Republic Strategic Command since the beginning of the Clone Wars.
Colonel Gascon specialized in map reading.
He would eventually be promoted to his desired rank of Brigadier General as he had success in his mission.
Gascon would achieve this with his command over D-Squad.
Members of D-Squad were R2-D2, QT-KT, U9-C4, M5-BZ, and WAC-47.

# Section 1

D-Squad was given a top-secret mission.
Their goal was to abduct a decoding module from a vault inside a Separatist ship.
While their landing on the ship did not go as planned because WAC-47 allowed the ship to be taken into a Separatist tractor beam, the droids were able to evade the Separatist security system as U9-C4 was able to cause a power outage.
When they were trying to enter the vault, M5-BZ accidentally inserted into the power outlet which decommissioned the droid for a time.
The droids were able to get to the module that they required.
Unfortunately, the droid commander, Aut-O, engaged the republic droids with that his own.
Luckily, the republic droids were able to escape the life-threatening situation.

# Section 2

After their escape, they repaired the droid, M5-BZ.
The ship they piloted was damaged in hyperspace, so they were forced to land.
The group landed on the planet of Abafar.
Abafar was a rather barren planet with little life on it.
The droids wandered aimlessly trying to find civilization while some of them were going insane.
They got split up as a result of different opinions.
The squad was luckily able to reconvene at Pons Ora.

# Section 3

Gascon and WAC-47 stopped by a mysterious restaurant to eat.
Colonel Gascon noticed something off about the clone-like appearance of the dishwasher present.
The rest of the D-Squad scouted the perimeter and found Separatist forces on the planet.
The group needed to escape the planet, and Colonel Gaston desired Gregor to accompany them.
Gascon presented evidence showing that Gregor was a clone, and he convinced him so.
Gregor wanted to join them, so he resisted his tyrannical boss and accompanied the group.
They would then go on to attack Separatist forces to board a transport ship.
Gregor sacrificed himself so that the rest of them were able to escape.
To their knowledge, he was deceased.

# Section 4

With their transport ship, the group would board what they thought to be a Jedi ship.
To their surprise, the ship was not filled with real republic personnel.
There were tons of holograms as there were fake people on board the ship.
It was being piloted and manned by Separatist droids.
Once discovered, D-Squad rushed to warn the republic, but they had little success.
They then attempted to board their transport ship to leave, and R2-D2 sacrificed himself while detonating the rhidonium bomb on the Separatist Venator.

# Section 5

The space station and every ship around it shook as the detonation went off.
After saving an important strategic meeting, Gascon called the space station.
He informed Jedi Guardian Anakin Skywalker of the death of his astromech.
Skywalker sent out a scavenging team to find the missing droid.
Luckily, he was alive.
To the sadness of Brigadier General Gascon, WAC-47 informed him that they will have future missions together as D-Squad was assigned to his platoon.
