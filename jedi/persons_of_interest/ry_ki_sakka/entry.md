# Introduction

Ry Ki-Sakka was a male human Jedi Grand Master who served during the High Republic era.
As a Jedi, he’d often spend most of his time away from the Core Worlds and far from the borders of the Galactic Republic.
Due to this, Ry Ki-Sakka became a very independent and self-sufficient Jedi, which made some Jedi believe he was the living embodiment of the old Republic Pathfinders.
Ry Ki-Sakka was sent back to Coruscant following the Great Hyperspace Disaster that killed Jedi High Councilor Jora Malli.
This led to Ry Ki-Sakka’s ascension to the Jedi High Council.
