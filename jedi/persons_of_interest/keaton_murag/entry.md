# Introduction

Keaton Murag was a Jedi Master and marshal of the Jedi Temple on Naboo.
Murag served during the High Republic era and was said to have saved thousands of lives on Naboo during a mining disaster.
Due to this, Murag earned the respect of the Naboo monarchs.
Witnesses claimed that Murag used the Force to hold back an explosion whilst the miners escaped.
Murag was promoted to High Councilor right before the Great Hyperspace Disaster.
Murag was personally involved with the decision of whether the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order wanted to pursue the Nihil raiders.
The vote became a tie and Jora Malli broke the tie by saying she would accompany the Republic Defense Coalition to attack the Nihil.
