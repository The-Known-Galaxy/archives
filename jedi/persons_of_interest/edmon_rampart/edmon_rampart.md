# Introduction
Rampart was a human Imperial Officer who began serving the Empire immediately after the Galactic Republic fell; he held the rank of Vice Admiral in the Imperial Navy.
Eager to take his role in the Galactic Empire, Rampart oversaw the implementation of chain codes that would quickly take place all across Imperial worlds in the name of order and security.
Concerned about the clone trooper’s loyalty to the Empire, Rampart believed recruited soldiers would be far more valuable to the Empire than the clones.
During his visit to Kamino, Rampart presented the first Elite Squad he had created to Governor Wilhuff Tarkin, after the first successful mission of the Elite Squad led by Crosshair, Tarkin left the project in Ramparts hands with slight doubts due to losing one trooper already.

During the celebration of the end of the Clone Wars, Admiral Rampart accompanied by Senator Orn Free Taa, Cham Syndulla and his wife were being angrily shouted at by the Twi’leks after the Empire didn’t end the occupation on Ryloth like the Republic had promised.
Later during the evening, Rampart was informed by Crosshair of a supply run to smuggle weapons on Ryloth by Twi’lek resistance fighters, including Hera Syndulla, having attached a homing beacon to their shuttle.
Their ship was eventually shot down by Crosshair and the crew were locked up in an HCVw A9 turbo tank accompanied by Senator Orn Free Taa, Admiral Rampart and Captain Howzer.
On their way back to the Capitol, the convoy was ambushed by Cham Syndulla and his forces, to rescue his daughter and the rest of the Twi’leks.
However, Cham was forced to lay down his blaster due to incoming Imperial reinforcements, Rampart then thanked Senator Taa for playing his part, giving Crosshair a signal to shoot one of Taa’s lekku from a vantage point.
Cham was then arrested for an attempted assassination of Senator Orn Free Taa and was taken to the Capitol building in Ryloth’s capital city in Lessu.
Shortly after Admiral Rampart accompanied by Captain Howzer confronted Cham, who was in a holding cell.
Later Rampart informed Twi’lek citizens how Cham and the rest of the traitors had been arrested and that Taa is making a full recovery, he also ordered Howzer to find Hera who managed to escape during the ambush.
With the help of Clone Force 99, Hera came up with a plan to rescue her parents.
They began the rescue by infiltrating the Imperial refinery and preventing its cannons from shooting the Marauder by disabling them, before starting to attack the refinery.
During this, Hunter and Echo sneaked into the Capitol and rescued Cham Syndulla and the rest from their holding cells.
While all the Imperial forces were sent to defend the refinery, Crosshair
knew something was off and ordered a few squads to block the main gate of the Capitol and be ready to shoot anyone that tried to escape.
Cham, Hunter, and the rest would have fallen into Crosshair's trap but were warned of what was waiting on the other side of the door by Howzer.
Taking another way out of the building, they managed to escape Ryloth.
Howzer, however, stayed behind, since he couldn’t abandon his own squad.
Once Rampart arrived at the completely destroyed refinery, he was very disappointed and furious.
He then gave Crosshair permission to hunt down Clone Force 99.

Having returned to Kamino, Rampart was informed by Crosshair that the plan to evacuate everyone from Tipoca City was ahead of schedule.
Inside the city, the Admiral was very disappointed by Kaminoan’s lack of cooperation.
He also told the Prime Minister that a piece of disturbing news had been brought to his attention, the Chief Scientist, Nala Se was gathering medical personnel to flee Kamino.
Lama Su tried to act surprised, but Rampart was well aware of what was happening.
He then told Lama Su how he has a use for scientists, but not for politicians, and how he has no further need for Su’s services before walking away from the room.
Later aboard his own fleet, he was informed how Crosshair had completely lost his control of Kamino.
He then ordered all the remaining forces to leave the city immediately and let the clones die down there together.
Shortly after Tarkin was informed by Rampart how all the medical personnel had been taken in along with cloning technology.
Tarkin then ordered Rampart to fire when ready.
Once the fleet was in position, Vice Admiral Rampart began bombarding the city.
He then ordered the fleet to jump to the rendezvous point.
