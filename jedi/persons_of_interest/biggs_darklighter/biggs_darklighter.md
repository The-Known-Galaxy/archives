# Introduction
Biggs Darklighter, an ace pilot for the Alliance to Restore the Republic, was a human who grew alongside Luke Skwalker.
They were best friends during childhood.
Biggs had joined the Imperial Academy to become a pilot after leaving his homeworld of Tatoonie.
Shortly after graduating from the academy, he defected with the aid of Derek Klivian, a fellow pilot and undercover agent, to the Rebel Alliance.

It wasn’t too long that Like Skywalker, alongside with Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia Organa had successfully stolen the Death Star plans after the sacrifice of Rogue One and many more during the Battle of Scarif.
Biggs was assigned as a pilot for the assault against the Death Star in the hopes to destroy it, before it destroyed Yavin IV first.
Both Biggs and Luke reunited and had a short conversation as they were preparing for battle.
Once the Battle of Yavin began, Biggs fell under the callsign Red Three.
The X-Wings had to dodge turbolaser fire as they tried to fire at them with much success.
Porkins, who was a friend and wingman to Biggs, was shot down after Biggs tried to call for help.
Fortunately for Biggs though, Luke had destroyed the pursuing TIE.
With the assistance of Biggs, Gold Squadron destroyed many turbolaser towers in the Meridian Trench.



# Section 2
Nearing the closing moments of the battle, Biggs alongside Wedge protected Luke while he flew down the Meridian trench to fire proton torpedoes at the exhaust port.
This was the one and only weakness of the Death Star.
With Wedge having to pull out due to mechanical  problems, Biggs made the ultimate sacrifice to buy Luke some time.
So paying with his life, Biggs was shot down by Darth Vader in his TIE Advanced.
Thankfully, his actions were not in vain.
Han Solo with the Millennium Falcon disabled Darth Vader’s TIE and Luke Skywalker destroyed the Death Star.
