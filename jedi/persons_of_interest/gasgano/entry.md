# Introduction

Gasgano, a Xexto male, was a notorious local podracer on Tatooine.
He was known for achieving high speeds as he was very competitive.
His green Ord Pedrovia podracer would prove very effective for racing.
The Xexto had installed cameras in the back of his podracer to see where his opponents were behind him.
Gasgano also had a greater amount of dexterity than that of most pilots because he had four limbs.

# Section 1

Gasgano started off the race well in a position to win.
He had passed multiple racers in the beginning along with Anakin Skywalker whose podracer had stalled.
Eventually, Anakin Skywalker caught up to the leaders and Gasgano.
Skywalker went over the head of Gasgano to pass him.
This would trap Gasgano behind Skywalker and Sebulba.
Sebulba, the favorite to win the race, crashed, so this put Gasgano in second place.
Ultimately, Gasgano lost to Anakin Skywalker and achieved second place.
