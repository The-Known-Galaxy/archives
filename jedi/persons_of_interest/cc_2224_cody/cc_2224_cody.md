# Introduction
CC-2224, nicknamed “Cody,” was a Clone Marshal & Commander under High General Obi-Wan Kenobi in the height of the Clone Wars, serving under the Grand Army of the Republic against the Separatists.
He, like all Clones, would be from the genetic material of infamous bounty hunter Jango Fett, although bearing more resemblance than most, being a 91% similarity.

# Section 1
His life would be designed and tailored to a leadership position among other clone officers slated for the command posts.
He would have an openly-independent thinking process causing concern for the meticulous and prying eyes of the Kaminoans.
Due to this, the Kaminoans would select him for special training where he would meet CT-7567 or better known as “Rex,” where they would become close friends before Cody was moved to the field.



# Section 2
Several months into the outbreak of the Clone Wars, CC-2224 would be temporarily moved away from the field to enter specialised and additional training under the regiment led by ARC-Trooper Alpha-17, which is designed to further invoke and create independent thoughts among the commanders.
In this time, CC-2224 would take on the name “Cody,” and attach ARC equipment to his armor such as a jetpack, a visor, antennae and enlarged shoulder pads among others.
He would be chosen amongst a handful of clone commanders that were part of the training regiment taking up a role within Squad Seven, cross-trained commandos and sharpshooters; the finest of the Grand Army.



# Section 3
In his participation among countless battles, becoming leader of the 7th Sky Corps and eventually taking up the personal command of the 212th Attack Battalion, Cody would be a major factor within Order 66 at its issue, being the commander present at the Battle of Utapau.

He would later reminisce about the Clone Wars and his brief tenure as one of countless clone commanders at the head of the early days of the Stormtrooper Corps, stationed at Timira City in Kamino.
The escape of Starkiller and the attack of the Rebel fleet on Kamino would leave his fate ambiguous as Darth Vader himself would be captured within that battle.
