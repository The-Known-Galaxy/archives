# Introduction
Bela Kiwikks was a female Togruta Jedi Master.
She served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Great Galactic War, Cold War, and the Galactic War against the Sith Empire.
She was one of four trained by Ngani Zho alongside other notable Jedi such as Satele Shan, Syo Bakarn, and Jaric Kaedan.
Around the year 3663 BBY, Kiwiiks achieved the honor of becoming a Jedi Master.
During the Great Galactic War she befriended some of her fellow Jedi Masters including Orgus Din and Tol Braga.

Section One: 
Kiwikks and the rest of  Zho’s former padawans teamed up to assist the Forty-Fifth Battalion in the Battle of Rhen Var.
In 3653 BBY the Empire attacked Coruscant, which would later become known as the Sacking of Coruscant.
After the discovery of the Order’s base on Tython in 3651 BBY, the remaining Masters decided to appoint new members to sit on the Council.
This new Council included Masters Kaedan, Kiwiiks, Bakarn, and Shan.
The Jedi Order then relocated to Tython and began to construct a new temple.
In 3645 BBY, Kiwiiks travelled to Nar Shaddaa on a mission for the Jedi Order.
This was where she first met her soon to be padawan.
They had their first encounter when Kiwiiks noticed a young female attempting to steal her ship’s hyperdrive.
When she approached the female, she could sense the Force within her.
She soon found out that the girl’s name was Kira Carson and decided to take Carson on as her Padawan.
The two managed to develop a strong bond and travel to many planets during their time together.



Section Two: 
By 3643 BBY Kiwikks and her padawan resided on Tython during a Flesh Raider uprising.
Not long after they ventured off to Coruscant to investigate a dark presence they met up with Din and his padawan during a meeting with General Var Suthra and Doctor Eli Tarnis about stolen files.
Afterwards, the Masters met up with the Supreme Chancellor and then sent Din’s former padawan to help recover the files.
Carson stayed back with Tarnis since her Master believed that her security expertise could be useful to him.
Once the files were recovered and decrypted everyone was shocked to realize that these files contained plans for superweapon projects.
Kiwikks was sent to Tatooine to secure the Shock Drum.
While there she was attacked and defeated by Darth Angral’s apprentice, Lord Praven.
She was taken hostage while she and the Shock Drum were taken to a cave within the Dune Sea.
The Jedi Knight (Din’s former padawan) and Carsen arrive to rescue Kiwiiks.
The Shock Drum was destroyed and Carsen confessed that she was formerly a child of the Emperor.
Nonetheless Kiwikks was proud of her padawan regardless of her past.


Section Three: 
They packed up and went back to Tython to recover from recent events.
Once back at Tython they met up with the Jedi Council and were praised for their good work.
Kiwiiks was saddened by the loss of her close friend and fellow Councilor Din.
All the while, Shan recognized that they may have lost a Master, but gained a capable Jedi Knight.
Then the Council turned to Carsen and praised her for being able to reject the Sith Emperor.
They decided that because of everything that has happened that Carsen was deserving of the title of Jedi Knight.
Not long after the Knight was dubbed the Hero of Tython as he had been a valuable asset to the protection of Tython.


Section Four: 
A year later the Hero and Carsen joined a strike team to capture the Emperor and bring him to Tython.
In hopes of converting him to the light side of the Force.
Kiwikks, Shan, and Kaedan informed the team that if the Hero was with them that it would fail and the Hero would turn to the dark side.
They were informed of this information through a Force vision from Jomar Chul.
Regardless of the Council’s decision the Hero decided to go on the mission.
When their squad never returned the Council feared the worst.
Months later the squad returned accompanied by Lord Scourge, the Emperor’s Wrath, who suddenly decided to convert to the light side.
Scourge explained to the Council about a vision that he had involving the Emperor destroying the galaxy and that the Hero would be the only one to stop him.
He also stated that starting a new war was the only way for the Emperor to conceal his plans.



Section Five: 
The Sith Emperor then planned on using this same ritual but on a wider scale to become virtually unstoppable.
Kiwiiks  worried that the Emperor had discovered the Republic prison planet that had been.
Around a thousand years ago, the Emperor had used a life sapping ritual on his very home of Nathema.
Which resulted in the consumption of all life on the planet and using them to become immortal.
hidden by the Jedi for years.
Scourge informed the Councilors that this ritual can’t be stopped and that they needed to save Belsavis.
Some of the Councilors were hesitant to heed the information that they had just received, but Shan soon consented to an alliance.


Section Six:
Kiwiiks was stationed on Corellia to help with the ongoing Battle of Corellia.
While there she was confronted by two Sith assassins.
They showed her a holo of Braga, who had been turned to the dark side by the Emperor, who had ordered them to kill her.
Fortunately the Hero of Tython had arrived to assist with her escape from the planet.
The Hero then explained to Kiwiiks that he was sent to help rally the Jedi to stop Braga from committing mass genocide.
Not long after Kiwiiks explained that she had never fully recovered from the events on Tatooine.
