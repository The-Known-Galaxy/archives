# Introduction

“Corellia’s Savior” or, more commonly known as, Master Arfan Ramos was a hot-tempered but wise leader to the Corellian Jedi during the Cold War and the Galactic War between the Republic and the Sith Empire.
He was born on the planet Corellia to a wealthy family, who had the joy of discovering his affinity with the Force.
At such a young age, he would have been fit for the Jedi Order, but his parents decided to opt for the Green Jedi Order (Corellia’s Jedi).
This Order was distinct in that it was independent from its counterpart , practiced distinctly unique practices that didn’t mesh well with the Jedi Order and put their own planet above everything else.
As a result, the two groups often came into conflict, not through violence but through ideology.
Regardless, Ramos grew up within the Order, researching (as most Green Jedi would) philosophy and untraditional uses of the Force.
Eventually, he rose through the ranks and gained the title of leader and master, leading the Corellian Jedi with his might and intelligence.
As a result, when Corellia was under-threat, he was always quick to take necessary actions to defend his home-world, even if it went against tradition.
Though that may be due to his rash and unhinged nature, as you could hear him scream in battle “I'll bury you first!" to the concern of his peers.
