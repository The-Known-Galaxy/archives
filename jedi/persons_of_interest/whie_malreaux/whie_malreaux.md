# Introduction
Whie Malreaux, a human man born on Vjun with his family being extremely wealthy.
It was clear that Whie was strong with the Force since young age, Whie was even blessed to see the future in his dreams and meditations.
That was why Jedi Master Maks Leem took Whie on as Padawan.
The family of Whie lived on Vjun as the wealthiest family in a big castle namer Château Malreaux.

# Section 1
It was known the better families on Vjun had a very high midichlorian counts.
Because of this, it became a status for wealthy families.
The father of Whie, known as the Viscount of Vjun was extremely interested in midi chlorians.
He tried to experience it but did not go as planned, since people started killing others and went mad.
The mother of Whie was crazy and most of the time, she was drunk that is when she gave her son Whie Malreaux away to a Jedi.



# Section 2
After the mother of Whie gave him away, his journey as Jedi could begin.
Whie had a very good friendship with a fellow Padawan at the Jedi Temple, named Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy, a girl one year older than him.



# Section 3
During the Clone Wars, Count Dooku took over Château Malreaux and set up a trap for Jedi Grandmaster Yoda.
Yoda selected Whie, his master Maks Leem, fellow Padawan Scout and her master Jai Maruk to come along on the mission.
While Whie and Padawan Scout run into Asajj Ventress, Yoda was fighting with Count Dooku.
Though the two Padawans were both captured by Ventress, Ventress senses the feelings that Whie has for Scout and tries to turn him to the Dark Side while she has Scout in a Force-grip.
Whie was very doubtful in what decision he should make, but luckily, Scout managed to convince Whie to make the right decision which he did.



# Section 4
When Whie peacefully returned to the Jedi Temple, rescued by Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, he still did not feel safe.
During Order 66, Whie was sparring with Bene when Darth Vader entered the Jedi Temple and executed Whie Malreaux by cutting across his chest.
Bene was killed not that long after Whie died.
Unfortunately, when the Galactic Empire was in existence, there were records by State Pestage stating Whie was killed while he was trying to mind-control citizens of the Temple Precinct.
