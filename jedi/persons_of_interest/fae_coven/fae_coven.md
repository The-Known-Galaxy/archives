# Introduction

Fae Coven was a Jenet, a Jedi Master and Grand Master who served the order around 896 BBY, Fae Coven was usually stationed in the Jedi Temple located in Corcant.
Alongside her many contributions for the Jedi Order she also was the author for a guidebook titled â€ž The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force'', alongside her contributor authors Master Fae's guide book was printed in three editions and her work was passed down from Jedi Master to Padawan for several generations.
Another achievement of Coven was that she joined the New Sith Wars.
With her reorganization of the Jedi Academy she was elected as a Grand Master who would lead the Order of the Galactic Republic into its Golden age.
The reasoning for her written guidebook was Coven's view of a pattern of inconsistency which was deeply rooted in the order at the time, in order for her guidebook to reach the wide audience it was written in plain basic which every Jedi would be able to understand.
Fae Coven's death is unknown and lost to history, however, due to master Yoda writing in her guidebook volume we are able to round up her death around 896 BBY.
Fae Coven was an extraordinary Grand Master who served the order for around forty years and with her determination she was able to uplift the status of the Order, bringing it into a flourishing golden age.
