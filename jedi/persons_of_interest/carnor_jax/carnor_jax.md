# Introduction
Carnor Jax was a Force Sensitive human male that served under the imperial rule of Emperor Palpatine as a Sovereign Protector (Royal Guard) and eventually inherited the imperial throne.
Jax joined the Imperial Stormtrooper corps at a young age, and while in service stood out from his comrades, and was soon selected for training as a Royal Guard.
At the academy he was subjected to harsh conditions and training on the planet of Yinchorr, along with the other recruits..
Recruits tested their combat skills on “The Squall” a dueling arena, where Carnor Jax and another recruit, Kir Kanos, met for the first time.
After continuing his training he was one of four recruits left from their class, and faced the final test of their training.
Two recruits entered the Emperor’s chambers and in his presence, fought to the death and the winner got to be an Imperial Guard.
Out of the two pairs, the emerging victors were Kir Kanos and Carnor Jax, which got to serve in the Imperial Guard.
Not much is known about his service in the Imperial Guard in Palpatine’s rule, but it’s presumed he served with excellence.

# Section 1
Carnor Jax was not on the Second Death Star when it was destroyed, hence his life was saved.
He and the remainder of the Royal Guard came under the control of a few self proclaimed rulers of the empire.
His unit eventually got transferred to the control of the Dark Lady of the Sith Lumiya.
She recognized the potential in Jax’s force sensitivity, and he specialized in telekinesis and precognition.
As he served under the Dark Lady, he got familiar with Imperial High Command.
When Palpatine returned to the throne of the Empire in 10 ABY Carnor Jax returned to serve as a Royal Guard and had himself promoted to Sovereign Protector, yet his loyalty laid within the circle of officers and high command he knew and trusted.
Eventually he and his followers bribed the Emperor’s physician to sabotage the emperor’s last remaining clones, letting the rebellion kill him at last, and letting Carnor Jax take the throne.
When the remaining Royal Guards were informed of his betrayal, he had the entire guard killed, except one.
The only survivor that managed to escape was Kir Kanos, who swore to kill all traitors to Palpatine including Jax and his council.
After a long search for Kanos, Jax and Kanos met once again for the final time on Yinchorr in “The Squall”.
Jax remarked that he always wins in the squall, but was eventually killed by Kir Kanos, saying “Thus die all traitors”.
