# Introduction
DOTO, also known as Duelist of the Order, is a tournament in which everyone can demonstrate their skill and passion for combat in order to determine the best Duelist of the Order.
Elder Bella, who has now retired from the order, announced the first tournament, which took place on June 6, 2021.
 

The DOTO operates and is hosted in a straightforward but intriguing manner.
When DOTO is being hosted, attendees must message their username to the host so that their name can be added to the list.
This is the one of requirements to participate in the event.
The first DOTO was assessed in the Jedi Order discord server on a stage so that attendees rallying on the tournament map could follow the Host's instructions.
  After your username is entered into a bracket, you are expected to be present because you will be pitted against an opponent in a best-of-three duel.
Failure to arrive at a DOTO automatically elevates the opponent.

# Section 1
Before the October Update of 2022, when DOTO first began, it was on the old tournament map, which was smaller and less developed.
Despite the group not being extremely large, many people attended.
SpartanMorningstar, HowToInvadeVietnam, and iExodos were the three finalists for the first DOTO; Spartan was the first Duelist of the Order and he is still involved in our community to this day.
Since the combat mechanism employed by this DOTO was the pre-Ossus version, the experience was very different.
During the first DOTO, if you finished on the podium, you would be awarded a Kyber Crystal attempt and Robux.
SpartanMorningstar used Makashi, also known as Form 2, to win the Order's first Duelist.
Due to only winning DOTO once, Spartan has a great history of being one of the greatest Combatants in the order.
However, Spartan has been unable to participate in future DOTO events because of his busy life.
