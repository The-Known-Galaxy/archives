# Introduction

In the early days of Sanctum, the Council of First Knowledge consisted of only two specializations, one of which was the Lore Keepers, being founded in early May of 2021.
The original purpose of the Lore Keepers was to teach the Lore Phase within the CoFK server, which transitioned to the Jedi Service Corps later on among other training phases and specializations.
The specialization was repurposed and moved into the Council of Reassignment while under the leadership of its second and last Chief Lore Keeper, BookZulfor around late December 2021.
After these events took place, the title of Lore Keepers were shortly disbanded, becoming what is known as the Jedi Seers in the current day, but they would soon reemerge with a new purpose.

# Section 1

Long after the fall of Sanctum and the movement to Ossus, the Lore Keepers were soon rebranded to serve as a position for those wishing to pursue their goals within either the Jedi Academy, whose task is to certify members who have become Knights so they may host trainings, or the Librarianâ€™s Assembly, whose goal is to provide the Archives with information about the wonders of the known galaxy.
Leadership of the Lore Keepers was also split between the Academy Headmaster, and the Chief Librarian acting as co-leaders with each having a seat on the Council of First Knowledge.
