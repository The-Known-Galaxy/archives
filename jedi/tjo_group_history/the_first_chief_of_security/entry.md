# Introduction

The Chief of Security role is given to the most senior head of the Council of Reconciliation.
The Chief of Security is responsible for the management and oversight of all specializations, divisions, and operations of the Council of Reconciliation.
The role first came into use when ArgusOtto earned himself the role on October 28th, 2020.

# Section 1

ArgusOtto, the first Chief of Security, only served in the role for a period of 3 weeks before his successor, Vermened, gained the position.
Compared to Vermened’s service of over six months, ArgusOtto’s service is overshadowed in a way.
Unfortunately, further information on ArgusOtto is limited.
However, the foundations of the Council of Reconciliation were certainly laid by ArgusOtto.
We owe the success of the group to these individuals, even if they only managed to serve for a brief period.
