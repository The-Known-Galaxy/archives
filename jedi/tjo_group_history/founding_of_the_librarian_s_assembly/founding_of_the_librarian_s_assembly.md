# Introduction
The Librarian's Assembly is a group of Jedi Initiates or higher who make the articles held in the archives.
As a division under the Council of First Knowledge, the Assembly was officially formed and opened on the 13th of October, 2020.
The first leader of the Librarian's Assembly was Chief Librarian DemshyAlkion, while Caretaker of First Knowledge ValSenko remained as Senior Councilor of First Knowledge.
The Librarian's Assembly was built just for the purpose of providing the most thorough records of information in the entire Star Wars genre and to spread the knowledge throughout the Order.
The motivation stemmed from the interest in Star Wars lore and the ability to provide accounts of lore effortlessly.
The goal for the Librarian's Assembly has been steadily fulfilled throughout the Librarian's Assembly's existence under different leaders, such as Chief Librarian CannonMalvern, who has been in service since the 29th of July, 2021.

Within the first few months, the Librarian's Assembly was relatively small in its efficiency.
The Assembly did not have a dedicated team to provide oversight and review articles aside from the Chief Librarian and Caretaker, though they kept on going with the production.
Over the course of that following year, the Assembly saw multiple changes in leadership and efficiency.
They now have a dedicated team of Archivists to revise articles, a team of Librarians to provide general oversight and a bot to automate the article submission process.
Every single Jedi who was involved in the Librarian's Assembly has contributed in some shape or form to keep the Assembly flourishing and is the reason it is still going strong to this day.
The Librarian's Assembly also has records of over 1200 articles within the Library's system.
Compared to how the Assembly was during the foundation, they have come a very long way.
