# Introduction

The transfer to Spintir happened shortly after the destruction of the Jedi Temple on Ossus by the hands of the Sith Order.
In the midst of the bombardment on Ossus, the Jedi High Council and Grandmaster TiberiusMalvern decided that the Jedi Order would move all operations to the Dawn Temple built prior to the bombardment on Ossus.
In the slaughter of more than 450 Jedi on the planet Ossus, a collective of 150 Jedi from Ossus and 300 from the Jedi Temple on Devaron attempted to escape, while Republic fleets attempted to mask their escape.
Out of the 150 escaping Jedi on Ossus, only 100 survived due to stray Sith starcruisers gunning down transport ships.
Upon the arrival of Spintir, the surviving Jedi were instructed by Republic military forces to land in a hangar embedded in the side of a cliff.
Upon landing, the Jedi admired the stone and rock architecture of the Dawn Temple and the lush green forests and large mountain ranges of Spintir.

Spintir, where the Dawn Temple was located, was known for its large bodies of water and large marshlands.
The Dawn Temple was constructed as a sanctuary to reconnect the Jedi with the Force and all life around them.
The Temple was notable for its advances in the knowledge spectrum, as well as its technological advances.
The technology seen on the Dawn Temple was similarly used for the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and combined with that of the Temple of Ossus and the Jedi Sanctum.
The original concept of the Sanctum being hidden in plain sight from those who may arrive uninvited led to the creation of Dawn Temple's defenses.
The Dawn Temple was also built to hone the abilities of Force-sensitives and younglings.
It was a symbol of the Jedi Orderâ€™s long and bumpy past, with nods to individuals and relics of both Ossus and the Jedi Sanctum.
