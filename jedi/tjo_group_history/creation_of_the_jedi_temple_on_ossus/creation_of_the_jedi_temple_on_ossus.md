# Introduction

Having left the Jedi Sanctum, the Jedi colonists had one purpose to achieve; the fate of the Jedi Order’s future rested in their hands.
Unless they found a suitable world, where a colony could be established, the Sanctum would eventually be overrun with constantly incoming visitors, scholars, and hostiles.
The Order needed to possess another sanctuary, both as a backup facility and a much larger stronghold adjusted to holding hundreds of students at once.
This, along with the sudden rise in the Sith activities revolving around the motherland planet, caused the Jedi High Council to dispatch a few most talented Jedi in this search.
The navigators would use a wide variety of methods, such as utilising the planetary research data, sending specially designed probe droids to different regions of the galaxy, gathering reports from other allied worlds, and even relying purely on the guidance of the Force.

After many weeks, even months, of extensive searching, one of the navigators travelling through the Outer Rim sensed a distortion in the Force.
The scout followed the resolution in the Force and jumped out of hyperspace in the system of Ossus.
Even though the environment of the newly discovered world did not appear promising, the Jedi Researchers recognised the planet’s potential in the Force almost instantly after landing.
The cliffed shores of Ossus were a natural defensive formation, and the seas of the planet significantly facilitated the methods of possible communication.

Following the creation of a camp near one of the Ossus’ largest mountains, the Jedi Researchers gathered all pieces of information they would need in the future and forwarded them to the Grandmaster’s office.
As expected, the plan of inhabiting Ossus has launched soon afterward.
Such a large project would require many sacrifices and investments, but thanks to the hard work of many Jedi, the colonisation of what would become the capital Jedi Temple started to take place.

After most of the Jedi Masters engaged in the project had arrived safely on the planet and the supply routes had been set up, the official construction began.
The highest mountain peak on Ossus, along with several small, grassed islands, was chosen at the prime location due to its defensive capabilities, strong alignment with the light side of the Force, and easy access to the planet’s fauna and flora.
The building would be led by the Grandmaster of the Order, TiberiusMalvern himself, who came down to Ossus to oversee the raising of the stronghold and use his mastery in the Force for the benefit of the whole Order.
Shocking news regarding the complete eradication of the Jedi Sanctum caused by a Sith earthquake would leave many Jedi sorrowed.
However, thanks to the overwhelming support from the Jedi Council, it did not take long for grief to turn into hope for a greater future.
Ironically, the news of the destruction caused even more volunteers to come to Ossus.

Soon, thousands of Jedi Knights, Masters, and even Younglings, gathered on the planet’s surface.
Everyone wanted to use their own set of skills to help with the Temple’s creation.
The Jedi Council members such as Dercye, Vermened, Unite5000, and Essence_v1, along with two of the Masters of the Order, who had served continuous cadencies one after another, WolfSupport and ValSenko, would quickly begin launching various projects, events, and information broadcasts to ensure the whole community would be prepared for launch.
Skaxon, the Order’s Barsen’thor and the leader of the Jedi Assault Team at the time, was another important personage to have contributed to the Jedi Order during the Ossus’ development.
The enthusiastic, passionate atmosphere boosted the morale of the workers; with every chamber hollowed inside the mountain’s caverns, everybody worked even harder and longer with a smile on their faces.
To this day, this historical event was considered one of the prime examples of the Jedi Order’s power and teamwork.

As time passed, the Jedi Temple on Ossus would grow and develop, with many assembly rooms such as the duelling mats, lecture rooms, and the private administrative rooms being modelled to match those from the old, but not forgotten, Sanctum Temple.
One of the most notable achievements of the Jedi was the successful forming of the Great Library on Ossus.
After the prevailing Chief Librarian, CannonMalvern during the time, initiative, almost all of the archived database from Sanctum had been moved to Ossus to supply the largest gathering of knowledge in the galaxy.
Another notable individual, without whose commitment Ossus’ building would not be as easy, was iSingToooMuch, also known as iSing.
His influence and leadership as the Chief of Security were very beneficial.
Owing to him and his Temple Guards all the Jedi assisting in the Temple’s creation would be safe and provided with the necessary aid they might have needed.
iSing was also one of the Jedi Masters famous for the last ceremony hosted in the Sanctum Temple, followed by a great festival to celebrate a new Temple’s opening.
With many lore seminars, educational classes, and rallies being hosted every day, the library would soon become a symbol of teaching, progression, and tenacity of the Jedi.
In virtue of the overwhelming engagement in the Temple’s expansion, the team of Jedi Architects additionally assembled a network of magnificent gardens, meditation paths, and a track of countless Jedi pieces of architecture around the Jedi Temple.
With a large, almost 100 metres high staircase engraved in the rocks, along with an ornamented facade and monumental statues portraying the ancient Jedi Masters, the Jedi Temple on Ossus was easily one of the greatest architectural advancements of the Jedi.
