# Introduction

The Jedi Sanctum was an illustrious temple made by the Jedi Order.
It had survived for many years, with its habitation having taken place long before the construction of the Great Jedi Library on Ossus.
While there was no intention of migrating, there was a sudden assault by the Sith Order.
The Jedi, unaware of the reformation of the Sith Order, were caught off-guard.
Late in the evening, the Sith would begin their assault on the Jedi Sanctum.
The Sith would charge hastily towards the cavern, which led to the entrance of the Temple, and was led by the Dark Lord of the Sith Vermened.
The Jedi fought courageously, knowing their home could be lost.
The two forces clashed inside the humble cavern, creating a spectacle of gallantry and fury.
The entirety of the Jedi Temple Guard stood at the entrance, bracing the charge up front whilst more Jedi stood behind as reserve forces.
The Sith broke the defenses of the Temple Guard, causing them to scatter and forcing other Jedi to join the fight.
A line of Jedi jumped over the main line, flanking the Sith on the front line and shocking those behind the front, giving the Jedi an advantage.
A blow to the Sith occurred, but all that resulted from the flank was a boost in morale for the Sith, gaining an undying passion and level of vigor above the Jedi.

The tides turned in favor of the Sith once more.
Unable to push back against the Sith forces, the Jedi stood their ground, knowing that this day would likely be their last.
Only being able to hold the line whilst the rest of the Jedi escaped.
The Jedi clashed with the Sith wave after wave, and three hours into the battle, their numbers would begin to dwindle.
While the battle went on, many Jedi evacuated the Jedi Sanctum in transports, only able to hope for the best of others.
Many of the transports escaped, and others were destroyed by Sith cruiser bombardment.
The battle of the Jedi Sanctum lasted six hours, however, in the end, the strength of the Sith forces overwhelmed the Jedi, and their temple was lost.
Many of the most respected Jedi would fall valiantly, protecting their kin, and many surviving Jedi would mourn the loss of their most trusted friends, mentors, and students.
In celebration of victory, the Dark Lord Vermened made a display of his power and strength in the Force by causing an earthquake in the area for miles.
The Temple would begin to crumble from the inside, with the entrance being blocked by the shattered roof within, the exterior stayed standing and was left in a fragile state.
The result of the Temple’s destruction would mark the rebirth of the Sith Order and the journey to their former glory.
For the Jedi Order, it would mark a new age, a new start, and in time, it would mark the beginning of a newfound war.
The Jedi would come to inhabit the Great Jedi Library of Ossus.
It was rumored that the Jedi Sasnctum’s structure still stands, buried beneath land and stone.
