# Introduction

The Wright of the Order competition is a monthly event hosted by the Council of Reconciliation.
It would make its first appearance on the 25th June 2021, which makes it the third oldest competition after Duelist of the Order  and Scholar of the Order.
Unlike the other contests, Wright of the Order does not have a specified requirement of acceptable submissions- everyone above the rank of Initiate in the Jedi Order may submit an artwork ranging from anything between a drawing, a sculpture, a digital model or another a personal creation according to one’s own imagination and vision.
After being announced, the average WOTO submission time equals one week, after which a period of decision takes place.
The person who emerges victorious receives a unique Wright of the Order title, along with their submitted artwork being recognised in public and a set amount of credits, robux, or a Kyber crystal attempt voucher.

# Section 1

The Wright of the Order competition is held once every month, but there are many cases where it has not been held in the month for certain reasons.
During the week of preparation, the Council of Reconciliation assigns a set of judges who will review every submission and choose the best five artworks based on their quality, effort taken, creativity and uniqueness.
Having chosen the top five submissions, the team of judges then ranks the remaining pieces of art and announces the first, second and third places as the given month’s winners.
To participate, one must progress above the rank of Initiate.
It is important to note that a maximum of one submission can be sent by a person.
The original prizes would include Kyber crystals and robux, but along with the release of credits, this new currency would be the main award along with the unique title.

# Section 2

The first Wright of the Order competition was  held during the summer of 2021.
The first edition of the competition was three days long and Jedi Master WolfSupport, who was the main presenter of the contest back then, announced the victorious three: donnybrook on the 3rd place, Blazey_Kitsune (also known as Blazey_Aktuun) taking the 2nd place, and Rozeshi being the winner of the competition.
Most of that month’s victors had decided to submit a painting artwork.
All three winners have been publicly recognised for their effort, Blazey has also received a Kyber crystal, while donnybrook finished the competition with an additional Kyber crystal, a prestigious Wright of the Order title, and 2500 robux.
