# Introduction

The Jedi Temple on Ossus was originally established during the Jedi Order’s prime.
During this time, Ossus had become a centralized hub of activity for the Jedi, outdoing Courscant and Tython by a country mile so-to-speak.
However, an attack had occurred at the Temple, ending 4 years of development, consistent growth, and the training of many Younglings and Padawans.

# Section 1

The Jedi Temple came under attack by a Sith Fleet from orbit, which landed troops just outside the Temple.
While the defense fleet attempted to destroy the Sith forces in orbit, many were able to break through the Temple defenses.
During this time the Sith capital ship commanded by ShokuMatsu the Emperor's Dread, began to bombard the temple with high powered turbolaser fire.
Despite this, the Jedi continued to fight the Sith around the Temple, believing the Sith to be after the archives where secret Jedi and Sith artifacts alike believed were to be held.
Despite the Temple Guards, Jedi Sentinel, and Assault Team's best efforts, the Sith quickly overpowered the Jedi forces and quickly took over what remained of the temple.
The remaining Jedi, wise and unfoolish, gathered into their starfighters to depart to another Temple on another planet, and the Jedi forces in orbit of Ossus were forced to retreat to Coruscant.

# Section 2

Throughout the entire time of the invasion, a small force of Sith Inquisitors led by none other than Darth Invictus raided the archives and engaged in battle with Jedi Librarians and Ossus Keepers.
While it was a very difficult fight leading to the deaths of many Sith and Jedi alike, the Sith quickly gained access to the hidden vault of the Archives where the artifacts were held.
They quickly looked around for many ancient Sith artifacts.
During the time of the bombardment on the temple, having recovered these lost artifacts, the Sith Inquisitors quickly returned to their vessels and returned to the Sith Fleet, providing aide and the likes in fighting the Jedi Fleet while Darth LuciferTemenos returned to the Sith Temple on Crucible Prime with the artifacts.

# Section 3

During the attack on the Temple, the numbers of the Jedi on Ossus had dwindled to less than a third of the forces that were originally there.
Of the some 600 Jedi present at the time, roughly one hundred and fifty (150) Jedi remained before the retreat order was issued by Jedi Master Creation, the highest ranking Master present on the planet at the time.
When Master Creation issued the order for retreat, he ordered all remaining Jedi to link up at the Temple of Eedit on the planet Devaron, the nearest available refuge.
When the order was issued, all remaining Jedi quickly made their way to their starships and fighters, many taking along Youngling’s and Initiate’s with them as an attempt to protect the young trainee’s, and quickly left for the Jedi Defense Fleet, which was rapidly preparing their hyperdrives.
While a few ships were shot down by Sith fighters, most of the retreating Jedi forces made their way to the hangars and jumped with the rest of the fleet, leaving the Ossus Defense team to defend the archives from the Sith forces.

# Section 4

When the news reached the Jedi High Council on Coruscant of the state of Ossus, they quickly made the call to mount an assault force and sent them out to attempt to regain Ossus, with the force being led by none other than Jedi Council Member, Master DylanMalvern as the supreme commander.
With a force of roughly 1200 Jedi, assorted support personnel and the main Jedi Defense Fleet, the Jedi forces made short work of the Sith fleet in orbit before landing troops and beginning to assault the Sith which had occupied the Temple.
Much to the surprise of the Jedi, most of the Temple had actually been destroyed in the short time of the invasion.
The Council chambers were in ruins, the Knight Hall where trials were conducted had completely collapsed, and the Archives were in a complete disarray.

# Section 5

After the Sith forces were completely eradicated from the Temple and its immediate surroundings and in full retreat, a multitude of Jedi Sentinels, Assault Force members and assorted personnel were quickly dispatched to survey the land surrounding the temple more thoroughly for any remaining Sith, with the order of capturing them alive if able for interrogation.
During this period of time, Jedi Master DylanMalvern contacted the rest of the Council on Coruscant from the remains of the Council Chambers and gave them a rundown; listing casualty reports, what was lost/taken (after a quick investigation), and a report on the temple’s status itself.
In the eyes of Master DylanMalvern, he told his fellow councilors that the Temple itself could indeed be restored, but with considerable work and effort due to the immense damage that was sustained from the orbital bombardment.
From there, the council would decide to instead abandon the temple as a whole, turn it into an outpost to listen in on potential Sith activity in the surrounding sectors in a hopes to dissuade this situation from ever occurring again.
