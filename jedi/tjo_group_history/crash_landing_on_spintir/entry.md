# Introduction

Sometime around the year 3653 BBY, a Sith battlecruiser was navigating into the orbit of Krataa after abandoning Dathomir when a malfunction in the navigation system occurred.
They were immediately dropped out of hyperspace and were greeted by a fleet of Republic starships that were protecting an unknown planet.
Upon seeing this sight, the shipâ€™s captain, Valoris, attempted to divert the ship from crashing into a standstill Republic cruiser.
In this attempt, the ship suffered major engine failure from fire from Republic starcruisers; this would result in forcing him to make a split-second decision.

He steered his ship towards the unknown planet that the fleet was guarding against the vessel full of Sith Lords.
Flying into the planet's orbit, he was greeted by the lush forests of the unknown planet and the snowy mountains.
In order to stop the ship from crashing head-on, Valoris was forced to land near a cave.
Valoris checked to see if the other Sith Lords were as battered as he was; dozens of Sith were killed on impact, along with the starcruiser's on-board maintenance crews and officers, but CaessrTemenos, as well as Rogan and several other Sith Knights, were still alive and able to walk.

Exiting from the heavily damaged ship, the realization finally set in that they were stranded on an unknown planet.
Not knowing where to go or what to do, Caeser suggested that they explore the cave and attempt to find shelter.
Upon exploring more, they found scattered clothes, cans of expired rations, and a blanket; they used this to start off the hidden Sith Shelter.
The group of lords decided they would roam and get a better understanding of the land.
Caeser stayed with the group to hunt and build a shelter, while Rogan went east and Valoris went north.
Upon exploring, Valoris found fragments of a lightsaber, and as he explored deeper into the lush forest, he discovered a stairway up to the top of the stone mountain he had seen upon his initial crash.

When he observed closer, he could see that it was a structure, with Jedi-like statues in front and the sight of flashing blades.
Upon learning of this, Caeser raced back to tell the group, realizing that it had been hours since he'd first gone out, hoping the group was still alive and well.
Once Caeser arrived back to the group, he told everyone about the large temple he had found on the planet.
The only hope for this group of Sith was to overthrow this temple, await help, and feed on revenge.
