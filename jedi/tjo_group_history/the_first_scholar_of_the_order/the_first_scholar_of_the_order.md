# Introduction

The Scholar of the Order is a contest based around knowledge about the Star Wars universe and is the second oldest competition in the Jedi Order.
It is hosted every month, although sometimes the organisers decide to skip the given month, in order to come back the following month.
The Council of First Knowledge holds the responsibility for hosting it in various forms ranging from a lightning elimination trivia to a creative writing competition.
Every month, the organisers decide which activity is going to take place.
To participate in the contest, one must hold the rank of Initiate and above, similarly to the other competitions such as Duelist of the Order and Wright of the Order.
The winner, besides a kyber crystal and robux, also receives a unique “Scholar of the Order” title, which is displayed until the next Scholar of the Order event is hosted.

# Section 1

The original Scholar of the Order tournament relied on elimination trivia rules about the Star Wars lore.
This resulted in no delays between the competition’s end and announcing the final results, but was certainly less accessible due to many different time zones being present in the Order.
Another popular Scholar of the Order set up would give the participants around seven days to submit a creative piece of writing in a theme of Star Wars.
After the submission time ended, the organisers would grade all the submissions and choose the best three winning propositions.
Along with the release of credits, the contest’s rewards would be: the winner could gain a Kyber crystal, as well as a sum of credits, while the second and third place would either be provided with a choice between these two, or just a smaller amount of credits to spend.
Many Scholar of the Order events would be hosted using the Kahoot platform — it would limit the number of participants and provide an easy tool to distinguish a winner among the competitors.

# Section 2

The first Scholar of the Order tournament was hosted on the 15th May 2021 by the Council of First Knowledge.
Back then, the event would be held in a trivia form in the Community Stage voice channel.
After around an hour of rivalry, Cyromanic (known as AmicaLux)  emerged as the first winner of the Scholar of the Order and received a Kyber crystal along with a choice between 2500 robux or Discord Nitro.
