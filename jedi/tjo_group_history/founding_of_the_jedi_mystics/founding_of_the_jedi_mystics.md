# Introduction
Jedi Mystics are individuals who study the nature of the Force and template the philosophy of the Jedi.
They host the required Ethics & Philosophy class for Padawans and Initiate IIs.
The purpose of the Jedi Mystic is to teach philosophy in the manner it was fleshed out during the development of the Jedi Arbiters, which consisted of an overarching approach to do good things while participating in the Jedi Order community.

# Section 1
Jedi virtues were listed as the basic teachings of the Jedi Code, yet are also applied to the community as its core values.
That, among other various concepts about how to interpret toxicity and how to define the quality of Jedi Knights, is all tied in the philosophy Jedi Mystics teach.
The Jedi Mystics were created because the Senior Councilors of the Council of First Knowledge were attempting to fill a hole that was made when the community stopped doing philosophy classes during the days of the Jedi Sanctum.
From the understanding of Head Mystic SlateStatic that is what the Senior Councilors intended, but they allowed Slate to do what he thought was best in that regard.
Slate’s thinking was that all these rules and laws of the Order existing, showcase the line that you should not cross, yet he wanted to fill the gray area of what you should do as a community member in the Jedi Order to provide a good environment for all in this community.
That is why the philosophy is communicated in the manner that it is.
However, this philosophy was built during the time of the Arbiters, because the question of what a good quality Knights makes had to be answered.
When Slate was experimenting with this idea, he went off to sort of research and ponder that question, studying the various interpretations of the philosophy of the Jedi.
Generally speaking, they adhered to various world philosophies like Buddhism, Taoism, Stoicism, the teachings of Socrates, and the warrior philosophy of the Samurai.
The duty of the Jedi Mystic is to communicate with the community’s values, provide an environment of debate and discussion.
Mystics teach ethics and this philosophy, but whether Knights-in-training honor it is up to them.
The job is not to enforce an ideology on the community, but preach its value and application while they perform their duties, while in the progression system.



# Section 2
Jedi Mystics are the third and most likely final version of a specialization in the Council of First Knowledge that started with the reintroduction of Jedi Paladins back in January, 2022.
Jedi Paladins were going to be a Guardian specialization that specialized in enforcing discipline on members of the Jedi Order through discipline trainings, part of the basic proposal that SlateStatic wrote up for the former Head Paladin, MarcosMalvern.
Once what was greenlit, Slate also wrote up a document called the Paladin Doctrine, which detailed the duties and expectations of the Jedi Paladin, on top of a list of what Slate called “Knighthood Ethics.” These were not only part of the Jedi Paladin’s expectations, but also meant to be a series of ideals that were to be enforced considering that was part of the proposal.
This is where the philosophy known until this day began.



# Section 3
However, the Jedi Paladins were short lived, as eventually it was dropped, perhaps due to conflicts of duties with the Weapon Specialists.
The remnants of the discipline training idea were going to be moved to the Jedi Peacekeepers and the enforcement part of the Paladin idea were moved to the Jedi Arbiters.
Jedi Peacekeepers kept MarocsMalvern as their Head, where he served as Head Peacekeeper for a time.
Slate did not follow his former Head Paladin, he decided to join the Jedi Arbiters which were meant to be the quality inspectors, who participate in sending people into the “Discipline Trainings.” In a call with the former Caretaker of First Knowledge, PoH_v1, who appointed SlateStatic as Deputy-Head Arbiter, they mutually agreed that creation_v1 would be an ideal decision to represent the Arbiters on the Council of First Knowledge.
Jedi Arbiters were organized as a means to enforce the ideology the Mystics now teach, which included violations of the Knighthood Principles as well as vice.
Vices  are what is interpreted as an element of toxicity.
On April 23rd 2022, the Jedi High Council determined the Jedi Arbiters were not fulfilling their role, and decided to go down the route of traditional Jedi-monks, and with that change Caretaker of First Knowledge ValSenko appointed SlateStatic as Head Arbiter due to his previous contributions regarding the Jedi philosophy ideas.
About a week later, Arbiters were about to come to an end.



# Section 4
The Jedi Mystic concept, as it is known now, was communicated to Slate on May 1st 2022, when Senior Councilors of First Knowledge ValSenko and Archimedes_v1 were pushed to reform the Arbiters from what it used to be.
The idea was about a required class for both Padawans and Initiate IIs to undergo before taking their Knighthood Trials.
This was something Slate actually had wanted for quite some time, as he never thought “enforcement” of an ideology was a good thing, in fact inherently negative.
Slate wanted the philosophy to be used in a positive, productive way, and not to punish people for their mistakes.
Slate brought up a number of different name change possibilities as this was an alteration of the job Arbiters did, a new name should represent that change.
A few strong candidates were Cleric, Prophet, Druid and Mystic.
Mystic ended up being chosen as both Senior Councilors and Slate thought it fit best.
As for the former Heads, the Jedi Mystic basically has no former Head.
Jedi Paladins were run by MarcosMalvern, Jedi Arbiters were first run by creation_v1.
Jedi Mystics are significant to the Order because, unlike the laws of the Order, which tell you what line you must not cross, the philosophy that Mystics teach provide the basis for good behavior and good deeds.
An fact of virtue is an act of love for the community.
Jedi Mystics cannot force Knights to follow the virtues and adhere to them, but they must encourage it, and they must show them that it is important for building strong relationships in their time as a Jedi in the Order.
It is an extension of the ideals outlined in the Jedi Code.
Mystics must represent the virtues to the best of their ability, but even Mystics are not saints.
“It is our duty to provide not perfection, but potential for growth in ourselves and our peers.”
