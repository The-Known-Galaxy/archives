# Introduction
The Jedi Seers is a specialization within the Council of Reassignment.
They work within the Jedi Service Corps and teach the Initiates the importance of plagiarism, how to be a good role model, and the basics of a Jedi Knight.
While this is their primary job, their secondary job is helping Initiates with their Knight Trial documents, specifically the lore part.

# Section 1
Before the Jedi Seers were named the Jedi Seers, they were once named Lore Teachers; they are as old as the Jedi Service Corps, made as a part of JSC to impart their knowledge to Initiate II.
Then on May 14, 2021, led by the first Chief Lore Keeper Blazey_Kitsune, they became a real specialization within the Council of First Knowledge.
As they became a real specialization, their name changed from Lore Teachers to Lore Keeper instead of just being Teachers who teach within the Jedi Service Corps.
