# Introduction

Regulated by the Galactic Empire, the Wastes, a Wild Space Sector, was located beyond Bescane, a temperate planet run by Galentro Heavy Works located near Dantooine, which was covered in factories that, eventually, destroyed all of its natural beauty.
The worlds were used for testing siege techniques, planetary bombardment, radiation warfare, bioweapon testing, and other prohibited actions, that could not be done within the public eye.
Planets Zeta Zero Nine and PL-40112-CE-021105, Grand Moff Bertroff Hissa’s homeworld, were hidden within the secretive Wild Space Sector.

# Section 1

Concealed in Zeta Zero Nine, was a secret Imperial research facility, one of Moff Jesco Comark’s Death Hunter projects.
The Death-Hunter Cyborg was Imperial Moff Jessco Comark’s brainchild, who used his position in the Imperial Intelligence’s Bureau of Operations Renik branch to extract funds in order to replace the Galactic Empire’s bounty hunters with perfect killing machines.
Within the research facility, he would capture humans from Bescane and turn them into his own cyborg assassins.
This meant all of the human’s physical abilities would be coated with technological additions.
Eventually, the facility was found and destroyed by the Alliance, a military resistance movement, and most of the captured humans were freed.

# Section 2

Pl-401120-CE-021105, home to Grand Moff Bertoff Hissa a human Sephi-hybrid of the Galactic Empire, was located within the Wild Space sector.
Until the Empire launched a survey, the planet was uncharted.
The surveyors awoke an ancient horde of interdimensional monsters called Rozzum.
Because of this, the Imperials were forced to ally with the Near-Humans in order to get rid of the creatures.
After, only two survived the encounter: Hissa and Commander Quarsh Panaka, the ranking Imperial officer from Naboo, a Mid Rim Territory within the Chommell sector.
