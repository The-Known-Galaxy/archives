# Introduction

The Void of Aogros was a mysterious and expansive part of Wild Space,  found in the Tunka Sector of the Outer Rim Territories in grid square H-18.
The Void does not contain any major star systems with the exception of the Quintarad, which is a system of five stars orbiting each other.
Little is known about the Voidâ€™s history, other than that the Quintarad may be artificial, constructed by the ancient Celestials who disappeared from the region by 30,000 BBY.

# Section 1

With the Quintarad being the primary system of the Void, it is a one-of-a-kind oddity within a desolate and starless region.
Astrophysicists as well as Xenoarcheologists were able to pinpoint the possibility of the Quintarad being made artificially, as evidence and remnants of an ancient sentient peoples known as the Celestials are thought to be the main cause of this anomaly.
Expeditions and probes would be sent into the quinary system to no result, with none making it back from the journey.

# Section 2

Being one of many possible artificial anomalies within the galaxy, it still remains unknown on how the Celestials may have formed the Quintarad, nor where they were within the Void of Aogros.
The mysterious nature of the Celestials and their pre-Galactic deposition renders most evidence hard to obtain if any exists at all.
The main method of discovering the many formations and artifacts of the Celestials is only found through Xenearcheology.
