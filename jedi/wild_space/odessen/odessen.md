# Introduction

Odessen was an unsettled planet situated in Wild Space, near the Unknown Regions.
Featuring extensive oceans and mountainous continents, the planet had a mild climate and a variety of wildlife amid its forests.
The entire planet was a Force nexus and it had a balanced connection with the Force.
Following the Eternal Empire’s victory over the galaxy, the Grandmaster Satele Shan went into exile on Odessen for several years.
In 3631 BBY, it was selected as the location for the headquarters of the Alliance against Zakuul.
The planet’s location was kept hidden until its revelation to the Eternal Emperor Arcann, who mounted an unsuccessful attack on the planet.
Odessen was assaulted a second time by Vaylin, who succeeded her brother to the Eternal Throne.
The second battle was far more catastrophic to Alliance forces, yet it still saw them emerging victorious over the Eternal Empire.
Odessen became the capital of the Alliance against Zakuul, which had reformed themselves as the Eternal Alliance.

As a backwater planet, Odessen’s location was unknown to the galaxy for the majority of galactic history.
Over half of the planet’s surface was covered with oceans and seas, while the terrain was filled with flourishing vegetation and tall forests that sprouted from the mountain ranges.
Native to Odessen, the shade stalkers were highly aggressive predators that hunted in packs.
The animals had thick scaly hides, suggesting that they were not always predatorial, and they seemingly did not require food to survive.
Doctor Juvard Illip Oggurobb had theorized that their rapid evolution may have been related to the planet’s Force properties.
When the scientist introduced several more species to Odessen, he found that evolutionary changes were present within a year.

In 3636 BBY, Satele Shan discovered the planet and went into exile after failing to defend the Galactic Republic against the Eternal Empire, choosing the planet because of its strong affinity with the Force.
The Grandmaster cut down a section of wooded land and transformed it into a small camp, where she lived for years with the company of the Force ghost of Darth Marr.
In 3631 BBY, the pair anticipated the arrival of the Alliance Commander and planned on adequately preparing them against the Eternal Empire.
Following the Battle of Asylum, the former Sith Intelligence Minister Lana Beniko chose Odessen as the prime world for the Alliance headquarters after the planet pulled at her through the Force.
Lana called upon her contacts to participate in the war against Zakuul, and the Alliance base was soon established on a cliffside.
News of the Alliance’s exploits against the Eternal Empire spread far across the galaxy, leading Republic and Imperial personnel alike to travel to the planet and join their cause.
After finding the Alliance Commander unconscious in the wilderness, Satele Shan carried the Commander to her starship, parked near her camp.
Along with Darth Marr, the two imparted their knowledge and wisdom to the Commander, trialling them to ensure they were ready to put an end to the Eternal Empire.

In around the following year, the artificial intelligence, SCORPIO, had revealed the position of the Alliance headquarters to Arcann, who responded by sending his detachment of the Eternal Fleet towards the planet.
The Alliance Commander scrambled the Gravestone, an ancient warship of tremendous power, to defend the planet from orbit.
In the ensuing space battle, Arcann was defeated in a duel when his Eternal Flagship was boarded by the Alliance Commander, while the remainder of his fleet was crippled by the Gravestone.
In his absence, Vaylin became the new Empress of Zakuul and eventually launched another assault on Odessen.
The Eternal Empress managed to land battalion sized units accompanied by Eternal Empire walkers and Siege Skytroopers.
She was killed in a confrontation at the Alliance base, bringing about the surrender of her soldiers by the thousands.
In the aftermath of the battle, the Alliance had occupied Zakuul and the Eternal Throne was relocated from the Spire to the Alliance base, where it was used to control the Eternal Fleet.
