# Introduction
Kalee is a terrestrial planet located in the Wild Space on the border of the Kadok Regions.
It is also home to the Kaleesh species.

# Section 1
The planet Kalee is filled with beautiful scenery of nature, canyons, and beaches.
Though it may seem like the planet is living in peace, it was actually a cruel world.
The planet is home to the intelligent bipedal hunter-warriors, the Kaleesh.



# Section 2
During the Galactic War, the Kaleesh began populating other star systems.
The Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire acknowledged them due to their brute forces and strength as warriors.
Many of the species were against the Sith, yet they supported both forces in war.

Due to many engagements with conflict, poverty arose with the Kaleesh.
Around 100 BBY, Bitthævrian threatened the border of the Kadok Regions with plans to overthrow a government–which alerted the Republic and convinced the Kaleesh that they should defeat the Bitthævrian.
The Jedi supported the Kaleesh against the Bitthævrian, marking the start of the Kaleesh–Bitthævrian War.



# Section 3
During the Huk War, the Kaleesh lost, since the Republic reinforced the Huks in the war.
General Grievous, who led the Kaleesh, nearly defeated the Huks, but he was incapacitated in a shuttle crash.
San Hill, Chairman of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, paid the Geonosians to create a cybernetic suit for Grievous, later leading the Separatist Army.
The economic recovery of Kalee was funded by the Banking Clan in return for the work of Grievous.
The Huk on Oben were slaughtered by Grievous’ former subordinates, which were now under Bentilais san Sk’ar’s command, and later emigrated to Oben.

With the rise of the New Order, the Kaleesh, together with Bentilais san Sk’ar and his subordinates, opposed the rule of the Empire, which resulted in a conflict between them.
When Captain Thrawn attacked the planet Oben, the conflict concluded, with Sk’ar later joining the Empire.
