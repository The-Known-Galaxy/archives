# Introduction

The Mephout Dominion was a government and a sector within the Wild Space.
Within the sector, was the Mephout’s home planet Mephout.
The capital of the Mephout Dominion was Mephout, discovered by the Empire during the Galactic Civil War, a major galactic conflict between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic.

# Section 1

The Mephout species were sentient beings local to Mephout.
Sentience was determined by the life form’s ability to reason, speak, and operate tools.
The Mephout politicians and diplomats were all female due to the male’s inability to control their tempers and their hot-headed natures.
Mephout was also home to the Plintep Cybernetics Corporation, a company responsible for creating the RST Model Translator Droid to use within the Mephout Dominion.
The translator was built with feminine programming and a large bust because of the prominence of females in the species.
The RST model was able to translate languages without the delicacy and refinement of a protocol droid.

# Section 2

The RST model’s sensitivity to electromagnetic pulses affected their rationality circuits and life conservation programming.
These defects led to several problems with the Mephout’s government affairs, resulting in a dozen assassinations, half a dozen declarations of war, and even a marriage proposal.
Eventually, the RST model was considered a liability and sold off or given away as presents, being retired.
Later, they were replaced by modern protocol droids.

One notable RST model was 42-RST, also known as Rusti.
Rusti was owned by Bungo Bung, captain of the Chubby Gundark, a SoroSuub freighter.
Rusti was given as a gift to Captain Bung for services rendered, but Rusti was a part of the outdated technology giveaways.
Rusti was Captain Bung’s co-pilot on the Chubby Gundark.
Great Bantha Breakfast Biscuit Run, a two-week transport mission where Bung made several thousand credits to transport large amounts of Bantha Breakfast Biscuits, was a direct consequence of owning Rusti.
She established it by off-handedly commenting that he should give them to thousands of beings in the galaxy who have never tried them; however, the mission was ended when they found out the biscuits were mutating into Giant Amorphous Bantha Breakfast Buscuits, amoeboid creatures that were created when the biscuits were placed into the autochef.
The biscuits bonded with the bantha genetic material in the meat to create a creature that would rapidly eat the chef.
Because of this incident and several other comments Rusti had made, she was known for her sarcasm.
Eventually, her life preservation programming was modified, and she tried to escape from the Giant Amorphous Bantha Breakfast Biscuit.
