# Introduction
The Utegetu Nebula sometimes referred to as “Paradise Nebula,” was a shell nebula, a cloud of gas and dust that formed many stars was located within the Wild Space.
Located between Reecee, an astronomical object,  and Adumar, a temperate planet, Utegetu Nebula was created by a supernova.
A supernova occurred when a large star stopped to combine light elements into substantial elemental products.
The loss of heat allowed the star to subside onto itself to form a neutron star or a black hole which could happen naturally or with a superweapon.
Utegetu Nebula was also located near Chiss space, a portion of the galaxy ruled by the Chiss, and the Rago Run, a spacelane anchored by the Mid Rim world of Rago.

Section 2: History

Utegetu Nebula contained Woteba, a planet discovered in 35 ABY by Han Solo, a galactic legend who gained fame from being a member of the Rebel Alliance, and his wife, Leia Organa Solo, Luke Skywalker’s twin sister.
There were also estimated to be at least thirteen other planets within Utegetu Nebula.
Under the Qoribu Truce, a truce forged by the Killik Colony and Chiss Ascendancy in 35 ABY,  Woteba and the many other planets were occupied by Killik nests.


The Dark Nest, an undisclosed nest of Killiks hidden from the rest of the Colony, secretly colonized a fifteenth unnamed world orbiting the star Tusken’s Eye, a G-class star.
A G-class star was yellow and medium-temperature with a lifespan of ten billion years.
The Galactic Alliance’s Fifth fleet surrounded the nebula at the Murgo Choke to prevent Killiks from traveling to Chiss space, so they wouldn’t start a war; however, a war eventually occurred called the Swarm War.

The Swarm War occurred in 36 ABY, including the Chiss Ascendance, the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, and the Colony, which consisted of Killiks and Joiners.
The Joiners were non-Killiks marinated into the Killik hive mind.
The Swarm War was also a continuation of the Dark Nest Crisis, even though the Galactic Alliance attempted to combine with the Chiss, Jedi elements sided with the Killiks, so the Chiss thought the Alliance aided the Colony; accordingly, it ended up becoming a three-way battle.
Eventually, the Alliance came together in order to win the Swarm War.
