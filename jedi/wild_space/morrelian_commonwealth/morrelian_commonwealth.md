# Introduction

The Morrelian Commonwealth was a Star Cluster found in the Wild Space regions, containing several star systems with the center being the Morellia system, to which it bears it’s namesake.
The Commonwealth is most well-known for its native inhabitants, the Morellians.
These near-human sentient species are known for their remarkable lifespans, as well as characteristically having red hair.
A Morellian can live up to the age of 160 and beyond, truly unique for a near-human species.

# Section 1

Due to the relative isolation of the Wild Space regions, the Morellian Commonwealth maintained and utilized low-level technology throughout it’s systems and worlds, with the primary arm of law-enforcement or defense being the Morellian Enforcers, who used primitive and somewhat limited technologies, with their primary weaponry being the 48-caliber Enforcer pistol manufactured and designed by the Morellian Weapons Conglomerate.

# Section 2

In recent history, the most well-known Morellian is Barosa Warren, who is thought to have been the last of his species.
He is well known for his expert survivalist skills, in which he headed the Galactic Outdoor Survival School as it’s Chancellor.
Holding a contempt for his former students who had joined the Rebel Alliance, he would begin a personal vendetta to which he would be feared by most rebels in the boundaries he was known to be in.
Torla, a former friend of Warren, was so scared of him that she disappeared from known space.
