# Introduction

Zakuul, a planet located in Wild Space, was the birthplace and capital of the Eternal Empire.
The planet was coated with an exceptional amount of southern ocean and swamps, including the Endless Swamp, known for its prodigious overgrown trees.
Balancing between the light and dark sides of the Force, the planet had a rare connection to the Force, similar to Odessen.
Home to many immigrated humans, Zakuul also had other species such as Iknayid and the swamp rancor.
Resting place of the throne and branching off from the Spire, Zakuul City, the planet had up-to-date technology with numerous cities spread throughout the world.

Because of its backwater position in Wild Space, Zakuul was a planet that had possessed no interaction with the rest of the galaxy; however, the builders of Iokath occupied the planet to be used as a testing site for their weapons.
Although the cause of events is unknown, somehow early Zakuulans immigrated to the world and started tribes led by three superstitious Force-Sensitive Leaders: Matriarch, High Shaman, and Champion.
The Zakuulans believed in Zildrog, an adviser to warriors who gifted them the Breath of the Dragon, a spiritual blessing.

During the time of the Zakuulans, the final conflict between the Eternal Fleet and the Gravestone transpired.
Concluding the conflict, the Gravestone was left in the Endless Swamp and the Eternal Fleet was over.
At the most influential point of the Old Ways, the Zakuulans were nihilistic and worshiped a pantheon of gods.
The leader among them was Izax, the god of death and Ultimate Devourer, who demonstrated his power through the discomfort and torture of his followers.
The Zakuulans believed their fate was tied to the Old Gods, and the ones who debated were identified as a demon and outcasted from society to the Endless Swamp.
Later, a prophecy was made promising that the Demon Savior would revolt above the pantheon and murder Izax leading to a new era.
Hundreds of years later, Vitiate appeared on the planet after being tempted by gossip about the Eternal’s Fleet’s new obliteration of Wild Space’s inhabitants.
As he traveled, he found Zakuul and decided to claim it as a place for his new empire and later became the powerful warrior known as, Valkorion.
Valkorion declared himself Demon Savior and built his new empire from the base of the Endless Swamp.

After Valkorian defeated the Old ways he repurposed multiple tribes from around the planet, taking their force-sensitive leaders, and turned them into the Knights of Zakuul.
The Knights of Zakuul’s job was to guard their planet and to serve Valkorian and even included a sector of Knights known as Scions who were able to see visions of past events and the future.
The Old World was the first city created on Zakuul; however, Valkorian didn’t deem it worthy enough, so he kept renovating it until he finally developed the Spire.
He then was able to make his people scientists by evolving sociology and purpose for generations who held a connection with the Old Ways.
In due course, he was able to navigate the empty Eternal Fleet using his Scions and assigned the installation of the Eternal Throne.
Once the Eternal Throne was operational, other planets were taken over by the Eternal Empire, who eventually expanded its power to a large chunk of Wild Space.

Eventually, a surplus of resources entered into Zakuul, including credits and raw materials which were essential to the planet’s expansion and expansion of its military technology which, in many regards, was inspired by the Eternal Fleet.
The citizens of Zakuul were given a stipend of credits making them the highest class of any core world who got everything they desired.
Throughout this time period, the Old World was a place to live out their darkest dreams of brutality and to feed on any other desires before returning to the Spire.
For about a hundred years, the Eternal Empire was at a calmness with the Eternal Fleet barely being mobile other than when collecting resources.
That is until the murder of Valkorion.

Following the Battle of Zakuul, the Eternal Empire ended and was taken over by the Eternal Alliance, who inherited control over Zakuul.
Even though the planet was under the Eternal Alliance’s rule, many rebellions were set out during the same time period as the War on Iokath.
In 3629 BC, after The Outlander’s Mission to Nathema, the people of Zakuul split from the Alliance to start their own government, because the Eternal Alliance was no longer a threat after the Eternal Fleet and Gravestone were demolished.
The Exchange, a criminal organization, later occupied Zakuul after the Invasion of Ossus.
