# Introduction

The Jahilid Drift, a region within the Wild Space, held worlds such as Koltine and Pral.
The Jahilid system, a star system, is also estimated to be near or within the region, as some may guess by the name.
The Jahilid Drift is also believed to contain more, undiscovered, planets.

More than ten standard years after the Galactic Empire’s establishment, around 9 BBY, Kaleesh Imperial General Bentilais san Sk’ar commanded an invasion force within the Jahilid Drift.
Kaleesh Imperial General Bentilais san Sk’ar was originally a warlord on his native planet Kalee, which was eventually destroyed by Imperial Star Destroyers; however, Sk’ar accepted his defeat and allowed Emperor Palpatine to see his potential and accept him into his Imperial army.
During the invasion Sk’ar led, Sk’ar subjugated several worlds, including the known worlds: Koltine and Pral.
Because of Skar’s victories in subjugating the worlds, his reputation was boosted among the greatest Imperial admirals, even those who were speciesist, a belief also known as xenocentrism and racism.
Though the region isn’t very well known, it served as a way for Kaleesh Imperial General Bentilais san Sk’ar to prove himself to all who thought the Kaleesh weren’t worth befriending.
