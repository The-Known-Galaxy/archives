# Introduction

Created by the Sith of the Mecrosa Order, the lightfoil were exquisite weapons equivalent in quality to Jedi lightsabers.
The technology behind lightfoils extended beyond the Sith and became a favored weapon among certain Tapani nobility.

# Section 1

The lightfoil can be traced back to the Mecrosa Order, a clandestine Sith organization that existed before the Great Sith War.
They are thought to have created the first lightfoils in secret, employing technology comparable to that of the Jedi Order.
These weapons were equal to Jedi lightsabers and were designed to be wielded in the Makashi technique with one hand.
Because of their small and finely crafted handles, they were ideal for this function.

# Section 2

The Sith influence on the Tapani sector decreased following the Cleansing of the Nine Houses, leading to the development of less potent "modern" lightfoils.
These weapons were favored amongst select nobility, who would pay exorbitant prices to obtain them.
These post-Cleansing lightfoils, however, were weaker than genuine or "archaic" lightfoils because of the poor quality focusing crystals utilized in their construction and the comparatively low degree of expertise of the crafters of modern lightfoils, in comparison to Jedi artisans.

# Section 3

The lightfoil was created for exquisite, one-handed combat in the Makashi style, which places an emphasis on precision and grace.
Because of its lightweight and balanced construction, it was an ideal weapon for this purpose.
Yet because of its smaller size and weaker blade, it was not as effective in combat as a lightsaber.
Proficient lightfoil users, however, could still employ the weapon to lethal effect.
