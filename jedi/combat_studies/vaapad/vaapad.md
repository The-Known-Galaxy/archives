# Introduction

Sometime during the later days under the Galactic Republic's reign, Master of The Order Mace Windu alongside Master Sara Bulq would engineer a new form of lightsaber combat.
This form of lightsaber combat became known as "Vaapad" which was the second variant of form seven.
Regardless of it being more known as a form of combat, the form itself was a "State of Mind" as well.
This was due to the form channeling one's inner darkness into a specific engagement and redirecting their opponent's fury.
This state of mind would allow it to be applicable within hand-to-hand combat as well as in lightsaber confrontations.

# Section 1

Commonly referred to as "The Ferocity Form", it was known to be practiced by both Jedi and Sith alike.
Although, the original name of the form came from a native creature on the planet of Sarapin which was named both Juyo and Vaapad by the locals.
This creature was known for utilizing various attacks that were almost seemingly invisible to its prey.
This was a major reason why the form was named after the creature as Vapaad.
It was noted to create a weave of near-invisible energy.
The form would also require the practitioner to use bold and direct movements in rapid succession which were heavily unpredictable.
These maneuvers would flow into each other with precision, that of liquid.
Due to this, it made the wielder appear as if they were wielding a plethora of lightsabers at once allowing the practitioner to easily throw off an opponent.
Lastly, this form would also require much more Force energy from a user as it required much more emotional concentration.
This extensive Force energy would cause the wielder to undergo exponential internal pressure when using the form.

# Section 2

Just like any other form of lightsaber combat, the moves that the form utilized could be practiced.
Although, a practitioner would not be using the full extent of the form until they permitted the excitement and passion of battle to take over, which often disarrayed these sequences.
Although, when a user of the form allows for this passion to take over the movements of the form would become much more unpredictable or paradoxical.
Nevertheless, allowing the form to take over one's actions would also lead them closer to the dark side of the Force.
Hence why information regarding the form would later become heavily restricted.
Mace Windu would later completely restrict the usage of the form without his permission.
The only known Jedi that Windu would ever go on to grant the knowledge of this form was Depa Billada.
