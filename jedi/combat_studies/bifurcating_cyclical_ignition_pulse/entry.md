# Introduction

Bifurcating cyclical-ignition pulse was a common lightsaber modification, designed to allow the blade to function underwater or in the presence of other similar liquids.
The modification was more commonly known as waterproof casing because of this.

While the Lightsaber is one of the most advanced pieces of technology in the galaxy, it is not excused from the laws of physics.
When exposed to water, the saber’s circuitry would short out and overload, requiring some maintenance and repairs.
The workaround for this was to use two kyber crystals that are rapidly switched between, allowing the blade to function.
For clarification, water would not be able to enter the saber from the emitter as the blade boils all water surrounding it, insulating the circuit in this scenario.
Alongside this, the secondary focusing crystals would act as another layer of protection

# Section 2

Originally invented for their saber by the ancient Jedi, knowledge of bifurcating cyclical-ignition pulse technology was lost to time due to war or a force-sensitive purge.
It was only discovered millennia later by Jedi Master Kit Fisto, who re-discovered it and popularised it.
This gave him a great advantage against his opponents as he was mainly deployed to aquatic environments due to his species’ amphibious nature.
By the time of the clone wars, most Jedi were fighting in wet or aquatic environments which resulted in many adopting the modification.
Finally, by the time of the Jedi Order’s revival after the Fall of the Empire, bifurcating cyclical ignition had become standard in all lightsabers.
