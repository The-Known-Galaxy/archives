# Introduction

The fifth form of lightsaber combat was Djem So.
However, this form had two variants, one being Djem So, and the other being Shien.
This form was the “Perseverance Form” and it was commonly associated with the “Krayt Dragon.” The form's origins date back to the 3996 BBY era; this form had just started to be utilized within the Jedi and Sith.

# Section 1

This form was most prominently based on form three, Soresu.
Soresu was a very defensive form that focused on defense and waiting for the opportunity to strike from the opponent's mistakes.
However, Jedi feared that this form could be too passive and lead to more lengthy duels.
Djem So was created to be more offensive and overwhelming an opponent, resulting in the end of a duel as quickly as possible.
In contrast, Shien was more focused on deflecting blaster shots and more defensive methods.
Shien was the more defensive variant of the form, often relying on blaster bolt maneuverability and accuracy.

# Section 2

The sub form of Shien focused on turning a defensive block into an offensive one by consistently deflecting bolts or lightsabers.
A weakness of this form is the difficulty to duel other lightsaber wielders because Shien's is used explicitly for defense and blaster bolt deflection, with a minuscule amount of offensive advantages.
However, if dual-wielded, this form was deadly against those equipped with sabers, and especially blaster users.
Shien strengths against long range foes resulted in opponents who wielded a blaster could be easily forced into submission.

# Section 3

Djem So was a very aggressive and combative form.
The form was to be used strongly, it required a high level of physical demand and energy.
The style was focused on heavy lightsaber strikes with finesse speed.
The overall objective was to overwhelm an opponent by exhaustion or sheer strength by breaking the guard.
In the Djem So stance, the user was less prone to lose defense as their offense would easily overcome any attack thrown from a foe.
Those who used this form must be careful, it was usually disliked by the Jedi for its aggressive nature, it was stated to hold a dark side energy to it when used.
Notable users of this form were: Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, and Kyle Katarn.
