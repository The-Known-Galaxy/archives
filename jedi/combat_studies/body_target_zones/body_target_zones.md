# Introduction

In lightsaber combat, there are five target zones combatants are trained to strike.
These five zones are introduced as the trainee learns Shii-Cho.
Each of the five target locations has a corresponding strike and block in Shii-Cho.

# Section 1

The first of the zones covers the head, and hitting this zone involves the attacker doing a downward strike down the middle of the defender's head.
To defend against a zone one attack, the defender must raise their lightsaber above their head and angle the blade down.
Some expert practitioners can turn a zone one defence into a downward attack on zone two or three.

# Section 2

The second zone is the upper half of the right side of the defender's body, with the third being the upper left.
Attacks against zones two and three were commonly diagonal strikes through the zone.
Interestingly a zone two attack can be parried by a zone three attack and vice versa.
Defending zones two and three are important as they are the zones where most humanoid species keep essential organs, such as the heart and lungs.
Failure to protect zones two and three can also lead to loss of limbs, primarily the weapon arm in zone two.
Zone two and three attacks can also be parried by an upward stroke through zone five and six.
With zone six parrying zone two and zone five parrying zone three.

# Section 3

Zone four covers the back of the body as well as the midsection.
Hitting the back of a defender is quite tricky, but a successful hit will almost guarantee a killing blow.
Zones two to five all intersect zone four.
Most attacks against zone four are horizontal strikes across the defender's body.
There are two ways to defend against a zone four strike.
The first and hold the hilt over your head or shoulder with one or two hands extending the blade down behind you.
The other is more awkward, it involves having the blade in one hand behind the waist and extending the blade upwards.

# Section 4

Zones five and six cover the legs of the defender.
Zone 5 is the right leg, with zone 6 being the left leg.
Attacks to zones five and six can be difficult to block as they can be pretty low.
But an attack on the opposite zone will be effective.
However, the best defence to a low strike on zones five or six is by jumping and attacking high on the attacker while their weapon is low.
