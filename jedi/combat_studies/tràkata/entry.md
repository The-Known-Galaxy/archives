# Introduction

Tràkata is a rarely used form apart from the seven standard and well known forms.
While dueling the user would swiftly dis-ignite the lightsaber then re-igniting again, giving them a variety of options to attack since the opponent is unable to react.
This style of dueling was crafted by a Jedi Consular during the Old Republic.
Controversially, it wasn’t used as much due to the dishonorable and dishonest form of combat it could be used for.
Both the Jedi and Sith alike neglected Tràkata, using the main and most known forms instead.

# Section 1

The Jedi would deem this a dirty trick and unhonest to the duel at hand, seeing as it mostly was used with deceiving the opponent and opening up their guard.
Claiming it was used with signs of weakness and lacking in power, the Sith would stray from this form of combat as well.

Since Tràkata enforces much of a practical combat and deception in its use, neither side would use it commonly.
When disigniting the saber, you give away the blade in which are the roots from both sides of the Force.
Turning your main key in combat into a deceptive and manipulative tactic.
This did not go hand in hand with either side's focus of combat, Sith being the raw strength and power it takes to overpower one's opponent.
While the Jedi would be more patient and defensive, unlike the quick, deceptive practice Trakata used.

# Section 2

There are many ways to use Tràkata as an advantage towards your opponent, such as disigniting with perfect timing and various feints.
However when disigniting the blade, you lose a great deal of defense, meaning your next move must be quick and swift.
Users would wait for the opponent to swing their saber with full force, allowing them to feint and hold their victim in place with very little time to react.
There are three distinct and common techniques that go along with Trakata.

The first being a technique called, “Pass the Blade''.
As the user swings, they would wait for their opponent to raise their block.
Then disignite the saber, by passing through their defense before reigniting and striking successfully on the now defenseless opponent.

The second technique being, “Unbalancing Block''.
The user would wait until the opponent collided blades against one another, before dis-igniting and letting the opponent stumble from the force they had just put into their own attack.
Allowing the user to attack a now stumbled and open opponent.

The third and final technique, “Flash Slash”.
It was a quick strike that required letting the blade reach full length before deactivating.
This wouldn’t allow the opponent to block and as soon as the user got past their defense they would reignite again.
Slashing the opponent in one swift motion.
