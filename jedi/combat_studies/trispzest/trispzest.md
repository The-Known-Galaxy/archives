# Introduction
Trispzest was a lightsaber combat form derived from Juyo or Form VII as well as elements from traditional S’kytri aerial combat, it was invented and developed by a Force-sensitive Majestrix native of Skye, Kharys.
It’s translation in the S’kytric language was heart palpitation, and was specialized for aerial users to utilize against grounded enemies or as the S’kytri referred to as “walkers.” This form of combat was aimed at swiftly eliminating a “walker” by means of rapid attacks.

This form of lightsaber combat was not extensively utilized nor as well known in comparison to the seven traditional lightsaber forms, but notable individuals who did utilize this were Kharys, Nazish, and the Dark Jedi Maw.
It heavily implemented the use of Sai-Cha, or decapitation with a lightsaber as a quick means of killing an opponent.
Another technique, specifically utilized by Maw, was a spinning attack utilizing sporadic, wild attacks in the air effective in killing large swathes of enemies.
Trispzest had many advantages, but it’s most lethal flaw would be its exposure underneath the user, where it would be open to an accurate enough attack.
