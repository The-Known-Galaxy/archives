# Introduction
Soresu, known as the Way of the Mynock and the Resilience Form.
Soresu is the third form of the seven classic lightsaber combat forms.
Originally, Soresu was created to defend against attacks from blasters, Soresu focused mainly on a strong defensive technique to outlast the opponent, meaning that the practitioners of Soresu were waiting until the opponent began making mistakes due to frustration.
One of the bad sides of using Soresu is that the form is lacking offensive capabilities, which was heavily criticized.

# Section 1
Soresu, Form Three, the Way of the Mynock; also known as the Resilience Form is the most effective defensive form of all the saber forms.
Practitioners of this form were using tight moves, efficient parries, and subtle dodges, trying to provide the maximum defense.
For the longer battles, a Soresu user was able to have the upper hand in the duel, because of the ability to observe the opponent and to learn how their combat style was, because of this, the Soresu practitioner could choose to kill, disarm or just use Form Zero on their opponent.
Not that practitioners of other forms could not do this, but Soresu users are the best at this.



# Section 2
The key to ultimately mastering Soresu seems to come from grasping the concept and philosophy of Form Three, rather than adhering to the form's tactics and maneuvers.
If a Form Three practitioner had to duel individual shooters, then the Form Three practitioners were encouraged to use the deflecting slash.
The deflecting slash allowed the Jedi using Form Three to come closer to their opponent and deflect the projectile into a slashing attack.
If a Form Three practitioner had to duel multiple shooters, then the Form Three practitioners were encouraged to use the circle of shelter.
This technique allowed the Jedi to hold off multiple projectiles by dropping into a moving mediation.
The goal of most of the Soresu practitioners was to prolong the duel, waiting until the opponent gets frustrated and exhausted as they try to keep up their offense.



# Section 3
Luminara Unduli once said, "The road is long, but it is worth the journey, for a true master of Form Three is invincible." Even though Form Three was created to combat blaster shooters, it did exist for thousands of years.
Almost millennia after the creation of Form Three, Soresu was mastered by the Jedi Battlemaster Cin Drallig, not only Jedi Battlemaster Cin Drallig, but also Grand Master Yoda and Swordmaster Mace Windu were Form Three practitioners.
Even towards the end of the Clone Wars, Soresu was the most common lightsaber form used in the Jedi Order.
But of course, a populair practitioner was Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, during the Clone Wars, Obi-Wan Kenobi was one of the highest masters of Soresu.
