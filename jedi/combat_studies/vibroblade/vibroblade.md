# Introduction
The vibroblade was a basic melee weapon that resembled a traditional sword, but used ultrasonic vibrations to increase its damage and cutting efficiency.
With a generator located at the base of the hilt powering the weapon, vibroblades could be incredibly effective against most opponents.
Vibroblades were highly customizable, with vibroblades from the Old Republic era often having a cortosis-weave along the blade, allowing duels against lightsaber wielding opponents without the risk of one’s weapon being destroyed.
Much like the lightsaber, many variants existed including the vibro double blade and vibrosword.
During the Old Republic era, Jedi Padawans and Sith Acolytes often trained with such weapons before progressing to lightsabers, and the amnestic Darth Revan was known to have wielded such a weapon before constructing his second saber.
During the Clone Wars both Commando Droids and Clone Commandos were known to utilise vibroblades, often concealing them within gauntlets or using them in addition to blasters.
