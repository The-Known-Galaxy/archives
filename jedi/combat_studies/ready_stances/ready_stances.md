# Introduction
Each lightsaber form had its own unique start-up and ready stances.
However, some of them were standardized across all lightsaber combat.
The known ready stances were Jedi ready, defensive neutral, offensive neutral, and center of being.

# Section 1
The first was Jedi ready, which was the most common stance amongst all Jedi.
This stance had a lot of similarities with the Ataru guard.
When using this form the dominant foot was held back and the blade was held in a vertical parry position.
Next was defensive neutral, the differences between this stance and Jedi ready were little to none.
The blade would still be held in a parry position, but the user’s feet would be evenly spaced.



# Section 2
The next known stance was offensive neutral, which has some similarities to defensive neutral.
However, instead of parrying the blade would be pointed directly at the enemy.
This stance was intended to give a smaller time frame that the blade is visible.
Thus preventing the enemy from being able to track and target the user’s moves.
Lastly, there was a center of being, which could also be used for meditation.
This stance was used by members of the Old Jedi Order and they did so by holding the saber horizontally with the hilt just below their chin.
