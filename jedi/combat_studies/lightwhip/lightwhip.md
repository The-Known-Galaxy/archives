# Introduction
The Lightwhip, or ‘energy whip,’ is a variation of the traditional lightsaber which made use of the same basic principles.
However, the lightwhip differs in its construction, opting for multiple crystals, a far longer blade, and no cell barriers to keep the weapon on a straightened path.
Most whips only make use of a single blade, as the skill required to operate without maiming the user is significantly higher than other forms of lightsaber - however it was not unheard of for lightwhips to contain multiple blades.

# Section 1
The whip’s mechanics and style are wholly unfamiliar to most combatants in the galaxy, and therefore it is able to gain significant advantage over opponents who lack the skill to understand it.
The range of the whip is its secondary advantage apart from flexibility, and allows for strikes from a distance of multiple meters and nearly infinite angles.
This flexibility of attack allows the whip to dodge and weave through parries of all but the most skilled warriors, and is especially deadly against lightly armored and unsuspecting opponents.



# Section 2
The whip is not without significant drawbacks, however, as unless the wielder is sufficiently practiced with a regular whip, this weapon was all but impossible to control, able to easily maim its wielder as well as opponent.
The whip also needs to be swung in a large, wide sweep in order to gain sufficient momentum to deal more than superficial damage.
The blade cannot easily penetrate many standard issue armor materials or even walls, and is almost completely vulnerable to close quarters assault.
If an opponent recognizes this and closes the distance, the wielder of a lightwhip is almost certainly defeated.
Jar’kai is essentially a perfect counter to the whip, allowing the whip to wrap around one blade while attacking with the freed hand.
