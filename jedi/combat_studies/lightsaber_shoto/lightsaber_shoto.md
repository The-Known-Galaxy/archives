# Introduction
Colloquially known as ‘light daggers,’ Lightsaber Shotos were yet another variant of the standard lightsaber design.
The Shoto was a smaller, more ergonomic version of the classic lightsaber, its blade extending a maximum of approximately half a meter, with a narrower and less bulky grip.
Being just a smaller version of the standard configuration, Shotos weren’t that hard to make and so during times of war, it was relatively easy for a Jedi to create one.
That being said, there is no mainstream combat form which utilises the Shoto, and so it was extremely hard to learn it or find a Master to teach it.

# Section 1
Shotos were originally conceived during the Old Sith Wars (4000 BBY - 3950 BBY) by Force-sensitive duelists who sought to recreate a smaller offhand weapon, useful for parrying and countering.
The introduction of the Shoto allowed for lightsaber duelists to attack with their primary sabre while keeping the Shoto in a defensive guard which greatly increased a duelist's protection.
Alternatively, a Shoto allowed a user to simultaneously attack with both blades, allowing for a furious onslaught of strikes, great when used in conjunction with Form Four.
Though not created for this explicit purpose, Shotos were widely adopted by Force Sensitives of a smaller physical stature as their primary weapons, such as in the case of Master Yaddle or Master Yoda since it better complimented their physical limitations.



# Section 2
Jar-Kai - As described previously, in this technique, the Shoto is held in the off-hand, allowing the user to block and deflect enemy strikes while riposting with the main sabre.
Alternatively, two Shotos could be used in conjunction with each other which limited the users' reach.
However, this could be compensated for with training in Form Four lightsaber combat.

Guard Shoto - This technique requires the fundamental changing of the Shotos construction in which the emitter and blade are at a perpendicular angle to the hilt.
This weapon was excellent at blocking lightsaber attacks but allowed for very few offensive techniques.
The sabres could be held in a reverse grip with the blade extending parallel to the forearm, which allowed the user to incorporate more hand to hand combat techniques including grappling and elbow strikes.
This could then be combined with Jar-Kai, allowing a guard Shoto in both hands, deadly when used in combination with Form Three.

Throwing - As mainly a sidearm, the Shoto could be thrown without entirely disarming one's self as there would always be a secondary sabre to back it up.
With proper force techniques and extensive practice, a user could theoretically attack from two angles simultaneously, as seen in the case of the Dark Jedi Taron Malicos.



# Section 3
Perhaps the most notable and famous user of a Shoto is the Jedi Ashoka Tano, who utilised a Shoto in combination with Form Five.
She used this primarily in an offensive style but could be seen to have mastered the defensive possibilities of the weapon, like when she defended herself from upwards of ten clone troopers who had surrounded her.
