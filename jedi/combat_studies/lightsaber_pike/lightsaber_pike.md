# Introduction
Lightsaber Pikes, also known as Saberlances and Polesabers were known as a unique weapon type that resembled a spear, glaive or most standard pole-arms.
These weapons utilized a shorter but thicker lightsaber blade to compensate for the weapon's immense size.
Most often, these weapons were crafted using a lightsaber resistant material such as Cortosis, Phrik or Mandalorian Iron.
Typically the pikes were constructed to be at shoulder length from pommel to emitter; but have been noted to stand at the full height of the weapon user.
