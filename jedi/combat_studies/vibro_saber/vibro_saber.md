# Introduction

A Vibro Saber is a type of weapon that utilized high-speed sonic vibrations making each cutting stroke and slash more deadly for the opponent; with the melee repercussions of the attack being very dangerous.
The matter on how is by the use of cortosis, a lightsaber-resistant material capable of shortening a lightsaber if it ever comes into contact.
Due to this, the weapon itself and those like it can be very devastating.

```
The Saber utilized a vibro-generator found in the hilt, which would send out high-frequency sonic pulses that can cause anything attached or that come into contact with the blade to be sent into a shocking and quick vibration.
```

Particularly, if the blade comes into contact with organic tissue or flesh, the vibrations would cause tremendous damage due to the rippling effect within the material, causing tremendous pain for the target.
This makes it very lethal compared to blades without a vibro-generator, and can bring even the smallest cut into a gaping wound.
It could penetrate even the strongest of armor with a more focused and upgraded vibrator cell.

```
With this, most Vibro Sabers have a cortosis-weave, implemented only in some vibroweapons but allows for the Saber to successfully block lightsaber blows directly, although reducing its strength as an overall alloy and would allow for less blunt blows.
```

Vibroweapons have gained an infamous reputation as the primary choice for criminals and lawbreakers, being illegal in most ‘civilised’ worlds.
Although in others such as the worlds in Hutt Space, this weapon would be the norm for self defense or provocative measures.
