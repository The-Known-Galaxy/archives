# Introduction

Sokan is a principle of lightsaber combat that focuses on using the local terrain for tactical advantage.
Itâ€™s noted by Grand Master Fae Coven that it also encourages a Jedi to use the environment as a weapon, from seeking and using the high ground, to driving an enemy into hazards like active machinery or open pits.

Notable uses of the Sokan practice were for example: Darth Maul using the barriers at the Naboo Palace in his duel against Qui Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda using a ship as a jumping point in his duel against Dooku and most famously, Obi-Wan using the high ground advantage in his duel against Darth Vader (AKA Anakin Skywalker).
