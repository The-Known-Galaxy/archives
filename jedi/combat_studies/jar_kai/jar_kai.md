# Introduction
Jar’Kai is a blanket term for a combat technique that involves the use of two, or ‘dual’, Lightsabers - one to support the other.
This can be done in a defensive manner, where one saber is used as an offensive tool and the other is used to defend the body from strikes.
It can also be used purely offensively, using two blades in a constant onslaught of strikes to one’s opponents.

# Section 1
The technique required both hands if the practitioner was bimanual - using both hands to hold either lightsaber.
This can be both a strength and weakness, as practitioners could not then use two hands in an effort for a more powerful strike, however having two lightsabers could easily overwhelm less experienced duelists who would have a hard time tracing the movements of both lightsabers in a duel.



# Section 2
The use of two blades can be traced in history to its origins, created by the Yovshin Swordsmen where the first Jar’Kai sabers were constructed - sabers that were designed to be wielded as pairs.
Similarly, Niman was a dual-bladed combat style, created by the Royale Macheteros for the triumvirate of the Kashi deities.
Both forms predated the use of lightsabers and its lightsaber forms.
These styles would later be adopted by the Legions of Lettow, and practitioners could be seen across the First Great Schism.
Upon the defeat of the Lettow, Niman was later refined to the sixth Lightsaber Form, and Jar’Kai became a blanket term to describe combat that utilized two lightsabers.



# Section 3
Notable practitioners may include Ahsoka Tano, Padawan of the Jedi Order.
She used a single traditional lightsaber, alongside the aid of a lightsaber shoto - a traditional lightsaber that was considerably shorter in length.
Her traditional single saber was used for offensive strikes, such as jabs, swings and other offenses.
The shoto was primarily used for blocking, parrying and defensive maneuvers.
Her mastery of Jar’Kai was impressive when compared to Masters who could not or had only just begun this accomplishment.



# Section 4
Another example of a Jar’Kai practitioner would be the dark-sided Asajj Ventress.
An extra blade can considerably increase a user’s defense, which Ventress displayed nicely in her mission to Ruul where she defended herself against 3 Jedi opponents at once.
Asajj would also opt for a more offensive approach, using both lightsabers for several duels in order to overwhelm the opponent with a continuous onslaught that allowed no opening, with the ability to become more defensive if it was required.
