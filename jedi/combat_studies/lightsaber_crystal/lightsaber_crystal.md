# Introduction

Living crystals, because that’s what they were called, although some used the name Kyber.
Incredible and extremely rare, of course, applicable to Jedi and Sith weapons.
The journey to the Crystal Caves of Ilum,  is one of the many tasks of the Jedi Initiates and required a lot of courage and dedication as finding Kyber Crystals wasn’t an easy task.
Although locating a planet where crystals could be found was quite easy, the actual search was extremely difficult.
Crystals also existed in larger forms, and if legends are to be believed, the largest and most powerful of them were used in the mysterious and deadly weapons of the Sith.

# Section 1

Kyber crystals were somehow sensitive to the Force and resonated with it.
A Jedi could have communicated with the Crystal by sensing collective consciousness or something like a strange presence.
Although the stone itself could not speak in the traditional sense, it was able to establish a kind of contact.
Kyber consists of organic and inorganic materials.
They remained stable at temperatures and pressure comparable to the pressure and temperature of the core of the star.
They were resistant to fire and physical storms, to some extent, of course.
Each of them had an original, sophisticated pattern, and as with the fingerprints of a human being, one could identify a certain crystal by them.
The stone was also able to withstand the destruction of the lightsaber.
Kyber did not give off heat and reacted only to animated matter.
The crystals grow slowly and in a certain arrangement that they reach without having a specific lifespan or size.
Some are as big as the grains of sand on Tatooine, and others can be bigger than humans.
However, they are all equally present in the Force.
Real crystals were the only ones found in the kyberite deposits.
The stone must not be contaminated in any way, if this is the case, it will be impossible to contact it.
The crystals themselves could accumulate vast amounts of energy and give much more.
There were recorded attempts of creating synthetic crystals, however, all of them failed as crystals were too unstable to be used.

# Section 2

Each Jedi had to choose a crystal that spoke to them and matched their character.
The Jedi heard from the crystal a kind of music or sound that symbolized harmony for him.
In the beginning, all crystals are colorless, similar to glass.
It was only after connecting to the Jedi that the Crystal received a certain color.
In most cases it was blue or green, but there were cases of other colors.
The color corresponds to the nature, character, and connection with the Force of each Jedi.
The more unconventional and complex the owner’s character, the greater the chance of getting a different color.
All crystals were naturally associated with the light side of the Force and reflected all the influences of the dark side.
However, the Sith found a way to bleed the crystal to give it a red color.
They poured in all their pain and hatred until the crystal gave up and distorted.
Such twisted stones could be cured, but it was extremely rare.
Ahsoka Tano was one of the few, who successfully healed the crystal.
In addition, the process itself could lead to the destruction of the crystal which is why most of the Jedi avoided such attempts.
The crystal protected itself from the unwanted owner, giving him extreme headaches and crazy thoughts.
The Jedi has developed and expanded the crystal cutting to minimize the waste of energy and ensure the crystal could store the optimal amount of power.
