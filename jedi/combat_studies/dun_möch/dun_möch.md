# Introduction
Dun Möch was a combat tactic used in conjunction with Lightsaber combat.
Dun Möch took place in the form of taunting, distraction and doubt.
The Sith aimed to dominate an opponent’s spirit, hence they incorporated it heavily into their Lightsaber combat doctrine.
(Quote: “Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.
Yoda holds you in such high esteem… Surely you can do better!” - Count Dooku)

# Section 1
Dun Möch commonly used verbal taunts to expose the opponent’s hidden fears, weaknesses or doubts, making the opponent lose their concentration.
Mental attacks would also be utilized, making the opponent less precise and effective.
(Darth Bane in his writings marked that Mind Shard, a dark side mental ability, can be improved if used in conjunction with Dun Möch - Book of Sith)



# Section 2
Dun Möch could be quite deadly, especially to Jedi, since concentration was a vital part to use the Force.
Dun Möch used the Force as a form of psychological warfare.
Many notable Sith have utilized Dun Möch including Darth Bane, Darth Traya, Darth Nihilus, Darth Sion, Darth Tyranus, Darth Maul, Darth Vader and Darth Sidious.
Dun Möch was also utilized both in its regular form and inverse form by some Jedi including Luminara Unduli, Galen Marek, Luke Skywalker and Jaina Solo to name a few.



# Section 3
If not carefully used, Dun Möch could backfire on the user, as Darth Sidious comments on Bane’s writings (Book of Sith).
A famous example of this is the duel of Obi-WanKenobi and Anakin Skywalker versus Count Dooku.
After Obi-Wan was incapacitated, Dooku taunted Anakin about his fear and Anakin not using his anger.
This taunting prompted Anakin to attack viciously, until he had Dooku at his mercy, and killed him.



# Section 4
As mentioned before, some Jedi used an inverse form of Dun Möch, famously used by Luke Skywalker on the Second Death Star against Darth Vader.
Young Luke tried to remind Vader that he still has good within him.
Luke was successful, and redeemed Anakin Skywalker.
This technique was also used by Revan to redeem Bastila Shan.
