# Introduction
Makashi was the second of the seven forms of lightsaber combat that were used.
It was known by a few different names such as “The Contention Form” or “The Way of the Ysalamiri”.
It was a form that was commonly used by the Sith.
It was designed to exploit the flaws and weaknesses of its predecessor, the first form, Shii-Cho.
Jedi Master Cin Drallig said that “Form II represents the ultimate refinement of lightsaber-to-lightsaber combat.” It proved to be one of the most simplified forms as it helped the user deliver swift but tactical parries and counters.
One person that used Makashi was Count Dooku.
He learned to master Form II and was very wise about his fighting style.
Another user of Form II was Asajj Ventress.
However, she learned to use it with two lightsabers though.
Makashi was very helpful when fighting against Jedi as it was considered an advantage over the Jedi’s familiar and most common combat style, Shii-Cho.
