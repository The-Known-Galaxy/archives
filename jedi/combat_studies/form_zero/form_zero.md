# Introduction
Once a Youngling had persevered through the icy winds of Ilum, retrieved their Crystal and built their Lightsaber, the first thing they were taught was form 0.
It was not a form like the others.
Form 0 is a way of handling situations, a principle.
It means that one should not use their lightsaber as a first resort.
Before they ignite it, read the situation.
Is the threat real?
This is an important lesson for the Jedi, as violence is never the answer.
They were required to see if they could find a peaceful way out of the matter.
It was encouraged that instead of drawing their lightsaber, they used the Force, for instance with mind tricks, to resolve their problems.
