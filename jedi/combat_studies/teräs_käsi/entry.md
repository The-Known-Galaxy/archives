# Introduction

Teräs Käsi arose from the world of Bunduki inside a star cluster that was named Pacanth Reach.
Bunduki was heavily populated by a species known as the Epicanthix.
Within Bunduki the followers developed a martial art that was known as ‘Teräs Käsi’.
They created this unique martial art to fight back the Jedi, who destroyed their original homeland, known as Palawa.
To learn this unique martial art, the students were sent to the followers of this form, where they were educated on all the information.
This information varied from the philosophies to the cultures and even the history.
Those who learned of this foretold secret martial art spread it around the Galaxy so more people could become aware and learn this ability.
