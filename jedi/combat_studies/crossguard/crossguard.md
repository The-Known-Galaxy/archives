# Introduction
A Crossguard was almost identical to the single-bladed saber, with the only difference being two small quillons below the main blade.
These quillons were on opposite sides of the hilt.
They projected two small blades, which were tributaries of the main blade.
They were created using an array of activators to separate energy from the crystal inside.
Emitter shrouds were used to protect the wielder’s hands from any possible injury from these small blades.

Section I
	The Crossguard was an ancient blade design.
The Crossguard was commonly used by Makashi users.
When the Sith were powerful and plentiful, a sith known as Darth Atrius owned a pair of Crossguards.
Full of the Sith Lords’ rage, the sabers survived long after the defeat of Atrius.
Due to being full of his Anger, the blades were capable of driving anyone who wielded them insane with anger.
They were eventually destroyed by Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker during the Imperial Era.
	Jedi Master Stellan Gios owned an odd form of Crossguard.
This was during the High Republic Era.
It was different than most due to the physical Crossguard being retractable.
When the blade was designated, the arms would fold up.
When ignited, the arms would fold out to support the quillon beams.
This provided an additional layer of hand protection.

	During the Galactic Civil War, a young Jedi by the name of Ezra Bridger found an ancient green-bladed Crossguard.
He found this while on Malachor.
When he ignited the blade, it almost instantly broke and deactivated itself.
Later, Kylo Ren built his own Crossblade.
It was unstable due to the usage of a cracked crystal.
At the end of his time as a Knight of Ren, he flung his blade into the sea on Kef Bir.
This was a sign of rejection of his commitment to the Dark Side.

Variations
	The first variation is the Forked Lightsaber.
This variation of the Crossguard had only one smaller blade.
This saber was utilized by Jedi Master Roblio Darte, whose saber had two blue blades.
With only a single secondary blade, the smaller emitter was at a 45-degree angle from the main blade.
Another known wielder of this variation is a Jedi of the Gran species.
The next variation is the Vented Lightsaber.
This variant emitted three blades, a primary one and two smaller ones on the side.
During the war against Zakuul Jedi Master Dazh Ranos used two of these blades.
 This type of Crossguard was commonly used by Makashi Duelists.
Similar sabers were used by a group of Nightsisters during the Clone Wars.
A very well-known user of this form is Kylo Ren.
The third variation of the Crossguard is the Vented Dualsaber.
This variant had four blades in total.
It was a double-bladed saber with small power vents forming blades on its sides.
