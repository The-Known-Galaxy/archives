# Introduction

Shii-Cho, also known as the Determination Form or the Way of the Sarlacc, is the foundation of the other lightsaber forms.
This is the first form that is taught to Younglings.
It teaches the basics of handling a lightsaber in combat: (i) attacking - an action to strike and hit an opponent; (ii) blocking - a move or pose to defend incoming attacks; and (iii) parrying - a way to attack the opponent by means of countering, a combination of attacking and blocking.

# Section 1

Shii-Cho primarily relies on utilizing the Force to sense incoming attacks.
The first training conducted for students is the blast-deflect training.
The training had a small droid called a training remote, which were used to shoot sting beams.
These beams were used as a tool to deflect blaster bolts using their lightsaber.
Students were required to be blindfolded, forcing them to trust their instincts and rely on the Force.
The next training was run using velocities.
Velocities are a quick series of attacks and parries to an opponent until one gets hit or concedes by calling “Solah!” These training sessions were conducted once every day.

# Section 2

The methods of combat in this form are separated in two: The Ideal-Form and the Live Combat Form.
The Ideal-Form utilizes horizontal and vertical angles, together with the basic moves that are perpendicular to each other.
The Combat Form is mainly focused on speed; with attacks mainly angled diagonally when hitting the target zones.
This was considered more functional than the Ideal-Form.

# Section 3

When engaging an opponent, there are specific target zones tailored for the form and are numbered as \[1\] head, \[2\] right arm, \[3\] left arm, \[4\] back, \[5\]right leg, \[6\] left leg.
It is designed to avoid injuring the opponent but rather disarm them.
These target zones are not only designed for a humanoid body but also in other types such as spherical or segmented.

# Section 4

Other techniques were inspired by Sun djem–an attack that is specifically used to destroy the opponent’s weapon.
The Disarming Slash is a series of attacks aimed to disarm the enemy, and the Sarlacc Sweep is a sweeping attack meant to hit multiple opponents.

# Section 5

Although every Jedi was expected to have full mastery of this form, there were others who were exceptional such as Kit Fisto, Cin Drallig, Luke Skywalker, and Yoda.
