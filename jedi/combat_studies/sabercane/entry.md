# Introduction

The sabercane was used mostly by elders of the order, for it helped them walk and it was a sneaky solution if they got jumped by a hostile.
Only a few people wielded such a weapon like this, for it was not easy to make.
Not only Jedi wielded the Sabercane, Sith Acolyte Haazen wielded the sneaky, powerful weapon as his main lightsaber.
Haazen built it while he was still a Jedi but he was not permitted to wield one so he built the Sabercane in secret so the Jedi would not know that he had a lightsaber.
Occasionally, he would train with it without letting the Jedi know.

It was a weapon used by the skilled and not the weak, for it was a very elegant type of weapon that if lost and found by Sith it would be very critical to the Jedi Order.
A Jedi Master Tera Sinubeâ€™s sabercane had a hilt made out of wood from his home planet.
Some Jedi or Sith would use the other part of the cane to block stuff while they dueled with the lightsaber part of the sabercane.
The sabercane was very elegant and hard to wield so it was restricted to some people.
The Sabercane was very sneaky and light to wield so it wasn't as heavy.
