# Introduction
During the height of the Old Republic and the outbreak of the New Sith Wars, Jedi were often seen wearing Jedi battle armor, which was a light-weight and extremely flexible full-body suit that allowed Jedi to move freely and without them having to face restrictions in their lightsaber forms, however, this armor still restricts Jedi in their movement more so than their traditional robes.
After the Ruusan Reformation, the Jedi Order had opted to no longer wear their armor as the Sith have been believed to have gone extinct.

After a millennium of peace, the Clone Wars had broken out, plunging the Jedi Order into another galactic-scale war.
This would result in them having them once again don their armor; however, this would not be the traditional Jedi armor that they wore during the Old Republic.
Jedi Generals and Commanders were known to wear pieces of modified variants of clone trooper armor to protect themselves from blaster bolts and shrapnel.
Some Jedi, such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, would also wear this type of armor as a sign of respect towards the men who served under them.
