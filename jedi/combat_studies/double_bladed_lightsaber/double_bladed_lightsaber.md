# Introduction

The renowned double-bladed lightsaber, known by the names of saberstaff, lightsaber lance, doublesaber, dualsaber, and lightstaff, was a modified specialization of the traditional lightsaber, with variations in hilt length being predominant and of course it’s twin emitting blades.
Its origins are traced to those of Zabrak origin, with a popularised quarterstaff known as a zhaboka.
In its essence, it was a single hilt with two blades allowing for a more amplified style of combat.

# Section 1

It was first invented by the Sith, under the Dark Lords of the Old Sith Empire as observed from its Zabrak origins, it was often very sophisticated with it’s two sets of emitters and a particularly long hilt as in most designs.
One such very notable example of this is the lightsaber of Exar Kun, originally a single-blade lightsaber which was then transformed by Exar Kun upon discovering the schematics of the design within a Sith Holocron.
In later years, the original design of the doublesaber would be slowly shifted into its more adherent form with a simplified single mechanism yet a larger hilt.
Some doublesaber designs had much more simplicity, being two individual crystals within the same hilt; simply two lightsabers in one.

# Section 2

The very nature of the double-bladed lightsaber made it difficult to utilize without strict discipline and accurate footwork as in accordance with the twin blades, with the user only being allowed to attack diagonally or vertically.
Many who would utilize the doublesaber would meet their fate at the hands of their own, accidentally decapitating or stabbing themselves.
But its wonder lies in its rapidly fast swings, able to provide twice the damage and more openings to attack the enemy from.
Its defensiveness was also impeccable with two blades and a longer hilt, allowing for more surface area for parries and deflections to defend themselves from.

# Section 3

In the more recent history of the Jedi Order, the use of the doublesaber would fall into obscurity, with its most popular surge being at the height of the Sith Wars with notable individuals such as Grandmaster Satele Shan, and the Sith lord Darth Thanaton.
In the essence of the double-bladed lightsaber being a weapon to kill more effectively and excruciatingly, the Order would frown upon its use, seeing the lightsaber as a means to defend.
In this measure, there was no true rule forbidding its use.
But masters and most knights of the Order refrained and even discouraged their students from constructing such a weapon.
Only a portion of popularity remained of it with the Jedi Consulars and fringe groups of the Order.
