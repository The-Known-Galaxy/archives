# Introduction
Mou Kei was often called the most brutal Mark of Contact when referring to lightsaber combat.
Mou Kei was a fighting technique that allowed its user to successfully target and dismember several limbs of their opponents with just using a single strike; this allowed this lightsaber combat to be brutal and dangerous.
If used in a correct situation, one Mou Kei attack could finish the fight and disable the opponent from taking any offensive actions against the Mou Kei’s user.

# Section 1
The nine Marks of Contact were one of the most important principles of lightsaber combat taught in the Jedi Order.
Even though every Mark directed the learner’s attention to a different technique of wounding the opponent, the main potential of these movements lay in targeting smaller areas of the user’s body and maximising one’s defensive and offensive potential in these sections.
Mou Kei was considered the most violent Mark, as it relied on cutting off more than one major limb of the opponent, often in a singular chain of quick, circular lightsaber strikes.



# Section 2
Because of its brutality, Mou Kei became one of the favourite Sith combat techniques, which would not only defeat the prey but also disable their body from functioning properly for the majority of their life.
The Jedi, on the other hand, feared Mou Kei and only a handful of Masters were able to fully master it.
The most famous usage of Mou Kei was undoubtedly the duel between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi on Mustafar, during which Master Kenobi utilised it to counter Vader’s aggressive leap and succeeded by taking Vader’s both legs and one arm with this strike.
