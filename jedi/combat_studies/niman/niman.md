# Introduction
Niman, the sixth form of lightsaber combat otherwise known as “The Moderation Form” or “The Way of the Rancor” is a combat form developed from two past martial arts fighting styles.
The form is rather unlike the rest of the general lightsaber forms and contains more relaxed blade work compared to others as well as any significant specializations.
The fighting style overall lacks advantages on other forms, but is much easier to master for the average Jedi compared to other utilized forms and contains a series of force-based attacks including telekinetic pulls and shoves.
In other words, the blade work is used mainly by individuals focused on their studies and diplomacy rather than combat itself.
The overall success with this form depends on the handler's creativity within the duel.



Section 1: Background 

	The original version of the Niman form was practiced by Royale Macheteros of the Kashi Mer Dynasty.
The Macheteros called the form its name based on the dual triumvirate of the Kashi deities.
The form was first adapted by a group of Dark-siders who were involved in the First Great Schism.
The form was eventually adopted by the Jedi Order and refined into the sixth form rather than the fourth.
Once adopted by the order, the form was mostly utilized by Jedi Consulars who were mainly focused on their studies and diplomacy because of the forms' naturally adaptable usage.
The form was prized for its usage in various wars against the Sith Order and over time became a standard in lightsaber training.
By the beginning of the Clone Wars, the form was one of the most commonly used in the order by Jedi’s.
Since then, it remains one of the most moderate and easy to learn forms on the list.
