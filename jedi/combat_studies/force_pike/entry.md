# Introduction

The Force pike was a type of polearm that featured a vibro-edged head with a stun module capable of delivering excruciating electrical shocks, paralysis, and death.
Despite its name, it was not related to the energy field known as the Force.
The weapon has been used throughout galactic history, from the Begali Uprising to the Clone Wars and beyond.

# Section 1

The Force pike was first introduced during the Begali Uprising, where it was used by the Sith assassins to hunt Jedi.
Its design was perfect for this purpose, as it was powerful enough to withstand the blow of a lightsaber.
Later, Atris's Echani handmaidens used it as a weapon of choice.
The Sith Lords also used it during their training exercises, such as the one Darth Plagueis and Darth Sidious undertook on Kursid.

# Section 2

One of the most famous users of the Force pike were the Emperor's Royal Guards.
They mainly used the weapon as a ceremonial weapon, but it was also useful for torture and crowd control.
The SoroSuub Corporation Controller FP model was their preferred weapon, but other models were also used by planetary militias and police forces.
The weapon was perfect for keeping people away from important figures, as its meter-long pole allowed it to be operated in small hallways.

During the beginning of the Galactic Civil War, Imperial stormtroopers also used the Force pike as a weapon instead of the E-11 blaster rifle.
Admiral Terrinald Screed and Admiral Kazz's forces used it extensively.
Its ability to slice through bulkheads and airlocks made it an excellent weapon for boarding actions.
