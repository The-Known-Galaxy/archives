# Introduction

For lack of a formal recorded name, this type 1 breathable atmosphere planet is known as Abeloth’s Planet.
It is located inside the Maw, an unstable cluster of black holes in the outer rim territories; Relatively close to Kessel.
The planet is the only object located inside the black hole cluster surrounding it, other than Sinkhole station.
The terrain of this Planet was primarily jungle-like.
The entire Planet’s flora and fauna was under the control of the Dark-side entity Abeloth.

The Planet itself was home to various extremely powerful locations: The Font of Power, a pure focus of Dark-side energy.
The Pool of Knowledge, able to grant one knowledge of everything.
An Ancient ruins of the previous inhabitants known as the Ones, containing the Font of Power.
And Abeloth’s cave, the primary residence of Abeloth herself.
The locations on this Planet corresponded with certain locations found in the realm of beyond Shadow, a place accessed by force-beings who would separate themselves from their physical bodies.
This process was primarily enacted by the Mind Walkers.

# Section 1

Before the departure of the Ones from the planet, the four being known as the Son, the Daughter, the Father and the Mother were the only sentient beings living on the Planet.
After the Mother drank from the Font of Power and bathed in the Pool of Knowledge, becoming the being called Abeloth, the Daughter and the Son worked with the Kilik to create the Maw around the Planet, to imprison Abeloth permanently.
Using Centerpoint station, they were able to  manipulate Black Holes around the Planet, and placed Sink-Hole station inside to moderate the Prison within.
