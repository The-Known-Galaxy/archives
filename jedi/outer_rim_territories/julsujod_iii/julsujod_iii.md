# Introduction
There are many types of worlds within the galaxy, ranging from planets covered in thick rainforests, such as Kashyyyk and Felucia, to planets that were completely frozen, like Hoth.
This article will focus on a planet that is unlike either of the aforementioned planets; Julsujod III, a water planet.
Julsujod III is located in the Julsujod system in the Tolonda sector in the Outer Rim Territories, and was the homeworld of a race of people known as the Stribers, a species of naturally telepathic water-breathing sentients.
Sometime neary five thousand years before the Galactic Civil War, Julsujod III experienced a cataclysmic event that left the Striber people helpless.
This would have been their doom had a group of mysterious benefactors not intervened and saved the entire species, relocating them to Iskalon.
Sadly, the Striber population died out a few generations before the Battle of Endor.
During the era of the New Republic, a Shi’ido anthropologist named Doctor Hoole studied the ruins of Julsujod III in an attempt to determine the nature of the catastrophic events that occurred there, and the identity of the Iskalonian benefactors.
