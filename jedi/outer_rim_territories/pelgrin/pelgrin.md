# Introduction

Pelgrin served as a home planet for Pelgrin species, located in the Outer Rim.
This planet had a large field of grass covering its flat surface.
Due to the lack of resources on the planet, Pelgrin were never able to leave their home planet.
It is said that over two million years before the Battle of Yavin, these native species built an artifact known as the Oracle, a merging of technology and Force.
These species eventually went extinct, leaving numerous ancient ruins and artifacts behind such as the Oracle.

The Oracle was an ancient device that held many secrets within it on the planet Pelgrin, this artifact was perhaps the galaxyâ€™s oldest artifact that was ever made.
It was known to cause Force visions to any Force-sensitive species that approached it.
The Oracle was located inside a  tower that was 88 meters high and was made of unknown metals and Dieuw wood.
When it comes to technology, this tower had a large network consisting of gears and levers inside it.
The Oracle itself was locked inside a chamber located in the central shaft, which reached all the way from the bottom to the top.
The Pelgrin also constructed a hexagonal chamber on top of the tower that resembled a crystal.
