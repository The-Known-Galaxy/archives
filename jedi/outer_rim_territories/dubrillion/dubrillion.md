# Introduction

There were beautiful oceans and thick, lush forests on Dubrillion, and white clouds framed the landscape.
The Outer Rim Territories are located in the heart of the Clone Wars, near Dantooine and Muunilinst.
Dubrillion is the sister world of Destrillion.
Dubrillion would eventually belong to the Galactic Empire after the Clone Wars; when that government fell, Lando Calrissian would become its administrator.

# Section 1

A large operation was conducted over an asteroid belt located close to the planet by Calrissian after the Empire ended.
There were also high-rise cities and luxury suites in Dubrillion.
Its ambassador, Leia Organa Solo, was only there for a short time.
Yuuzhan Vong invaders attacked and ultimately conquered the planet during the Yuuzhan Vong War.

# Section 2

In 25 ABY, the asteroid assault course Lando's Folly was built in Dubrillion using TIE Advanced x1 starfighters during the Yuuzhan Vong War.
On the leaderboards of the challenge, pilots such as Jaina Solo quickly attained high status.

# Section 3

Dubrillion was also the first world in the New Republic to be conquered by the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong.
A Yuuzhan Vong base camp was set up near the asteroid field where the aliens spent two months attacking ships travelling to and from Dubrillion.
They also sent coralskipper squadrons to attack the surface, slowly wearing down Administrator Calrissian's defenses.
New Republic ships arrived, helping to evacuate the planet, but the Yuuzhan Vong ultimately invaded the planet and destroyed many ships carrying refugees.

# Section 4

The Yuuzhan Vong pushed back the New Republic troops to Dantooine, where they subjugated the remaining Dubrillion population.
However, most of Dubrillion's surface was left in a recognizable state despite the earlier fierce coralskipper attacks.
During the Yuuzhan Vong's conquest of Dubrillion, Shedao Shai decided to make the planet the main base of the Outer Rim.
Shai sent Chazrach warriors into Jerusalem to rout resistance holdouts, then they found and killed the last surviving citizens.
The others worked as slaves to help the planet's terraforming efforts.
Dubrillion Aquarium, a major landmark and a haven for galactic marine life, was left intact by the invaders - rare mercy given the reverence for natural life that the Yuuzhan Vong had.

# Section 5

The Jeedai heresy, which strongly enhanced the revolt against the Vong, helped unseat the Vong hold on the galaxy in the later stages of the Yuuzhan Vong War, as reported by a prominent Yuuzhan Vong priest.
As a result of an attack led by Commander B'shith Vorrik, Yuuzhan Vong forces from Dubrillion then attacked and sacked the Imperial Remnant on Bastion and on Bescane in 29 ABY.
