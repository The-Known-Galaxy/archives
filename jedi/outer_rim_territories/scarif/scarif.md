# Introduction

Scarif is a planet in the Outer Rim, a part of the Abrion sector.
From orbit, it was a small deep blue planet.
Scarif was mostly ocean, with several island chains breaking the ocean’s total coverage of the planet.
These islands were mostly tropical, with rocky volcanic islands as well as sandy beaches.
The climate was mostly temperate as well, with little variation of temperature.
Scarif was no short of a tropical paradise.
If it wasn’t for the dangerous wildlife and ecosystem, it would be a very nice place to be.
The planet was also dense with valuable resources that could be used for starship construction, but because of its remote location within the Outer Rim it was not used a lot for this purpose.

# Section 1

The Galactic Empire built the Imperial Center of Military Research and housed the Empire’s deepest military secrets as well as any information the Empire wished to keep hidden from the Imperial Senate.
The Empire built this in the northern hemisphere of the planet.
It was garrisoned by the Scarif Deployment from the Tarkin Initiative, which was centered on the Citadel Tower, a monolithic tower in the middle of the entire center.
Which was centered on the Citadel Tower, a monolithic tower in the middle of the entire center.
The planet and base respectively were treated as an unofficial retirement center for Imperial officers.
Yet in 9 BBY, the Death Star was moved from Geonosis to Scarif.
Here it would continue its construction, with Orson Krennic as the director of the project.
Even with such a massive project built in orbit of the planet, the garrison commander, General Sotorus Ramda, held too much confidence in the planet’s defenses.
Namely the orbital gate, which shielded the entire planet.

# Section 2

Scarif was the site of a battle named after the planet, the Battle of Scarif.
Here, the Rebel Alliance made a desperate play to get their hands on the Death Star plans in 0 BBY.
TThe plans were shared to the Rebels by Jyn Erso.
She also informed them that the Death Star’s blueprints and weak points were in Citadel Tower.
After a lot of struggling, the plans were transmitted to Princess Leia Organa, who was in orbit with the Alliance Fleet.
Then, Grand Moff Wihuff Tarkin came into orbit with the Death Star and ordered to fire a single reactor ignition at the planet, as an attempt to prevent the plans from reaching the Rebels, who were in orbit.
His plan failed and the research center was completely destroyed.
Scarif was left with the scars of the shot, however the planet was not destroyed because of the single reactor shot.
