# Introduction
Priate is the star at the center of the Mustafar System located in the Outer Rim.
The gas giants: Jestefad and Lefrani; and the terrestrial planet: Mustafar, were the planets orbiting the star.
Occasionally, the planet Lefrani would eclipse the view of the star, in which Darth Vader witnessed in 19 BBY.
 
However, an artifact known as the Bright Star–considered the most sacred artifact of the Mustafarians; stolen by Lady Corvax, who wanted its energy to power her Aeon Engine and resurrect her dead husband–drew immense energy towards the star system which altered the orbit of Lefrani.
Mustafar was drawn into the strong gravitational fields of the two gas giants, which turned the volcanic planet into a wasteland.
