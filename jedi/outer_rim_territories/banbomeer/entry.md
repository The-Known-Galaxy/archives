# Introduction

A planet known as Bandomeer could be found inside the Outer Rim Territories, located within the Meerian sector on the Braxant Run, while also being part of the Hydian Way.
This planet served as a homeworld for the Meerian race.
Most of its terrain consisted of deserts, mountains and oceans.
Bandomeer became popular due to its high amounts of ionite.
Before different mining companies such as the Offworld Mining Corporation started drilling for ionite, the planet used to be quiet and peaceful.
However, the once flourished plains and forests were replaced with deserts and toxic waste.
These mining corporations had to hire increased security near their mining operations since the planet was filled with many kinds of dangerous predators.
Bandomeer was not the only place where such rich materials could be found.
Asteroids surrounding the planet contained similar materials.
However, they were left untouched since pieces from the asteroids could collide with the planet if drilled.
After the ionite miners began showing lack of respect towards the Galactic Empire, the Emperor sent Darth Vader to deal with the disappointing news.
The Imperial army began establishing control over the planet to remind the locals who was truly in control.
