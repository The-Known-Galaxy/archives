# Introduction
Geonosis was a planet located in the Outer Rim territories  in the Geonosis system.
The planet’s climate was very high, due to its distance from the star Ea.
Geonosis was the second planet from the star.
A day on Geonosis would last 30 hours and a year would last 256 days.
Geonosis had 15 satellites, some having the same climate as the planet, a hot and arid one and some satellites were covered in Ice.

# Section 1
The planet had a diameter around 11,400 Kilometers.
Its atmosphere was breathable, with water on the planet’s surface, so it could contain life.
Because of the planet’s hot weather, the water amount wasn’t higher than 5% of the planet’s terrain.
Because of this, the planet couldn’t sustain a large population.



# Section 2
The Flora and the Fauna were not very large due to the low amount of water.
The Flora of the Planet is very restricted, having very few representatives.
The Fauna on the other hand it’s much more extended, having many native species like: the Orray, the merdeth, the phidna, etc.
Geonosis also sustained intelligent life.
The intelligent native species called: Geonosian was a semi-Insectoid Creature with Wings that allowed him to fly.
The geonosians were living in Hives and were led by a queen.



# Section 3
The economic activity of the planet was made by the import and export cycle.
The Planet was importing raw materials, as Geonosis was a hot and arid place full of deserts, there weren’t many materials obtainable.
The Planet was exporting processed materials, but mostly Geonosis was exporting battle droids and war equipment for the Separatist Forces.

During the Clone Wars, Geonosis was the Capital of the Separatists.
The Planet was producing droids for the Separatist army.

In 14 BBY, the sterilization of the planet began, killing the whole intelligent life on Geonosis.
