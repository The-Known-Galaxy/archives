# Introduction
The Corellian Run was one of the largest hyperspace routes that ran throughout the galaxy.
It was mapped out between 25,000 BBY and 24,000 BBY.
The route helped contribute to Corellia becoming an economic superpower.
Corellians held hefty amounts of power within the sectors that surrounded the Corellia.
The Corellian Run began at Coruscant and went around the Deep Core, where it eventually reached Corellia.
It later moved farther out towards Tinnel IV, which was the final stop within the Core Worlds before moving on to other major regions of the galaxy.

When the Kyyr system supernova made the Ootmian Pabol disappear from existence in 4000 BBY, multiple spaceports along the Corellian Run began to overshadow Nal Hutta, which had seemingly thrived up until that moment.
Alongside the Perlemian Trade Route, they formed The Slice, a region of the galaxy that was commonly explored and vastly populated.
The Slice was also comparatively easier to navigate than most other parts of the galaxy.
The Outer Rim section of the Corellian Run consisted of one of the three sides of the Spice Triangle, which included the Death Wind Corridor and the Triellus Trade Route.
