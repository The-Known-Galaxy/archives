# Introduction

Planet Zeffo is a beautiful, electromagnetic, swarmed planet located in the Outer Rim region.
The planet could have functioned as a habitat to several of the galaxy's species, as it included a type-one atmosphere and great fields of grass and flora from skungus to dreamworts.
The world consisted of countless cliffs and rocky mountains, with the big beast of Phillaks being host to them.
Other animals from scazz to the zeffonian birds were also included in the ecosystem.

# Section 1

During this time in history, the sentient species of Zeffo had held the planet as their homeworld.
The species during their existence were great at preserving their history, making all kinds of relics and statues of their species members and achievements.
The Zeffonians had even created tombs for Zeffo Sages as a show of memory and respect.
These tombs would be guarded by ancient automatons designed to attack outsiders who dare enter the caves.

# Section 2

The Republic Era was an era in which archaeologists and historians would explore the planet's tombs and secrets, since the now extinct Zeffonians are no longer around to express or continue their history.
A Jedi by the name of Eno Cordova was obsessed with the history and secrets of the Zeffonian species.
He would conduct several research journeys during his life to study the planet’s tombs.
The planet's history would continue from the Zeffonians to the humans that now inhabited the planet.
Eventually the Clone Wars and the New Galactic Empire's troubles would hit the planet.
It was during the fall of the Jedi Order that a Jedi by the name of Chiata and her Padawan, Marseph, were killed on Zeffo.
They weren't killed by the crash landing that their Republic Star destroyer had to take, but by the clones they once commanded turning on them after the initiation of Order 66.
After this, the Empire set up an excavation called Project Auger to absorb resources from Zeffo’s icy caves.
They drove the Zeffo immigrants from their homes to continue the project on the land the immigrant called home.
The Empire stated they were in violation of Imperial Code 94364.
