# Introduction
The Kessel Run was a famous 20-parsec (a parsec is a measurement of distance at about 3 lightyears) route used by smugglers to move a highly sought-after spice known as glitterstim spice from Kessel, where it was mined, to an area south of the Si-Klaata cluster.
The challenge in this route was not getting caught by Imperial ships that were guarding the movement of spice from Kessel.
Han Solo famously completed this route in 12 parsecs.

The route took travelers who were in realspace (which is the perception of space when traveling at less than the speed of light) around the Maw cluster, or simply the Maw.
This was a cluster of black holes, and due to the gasses being drawn into it, it was made visible and was even hailed as one of the Wonders of the Galaxy.
It was somewhat of a mystery, and many believed it was created by an advanced civilization.
Because of the gravity of the black holes, the Kessel system was also slowly drawn into the Maw.
Also due to these gravitational forces, smugglers often noticed that their ships were being pulled apart.
Smuggler Han Solo skirted around this cluster instead of simply avoiding it to achieve a run of fewer parsecs.


After smugglers were out of the Maw, they would reach the homestretch - The Pit.
This was an area of stray asteroids, which were dispersed across the arm of a nebula.
While this area was easy to navigate through, smugglers who got to this point were often so relieved that they would lose focus and collide with an asteroid, destroying their spacecraft.

Han Solo famously boasted about his 12 parsec Kessel Run.
This run was achieved by skirting the Maw cluster, instead of fully avoiding it to cut down the distance.
Solo’s ship was the Millenium Falcon, which was an extremely fast and agile modified version of a YT-1300 light freighter, originally manufactured by the Corellian Engineering Corporation.
This run was then beaten by smuggler BoShek, who was a male Corellian smuggler with a talent for piloting and a sensitivity to the field of the Force.
Following this, Solo beat the record once again with Luke Skywalker, who was the son of a moisture farmer, but then became a Jedi after a series of events occurred that revealed his destiny as someone who would balance the force.
