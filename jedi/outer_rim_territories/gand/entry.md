# Introduction

Gand was a planet that was located in the Outer Rim territories Shadola sector, specifically located in The Slice past the Centrality and bordering the Wild Space region.
While the planet was very isolated from the rest of the galaxy due to it not being on any major hyperlanes or not being involved in spice trading, the planet’s sentient species of Gand completed their trading on the five orbiting stations surrounding the planet.
When touching down on the planet,  the rocky landscape is scattered with pocket colonies, between those colonies is kilometers of ammonia mist.
The ammonia atmosphere makes the planet a type IV atmosphere, requiring many of the Galactic population to wear environmental protection suits in order to explore the planet.

# Section 1

Planet Gand has hosted the species of Gand before any actual recording of the planet’s history.
The Gand have two subspecies, their difference being that one can survive in both oxygen and ammonia type atmospheres while the other species cannot.
The planet's government system in the past was of a totalitarian monarchy but, in recent time have converted to meritocratic democracy.

# Section 2

It can be noted that Gand was only discovered at around the time of 3951 BBY, during the Kanz Disorders.
However, the planet and species have mostly kept to themselves, especially in the events of wars that have swept through the galaxy, choosing to remain independent in the conflicts.
The planet would seem to not ally with any side during the Clone Wars, Yuuzhan Vong War, or even during the first and second Galactic Civil Wars.
The planet has seen its fair share of invasions during its time however.
The planet saw a Sith invasion prior to the arrival of the Exiles on Korriban.
Later on, the Galactic Empire would occupy the planet.
