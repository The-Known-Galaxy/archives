# Introduction

Charis was a planet with a population over 850 million inhabitants.
It was located within the Trition Trade Route in the Kathrol Sector.
This planet was in the middle of five trade routes inside the Outer Rim Territories, those travel routes led to different star systems such as Aaris, Corjain, Ott, Mairne, and Kolatill.
Charis was considered as an important and profitable planet due to its industrial sectors on the planet surface, most of those factories were specialized in manufacturing technology.
Kentor Sarne, Imperial Sector Moff who had declared himself as a warlord, kept a large fleet of Star Destroyers above planet Charis during the Battle of Endor.
This particular fleet Sarne owned was known as the Charis fleet and was under the command of Admiral Pertaal Logris.
After Imperial flags began disappearing from across the galaxy due to the death of Emperor Palpatine, Charis system was shortly abandoned by Imperial forces after the Empire began shattering apart from its very core.

However, like in many other words, the Imperial forces had left a devastating mark to this planet far before they left.
Moff Sarne had ordered his troops to lay toxic waste in major cities; these actions caused millions of people to lose their lives.
Population of the planet was eventually reduced from one billion to 850 million.
