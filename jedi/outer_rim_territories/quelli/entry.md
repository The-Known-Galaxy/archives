# Introduction

Quelii was a planet located in the Outer Rim Territory where humans lived in villages.
This planet was left devastated by an attack on them from the Mandalorians.
From this attack some of the natives were able to leave the planet and enter Republic space.
One of the most important people within this group was the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Malak who later led the Sith war with his friend Darth Revan during the Jedi Civil War with the Mandalorians.
This world's history started very peacefully where humans peacefully lived and learnt more about the world and being natives, they did not have familial surnames.
Those who fled later took on those.
Queliiâ€™s social status was mostly destroyed and the part that lived was part of those who fled the planet.
