# Introduction
Rishi was a jungle-like planet, similar to Felucia.
It was in the Outer Rim and it had a sun named Rish, plus a moon named Rishi.
The planet was the homeworld of the Rishii, a species that resided on mountains as well as nests.
Rishi also contained many swamps and tropical areas that were a common place for many criminals to live in the Old Republic era.
The climate was quite hot and humid, as it was a tropical planet.
In addition, Rishi had many islands such as the Tracyn island, Sky Ridge island and Razorback island.
Rishi had a population of around 2 billion, with the majority being Human and Rishii.

# Section 1
When Rishi was first discovered by a group of pirates known as the Nova Blades, they made it into a safe area for criminals to come to.
The Nova Blades refined the many fossil fuels found on the planet, and throughout the Galactic War the planet stayed neutral, but the Nova Blades supported The Order of Revan.
Soon after the Battle of Rishi, the Padawan of Master Orgus Din went to Rishi and cured many of them from the Tanamen Fever.
The fever was not very fatal on other planets, however on Rishi it was quite damaging.
In a Force vision by Master Orgus Din, most pirates on the planet were gone due to the Rishii and many people were able to live peacefully.



# Section 2
Sometime around 60 BBY, over 50000 H’kig formed a colony on Rishi, but it went downhill extremely fast as many of them went and formed another colony on the planet J’t’p’tan.
By the time the Clone Wars began, The CIS tried to take the fossil fuels from Rishi.
This was dissolved by Kit Fisto and his clones, with the help of the Rishii.
The Rishi moon was used as a defense from the many invasions on Kamino.
It alerted the Republic whenever there were CIS ships nearby, but it was destroyed by a clone trooper in order to put the CIS into retreat.
