# Introduction

Kaon is a planet located in the Tion Cluster of the Outer Rim Territories.
A part of the Tion Hegemony sector, Kaon has a breathable atmosphere and is primarily made up of rainforests.
Also containing a standard gravitational pull, this planet is able to sustain life.Kaon was ruled by a monarchy and was home to a royal family of Tioenese heritage.
Kaon was a strong trading affiliate with Ximâ€™s Empire so when it fell, Kaon also dropped into disparity.
A notable member of this family, Prince Matteus Zaym, was able to revive the planet after it had fallen into ruin.
Kaon also houses Count Dooku's castle, which he used to escape to after he had to flee from the planet Vjun.
Kaon, much like many of its sister planets, had an outbreak of the Rakghoul plague.
