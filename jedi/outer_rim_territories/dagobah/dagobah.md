# Introduction
Dagobah is a swampy planet that resides in the Dagobah system, as an Outer rim planet.
It was home to the exiled Jedi Grandmaster Yoda after the events of Order 66; it was also the resting place of the Jedi Grandmaster Yoda.

# Section 1
Dagobah’s location was in the Sluis sector, a part of the Outer rim territories.
It resided near a trade route, yet was only reachable through an obscure hyperplane.
Dagobah was home to a harsh and humid climate with many swampy areas that cover the entire planet.
Along with the swamps, covering the planet were many trees.
The planet had very few true open waters, most of the water was from its thin coat of swamps.
Although there wasn’t much to the planet, it still held some lifeforms, creatures such as the bogwings, dragonsnakes, sleens, vine snakes, and swamp slugs; it also had few faunas living on the planet, examples are Adder moss, the hassling, gnarltree, and meat flower.
Although it had lifeforms living on the planet, it did not house any advanced civilizations.



# Section 2
Hundreds of years before the Clone Wars, a Jedi by the name of Minch came across Dagobah while chasing down a Sith priest also known as a Bpfasshi Dark Jedi.
The Jedi Minch killed the Dark Jedi, and with the death of the Dark Jedi, the surroundings began to consume the dark energy coming off the deceased body of the Dark Jedi.
In the coming years, the planet was seldom found, most times when it was found by explorers, they were either eaten by the wildlife or had to resort to cannibalism.

In 22 BBY, a Republic research team was stationed in Dagobah under Halka Four-Den, a commander of the Republic.
The initial assessment of the planet was that it was beaming with a diversity of lifeforms; they were wrong with their assessment as Halka Four-Den and her team died on Dagobah.
They could’ve been retrieved but because of the upstarting of the Clone Wars, their transmissions were likely cut off from the other many transmissions.
The surviving members of the team raised their children as cannibals.
Years later during the outbreak of the war, Jedi Grandmaster Yoda found thirty-eight worlds that were deleted from the Jedi Archives, one of them was Dagobah.
Yoda would go to Dagobah following the spirit of fellow Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn.
There he was given the task to find out how to become one with the Force and how to achieve immortality.
During this short visit, he entered a cave where he experience a powerful vision of the Sith’s powerful hold on the galaxy, the fall of the Jedi Order, and the confirmed existence of Darth Sidious.



# Section 4
In 19 BBY, at the start of the Great Jedi Purge, Yoda entered exiled on Dagobah after his defeat at the hands of Darth Sidious.
He chose Dagobah because of the cloud future he could not see, he decided to go to a nameless world, a planet that was writhing with the Force, enough to hide his presence in the galaxy.
He also stayed near the Cave of Evil which negated his light side energy, further hiding his presence.
In his exile he had met many people, one was a clone of Galen Marek, renamed Starkiller; he allowed Starkiller entrance into the cave.
Other people he has seen before were Tash Arranda and Zak Arranda two orphans who survived the destruction of their planet Alderaan.
They were two Force-sensitive humans who Yoda chose not to train in the ways of the Jedi, waiting for another.
Even though Dagobah was a remote planet, it was an included destination on the Intergalactic Passport.



# Section 5
In 3 ABY, Luke Skywalker was visited by the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi on the planet Hoth.
Luke was instructed by Obi-Wan to go to Dagobah so that he may be trained in the ways of the Jedi.
He traveled to Dagobah but crash-landed on the surface of the planet almost losing his X-wing to the swamp.
There he met a grumpy little green creature, who he discovered later on to be the Jedi Master Yoda.
He would be taught the ways of the Jedi through hard training, learning to control the Force.
Luke would later enter the Cave of Evil, given a powerful vision of Darth Vader fighting him; where he would cut the helmet seeing his own face there, hinting at Darth Vaders identity.
Later in his training, he would have a vision of his friends, Han Solo and Leia Organa suffering on Bespin.
He stopped his training promising to come back to finish his training, and he certainly did come back but, came back too late as Yoda was on his deathbed.



# Section 6
Over the years, many Jedi have come to Dagobah either looking to overcome their fears or to reconnect with the Force.
Luke came to Dagobah with his lover Callista Ming to try to reconnect her to the Force, while Anakin Solo, grandson of Anakin Skywalker came here to overcome his fear of becoming the visions of himself as a Dark Jedi.
It had also been used as a place of exile.
