# Introduction

Eliad was one of the over 70 planets suitable for living located in the Minos Cluster deep in Outer Rim Territories.
Unlike most other planets, Eliad was very unique in its terrain, by having multiple different biome variants across the surface.
As unique as the planet was, only a few people lived there compared to the core world.
The planet mostly consisted of extremely wealthy people.
With nothing to spend their money on, the rich often used credits to build their own private castles and palaces.
Eliad was quite separated from the rest of the planets, as it had little in trade aside from expensive mineral exports.
Those who didn’t own such fortune had a hard time living on the planet due to the lack of jobs and often decided to leave in hopes of finding a more suitable environment.
The planet held many sights to see, such as Eliad spaceport, the primary and most commonly used spaceport, located in the Great Jesart Desert.

During the early years of the Galactic Empire, Emperor Palpatine removed many rich from their power.
Instead of just killing these wealthy people, he gave them a choice: they were to go to a permanent exile in exchange for keeping their wealth and status.
Most of the families obeyed the Emperor’s will, however, many chose to die instead of abandoning their homes.
Once the system was fully controlled by the Imperial Government, over three hundred thousand nobles were brought back to Eliad along with their massive amount of servants and droids; they were left to rot away along with their uselessness and worthlessness to the Empire, all according to the Emperor’s plans.
During the Galactic Civil war, Princess Leia Organa tried to encourage these nobles to aid the Rebel Alliance with their funds.
