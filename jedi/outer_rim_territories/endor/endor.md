# Introduction
The Forest Moon of Endor, also known as the Sanctuary Moon, was a small-scale Forest moon that orbited the planet also known as Endor; it was the ninth moon of the planet Endor and was the homeworld to the Ewoks, the fierce warrior species of Endor.
It was also home to a species known as The Dulok, who were very aggressive and would hunt down the Ewok.
The Wistie, also known as the fire sprites, were used by Ewoks as a weapon against intruders like the Imperial Stormtroopers, and, finally, the Gorax, a semi-sentient species that were built like giant humanoids, would also hunt for Ewok villages.

# Section 1
Throughout galactic history, Ewoks were prime targets for visiting raiders/intruders.
They would hunt the Ewoks to make an outer-rim snack known as Ewok Jerky.
The Forest Moon was quiet until the Galactic Empire took over and used the moon to establish an Imperial Outpost, which contained a shield generator complex to defend the second Death Star while it was still being constructed.
What caused the Ewoks to rebel against the Empire was when they bulldozed a whole village.
Because of this act of hostility from the Empire, the relationship was strained between both parties which led to them assisting the Rebellion.
Since the Death Star was very close to the Forest Moon, there tended to be earthquakes and other geological disturbances.



# Section 2
After the attack on the village from the Empire, the Ewoks and the rebels joined in unison to overthrow the empire by launching an attack on the shield generator.
If the Rebellion hit the shield generator, the Death Star would be unprotected while incomplete.
The Empire had the rebels trapped, but the Ewoks saved them, and together, the Empire was overthrown on land.
Above the Forest Moon, there was an intense space battle between the Empire and Rebellion to blow up the Death Star, and it was successful for the rebellion but at a cost.
The Death Star blowing up meant that there would be debris raining down into the atmosphere, damaging the ecosystem.
After the war between the Empire and Rebellion had ended, the Ewoks and Rebels celebrated together.
The rebellion repaid the Ewoks by putting shields and tractor beams to protect the planet from debris.
Despite all the issues due to the Death Star blow-up, debris proceeded to rain down for at least a decade; however, Endor’s ecosystem prevailed and remained strong.
