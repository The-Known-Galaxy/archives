# Introduction
Stygeon Prime was a cold snowy planet that had extremely harsh weather conditions.
The planet was located in the Stygeon system of the Outer Rim Territories inside the Nuiri sector.
Its dangerous rocky surface was always covered in a thick layer of snow that made traveling on foot difficult and risky.
Due to the planet’s environment, it barely has any intelligent species living on it.
However, a flying species named Tibidee could often be seen flying above the ground.

# Section 1
During the Clone Wars, an extremely secure prison was built on Stygeon Prime on top of a high mountain by the Separatists, they called it the Spire.
This location was an excellent choice since even if the prisoners somehow managed to escape, they would not survive the long way down from the mountain.
Anyone that was brought in had very little chance to escape unless they managed to hop on a Tibidee and use it to glide away from the prison, even then, without a ship they would not survive long outside the walls.



# Section 2
One of the most dangerous Sith Lords and force wielders, Darth Maul was held in this facility during the Clone Wars.
Count Dooku and Darth Sidious visited him from time to time to ask questions and torture him.
Maul eventually escaped with the help of a Death Watch attack.
Many years later the Galactic Empire had armed the building with their advanced military tech.
At that point, most of the prisoners were captured rebel leaders and officers.
