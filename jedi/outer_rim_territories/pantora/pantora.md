# Introduction
Pantora was the primary moon that circled planet Orto Plutonia, located in the Outer Rim Territories inside the Sujimis Sector.
This planet was the homeworld for Pantorans, and their leader, Supreme Chairman of Pantora.
Pantorans were close to humankind, apart from their blue colored skins.
The most common immigrated species you could see on Pantora were Sullustans, Rodians, and humans.
For a long time, Pantora had belonged to the Republic with  great loyalty and respect towards them.
After the Galactic Republic was reorganized, Pantora welcomed the Empire to their homeworld with open arms and kept the alliance strong between them.

# Section 1
During the Clone Wars, fearing that the Separatists might attack their core world, a Republic outpost was built on Orto Plutonia after being requested by Chairman Chi Cho.
After all military personnel had been wiped out from both Republic and Separatist outposts, Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi began investigating what caused all those deaths.
Eventually, they came upon a primitive village that belonged to the warrior species known as Talz.
After attempting to negotiate with them, the Jedi managed to come to an understanding with these primitive species, both sides only wanted peace.
Any further negotiations were quickly interrupted by Chi Cho, claiming that Orto Plutonia had always belonged to Pantorans and accused Talz of trespassing.
These words led to another conflict between the Republic and Talz.
Shortly after this, the Chairman met his end after he was ambushed by Talz and underestimated their strength.
In the end, Senator Riyo Chuchi with the help of C-3PO was able to come to a mutual understanding with Talz Chief and put an end to that battle.



# Section 2
Later during the Clone Wars, the Trade Federation formed a blockade over Pantora, claiming that Pantorans owed them large debts, but in reality, the blockade was formed to pressure the moon to join the Confederacy of the Independent Systems.
Separatists also ordered the Trade Federation to send bounty hunters to kidnap both Chairman Papanoida’s daughters, meanwhile, the Separatists offered their help to solve this kidnapping.
However, Padawan Ahsoka Tano and Senator Chuchi found one of the daughters on a Trade Federation Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship.
The Captain of the vessel and Senator Lott Dod were forced to let them go, so that the Trade Federation could remain neutral in the eyes of the Republic Senate.
To avoid any further suspicions, Senator Lott Dod had to announce how Viceroy Gunray had handled the corrupt members from the Trade Federation and the trade routes to Pantora were opened to increase their relationship with Pantorans.
