# Introduction
Mandalore is the fifth planet located within the Mandalore system.
The said system is also a part of the Outer Rim Territories and is close to the Hydian Way trade route.
The planet sits at the end of the lane called Mandalorian Road, an ancient route that connected Mandalore to another planet by the name of Corsin that was located in the Inner Rim.

# Section 1
The planet has normal gravity levels and two moons, including a well-known mining and agricultural center, Concordia.
Both Mandalore and Concordia were unique in the way that they had an iron ore that was known by the name of beskar.
It was known to be indestructible and capable of withstanding hits from all weapons, even lightsabers.
Metalsmiths used beskar to make armor, weapons, and starships.
Besides its plentiful amount of ore, Mandalore possessed a breathable atmosphere with days made up of 19 hours.
Meaning that a year on the planet of Mandalore lasted for a total of 366 days.



# Section 2
Before the reign of the Mandalorians, the planet was roamed by mythosaurs.
These beats were known to compete with cities when it came to their size.
Not much later, Taung warriors arrived on the planet and set out to slaughter them in order to conquer the new world.
Mandalore is covered by veshok trees that were mostly native to the northern hemisphere.
Winters on the planet were taken over by heavy amounts of snow and freezing cold temperatures.
On the other hand, you would see herbivores called shatuals living within the dense forest.
They were known to live there alongside strills that called them prey.
You could also find galek trees, wild mushrooms, and serpentine rawl throughout the forest of northern Mandalore.



# Section 3
If you traveled up north of the forest you would find Keldabe that served as the capital of Mandalore since 3960 BBY.
The city was also the meeting point for government officials across the whole Mandalore system.
Some time passed and up rose a new faction known as the New Mandalorians.
They began running their base of operations within the city of Sundari.
The city was conveniently located over an expansive beskar mine.
Keldabe, on the other hand, was surrounded by lush forests and the waters of the Kelita with farmlands perfect for their growing culture.
The Oyu’baat hotel and tap cafe were housed in Keldabe and later became the hub for clans and the Mand’alor.
Operations were run here until 40 ABY when MandalMotors Hall was constructed.
Most of Manadlore’s settlements were built where there was lots of fortification so the citizens living there would feel at ease.
One of the prominent settlements was the town of Norg Bral which housed members of Clan Bralor.
Architecture for the towns and cities of Mandalore was diverse like the people who lived within them.
The design, structure, etc.
would vary depending on the region and the specific inhabitants that lived there.
Ranging from towers of steel and granite to durasteel, and even amongst the trees.



# Section 4
The Taung arrived on the planet Mandalore due to being driven from Coruscant by the Battalions of Zhell.
They would arrive on the planet Mandalore near 7000 BBY, which they originally named the planet Manda’yaim or “Home of the Manda’lor”.
They would soon come to want more planets under their control, they would abandon their Mandalorian space by the 3996 BBY during the Great Sith War.
They went to other Star systems to try to conquer them, being dubbed the Mandalorian Crusaders.
As the attacks of the Mandalorian Crusaders increased, a new faction within the Mandalorians planet, named Neo-Crusaders.
However as the number of planets within their control grew, a new enemy arrived, named Jedi Knight Revan.
The efforts of Mandalore the Ultimate were in vain, as he was defeated; many Mandalorians after losing their leader came to be mercenaries, bounty hunters, or regular citizens that moved back to the central planet of the Mandalore system.
Many years arrived when veteran mercenary Aga Awaud returned to his home planet Mandalore.
He was met with raiders trying to take over their planet during an era of many deaths due to the Candorian plague.
Aga Awaud would reunite the scattered Mandalorian tribes across the galaxy, with Aga becoming the Manda’lor.



# Section 5
At the end of the New Sith Wars, the Mandalorians pushed themselves to become a more technologically adept and rigid, militant society.
As they grew more powerful, the Jedi became more alarmed and attacked the Mandalorian clans, but as a new era came, a new clan of “New Mandalorians” arrived.
They were peaceful Mandalorians who created their own small cities in the deserts of Mandalore.
The New Mandalorian with their new wealth of beskar and their love of advanced technology was named the faithless for turning their backs against the old traditions.
Then in 60 BBY, a new leader arose Jaster Mereel, he served as a law officer where he would fall from grace.
His strong morals drove him to murder a corrupt officer.
Mereel disliked the old traditions of conquering and changed them by implementing the Supercommando Codex, a new behavioral guide to being better, something close to Mereel’s morals.
With new rules comes the opposition, a new group called the Death Watch appeared, their leader Tor Vizsla.
With a new group growing, Mandalore was led into a Civil War.
As the war raged on, Mandalorians living off-world did not join and those in the Mandalore sector also did not join.
At the end of the war, Jaster Mereel was defeated, and Tor Vizsla was the victor.
However Mereel’s son, Jango Fett took command of the True Mandalorians.
He would later be sold into servitude after being wrongfully captured by a Jedi strike team, led by the scheming Death Watch.
After his escape from servitude, although he was able to take his revenge on Tor Vizsla, he grew very distant from his people.
With an old Civil War gone, a new civil war arose, named the Great Clan Wars because of how much damage the new war gave to each clan.
In the war, there was betrayal, fights within the clans, etc.
and at the end of the war, a lot of the warlord chieftains either joined the New Mandalorians or went into exile on the moon Concordia.



# Section 6
In this era, during the Clone Wars, Jango Fett perished but 10 years earlier, his DNA was taken to make a secret army for the Republic.
The clones of Jango were made on the planet Kamino.
