# Introduction

One of the largest and well known hyperspace trade routes was originally known as the Warriorâ€™s Trace but was then changed into the Salin Corridor.
It took place in the Outer Rim Territories.
The route began from the outer edge of the rim and continued to follow the outer rim for a good distance.
The route eventually turned towards the Core in the Tharin sector, passing both the Periphere and Novor 3, and finally merging with the Sisar Run.
