# Introduction
Anoat was one of three livable planets in the Anoat system, located in the titular Anoat sector.
Detected in the Greater Javin of the Outer Rim.
It was located in the middle of the Hoth system and the Bespin system.

# Section 1
Throughout the Cold War, between the Galactic Republic and the improved Sith Empire, a thief confessed to having concealed goods in the sewage system of Anoat.
While the planet was livable, it was also unwelcoming like the other planets of the Anoat system.
The planet Anoat was discovered shortly before the Clone Wars by the Figg Excavations group.
After the discovery, Human colonists began to occupy a part of the planet as excavation began.
Without noticing the brittle ecosystem, the miners broke the planet and poisoned the atmosphere, leaving the planet in ruin.



# Section 2
During the monarchy of the Galactic Empire and the throughout the Galactic Civil War, Anoat's only settlement, Anoat City, served as the secret base of the imperial weapon designer Moff Rebus.
Throughout the war, Rebel mercenary Kyle Katarn took Rebus out of his hideout in the sewers of Anoat City and brought him to justice.
Later in 3 ABY, during the Battle of Hoth, the Millennium Falcon passed through the Anoat system while running away from Imperial Navies.
