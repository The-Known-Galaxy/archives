# Introduction

Bogano was a planet located in the Outer Rim Territories; it was largely unexplored and could not be found on maps.
The surface of Bogano was grassy, with mesas and wetlands.
The planet was home to an ancient Vault, which was built by the ancient civilization, the Zeffo.
Bogano was important to the Zeffo because of the Binog, a large creature shown in Zeffo art and culture.
The Jedi Eno Cordova theorized that the location of the Vault was there because of electromagnetic winds.
The Vault housed a single object, a holocron, which had a list of all the Force-Sensitives in the galaxy; the holocron was placed there by the Jedi, Eno Cordova.

Bogano thrived as a planet; it had a balanced ecosystem and was barely touched by sentient life, which left the environment to thrive.
After the fall of the Jedi Order, Cere Junda brought Cal Kestis to the planet, hoping to restore the Jedi Order.
After finding the Vault, Cal Kestis left and returned with the Astrium, which he found on the planet Dathomir.
He unlocked the Vault and found the holocron, which was then stolen by Cere Jundaâ€™s former Padawan, the Second Sister, Trilla Suduri.
