# Introduction

Rinn was a snowy planet that was located in the galaxy with much not known about it due to lack of information.
One thing that is known is that around 4 BBY the Rinn people had a very large energy crisis due to them running out of fuel cells which had been powering their heaters.
Due to this the Rebel Commander Jun Sato decided to help the people by getting new generators.
This later resulted in a large battle near Rinn between the Rebellion and the Empire.
Rinn was also notably the homeworld of the Human Resistance Major Taslin Brance.
