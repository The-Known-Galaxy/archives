# Introduction

Situated near the Tion Cluster in the Outer Rim territories, Rhen Var was once known as one of the Thanium Worlds.
Rhen Var was completely covered in ice making it almost inhabitable for any species to live, as well as being the first planet in the Tobali System.
The planet was also a known landmark for ancient Jedi artifacts, as well as being home to ancient remains, home to the former planetary civilizations that once inhabited the planet.
Before being dubbed as inhabitable, Rhen Var once was a flourishing planet filled with vegetation and wildlife, but due to a cataclysm caused in the planet's atmosphere, Rhen Var became an ice-bound planet filled with tundras of snow-swept mountains.

Rhen Var was the planet in which former Jedi, Ulic Qel-Droma, would train his padawan, Vima Sunrider, after the Great Sith War in 3986 BBY.
Due to Rhen Var’s snowy wastelands, as well as Ulic’s personality, Ulic felt at peace when he walked the planet, as he found snow-waste planets comforting.
After Ulic’s death, he rightfully earned a burial site and tomb in his honor, which was built on Rhen Var’s surface.
Rhen Var is also home to a cave that is known to be the growing site of a very rare crystal type known as Solari.
In 22 BBY, Rhen Var was the site of a Republic supply base that was set up at the beginning of the Clone Wars, which was eventually seized and captured by the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
This forced the Republic to retreat and vacate the planet, starting the Battle of Rhen Var.
Obi-Wan Kenobi informed the Jedi High Council of Rhen Var’s state and soon recaptured it with the Republic.
