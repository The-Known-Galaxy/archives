# Introduction

The Yablari system of the Outer Rim Territories was an agrarian planet in the Vorzyd sector.
As part of the Perlemian Trade Route, Yablari's agricultural technology was highly advanced and prolific.
Natively inhabiting Yabari were the intelligent Anomids, known for being wealthy and pacifist.
In addition, the world was predominantly used for agriculture.
There were times when the world was prone to mass droughts, but the soil was fertile and good for growing plants.

A native race of planets, the Anomids, joined the Galactic Republic in the early 25,000 BBY- 22,000 BBY time period, it had discovered hyperdrive centuries before the technology became widely known.
The Anomids' first contact with alien life occurred on a world on which there was a small Duros colony after they were driven off-world to search for fertile soil due to a severe drought.
Perlemian Trade Route pave the way for the travel of curious Anomids, allowing them to leave their world and embark on a 15,000-year adventure.

The Krath besieged the planet's star system during the Great Sith War and defeated Republic forces thereafter in an open war.
Even though the Sith were expelled at the conclusion of the war, Darth Revan's Sith Empire later annexed the planet during the Jedi Civil War.
Eventually, the Anomids' Central Council decided to support the Galactic Empire for the good of their people.
As a result, rebel operatives tended to approach travelers who might be persuaded to contribute money to their cause.
Anomid food technology was used by some Rebel safeworlds to stretch limited supplies.
