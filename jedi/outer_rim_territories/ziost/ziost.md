# Introduction

Shrouded by the Dark Side, Ziost was the icy Sith world that would become the Empire’s capital after the reign of Sith Overlord Adas came to an end.
Located in the Outer Rim territories.The world’s landscape was made up of ancient dark forests and barren tundra, but the trees shriveled away and the planetary landscape became similar to the Sith planet, Korriban.
At the time of the Great Hyperspace War, Ziost remained as a key planet to the Sith Empire, although after the Republic’s victory, it was abandoned whilst the remaining Sith with the new Emperor established the new capital on Dromund Kaas, leaving Ziost forgotten.

# Section 1

Although after some time, Ziost was resettled by the new Empire, becoming once again a major Sith holding.
It also served as the capital of Imperial Safeguard Space and after some time, it housed the Orbital Defense Command Center, headquarters to the Ministry of Logistics.
The city of New Adasta quickly became a major trading centre, giving the planet it’s nickname, ‘’Gateway to the Empire’’.

# Section 2

Ziost’s existence was yet again forgotten after the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, due to the mystery of Darth Bane’s Sith Order.
Over the years the planet was visited once in a while by few people, for example, Jedi fugitive ‘’Rahm Kota’’ and secret apprentice to Lord Vader, ‘’Galen Marek’’.
Many ancient and evil secrets stayed neglected at this place of great dark power.
