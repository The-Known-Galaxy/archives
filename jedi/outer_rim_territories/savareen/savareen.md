# Introduction

Savareen was a planet in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories, located on one of the Kessel Run's spurs.
The world was made up of sand-covered landmasses and vast oceans.
Savareen was also recognized for its well-known brandy cocktail.
The Crimson Dawn used to run a business there, chopping off the tongues of the locals.
The world resembles the other desert planets of Tatooine and Jakku and might easily be confused with them.
This planet, unlike the other two, has water but is just as thinly populated as the other desert planets.
Because of its proximity to the Kessel Maw Nebula, the planet has become known for processing coaxium on the black market.

# Section 1

Before 10 BBY, Crimson Dawn, a crime syndicate, had a presence on Savareen.
When the indigenous attempted to revolt against Crimson Dawn, they were unable to speak.
The Dry Gulch had been harassed by the Bellwing Gang over the refinery by 10 BBY, and the townsfolk hired the mercenary Gallandro to deal with the gang.
Gallandro's crew was permitted to tap the raw coaxium in exchange for 10,000 credits.
The specifics of the Dry Gulch job were written in the Smuggler's Guide logbook by Gallandro's employee Loonoo.

# Section 2

Han Solo and the rest of Beckett's gang proceeded to Savareen after the raid on Kessel to refine the coaxium they had taken from the Pyke Syndicate.
Enfys Nest and her Cloud-Riders fought with Beckett's group while they were there, after which Enfys regaled them with the narrative of how Crimson Dawn plagued the village.
Han concluded he couldn't give Dryden Vos the coaxium and devised a scheme to deceive him.
Tobias Beckett was adamant about not taking part in this betrayal.
