# Introduction
A cold ocean planet, Wrea could be found in the Outer Rim of the galaxy.
Breaking up the ocean were islands scattered around the planet.
Which were small in number.
Wrea is where the Wrean come from as well.
Wrea's location in the Outer Rim near the Smuggler Run’s asteroid belt made it hard to get to.
Little is known about their physical appearance or about their species as a whole, with the exception of them being an aquatic species that live in the depths of the planet’s oceans.

# Section 1
The planet had been in control of the Partisans during the Galactic Civil War.
The Partisans were Saw Gretta’s rebel group who laid claim to Wrea as a base of operations.
It was in fact the only point of interest on the planet.
Because of Wrea’s location in the Outer Rim, it made the planet a strategic point for the Partisans, who wanted to keep their base secret.
