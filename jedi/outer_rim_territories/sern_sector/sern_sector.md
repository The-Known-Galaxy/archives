# Introduction
The Atravis Sector was located within the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories.
It was connected to the Shumavar System and the Tosste System, which was also near the Hydian Way super-hyperroute.
It was the location of many planets including Mustafar, Dorlo, Carreras Minor, Mala, and more, and also housed the entire Atravis system, which was under the control of the Confederacy of Independent Systems in 22BBY.
The Atravis Sector is mainly made up of the Atravis System, which later became the sites of many battles carried out by the Empire, former Separatists, and the Rebel Alliance, and made up of many Empire fleets and armies under the order of Lord High Admiral Harrsk eight years after the Battle of Endor.

# Section 1
The area of the Atravis Sector was explored between 5000 and 3000 BBY.
The first campaigns in the Clone Wars took place within its system around 22BBY, when the system was under the control of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
They were ordered to engage in any of their operations within their vicinity.
In 25ABY, during the reign of the Empire, the Atravis Sector fell under the order of Admiral Haarsk, and its population fell from 10 to 1 billion after the Sector suffered excessive casualties due to battles between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire, and massacres led across the planets by Captain Wilhuff Tarkin, who was also responsible for the Ghorman Massacre in the Sern Sector.
