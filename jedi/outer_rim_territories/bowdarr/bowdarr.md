# Introduction

The Killer from Kashyyyk.
Deathmountain, Boneshatterer; these are all nicknames to describe one being.
If the first title wasn’t a dead give away, Bowdaar was a male Wookie who was put into slavery and forced into various gladiatorial matches spanning the galaxy.
Captured as a child in 3838 BBY, Bowdarr had only known violence for most of his life.
For more than a century, Bowdaar fought in single combat.
He had fought well over ten thousand matches, fighting rancors, Mandalorians, gundarks, and a Jedi.
He hadn’t lost a single match.
To add on to this, Bowdaar refused to wear armour or use any form of weaponry, giving him a fierce reputation that he was merely immortal.
Those who survived their encounter with him, however, would merely say he was just better than them.

# Section 1

Around 3643 BBY, nearly two hundred years after his capture, Bowdaar was acquired by Drooga the Hutt as payment for a gambler’s debt.
Bowdaar was kept caged between his matches and was treated cruelly.
Drooga would eventually get annoyed at Bowdaar due to the fact that Bowdaar would slay all of his opponents before any real entertainment could be gained from the fight.
This led Drooga to take many steps to put Bowdaar at a disadvantage, such as draining half of his blood or just outright poisoning him.

# Section 2

During his tenure with Drooga, a smuggler captain arrived on Nar Shaddaa to barter an incredibly rare male Shanjaru, a beast that was near extinction at this point in time, in exchange for an experimental engine.
Once the smuggler located Drooga’s barge in Nar Shaddaa’s Nikto Sector, the captain was able to arrive just before Bowdaar’s next fight against a gang of Kaleesh warriors.
And although Bowdaar could have easily taken the gang by himself, the smuggler chose to intervene.
Bowdaar would later repay this by assisting the smuggler against Zank Helrott, a bounty hunter in the employ of Rogun the Butcher.
Following this, Drooga had decided that he wanted to be done with the Wookie once and for all.
As such, Bowdaar and his new friend, the smuggler captain, were pitted against Drooga’s pet gundark, which was specifically starved for this occasion.
Once the gundark had died, Drooga had finally had a suitable amount of entertainment for the night, and decided that Bowdaar was no longer worth the cost it took to maintain him and simply released him, which led Bowdaar to join the smuggler’s crew.
