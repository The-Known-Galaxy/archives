# Introduction
The 3rd Moon was a terrestrial moon that could be found in the Outer Rim Territories.
The moon was home to multiple different kinds of species.
The 3rd Moon was host to a game of dejarik played by Sana Starros and a Twi’lek.
The game would eventually end with the two drawing blasters simultaneously.
During this time, Sana received a holo-communication from Hera Syndulla, a General within the Rebel Alliance.

# Section 1
As the two players were locked in a standoff, an alien approached Sana nervously, offering her the holo-comm.
Before answering the holo-comm, Sana would shoot her Twi’lek opponent and many others within the room who had stood up to engage.

General Hera Syndulla of the Republic Alliance had contacted Sana regarding a job.
Hera had hired Sana to locate Doctor Chelli Aphra, an Archaeologist for the Alliance that had gone rogue.
After accepting the job and preparing to leave, Sana would approach the Twi’lek and would take a small bag from their body.
Sana left the 3rd Moon heading off to her next location, Senex-Juvex, where she would locate Doctor Chelli Aphra.
