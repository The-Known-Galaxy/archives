# Introduction

Dathomir is a terrestrial planet located within the Outer Rim’s Quelli sector.
It possesses a Type II (breathable) atmosphere, and temperate climate.
The planet’s surface appeared red, stained by Dathomir’s sun--which contrasted significantly to the planet’s various swamplands and vast, barren, rocky terrain.
A lot of the planet’s surface was either forests or mountainous terrain, residing in said terrain being the planet’s many species and inhabitants.
The planet is heavily saturated in the Dark side of the Force, thus these inhabitants would most often be force sensitive and would affect their lives and culture.

# Section 1

Dathomir was home to a large variety of fauna and species, with its most notable perhaps being the infamous Rancor, and the Dathomirians - a near-human subspecies of the Zabrak, originating from the hybridisation of human females and Zabraks.
These Dathormirians lived in a matriarchal society in many clans, such as the Nightsisters and Nightbrothers.
Female Dathomirians, commonly referred to as the “Dathomirian witches”, bear pale white skin and donned subtle tribal tattoos.
They were force sensitive, developed their own magicks and voodoos through Dathomir which were capable of raising the dead, or turning oneself invisible.

# Section 2

Dathomirian males were red or yellow in colour, dawning natural stripes over their face and body.
They donned more obvious tribal tattoos to accentuate their stripes, and possessed a crown of horns that protruded from their heads.
These Dathomirians shared their territory with a plethora of other species, such as the aforementioned Rancor.
The Rancor is a semi-sentient predatory beast, a staggering ~4-5 meters in height, with long, powerful arms.
They would use their terrifying strength to destroy their environment, and use their powerful jaws to consume their prey--living or dead.
Despite their potential to kill and destroy, they were largely domesticated by the Dathmorians and used for their combative skill.

# Section 3

For thousands of years, before the year 3 BBY, the six-armed Fromprath was also a native to the planet, however was ultimately exiled from Dathomir by the Dathomirians.
A similar fate would ironically occur to the Dathomirians themselves, as an unfortunate failed assassination attempt by one of the Nightsisters, Asajj Ventress, would result in the near-extinction of the entire subspecies.
The last recorded survivors of this massacre are Asajj Ventress herself, and two Dathomirian women Talzin and Merrin.
