# Introduction
Telos IV, also simply known as Telos, is a world within the Outer Rim territories; strategically located at the edge of Republic space on the Hydian Way hyperlane.
Telos was once orbitally bombarded during the Jedi Civil War, but after the war occurred, Restoration Zones came to design.
These zones are scattered around the planet, however, it did exclude many of the planet’s ruins and deserted bases during the first restoration wave.
The Restoration Zones stabilized the atmosphere in these zones, allowing for flora and fauna to take root in the once desolate planet.
These were exported to the planet from ecologically rich planets such as Ithor, Onderon, and Dxun.
The restoration project was eventually successful, becoming a lush and beautiful planet.

# Section 1
Telos was the victim during the earliest days of the Jedi Civil War, which was devastated by the Sith Empire who were under the orders of Darth Malak.
He demanded the planet's surrender, which was rebuked.
This led to the orbital bombardment of the planet.
Soon after this, the Jedi Order feared an attack against the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine.
With these fears lying in the possible loss of many of the Order’s valuable relics; Telos was chosen to be a site for a secret Jedi academy and repository because of these fears.



# Section 2
Supreme Chancellor Tol Cressay chose Telos to be the first Republic-sponsored restoration project.
If successful, Telos would be the first in many planets to be restored that had been devastated by previous wars; such as the Mandalorian Wars and the previously mentioned Jedi Civil War.
Being called the Telosian Restoration Project, it had called for the construction of Citadel Station, a station large in scope that orbited the planet.
This project was overseen by the Telosian Council, a herd of Chodo Habat had been chosen to manage the project.
During the First Jedi Purge, the Jedi Exile sought to end the purge.
Telos and Citadel Station both played crucial roles in this mission.
At Citadel Station, the battle for the restabilization of the Republic took place, in which the Jedi Exile was victorious against the Sith Triumvirate.
The actions of the Jedi Exile allowed for the completion and success of Telos’ restoration.



# Section 3
Before the collapse of the Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Telos had become a politically significant world.
It was noteworthy for the natural beauty and tourist trade that its beauty drove.
In 53 BBY, Governor of Telos Crion and his son, a former Jedi named Xantos co-conspired together.
They plotted to annex a neighboring planet to gain access to its resources and factories.
This started a civil war after the Telosians discovered the plot, the resulting conclusion of the war ended with Crion’s death.
Nine years later, however, Xantos convinced the Telosians that he and his deceased father, Crion, were innocent.
He sought to industrialize Telos for his own material gain.
However, just like with the plot nine years earlier, it was foiled.
Rather than face judgment for his crimes, he took his life.
During the Imperial Period, Telos had rebelled along with several other planets within the Kwymar sector that Telos resided in.
The following Kwymar Suppressions had Telos attacked by Imperial forces, which ultimately resulted in an Imperial victory.
