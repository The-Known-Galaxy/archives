# Introduction

Vanqor was a planet located in the Outer Rim Territories, it had rocky crystalline terrain that was mostly mountainous which often included cave systems both inside and under the planetary surface.
Even though Vanqor is considered an uninhabited planet due to its lack of resources and proper land, it does however serve as a home for bloodthirsty creatures known as Gundarks.
The closest planet to Vanqor was Florrum from only six parsecs away, which allowed Hondo Ohnakaâ€™s pirate crew to perform quick scavenging runs from Florrum to Vanqor from time to time.
It is recommended to not stay on Vanqor after dark since Gundarks tend to hunt for food during that time.

Section I | Gundarks
Gundarks are carnivorous beasts native to planet Vanqor.
They are easy to recognize from their red skin and having over a dozen claws on their legs and four hands.
These terrible beasts have excellent hearing that allows them to hear any moving or somewhat heavily breathing beings from a far distance.
Gundarks are also able to not only use their strong hands to run faster but also climb on walls and ceilings, they often use this advantage over their prey.
Since Gundarks are very strong and vicious, Trandoshans often used to hunt and skin them for trophies and to gain points for their goddess or the Scorekeeper as the Trandoshans tend to call it.
