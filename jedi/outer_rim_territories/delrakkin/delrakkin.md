# Introduction

The planet Delrakkin was located within the Delrakkin system, a system of three planets located in the Outer Rim Territories.
It was the only planet in the system that supported life.
Apart from its mountain ranges, it was covered almost entirely in jungles.
Delrakkin was pummeled by constant storms, which were so dangerous that most of the native population chose to live in caves or underground.
The only place considered hospitable by outsiders was Delrakkin City, which sat on a mountaintop above the clouds.
Delrakkin City was covered in towering skyscrapers, and one powered by one tower in the center of the city.
It was the home to the reptilian species Delrakkin, which were lizard-like humanoids that were known to be skilled warriors, trackers, and hunters.

# Section 1

In the past, Delrakkin was considered a good place to hide by smugglers, until the Galactic Empire invaded, forcing the Delrakkin to leave Delrakkin City.
The Empire then populated Delrakkin City with Imperial citizens.
They installed a massive ion cannon on the side of the mountain to defend the Imperial citizens from any threats.
During the Empireâ€™s reign, groups of Stenax immigrated to Delrakkin after their homeworld of Stenos was also invaded by the Empire.
The Stenax were sent there to see if Delrakkin would be a good candidate for conquest, as they were doing on many other Outer Rim worlds.
They also examined the technology of the Delrakkin, only to find it rather primitive.

# Section 2

In 0 ABY, Delrakkin almost became the subject of an Imperial experiment led by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin.
He planned to use the planet to test the new interdictor technology, which would prevent enemy ships from going into hyperspace.
This technology was going to be developed under extreme secrecy.
To ensure that nobody caught wind of his tests, he ordered Admiral Termo to eliminate the planet's populace using Rebellion ships and to frame the Rebel Alliance for the act.
However, the scheme was foiled by the Rebellion leaders Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Leia Organa, and they evacuated the civilians on the planet.
