# Introduction
Chol is a brownish-colored planet located in the Outer-rim territories of the Cholganna system.
Orbiting along with its star Chol, the planet had three larger planets that rotated along with it, Cholganna, Be’ekk and Ryien.
 There isn’t much history about the Cholganna system.
Although there was a point in time when the system was engulfed by the Chol Nebula, the planets passed through the Nebula during their orbit.
