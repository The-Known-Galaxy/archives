# Introduction
Yavin 4 was a jungle-covered moon around its parent planet, Yavin Prime.
Seeing as this was the 4th moon circling the planet, it was named Yavin 4.
This moon was known mainly for its extremely prominent role within the Galactic Civil War, that being a base for the Rebel Alliance.
The flora of this moon were ubiquitous, with the entire moon being densely covered in foliage, yet the moon had a surprisingly comfortable and temperate climate - at the cost of having dangerous fauna and a very unforgiving ecosystem.
Some predators there included things like the Howler, a dangerous creature that derived its name from its piercing cries that could stun prey easily, or more subtle creatures such as the crystal snake, a snake that had nonlethal venom capable of making a victim fall into an hour-long sleep, as well as many other forms of wildlife, chiefly reptilian, aquatic or amphibious.
The moon experienced only two seasons, though each was very extreme.
These two were a wet season, covering the moon in rain, or a dry season, which caused the moon to become extremely dry and hot.
This moon was also the place where two Rebel veterans, Shara Bey and Kes Dameron, settled down and had a son, Poe Dameron.
It was here that they also planted a force sensitive tree that once grew on the planet Ahch-To, and was made of the same wood the ancient library in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant was made out of.

Long before the Rebel Alliance’s occupation of Yavin 4, another tribe, the Massassi, a race in tune with, and also that fed off (in a literal sense) the dark side of the Force, occupied the moon.
This race originated from the planet Korriban, the homeworld of the Sith, who were the primary users of the dark side of the Force.
This race was the original conceptualizers and creators of the Great Temple, which they had built under enslavement by a Sith Lord named Naga Sadow, a prominent Sith Lord who had also mutated the Massassi using Sith Alchemy, a rejected ability by the Jedi Order that allowed a Force user to bend things to their will.
Preceding this, the Temple was then used long after the extinction of the Massissi, by the Alliance to Restore the Republic, or simply the Rebel Alliance, as their main base of operations.
It is from here that Operation Fracture came to fruition, which was an operation carried out by the Rebel Alliance to sabotage the superweapon known as the Death Star by extracting a scientist known as Galen Erso in order to get him to testify its existence to the Imperial Senate.



# Section 2
Following this, small fighter squadrons were dispatched from the moon’s surface with the order to destroy the Death Star.
These fighters were occupied by some prominent figures, most notably Luke Skywalker, who, using his knowledge of the force, fired off a missile shot into a vulnerable part of the superweapon, thus blowing it up and bringing an end to the Empire’s sinister plan.
After Luke and his friends Han Solo and Chewbacca were honored during a subsequent award ceremony, the rebels evacuated the base, out of fear that the Empire may strike back with their own planetary missiles.
The rebels barely managed to escape the moon after an Imperial-Class Star Destroyer accompanied by some TIE fighters began to attack the Rebel headquarters, but the Destroyer was hijacked.
Here the rebels learnt that the course of attack for the destroyer was pre-programmed to fire at their headquarters.
A rebel named Evaan Verlaine was able to just barely veer the lazers off course, however, by ramming the destroyer with a Raider-class corvette.



# Section 3
Shortly after the evacuation, a rebel force was sent back in order to extract Rebel information from the moon that had been left there.
Once the Extraction Team arrived, they saw that the Empire had taken the planet over.
The extraction failed and instead resulted in the Empire taking the information, which they wouldn't have found if it weren't for the rebels, for their own purposes.

Overall, the moon of Yavin 4 was a moon with a rich history, despite the jungle-covered planet’s unassuming appearance.
