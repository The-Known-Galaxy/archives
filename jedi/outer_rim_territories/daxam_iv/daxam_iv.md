# Introduction
A planet known as Daxam IV could be found among many other worlds in the Outer Rim Territories.
This planet was near the edge of its binary star system.
Daxam IV only had two hyperspace lanes, one leading to Rior and other one to Azzameen Station.
Since planet Pamarthe was near it, a good number of Pamarthen workers, pilots specifically, were hired to work on Daxam IV.
This world was among many others that eventually joined the New Republic.
However, a terrorist group that worked with the First Order, secretly took place on Daxam IV.
