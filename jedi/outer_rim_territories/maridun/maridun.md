# Introduction

The world of Maridun is situated in the Rolion Sector of the Outer Rim Territories.
The world was mostly covered in dry grasslands with occasional rainforests hiding in wetter meadows.
Besides the Amanin, the only sentient beings that inhabited Maridun before the Imperial Era was a group of Lurmen.
The Lurmen were seeking refuge from the enslavement of the Intergalactic Banking Clan on Mygeeto.
Many non-sentient species are native to Maridun.
There is enough non-sentient life on Maridun for the Amanin tribes to sustain themselves solely on hunting for food rather than agriculture.

# Section 1

One of the non-sentient species native to Maridun is the Mastiff phalone, which is, in essence, an eagle with four strong legs rather than wings.
Another creature from Maridun is the Charnoq, a horned crocodile-like predator with eight legs that even the Amanin feared.
A more peaceful non-sentient species native to Maridun is the Carrier butterfly.
The Carrier butterfly is favored by Lurmen colonists because it can relay messages by repeating words that it hears.
Due to its usefulness, the Carrier butterfly is a common pet of Lurmen colonists.
The Amanin keep the native Fwit as their pets and guardians.
Fwits are half-meter-tall predatory mammals that favor fresh meat and blood above all else.
They are so vicious that even the Galactic Empire disliked them, resulting in the Imperials encouraging hunters to eliminate them whenever they saw them.

# Section 2

The Amanin seemed to tolerate the Lurmenâ€™s presence, as the Lurmen colony settled in the grasslands rather than the rainforests that the Amanin tribes called home.
The colony of Lurmen refugees, motivated by the horrors of the Clone Wars, embraced pacifism.
Their devotion to nonviolence was so great that they almost let a Separatist General, Lok Durd, test his experimental Defoliator tank on them without even offering resistance.
Without the efforts of a marooned group of Jedi and clones, the colony would have perished.
While they held onto their pacifism, they accepted the need for defense.

# Section 3

While the Lurmen colonists were strict pacifists, the native Amanin tribes were anything but.
The Amanin tribes regularly engaged each other in ritual battles, called takital, over territory in the rainforests they inhabited.
Being incredibly primitive, the Amanin relied solely on hunting and gathering to feed themselves, despite the Lurmen proving that agriculture on Maridun was practical.
When they defeated other tribes, it was not uncommon for them to enslave the survivors.
They were open to selling their slaves to the Imperials who later occupied the world.

# Section 4

After the Galactic Empire officially discovered Maridun in 11 BBY, initial interactions between the Imperials and Amanin tribes were anything but peaceful.
After accidentally trespassing onto a sacred site, an Imperial army was besieged for two days before the Amanin recognized the Imperials as worthy opponents.
Besides the Imperials, Hutts also began enslaving some of the Amanin.
The Amanin were desired for slave labor because of their towering stature and incredible strength.
The days of Maridun being known to a select few were over.
