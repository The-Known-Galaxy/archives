# Introduction
Yavin Prime is a red gas giant located in the Yavin System within the Gordian Reach sector.
It has 26 moons, most notably Yavin 4.
Yavin 3, 4 and 13 are the only three habitable moons.
The planet’s atmosphere is made of thick clouds and violent storm systems.
This atmosphere caused many starships to end up lost, because of the winds.
Ships that had a tracking beacon usually did manage to find their way.
Because it’s a dense gas giant, there was intense gravitational and atmospheric pressure.
Many ships were crushed because of this.

# Section 1
Several space stations orbited Yavin Prime after it was conquered and later abandoned by the Rakatan’s Infinite Empire.
After the Great Sith War, corusca gems were harvested from the gas clouds of Yavin at Yavin Station.
The station was eventually destroyed in 3965 BBY, crashing on one of Yavin’s moons, Yavin 22.
Another station was built during the Galactic Empire's reign, Achtnak Turbine Station, which held an interesting responsibility of blockading the Rebel Alliance in 0 ABY, shortly after the Death Star’s destruction.
The station wasn’t orbiting the gas giant, instead it hid within the planet’s clouds.
The station would later be destroyed by Luke Skywalker.
Another notable station was GemDriver Station, which was built by Lando Calrissian; the station was also responsible for the harvesting of corusca gems as well.
Like the other two stations, it was destroyed.
This time, however, by the Shadow Academy.
