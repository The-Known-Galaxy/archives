# Introduction

Arzid is a planet located in the Calaron sector of the Outer Rim Territories.
Arzid is a terrestrial hot and humid planet, with its main biome being dense forests.
The planet was largely undiscovered until about 15,000 BBY and mostly fell in Hutt Space on several occasions.
No significant population of intelligent life lives there, partly due to the planetâ€™s sun emitting green firestorms making space travel difficult in the system, and partly the hostile life on the planet.

# Section 1

The planet does not have any major population of intelligent life which may stem from the fact that incredibly hostile life lives on the planet.
The forests are covered in Macaab mushrooms that slowly deteriorate brain matter and tentacle bushes that are scattered throughout Arzid.
These plants use their tentacles to grab small creatures in order to digest them.
The Arachnor are large spider-like bugs that live on Macaab mushrooms.
Although they mainly eat the mushrooms on the planet, the Arachnor do not stray away from eating any meat.
It is no wonder why the Imperial outpost had incredibly high death rates.

# Section 2

Throughout history, the planet mostly fell within Hutt space but once the Galactic Empire emerged, the jurisdiction of the planet was enforced by the Galactic Empire.
Following this, the planet was first visited by Mammon Hoole and his assistant Chlar Kotchim.
Once arrived, they faced a deadly and hostile environment which would lead to the death of Chlar and the narrow escape of Mammon.
By 5 ABY, the Empire would establish a small Imperial outpost that held a notoriously high death rate.
By 16 ABY, a small and single settlement would emerge, however it was short-lived as a squad of Baktoid E4 Droids would overthrow the settlement and rule the planet.
