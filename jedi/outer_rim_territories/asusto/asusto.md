# Introduction

Asusto was a small, terrestrial planet located in the Outer Rim region of the galaxy, residing inside the Tamsis Nebula.
The planet was mainly a forest biome with Type I atmosphere.
While there were notable flora on Asusto, there was a strange fauna of moss that can move around at its own will.
This moss, however, was known to entangle those who tread on it.
Asusto was mainly used by smugglers for their business.

# Section 1

Asusto was known to have the dark side of the force latched around it.
There was the case when the last Presagers of Hakotei hid in Asusto.
These very Presagers would be the ones to lure Jedi Master Lene Kostana and her Padawan Sifo-Dyas into a trap on the planet, using the Sith artifact from Karazal on the small planet.
