# Introduction
Kamino was a heavily aquatic planet located beyond the outer rim.
It was inhabited by a species known as the Kaminoans, these species were tall, thin and possessed long necks.
The Kaminoans were known to be very isolated from the galaxy and often kept to themselves.
Their cloning feats were commendable, quite literally being able to produce an entire army for the Galactic Republic.

# Section 1
The planet Kamino itself was the home for millions of clones programmed to fight.
Renowned for its science and superior production capabilities the Galactic Republic took an interest in it.
Kamino was never a fully aquatic planet, originally it was mostly dry land, however water levels rose to such a degree that the Kaminoans were forced to develop facilities and civilization on stilts.



# Section 2
The outbreak of the Clone Wars resulted in mass production of clones which forced Kamino to become a priority for the Republic.
Around 22-21 BBY a separatist assault led by General Grievous hit Kamino in the hopes to put an end to the Clone Wars as a whole.



# Section 3
In the era of the Galactic Empire, Kamino was closed down and the cloning facilities were locked, as there was no more demand for a clone army.
Instead, the rebels and empire decided to focus on recruiting humans and other species, marking the end of Kamino.
