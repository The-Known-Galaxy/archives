# Introduction

Hoth was a distant, frozen planet located in the Anoat sector of the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories.
It was the sixth planet in the star system of the same name.
It was the primitive Wampa species' homeworld.

# Section 1

Due to its extensive snow and ice cover, the planet of Hoth seemed to be a pale blue sphere from space.
Between Hoth and its sun, there were five planets, and an asteroid belt encircled the planet, with meteors sometimes reaching the surface.
Glaciers and frozen ice plains covered the majority of its surface.
Oceans covered another 2/3 of the planet.
Even though it was always cold, the temperature was known to plummet below -60Â°C at night.

During the Galactic Civil War, it was home to Echo Base, the Alliance to Restore the Republic's temporary headquarters until the Galactic Empire tracked them down, resulting in the Battle of Hoth.
Scavengers set up temporary base camps on the planet in the months afterward to scrap the AT-ATs that had been destroyed.
During the months following the Battle of Endor, reports circulated that the New Republic intended to turn Hoth into a prison for Empire loyalists, but the veracity of these claims was questioned.Chancellor Mon Mothma had been dedicated to a pretense of justice over punishment, thus rumors were rejected.
During the Iron Blockade, the war returned to Hoth, which was the site of yet another fight.

# Section 3

The ice planet of Hoth was the scene of a fight between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance, which had set up its temporary headquarters, Echo Base, there.
The Imperials, however, had located the Alliance outpost within a month after the Rebels' arrival on the planet, owing to one of the thousands of probe droids they had dispatched throughout the galaxy.
Despite the fact that Echo Base was evacuated at the eleventh hour, the Alliance was clearly defeated at the Battle of Hoth, which was won by the elite Imperial Blizzard Force.

# Section 4

Scavengers set up temporary base camps on the planet in the months following the Battle of Hoth to scrap the AT-ATs destroyed by the Rebel Alliance during the Empire's onslaught.
Following the War of Endor, Hoth was the site of yet another battle, this time during the Anoat sector's Iron Blockade.
Acting Governor Fara Yadeez of Troithe heard rumors in 5 ABY that the New Republic planned to use Hoth into a prison for Empire loyalists.
Major Soran Keize, on the other hand, scoffed at the story, claiming that Republic Chancellor Mon Mothma was dedicated to a pretense of justice over punishment, and that repurposing Hoth, where the Rebellion had been soundly beaten by the Empire, was a waste of time.
