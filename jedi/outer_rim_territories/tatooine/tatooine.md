# Introduction

Tatooine is a desert planet located in the Outer Rim Territory, in the Arkanis Sector.
The sand planet is located on a binary star system, which is the main cause of the planet’s scorching hot temperatures, loss of life and water shortages.
With the planet’s small water supply, Tatooine could not afford for large populations to live there, leaving much of the  planet undiscovered.
Tatooine is thought to be one of the oldest planets in the galaxy, formed by a strong molten core and thick rock crust, which has allowed it to survive for so long.

# Section 1

Most of the local people of Tatooine are poor.
Due to the minimal water supply of the planet, people have begun to live and work on moisture farms.
These farms provided the people enough water to live.
Many locals also buy and sell scrap from shipwrecks and from Jawas.
Due to the low population of Tatooine, criminal activity is very high.

# Section 2

Tatooine is most infamous for their large population of Jawas and Tusken Raiders.
Jawas are small, human-like creatures that wear long coats.
Their faces are indescribable, but they have 2 bright eyes, which are typically orange.
Jawas are most typically known for their collecting of scrap.
They take almost any parts they can find, and use them on random things.
Jawas typically are seen living in large, portable scrap ships, which can hold hundreds of Jawa.
Tusken Raiders are said to be the first inhabitants of Tatooine, and have had their land taken by the new inhabitants, causing them to dislike said inhabitants.
Tusken Raiders can be seen wearing long, cloth clothing to protect themselves from the heat, and no part of their skin is showing.
They also are seen wearing large goggles, to be able to protect their vision in the sands.
Not much is known about the living style of the Tusken Raiders, due to their extreme hostility towards common folk.
