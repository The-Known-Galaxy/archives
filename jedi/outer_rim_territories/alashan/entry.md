# Introduction

There were many technological advances made in the Pre-Republic era by a culture unidentified as Alashan.
The underground city of Forever thrived as it was fully powered, protected by the Guardian, and the life forms on this planet thrived there as well.
It lasted for only a short time, despite its advanced status.
The Alashans vanished from all records at an unspecified time because they had locked the city from the outside.

# Section 1

The world was forgotten for several millennia until an archaeological team sent by the Alliance to Restore the Republic discovered it.
In the days that followed, a Galactic Empire Star Destroyer landed on the surface after the Staraker crashed onto the surface.
Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, along with Imperials led by Major Wil'm Grau, found the abandoned dig site and the lost city of Forever when they searched the planet together.

# Section 2

Following the conflict with the Guardian in the abandoned city, the team fled the planet, and the city sealed itself upon their departure.
In 137 ABY, this planet was tucked away in a space controlled by Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, escaping all galactic politics.
