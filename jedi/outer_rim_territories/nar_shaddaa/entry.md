# Introduction

Nar Shaddaa, also known as the Smuggler’s Moon - is the largest moon of hutt homeworld Nal Hutta.
It is tidally locked to its planet and has an orbital period of 413 days, each around 87 hours each.
It has a Type I (Breathable) atmosphere and a temperate climate.
While it is presumed that the moon was once a green world full of forests and life in pre-ancient times, eons of building layers of cities on-top of one another has left it completely unrecognizable; there is no history dating back to before then.
The moon is very similar to planets like Coruscant and Taris, where cities cover every square inch of the world.
It has no natural surface water that we know of, since it has all presumably been built over.
The Smuggler’s Moon is known to be one of the most dangerous places in the whole galaxy, mostly because of the criminal underworld and various gangs that have made it their home.
All the industry has left the moon extremely polluted and the cities are filthy, streets covered in trash - nearly every sector a borderline garbage dump save for the highest levels where the rich crimelords make their living.
As mentioned earlier, the moon has layers of cities, each layer being home to a different wealth class - the lower the worse people have it in life and the bottom layers are near-inhospitable.

# Section 1

The moon does have native wildlife, namely the Fang-rat - but most notably the Gank.
This is a sentient alien species indigenous to Nar Shaddaa and the only one we know about so far.
The Gank species is an intelligent, highly aggressive and unforgiving race known for their prowess and strength in battle.
A bit like the Kaleesh and Tusken Raiders, nearly nobody outside their species know what they look like because of the high-tech armour they wear from head-to-toe.
Members of this species usually worked as hired killers for criminal gangs.
When the Hutts arrived on the moon, they began industrializing it, building spaceports and docks across the surface of the moon.
It quickly began to prosper and traders, smugglers and pirates among other types flocked to the moon in droves - immigrating and building the very diverse population it has today.
For the majority of the moon’s existence it’s been mostly controlled by the Hutt Cartel, though the government is often overshadowed and controlled in itself by all of the major Criminal Organizations present on the world who are constantly at war with each other.
The moon is also a popular smuggling spot for Spice.

# Section 2

The Smuggler’s Moon is a giant city, therefore it has all sorts of hotspots and interesting areas - far too many to list here.
Notable points of interest would be the various Cantinas and Casinos around the moon, the different sectors such as the Corellian Sector and some would also consider the Undercity and Refugee Sector to be points of interest.
Rumours have also come about that large research corporations use the lower layers such as the Undercity for shady experiments that would otherwise be illegal in the rest of the galaxy, since the law does not regulate it like in Republic and Empire controlled worlds.
