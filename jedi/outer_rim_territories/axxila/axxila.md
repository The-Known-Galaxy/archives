# Introduction
This planet originated from the D’Astan sector of the Outer Rim Territories.
Many would describe Axxila as an “inside out Coruscant.” Its location was around the intersection of the Celanon Spur and the many industrial worlds, including Edusa and Vandyne.

Section One: 
During the Jedi Civil War, Axxila was the remains of a battle won by the Sith.
The homeworld planet of Admiral Firmus Piett, the last commanding officer of Vader’s Death Squadron.
Then came the Clone Wars bringing the Ciutric Hegemony to Axxila.
Soon after the planet was taken over and united with the Separatists.
Causing many of the civilians to flee the planet under the name of “Free Axxilans”, later relocating to the planet of Halmad.
At the end of the Clone Wars a good chunk of the separatist army retreated to the Ciutric sector.
A group known as the Crimson Dagger was relocated to Axxila in order to launch a campaign to reconquer the area and its people.

Section Two: 
Several months after the Battle of Endor, Ysanne Isard sent Admiral Delak Krennel to attack the planet to prevent Coruscant being given to the New Republic.
Many civilians were wiped out in the process.
Krennel later took control of the Ciutric Hegemony.
Axxila was conquered by Yuuzhan Vong during the Yuuzhan Vong War after the acquisition of Vinsoth in 25 ABY.
The world was used by the invaders as a platform to stage their assaults on the planets Pedd IV, Celanon, Feriae Junction, and Yavin IV.
Axxila remained under the control of Yuuzhan Vong until the conclusion of the war in 29 ABY.
Now placed under the Galactic Alliance during the Second Galactic Civil War.
Not long after, Axilla was a member state of Darth Krayt’s Galactic Empire.
