# Introduction
Korriban is the only planet in the solar system of Horuset.
It was the home planet of the Sith species and a sacred planet among the Sith.
The planet is buried in a number of ancient and powerful dark Sith Lords and the planet is tainted with dark side energy.

After a hundred years of darkness, the dark Jedi arrived on the planet to rule the Sith using the Force.
When the Siths lost in the Great Hyperspace War, against the Republic, Korriban was abandoned.
It later housed two Sith academies and became the center of the New Sith Order.Rakata attacked Korriban in 27,700 BBY, with an attempt to integrate the world into the Infinite Empire with the intent to gather slaves from the planet for use in Rakatan projects.
The Rakata was eventually exiled from Korriban, after the Sith King Adas, lead the Siths to fight against them, even though he was killed within the battle, they won.
The Sith Dynasty on Korriban fell and the Siths started leaving Korriban to planets like Arbra and Tund.

# Section 1
The Sith Empire on Korriban was created in the 6900 BBY, by the Dark Jedis, exiled from the Jedi community, and it’s morals.
 Many famous and powerful Siths were buried on this planet, for example Darth Bane.
The graves of the fallen Sith Lords, were on the famous “Valley of the Dark Lords”, which included many other gravestones, of the fallen siths.
The Valley was also next to a Sith Temple.

The exiled Dark Jedis, called themselves “Siths”, after the species that lived on Korriban.
The first three Sith lords were Ajunta Pall, Karness Muur and XoXaan.
Korriban itself is one of the planets, that can have liveable environment, but itself, hard to live on.
Because of the hard pressure of the dark stigma on the planet, it had more negative and dark monsters living on it.
For example, Shyracks, that lived in certain caves, of the planet.
