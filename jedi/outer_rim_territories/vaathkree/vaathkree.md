# Introduction
Vaathkree, also known as Vaath’kror was a volcanic planet located in the Outer Rim Territories and inside the Tharin Sector’s periphery region.
Vaath’kror served as a home planet for Vaathkree species.
Vaath’kror was mostly ignored in terms of invading or attacking due to lack of interest from other species, in fact, it was quite difficult to even visit the planet due to its surrounding Hutt Space, barely anyone wanted to deal with a large crime family just to visit a rocky planet.
During the invasion of the galaxy, for the first time in many years, Vaath’kror was being invaded by the Yuuzhan Vong, also known as the Chosen Race who managed to conquer the Vaath’kror system.

Section I | Vaathkree species
Sometimes life was very difficult on Vaathkree due to the planet’s volcanic nature, however, members of the Vaathkree species often had their skin covered in multiple layers of metal or stone in order to protect themselves from any danger that they might have encountered in their home planet.
These creatures had a long lifespan from 300 to 350 standard years.
Some might have described these creatures as menacing or terrifying due to their appearance, however, Vaathkree were actually well known for their devotion to trade.
In fact, they even constructed small settlements for any outsiders that arrived in their villages for protection and comfort, these outsiders were welcome to stay for as long as they wanted to.
