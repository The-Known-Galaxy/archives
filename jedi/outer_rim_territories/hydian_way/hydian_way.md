# Introduction
The Hydian Way was a super-hyperroute established in 3705 BBY to 3693 BBY by renowned scout Freia Kallea, opening up much of the galaxy being the sole route that accompassed the entirety of it.
It began on the Corporate Sector and went way past Eriadu, effectively accompassing past The Slice and fundamentally changing the state of galactic civilization.
With this, the route was named after Duros scout Banu Hydia, a colleague of Freia Kallea.
With the establishment of this hyperroute, the state of the galaxy is forever changed as it now compasses the Inner and Outer Rim regions with relative ease in comparison to previous routes.

# Section 1
The beginning of the Hydian Way started at the Outer Rim world of Bonadan, streaking it’s way past Bandomeer and Taris to Bogden, within the Inner Rim.
With this, the hyperroute would make its intersection with the well-known Corellian Run near Caamas, through the Perlemian Trade Route at Breental.
The Way would then make its way through Alderaan, as well as Rendili, and would cross the Corellian Run again at the Inner Rim world of Denon.
Continuing this, the route would go near Derra IV in the Expansion Regions and Malastare within the Mid Rim, crossing the Rimma Trade Route at Eriadu and would end at the Outer Rim.



# Section 2
With the Hydian Way being one of the most important routes throughout the galaxy, its history should come as no surprise with relevancy.
In her first advances into space, Freia Kallea would make advances into the regions beyond Farana would result in the creation of a reliable path through the Crombach Nebula, and the formation of a decisive route between Serenno and Telos IV.
With this, two Neimoidian scouts named Thoax and Farge Ossax would hire Duros Banu Hydia to eliminate their growing competition, to which he would refuse.
Freia Kallea would continue chartering routes south of Denon, eventually establishing a route to Demos IV by 3703 to 3702 BBY.

Upon her entry unto Malastare, Kallea would be captured and arrested by Thoax and Ossax’s thugs, with Hydia aiding in her rescue.
She would attempt to continue their expansion, only to be crippled by the Neimoidians and force her ship into crash-landing on a relatively desolate world of Nuvar, where she would be rescued by Hydia 6 standard years later.
In her return to civilization, she would begin to launch her scouting expeditions again, making her way past the Tosste System and would finalize her route with the Hydian Spur, ending on the luscious planet of Imynusoph.
They would be caught under trap by the Neimoidians and their henchmen, ultimately resulting in the death of Hydia, who would be the namesake of the Hydian Way.
Remaining stretches of former hyperspace routes would be sown into the Hydian Way by Kallea, with routes -such as the Morellian Trail, the Sprizen End Run, and the Dustig Trace, which would be absorbed into the Hydian Way in 3693 BBY, rejuvenating Malastre as a trading hub of the Way.

	In recent history, the Hydian Way would be a centerpiece of many conflict across the galaxy, with the Mandalorian blockade of the Hydian Way in 3661 BBY or 7 BTC in an attempt to choke the Republic’s trade in the region, to an extent even placing it under economic crisis.
With this, the Republic would strike back under a Mirialan named Hylo Visz, who would drive the Mandalorian blockade from the Way, ending the time of turmoil and starvation with the Republic.
She would be hailed as a hero of the Republic after.
 In the Galactic War between the reinvigorated Sith Empire and the Republic, the Empire would blockade the Hydian Way with their Mandalorian mercenaries, with vast traps placed around the Way ambushing Republic convoys in redirected routes.
 After century after century, the Eriadu Way would be eventually integrated into the Hydian Way, no longer becoming a separate hyperlane.
Recent movements in the galaxy would result in alternation of original Hydian routes.
