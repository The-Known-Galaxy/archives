# Introduction

A Galactic Republic fortress world, Falang Minor is a cold and rainy world within the Outer Rim Territories.
Falang got its status as a fortress world because of the Tionese War, which saw the construction of these worlds.
The Tionese War was a war fought between the Galactic Republic and the Honorable Union of Desevro and Tion, from 24,000 BBY to 23,900 BBY.
Despite not being an official territory of the Republic at the time, it was built to it’s status by the Republic.
Some other planets that held the same title of fortress world as Falang are Ossus and Haashimut.
On these two worlds the Jedi watchmen monitor and Falang Minor was no different than Ossus and Haashimut.
Infact, his world was speculated to be the birthplace of the Jedi Order along with other planets until the Jedi traced its foundations to the world in the deep core, Tython.
Despite not being an official territory of the Republic at the time, it was built to it’s status by the Republic.
