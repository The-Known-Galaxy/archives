# Introduction

Florrum was an Outer Rim territory, located in the Sertar sector.
During the Clone Wars, the planet was home of a pirate gang led by Hondo Ohnaka, with the planet possessing sulfur, with a majority of the terrain being desert-like.
The planet was briefly held by the CIS, but then the forces were repelled by the Jedi, along with the pirate gang led by Hondo Ohnaka.

# Section 1

Florrum was home to little wildlife, with the main fauna being the Skalders.
These creatures were entirely native to Doshar fields, the Doshar Fields being an area of acid geysers.
Due to this environment, the Skalders developed thick hides that allowed them to survive the harsh conditions.
The planet of Florrum was also home to Jawas, Weequays, Nikto and Bith.

# Section 2

The pirate gang led by Hondo Ohnaka was a major player in Count Dooku’s capture, taking the Sith Lord back to the planet of Florrum, putting a ransom up for the Sith lord.
This attracted the two Jedi Knights, Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi.
As the gang expected, the two Jedi arrived at Florrum, expecting to pay the ransom for Count Dooku.
Instead, contrary to the Jedi’s belief, the pirate gang then captured the two Jedi.
The two Jedi then escaped afterwards, along with the help of Jar-Jar Binks, a few clone troopers and Commander Stone.
The Republic then left the planet of Florrum to solitude until the freeing of Ziro the Hutt.

During Boba Fett’s scheme against Mace Windu, attempting to get revenge for his fathers death, Boba Fett, along with a few other bounty hunters, brought Republic hostages to Florrum, seeking to receive refuge with the pirate gang.
The gang allowed the bounty hunters to take refuge, but Hondo refused the bounty hunters' support in their journey.
Shortly after, the Jedi Ahsoka Tano, and Plo Koon appeared on Florrum in search of the bounty hunters.
The two sides fought in a cantina, with the bounty hunters then dispersing, leaving Boba Fett and Bossk to be captured while Aurra Sing was on the run.
Ahsoka Tano pursued Sing, while Plo Koon brought the two bounty hunters back to Coruscant.
Sing was injured after the crash of Slave I, due to Ahsoka, although Sing despite all odds, survived the crash.
Allowing her to be included in future missions.

# Section 4

After Cad Bane’s attempt at rescuing Ziro the Hutt from Galactic prison, Bane’s partner was caught over Florrum, attempting to hide from the Republic in the Outer Rim.
Bane’s partner crashed into Florrum, being captured by Hondo’s gang.
Toward the later years of the Clone Wars, Ahsoka Tano was captured by the pirate gang while chaperoning a few younglings on a Crystal Gathering, these younglings cleverly snuck their way into the pirate gangs facility, freeing Ahsoka and allowing them to escape.
