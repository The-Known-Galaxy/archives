# Introduction

Rattatak is located within the Outer Rim and was unknown to the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars.
The planet was dry and arid with lots of red rock mountains that covered most of the planet.
Most of the settlements there looked to be cut into the rock itself.
There was too harsh of a climate on the planet to be able to sustain large amounts of agriculture.
Rattatakâ€™s judicial system is based around the gladiator games, which involve taking anyone convicted of a crime and throwing them into the gladiator pits for the rest of their lives.
The Rattataki were believed to have been descendants of an Old Republic expedition, while the rest of the civilians were from hundreds of unknown worlds.

# Section 1

The planet was one of the few that had not been explored in the galaxy.
Since the planet was isolated this led to the Rattataki fighting each other, alongside one other sentient species.
Their way of fighting eventually evolved from melee weapons to blasters.
After some time the Ventresses built up an army in the southern hemisphere, but their foster daughter Asajj was the only one to escape.
After their attack, a warlock fell from the sky claiming to be a representative of the Galactic Republic.
Upon his arrival, he was immediately barraged with attempts to assassinate him, but he managed to escape and locate Asajj.
Then taking her on as his Padawan as he noticed her strong connection with the Force.
They worked together and began to unite armies which helped bring peace to the planet.

# Section 2

All of the warlords feared the duo so they joined together to take them down.
Unfortunately, they were only able to successfully kill the master.
Because of this Asajj captured and killed every warlord responsible for the death of her master and later started a totalitarian regime on the planet.
The majority of the planet ended up being controlled by the Stunger state.
It was around this time that Count Dooku discovered and recruited Asajj after she arose victorious at the deathmatches of The Cauldron.
He later introduced her to Darth Sidious who gave her her first assignment, which was to kill Anakin Skywalker.
Later on, during the Clone Wars, Obi-Wan-Kenobi was taken to Rattatak by Asajj after her victory on Jabiim.
