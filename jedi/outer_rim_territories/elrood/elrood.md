# Introduction
Elrood was a planet that could be found inside the Elrood sector in the Outer Rim Territories.
This planet’s surface was mostly covered in plains and oceans.
Since this world did not have any native sentient-species, humans eventually colonized the planet with the help of the Galactic Republic.
The planet was named after Senator Elrood who helped provide funding for the colonizers.
At some point Elrood began growing more popular as people began using it for means such as trading, it eventually became the capital world of its own sector.
Anyone that planned on visiting Elrood had to leave their equipment behind since all types of armor and ranged weapons were not allowed on the planet, and any non-sentient creatures were not allowed to roam on the planet without being attached to a leash.
