# Introduction

A planet known as Clak’dor VII served as a homeworld for a species known as Aalagar and Bith.
They could be found among many other planets in the Outer Rim Territories.
Its precise location was in the Mayagil sector, inside the Colu system.
Clak’dor VII was also known as Bith.
Since this world was also part of the Rimma Trade Route, one could see ships often appear near the planet.
Most of Bith’s terrain consisted of swamps and jungles.
A good number of slimy creatures and fish could be found hiding in the waters and foliage.
Most species that planned on visiting Bith had to bring a breathing device with them, since the atmosphere of this planet lacked oxygen required for breathing.

# Section 1

Right before the start of the Clone Wars, a good number of Bith chose to move back to their homeworld due to the increasing tension between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of the Independent Systems.
Despite most of the Bith wanting to remain neutral and have no part in the war, they decided to stand with the Confederacy of the Independent Systems before and during the war.
After the Clone Wars, the Bith quickly began seeing through the lies of the Galactic Empire and were afraid of what the Republic had turned into.
After the Galactic Civil War, Clak’dor VII was one of the first planets that was freed from the Imperial chains.
