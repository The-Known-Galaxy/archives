# Introduction
The Raxus system was located in the Outer Rim Region, inside of the Tion Hegemony sector.
The single star, named Raxus, had three planets orbiting it; Raxus Prime, Raxus II and Raxus Secondus.
Having had a population of around 1.3 million, the system was one of the less populated regions of the galaxy.
The system was first inhabited by humans around 30,000 BBY, when the system was conquered and annexed by the Rakatan Infinite Empire.
During the Empire’s reign, human slaves were brought in to do manual labour and to populate the planets.

# Section 1
Control of the system has swapped hands many times in galactic history.
After the fall of Rakata to a plague around 25,200 BBY the system would come under the control of the Livien League, and then later as the Capital of the Kingdom of Cron around 25,120 BBY.
Where it would stay under their control until its absorption into Xim’s Empire.
The system would continue to change hands between minor galactic factions until 23,000 BBY, when the Honourable Union of Deservro and Tion was annexed by the Galactic Republic after being exhausted by centuries of fighting them.



# Section 2
Later on during the “Cold War” between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, a probe of unknown origins was located in the system when it was under the control of  the Galactic Republic and someone was sent to find out the origins of this unknown probe.
During the Clone Wars, Raxus served as the Capital of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
