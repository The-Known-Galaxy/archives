# Introduction

Rodia was a planet that served as a homeworld to a species known as Rodian, it was located close to the Corellian Run super-hyperroute, right in between the Mid Rim and the Outer Rim Territories.
Most of the planetâ€™s surface consisted of water due to Rodia being a swampy planet.
One could see giant trees sticking out of the water and reaching the skies.
While a good amount of Rodia was considered as swamps, some oceans could be found, separating land masses from each other.
Since there were few predators and dangerous creatures on the planet, the Rodians constructed their cities on giant platforms that were built right above the swamp water level.
Their cities were also protected with bubble domes since they had very little space to flee to in case of an attack, even some hidden bunkers were built underwater in case of an emergency.
During the early years of the Clone Wars,  Rodia became part of the Republic and continued to remain loyal to them after seeing the benefit between their relationship.
However, during the Imperial rule, many Rodians joined the Rebellion due to the Empire taking over their homeworld.
