# Introduction

A planet known as Cyrkon could be found among many other star systems in the Outer Rim Territories, it was located near the edge of Hutt Space.
Cyrkonâ€™s atmosphere was once breathable, however, it was filled with deadly toxins by the increasing amount of facilities.
Therefore, each city was equipped with a dome shield to protect the inhabitants, including the capital of Cyrkon.
Their government was also incredibly corrupt; as long as one had enough credits, they could easily bribe their way into obtaining anything they needed at the time.
Most of the trade and deals happened on the black market, despite a working economy existing on the planet.
Almost anything that was worth credits could be found on Cyrkon, including weapons, spices and servants.
Life on the outside of the domes was impossible since not only was the atmosphere deadly, but all the terrain had overheated as well, the only suitable temperature was inside the domes.
Eventually these cities began gaining far too many inhabitants and started lacking law enforcement and government members.
