INTRODUCTION
“The Noghri had no interest in the war.
But the war came to them nonetheless.” - Bly.

Out of the (7) planets within the Honoghr system, Honoghr is the only one to contain a permanent and stable living species called the Noghri who consider the planet to be their homeworld.
This planet is particularly interesting considering that the entire planet is made up of one land-mass, it’s only continent.

HISTORY
Unsurprisingly, the Rakatan Infinite Empire had dominated the planet and annexed it as part of their conquest in roughly 30,000 BBY.
The Rakatan ancient ruins of a once owned temple remained as evidence, and the Noghri utilised this as a sacred area to their people.

The Sith had also once used the temple as a training camp for Sith Warriors and Marauders during the New Sith Wars period.
The Yuuzhan Vong had also laid assault to the planet at one point.

Unfortunately, a cataclysmic disaster brought the planet to its knees in 20 BBY when a Lucrehulk-class Core ship during a starship battle plummeted into its mass.
This alone would not have been deadly; however, the ship contained Trihexalophine 1138, a deadly toxin that consumed the planet.

The toxin left the planet barren, killing all it’s plant life and most of its ecological systems.
The hunter-gathers at the time, Noghri, travelled across the planet to refuge areas or oasis’s where they could survive and escape starvation.

Later on, during the Galactic Empire period, Darth Vader visited the planet.
His soldiers had actually been killed by the natives.
The Noghri still had primitive weapons at the time, and being able to kill the Stormtroopers had impressed Lord Vader.

Lord Vader in kind restored the planet to its former beauty in exchange for the Noghri’s skills who would serve him as assassins.
These assassins titled “Death Commandos” were deceived as the grass on the planet was actually a hybrid of the toxin and still poisoned the local Noghri.

Galen Marek, Tao and Ennix Devian, (3) of Vader’s apprentices were also later trained on the planet by having them fight and survive Noghri hunting groups.

Later on, a Zann Consortium sent a task force to the planet in order to kill Commander Malinth, an imperial commander stationed there.
This led to conflict with the Noghri who sided with the Empire against the empires.
The Noghri were defeated.

During the Thrawn crisis in 9 ABY, Leia Organa Solo visited the planet and convinced the Noghri (being the daughter of Lord Vader) to abandon the Empire.
They would seize their freedom, join the alliance and never be deceived again.

This very relevant and important species became part of the New Republic and their respective clan, Kim's Bar represent them in the senate.
