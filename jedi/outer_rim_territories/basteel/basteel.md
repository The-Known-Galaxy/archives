# Introduction
Basteel--often misspelled as ‘Bastille’--is an overall, relatively underwhelming planet found within the Outer Rim Territories.
It has its own Basteel system found in the Corva sector, with neighboring planets and systems such as: The Galaan System, Galaan’s Yellow Moon, The Sesid system, and Jaresh.
Basteel itself experiences frigid temperatures, and its terrain is extremely mountainous, with only one major city erected below the planet’s surface - Eladro city.

# Section 1
Its most notable fauna consisted only of the ‘unidentified tunnel creatures’ that inhabit the cave systems inside Basteel’s mountains.
Despite its uninteresting appearance, however, Basteel and its neighbouring systems would show some interesting activity from an outside influence at around 4 ABY.



# Section 2
During the Galactic Civil War, Basteel would show little to no activity from the Empire.
Its extremely far location from the planet Endor and its uninteresting appearance elected it to be the perfect place for Leia Organa’s Operation Yellow Moon.
It was this sector and its neighbouring sectors where Leia would proceed with her operation and place several hyper-transceivers to distract the Empire from the Alliance’s appearance and movements shortly before the Battle of Endor.



# Section 3
The Empire would appear as a result, thinking it to be an Alliance movement and proceeded to arrest Eladro city’s inhabitants in an effort to locate the rebels.
In reality, the Rebel Alliance was making significant progress towards rallying a large Alliance presence at Sullust right before their advancements toward the second Death Star for what would soon be the Battle of Endor.
