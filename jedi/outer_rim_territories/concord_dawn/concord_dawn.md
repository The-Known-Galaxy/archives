# Introduction

Concord Dawn was an Outer Rim planet within the Concord Dawn system.
The planet has suffered colossal damage due to wars or small squabbles.
Nearly ?
of the planet’s mass has been blasted to bits.
However, Concord Dawn has a fair share of history, notably being the birthplace of Rako Hardeen and Jango Fett, two bounty hunters renowned (or despised, as bounty hunters are) for their works.
Concord Dawn was governed and overseen by the Mandalorian Protectors, headed by Fenn Rau.

# Section 1

Around the time of the Age of the Empire, a congregation of Mandalorian warriors referred to as the Mandalorian Protectors set up a camp on Concord Dawn and began to rule the planet and its third moon.
At their head was Fenn Rau, who forged an agreement with the Empire which had occupied their homeworld, Mandalore.
In 3 BBY however, a group of rebels known as the Spectres, particularly Hera Syndulla and Sabine Wren, were attacked by the Protectors attempting to negotiate hyperspace routes.
The leader of the Spectres, Kannan Jarrus, was sent to destroy their fighters to halt more conflict between them.
However, Kannan had a double intention of attempting to negotiate.
Sabine hid on Kannan’s ship, with the purpose of killing Fenn Rau for maiming Hera during the dogfight.
When Jarrus got to the planet and spoke with Rau, Sabine Wren planted explosives on the Mandalorians’ Fang fighters.
After being captured and assumed a bounty hunter by the Protectors, Wren demanded a duel with Rau, to honor the Mandalorian Code.
Rau agreed to this duel.
However, Sabine then set off the explosives that she had planted earlier, prompting Fenn Rau to attempt to capture the rebels.
However, this was in vain and backfired, as Rau was captured by the rebels.
Eventually, Rau was forced by the Spectres to let them use their hyperspace routes.

# Section 2

In 2 BBY, the Protectors’ deal with the rebels to allow them to pass through Concord Dawn in order to escape Imperial Patrols was discovered by the Imperial Viceroy of Mandalore at the time, named Gar Saxon.
Saxon attempted to lure Fenn Rau to the planet, who was offworld ever since his capture, by decimating his subordinates within the Mandalorian Protectors.
After learning of this and Escaping Gar, Fenn Rau joined the rebellion.
After this, when the Mandalorian Civil War broke out, Fenn Rau declared that the Mandalorian Protectors would join the other Mandalorians under Bo-Katan to lead them.

# Section 3

To summarize, Concord Dawn was a planet characterized by its many wars, and is now a desolate planet.
It is a warning of what can happen if a planet is abused over petty squabbles, as it now sits uninhabited, with nearly a third of the planet decimated by war.
However, Concord was responsible for the Mandalorian Protectors, a prominent Mandalorian group, and two fearsome bounty hunters who still are venerated/feared by many.
Though its time has passed, the legacy it has left on the Galaxy is remarkable.
