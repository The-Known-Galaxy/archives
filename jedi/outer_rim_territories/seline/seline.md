# Introduction

Seline was a cold temperature planet in the Outer Rim Territories located within the Dalonbian Sector, and was also located in the Veragi Trade Route.
The planetâ€™s mountainous surface was mostly dead and unproductive due to the forever lasting cold weather.
Barely anyone lived on this planet due to the lack of resources.
However, it was used as an outpost planet by the Galactic Republic which included a Jedi Starport for the Order.
During the large Galactic War between the Jedi Order and the Sith Empire, ancient Gree ruins were discovered on the planet's surface.
Both sides continued to fight until they gained control of two hypergates that were left on Seline by the Grees.
