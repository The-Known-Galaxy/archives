# Introduction

Chad was a planet in the Outer Rim Territories, it served as a homeworld for the Chadra-Fan race.
It was located in the Jospro sector, inside the Chad system, being the only inhabited planet.
The members of Chad’s government were either from local ranches or anarchistic clans.
Most of the planet’s surface was covered in water, causing areas such as wetlands, swamps, bayous, and marshes to form.
The only surfaces that could be walked on were the highlands and mountains.
However, many inhabitants chose to live on the ocean on ranch-arks and sail barges.
Knowing that their homes could be destroyed and civilization damaged by the huge waves, some chose simply to live on top of tall trees.
Due to the warm climate of the planet, it often rained heavily on the highlands as well.
Storms and hurricanes could often be seen moving through the deep oceans.
There were barely any variations during different seasons, and despite the overwhelming degree of heat, the north pole surprisingly still froze during winters.
Whenever the ocean floors shaked on Chad, a tidal wave, or a “death wave”, as the Chadra-Fan had named them, was expected to arrive.
These massive waves killed hundreds of thousands of the inhabitants, mostly Chadra-Fan and Humans, while wiping out their property.
Chad was not part of the Galactic Republic or anything else.
