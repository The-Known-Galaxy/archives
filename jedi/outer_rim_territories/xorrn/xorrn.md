# Introduction
Xorrn was a planet known for its mineral rich lands.
This planet was located in the Ferra sector within the Outer Rim Territories.
The surface of the planet had only begun to cool, so the natural resources were easily accessible.
However, the instability of the planet’s crust and the cost to start up any mining operations prevented them from happening.

Section One: 
Some time before the Clone Wars, Geonosians used Xorrn to build battle droids illegally.
They also tried to construct their hive spires on the planet as well, but all of them collapsed before completion.
To overcome this, the Geonosian people started to build their spires in reverse.
Over time this became one of Geonosis’ best kept secrets.
Millions of battle droids were made right underneath the Republic’s nose without them even knowing.
Although, the secrecy of these operations did not last for long.


Section Two: 
Not long after the Clone Wars, the planet was discovered by the Republic.
Thus becoming a recurring target for numerous Republic attacks.
After several assaults and other Geonosian worlds fell, the Republic felt no need to waste more of their time on capturing the planet.
Their fleet attacked the Geonosian hives remaining on the planet, destroying a multitude of Trade Federation Core ships in the process.
Around the time of the Galactic Civil War you can still see remnants of the former attacks when Xorrn became the site of yet another battle.
