# Introduction
Nal Hutta, also known as Hutta, was the home planet of the Hutt race.
It was located in the Outer Rim Regions.
It was a hot planet full of marshes and swamp forests.
Nal Hutta got its marshes through the invasion of Drengir, which also caused frequent and heavy rainfall.
The planet became a paradise for criminals through the activities of the Hutts.
Few well-protected spaceports have been built to connect cities on the planet.
Because of her climate, Nal Hutta had few guests.
Most things were done on Nar Shaddaa, Nal Hutta's largest moon.
The capital of the planet was Bilbousa, where the Hutt Council sometimes held office.
The majority of Hutta fauna has been extinct by Drengir, and the only native species which survived the invasion were the Hutts.
Over time, new animals were brought to Hutta from different worlds.
Some were able to adapt and survive; some shared the fate of their predecessors.
The same goes for Nal Hutta flora; it was completely wiped out by Drengir and turned into swamps and jungles.

# Section 1
Nal Hutta was not always the swamp it was.
It once had hundreds of cities and villages on its surface that were filled with life.
It was one of the largest metropolises in the Outer Rim Region.
The Drengir Invasion ruined the planet and transformed it entirely, which led to many of its residents fleeing to its moons or other planets.
Nal Hutta did not participate in any major conflict, as no one wanted to settle a base on its territory.
It was impossible as the Hutt Council did not want any military force on their home planet.
Also, because of the climate, such a project would cost twice more as a normal base built.
Under the strict rule of the Hutts, Nal Hutta had earned a reputation as a dangerous place, it was a paradise for any criminal that wished to begin their dark career.
Despite its reputation, the moon of Nal Hutta, Nar Shaddaa, was one of the most important centers of legal and illegal trade and played a large part in the galactic economy.
