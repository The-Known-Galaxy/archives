# Introduction
Muunilinst was a homebase planet for one of the groups within the InterGalactic Banking Clan (IGBC); which during the clone wars, was one of the members of the Confederacy of Independent Systems or CIS.
This planet in particular was inhabited by the Muun species and held its significance during the Clone Wars during the battle of Muunilinst.

# Section 1
Muunilinst was often described as ‘mineral-rich’ and this world had rich forests, a long blue sky stretching across the horizon, and mountains reaching great heights.
Below the surface, the planet had a liquid iron core, many active volcanoes rumbling ready to erupt.
The shallow oceans that this planet proudly owned had many vents, leading from the crust and, from these vents, pure and very valuable metal poured out alongside many sea creatures.
This made Muunilinst a very wealthy planet hence why it was essential and only right for the IGBC to set up a headquarters there.

 Muunilinst was often called ‘Moneyland’ due to the species that inhabited this planet, known as the ‘Munns’.
These species were naturally talented in mathematics as well as brilliant businessmen.
They were often or not seen as very arrogant, and competitive since they believed they were superior to every other species.
Despite these negative differences, they still had the utmost respect for fairness and followed every letter of the law.
Regarding their society, they had a strict social hierarchy.
If you were born as a poor Muun you were most likely to stay down in that social class unless you excel in education, those who were gifted were often allowed the opportunity to move up a social class and thus were tested constantly.



# Section 2
The IGBC was known specifically during the Clone Wars for playing as a double agent, aiding both Seperatist and Republic forces.
In this particular battle at 22BBY, it led to a lot of blood shed.
In desperation the people of Muunilinst turned to the Republic in secret, asking for help as the CIS had made multiple droid and munition factories scattered across the planet in disagreement with many of the natives on the planet.
The Republic forces were led by Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obiwan Kenobi.
Due to the vicious forces that were presented towards the Republic by the Separatists stationed there, the Republic had no choice but to battle within the cities.
This of course almost led to the near bankruptcy to the galaxy and the cities in ruin.
The main issue present during the battle was a unit of IG assassin droids led by an infamous Jedi bounty hunter (known by Durge), despite this clear struggle the Republic stayed on top and managed to reclaim the planet.
This victory didn’t last long as later the planet came back under Separatist authority.
