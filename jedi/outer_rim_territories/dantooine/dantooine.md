# Introduction

Dantooine is a green, grassy world within the Outer Rim with an orbital period of around 378 standard days, each day lasting approximately 25 hours each.
The planet boasts a Type I (Breathable) atmosphere and is mostly covered in grasslands, lakes and rivers; the climate is temperate and pleasant.
It has several continents, most of them roughly of the same composition.
It is known to be quite a beautiful world, vast savannahs stretching out across open fields - the moons shining brightly in the sky.
There are hilly regions, though not common as the planet is mostly flat.
It has two moons and orbits a single yellow star named Dina.

# Section 1

It is somewhat of a quiet planet, almost completely devoid of galactic traffic.
The planet has quite a low population, mostly consisting of human farmers and various wildlife.
Though the planet does have an indigenous species of its own, the Dantari.
A near-human species with primitive tech and a tribal culture.
Not yet having learned about farming, they would mostly hunt - wandering the plains in search of their food.
The planet inhabits many different alien species, though most are the non-sentient animals that are native to the world.
Strangely enough for such a calm-seeming planet, most of the native wildlife is quite aggressive in nature.
Many predators roam the savannahs and only a few true “prey” animals exist.

# Section 2

The planet has numerous structures of interest, namely the ancient Jedi Enclave.
The Enclave was built sometime around 3997 BBY and used for around forty years until it was destroyed by the ancient Sith Lord Darth Malak.
It was rebuilt a few years later and was used as a temporary residence for the Jedi Council, but due to unfortunate circumstances it was soon abandoned as it mostly stands to this day.
The Enclave on Dantooine is very important to the Order’s history as many notable figures were trained there - such as Revan and Bastila Shan who would both go on to shape the history of our galaxy.
