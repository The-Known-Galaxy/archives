# Introduction

The Qeimet System was a system located in the Juris Sector within the Outer Rim Territories.
Its grid coordinates on the Galactic Grid map were “P-17”, and it had a population of somewhere between ten to hundred million.
A trade route running through the Qeimet System was the Five Veils Route, which ran from Farstine to Skynara.
The Qeimet System was allied with the Republic in the Old Republic era and continued to ally throughout the Clone Wars, allowing the Republic to set up its Sarin Oversector headquarters there and serve as the base of operations for the Fifteenth Sector Army.
Due to their alliance, the Qeimet System quickly fell to Imperial rule in 19 BBY.
The Sarin Oversector was explored in the years between 1000 BBY and 25 BBY, which produced many impressive findings.
The discovering of the Rebel base on Hoth drew the attention of the Empire to the Qeimet System, which was where the report came back that a probe droid had sensed activity on the barren and frozen planet of Hoth in the Outer Rim, which intrigued the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader, to focus all attention on the snowy planet.
Imperial rule was relatively weak in the sector, as the New Republic was quite rebellious there.
Thus the Empire created the Qeimet Fleet with the flagship “Victorious,” leading the fleet to destroy all rebellious activity in the system.
The Qeimet System was quite a quiet System, seldom involved in conflicts, and was ruled peacefully under the Galactic Republic’s and Empire’s reign.
