# Introduction
Greater Javin, or the Javin Sector, was a region of space in the Outer Rim Territories.
Greater Javin consisted of three other subsectors — Javin, Anoat, and Yarith.
The region thrived economically throughout the Galactic Republic and Galactic Empire era.
Throughout the system, there would be a large number of trade routes.
This means that the area of space surrounding Greater Javin was open and safe for hyperspeed travel.

# Section 1
The Corellian Trade Spine was a trade route that ran through Greater Javin.
The route would begin on the planet Corellia and end on Duro.
The trade route was controlled by the Figg family, a family of hyperspace explorers that originally opened Greater Javin to hyperspace travel.
However, Separatists would relentlessly raid the trade route during the Clone Wars, and the same would happen during the Galactic Civil War as Nym’s pirates would raid it then.



# Section 2
Throughout the Galactic Civil War, many planets within Greater Javin would become Rebel home planets, a place of safety and comfort for the Rebellion.
One of these planets would include Hoth, an ice body located within the Anoat sector of Greater Javin.
Hoth would temporarily become the headquarters of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.
This would be temporary, as the Galactic Empire would soon locate the base and launch an attack that would initiate the Battle of Hoth.

Another planet within the Anoat sector would be Bespin; this planet would be prevalent during the Galactic Civil as a Rebel General named Lando Calrissian would be a Baron Administrator on Bespin.
Darth Vader forced Lando to set a trap on Han Solo, Leia Organa, C-3PO, and Chewbacca.
This trap would lure Luke Skywalker to the gas giant so Vader could carbonize Luke and send him to the Emporer.
Lando would eventually betray Darth Vader and set the group free; this heroic act would see him joining the Rebel Alliance.
Promptly after, he would be promoted to General and help destroy the second Deathstar.

After the Battle of Endor and the death of the Emporer, the Anoat sector would be the first to get rid of the Empire's reign, soon joining the Alliance of Free Planets, which would later be reformed to become the New Republic.
