# Introduction

A planet known as E’ronoh could be found inside the Outer Rim Territories, located within the Eiran system.
The system this planet was in also happened to be a hyperspace waypoint.
However, Eiram, the twin planet of E’ronoh was also interested in being control of this waypoint, causing both planets to compete with each other until entering into a war.
During the High Republic Era, members of Directorate, an organization that worked for the Hutts captured two individuals that were extremely important for both E’ronoh and Eiram.
This caused both of the worlds to ask assistance from the Jedi Order.
Once the crisis had been solved, both sides began improving their relationship.
They also allowed the Republic to build the Starlight Beacon inside their system.
