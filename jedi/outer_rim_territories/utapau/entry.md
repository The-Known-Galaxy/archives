# Introduction

Utapau is a planet located in the Utapau system, found in the Outer Rim Territories’ Tarabba Sector.
It is a rocky and remote planet, with gigantic sinkholes littering the planet’s surface.
In these sinkholes lived the Pau’ans and the Utai, collectively known as the Utaupauans, who both called Utapau their homeworld.

# Section 1

Utapau orbits a singular sun located 51,000 light-years from the core and has nine moons orbiting itself.
The planet itself is comprised of a small molten core with a rocky mantle and a calcareous crust.
Only 0.9% of Utapau’s surface is water, but below the crust is a vast underground ocean that has surrounded the planet.
This subterranean ocean was formed when the surface oceans that once covered Utapau leaked away through the large caverns that once were magma chambers.
Due to the erosion caused by these oceans leaking through the planet’s crust, giant sinkholes formed in the planet’s habitable, windswept savannas.
The mineral deposits that resulted from these sinkholes acted as a major source of wealth for Utapau’s residents.

Utapau is a peaceful world, and its residents always attempted to remain neutral in times of galactic war and conflict.
It is home to two symbiotic sentient species, whose ancestors settled the planet sometime after 57,000 BBY.
30 percent of the planet’s population consists of the Pau’ans, a thin, grey-skinned, lethargic race that acts as port masters, patricians, and bureaucrats; while the other 70 percent of Utapau’s population consists of the stout Utai, who act as the working class.
Originally, these two races lived independently of each other, with the Pau’ans living above ground and the Utai living down underground.
However, in the 10 thousand year period before the start of the Clone Wars, Utapau’s shifting climate caused the hyperwind storms on the planet’s surface to grow more intense.
This caused the Pau’ans to retreat underground.
In turn, both races reestablished connections with each other, and soon their sinkhole-dwelling communities developed considerably; and both species' architectural styles mixed into what is now known as Ossic, where animal bones were heavily used to support and build their cities that hid on the crevasses and ledges of Utapau’s many sinkholes.
And to fuel these large cities, many windmill farms were constructed on the planet’s surface, serving as the source of 99% of the energy consumed by Utapauan communities.
However, this didn’t result in both societies completely cooperating immediately.
At first, the mixed populations were divided into city-states that occasionally skirmished and held small wars with each other.
But with the effort of Utapauan nobles such as Timon Medan, all of these cities were brought together and unified.

# Section 3

Utapau, despite its constant attempts to remain neutral, has been the site of numerous battles during numerous wars.
During the Clone Wars, their hand was forced in joining sides with the Separatists when the Master of Port Administration at the time, Tion Medan, was taken hostage by General Grievous and the Separatist Council.
If Tion were to call for any assistance, Grievous threatened to retaliate with the destruction of Utapau’s capital, Pau City.
Luckily for Tion, Jaing and Kom’rk Skirata located Grievous on the planet and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi went to Pau City to launch an ambush on the Separatists.
With Tion having secretly given him the location of Grievous’ Droid Control Ship “Unlimited Projection,” Kenobi was able to catch Grievous off-guard.
With support from Commander Cody’s 212th Attack Battalion, a detachment of the 501st Battalion, and local Utapauans, Kenobi killed General Grievous and won a decisive victory against the Separatists, marking the end of the Clone Wars.
However, upon the issuing of Order 66 and the Declaration of a New Order, Kenobi’s clone troopers made an attempt on his life, which forced him to flee Utapau.
Afterwards, the clones rounded up the members of the resistance movement, which included Tion Medan, and deported them to Byss, where they were used as servants for “recolonizing.”

Later, the Galactic Empire established a secret storehouse on Utapau, which included artifacts such as Grievous’ remains and his modified Bellbullab-22 starfighter.
In 0 BBY the planet was predominantly controlled by the Fey Family, and there was some Rebel influence still remaining on the world.
However, the Zann Consortium, an underground crime syndicate, had the opportunity to corrupt Utapau.
They planned to do this by sending Nightsister Silri along with a detachment of Defilers, a pair of Missile Attack Launchers, and droideka Mark IIs to kidnap the head of the Fey Family, Garnak Fey.
They believed this would force the Utapauan Government to cooperate with the Zann Consortium, and make them meet their demands.
Once the Galactic Empire’s downfall started after the Battle of Endor, Utapau was one of the first worlds to join the New Republic, in an attempt to avoid being caught up in another war that could result in the Utapauans being dominated by outside forces again.

However, during the Second Imperial Civil War, the remnants of the Galactic Alliance, led by Admiral Gar Stazi, built a base on Utapau after their victory on Mon Calamari against the Sith-Imperial forces.
And following the Devastation of Da Soocha the Sith made their way onto the planet as well, when Sith scientist Vul Isen and Darth Azard set up a secret laboratory to study the planet’s flora and fauna to poison them and the Alliance; and they also planned to send an assassin to murder Gar Stazi.
However, the Sith’s plans were thwarted by Jedi Knights Wolf Sazen and Cade Skywalker, along with Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue.
Syn and Blue took care of Isen’s assassin, who was an Alliance Guard that was paid off by the Sith, Azard was mortally wounded by Sazen in a duel, and Isen herself was bisected by Skywalker before her plans of poisoning the planet came to fruition.

# Section 5

Since before the Clone Wars Utapau was one of the worlds that had an arms embargo restriction placed on it by the Trade Federation.
Therefore, the Utapauan’s local defense fleet was centered only on downsized warships, most of which were designed and manufactured on Utapau itself; including a variant of the Rendili StarDrive Dreadnaught.
This ship was capable of offering protection from pirates and marauders, but in terms of battleships, it was fairly outclassed by those made by rich, industrialized sectors.
As an example, Utapau’s Dreadnaughts were merely one-fifth of the size of a Lucrehulk-Class battleship, and all of these dreadnaughts were destroyed by invading Separatist forces.

Yet on the other hand the Porax-38, Utapau’s main starfighter, was a tough long-range snubfighter that was designed for Utai pilots and could make extended interstellar patrols that lasted up to twenty days.
These ships saw good use when the scattered Utapau Skyforce rallied to face the Separatists alongside Republic forces during the Battle of Utapau.
And in addition to mechanical vehicles, the Utapau Skyforce also utilized dactillions; native flying reptiles that can carry riders into battle.
