# Introduction

Ryloth was a planet in the Outer Rim from which the intelligent race of the Twi’leks descended.
It was also known as Twi'lek, and Twi'lek Prime.
It was located on the Corellian Path and was also the beginning of the Death Wind Corridor.
It had five moons and was the second satellite of its mother star with an orbit time of 305 standard days.
On one side of the planet remained illuminated all the time, and on the other side there was eternal night, which, together with the shape of the surface, led to an inhospitable, barren climate.
The wind speed on Ryloth reached 500 km/h.
There were also murderous fire storms that threatened to destroy all living beings.
The inhabitants of Ryloth lived in cave complexes in these regions, where temperatures remained so high that they could live without extensive life support systems.

# Section 1

Ryloth was discovered as one of the first worlds of the Outer Rim.
Around the year 10 000 BBY the planet entered the structures of the Galactic Republic.
Since then, the illegal trade with them as servants was started, and the Twi’Lika dancers were particularly popular.
After some time, the possession of Twi’lek became a sign of property status.
Around 4800 BBY a mineral called Ryll was discovered on Ryloth, which is one of the most valuable and illegal spices.
The Twi’lek were at a relatively low stage of civilization development, therefore they were easily influenced by rich companies or pirates.
Its capital was a permanent city of Kala’uun.
Despite its unfriendly climate, Ryloth attracted masses of immigrants.
Most of them were servant traders or gangs who wanted to make money by selling Twi’Leks or mining Ryll.

# Section 2

Despite the harsh climate, there were many species of animals and vegetation on Ryloth.
All the forests were jungles full of dangers.
Among the best known predators are Iylek and Daoshim, which posed a great danger to the inhabitants.
Because of the winds, the majority of species living on the illuminated side had to adjust and seek shelter from the storms.
