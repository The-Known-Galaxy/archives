# Introduction

Zygerria was a planet that served as a homeworld for a species known as Zygerrians, it was located inside the Zygerria system in the Outer Rim Territories.
Most of the planet’s terrain consisted of plains, mesas, and a good number of valleys.
For thousands of years, the Zygerrian Slave Empire was in control of the planet, and many of the cities and fortresses were built by the slaves.
However, the slave Empire was eventually taken down by the Jedi Order, it did not take long for it to collapse from its glory afterward.
While Zygerria was mostly known for being a slavery world, many annual podraces were hosted on the planet even during the Queen’s rule.
After the slave Empire had collapsed, Zygerria attracted many visitors and tourists, the fortresses built by slave labor were a sight to see.
