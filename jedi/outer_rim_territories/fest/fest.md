# Introduction

Fest was a primary planet located in the Outer Rim Territories of the Atrivis Sector.
It was inhabited and was home to humans.
It was a densely populated planet with steep, rigid mountain ranges and valleys and was covered with ice throughout the planet.
During the Cold War, which was the Galactic Republic vs the Sith Empire, there used to be a climbing tournament with a promise for the person who climbed the Mountain Of Fest the quickest.
Around the time of the Clone Wars, there was a research center set up where Sprik Metal was being developed.
Omega Squad came in, raided and destroyed it later 10 months into the war.
The planet was then ravaged by a civil war and people from the planet of Mantooine.
The people of Fest were rebellious to the Galactic Empire.
Fest later housed an Imperial Base.
