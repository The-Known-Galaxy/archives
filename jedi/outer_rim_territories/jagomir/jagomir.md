# Introduction

Jagomir was a humid planet located in the Jaga’s Cluster which is located somewhere in the Outer-Rim Territories.
The planet is covered in animals and plants yet most are dangerous, there are also no known sentient species that originated from the planet.
It is a planet consisting of land and sea, with 7 continents and almost 75% swampland.

# Section 1

The planet was used for the Rebel base after they had to abandon Arda I due to the traitor Var Narek leaking the location of the Arda I base.
After the Arda I attack 306 Rebels landed on the planet with most of them either Human or Bothan.
The planet was quite hard to build a base on until they found a mountain area to build on.

# Section 2

The mountain that they inhabited also turned out that it used to be home to a pirate base yet it seems like the base wasn’t inhabited during the Galactic Civil War due to it being in utter disarray.
It’s thought that it was most likely inhabited during the Republic Era or the Clone Wars Era because the base was beyond repair due to age.
