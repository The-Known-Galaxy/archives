# Introduction

Rannon, a forest planet located within the Instrop Sector of the Outer Rim.
Rannon was the third closest orbiting body from its star and had two moons.
A single revolution around the star took 380 days, in local time; one day lasted twenty hours.
The planet had a population of ten million, both Humans and Rodians alike, with a governing body of a cooperative council between different settlements.
The population maintained a society of space-level technology that was similar to the rest of the galaxy.
With the exports of foodstuffs and gems, outside of this however, there were no notable resources.
Rannon has an interesting history after the end of the Galactic Empire and the birth of the New Republic.
4 ABY, Dark Jedi Danaan Kerr, a madman, settled the planet within the Valley of Ternaax as a simple hermit.
The dark side of the Force had caused a revelation in the Dark Jedi of Palpatineâ€™s survival in a clone body.
This caused the corruption transforming the Valley of Ternaax.
This came to the attention of General Airen Cracken after hearing rumors of such.
