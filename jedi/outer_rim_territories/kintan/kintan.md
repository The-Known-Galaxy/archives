# Introduction
The world of Kintan  is located in the system of Kintan, in the Si’Kaata Cluster, on the Ac’fren Spur, within Hutt space, in the Outer Rim Territories.
The official languages spoken on Kintan are Nikto and Huttese.
Kintan was the original home of the Kintan striders that were taken off world to be used as pets and guards for the Hutts before the planet's pollution and other natives of the planet, the sentient species Nikto, and their hunting habits of the creatures drove them to extinction.
Kintan’s harsh planetary makeup was described with “rivers of fire and sand of ground glass” by the Jedi Alaya Secura.
The planet had vast mountains, deserts, swamps, forests, and magma fields.
The Nikto, the sentient species of the world, evolved into five subspecies after the supernova M’dweshuu had exploded.
Three of these species are more known: the green-skinned Nikto known as the Kadas’sa’Nikto, the lavender-skinned Nikto known as the Esral’sa’Nikto, and the red-skinned Nikto known as the Kajain’sa’Nikto.

Besides the Nikto and Kintan strider, the Kintan crusher is also native to the Kintan.



# Section 2
In 26,000 BBY, the Nikto species, the sentient species of Kintan, formed a violent cult, worshipping the nearby supernova - M’dweshuu.
The cult was called the Cult of M’dweshuu.
Circa 25,130 BBY, the Cult of M’dweshuu came to power over the planet of Kintan and drove the world into four gruesome civil wars.
Thirty years later, circa 25,100 BBY, with the four wars nearly over with, the Nikto became permanent indentured servants of the Hutts under the Treaty of Vontor.
Roughly 24,000 years, circa 1000 BBY later the Nikto cultists were able to drive the Hutts off of Kintan for a brief time.



# Section 3
During the Cold War between the Sith Empire and Galactic Republic circa 3653 BBY, Nikto miners uncovered ancient cave paintings, which they assumed were made by pre-civilized Nikto.
Some time thereafter, historians were sent to study the paintings and interpreted them as describing the four violent civil wars the Nikto had tens of thousands of years before.
The paintings showed worshipping of an honored warlord named Da-Shek Yalaa.
For many years after, the Morgukai warrior tradition was born on Kintan among the Nikto elites, separating themselves from the other Nikto.
Circa 30 BBY, an exiled Twi’lek by the name Kh’aris Fenn lived in the Kh’aris Fortress on Kintan guarded by the last two remaining Morgukai known as Bok and Tysr.
The pair kidnapped a Twi’lek heir named Nat Secura and brought them to the fortress where the heir was then rescued by the Jedi and Tysr killed in the process.
The last Morgukai, Bok, was killed on Saleucami along with his army of Morgukai clones supplied by Count Douku, during the Galactic Republic's Outer Rim Sieges



# Section 4
Kintan joined the Republic twenty years before the Clone War broke out with direct representation in the Senate, however, in reality the senators who represented Kintan were ultimately the mouthpieces of the Hutts who still held strong control over the planet and the Nikto species.
As the Clone War started, Kintan faced yet a new wave of violence between the Nikto cults making the Sisar Run hyperspace trade route particularly more dangerous than it already had been running through Hutt space as is.
In 26 ABY, the planet was taken over by the Yuuzhan Vong, a sentient species that is known to have originated outside of the galaxy.
During the Vong occupation over Kintan, 75% of the Nikto were either killed or enslaved, driving the rest of the population into hiding in the harshest areas of Kintan.
After the war with the Vong had ended, the Niktoand planet slowly recuperated to their former states.
