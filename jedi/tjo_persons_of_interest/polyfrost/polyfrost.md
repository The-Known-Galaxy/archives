# Introduction
Jedi Master Polyfrost joined the Jedi Order on the 17th of January, 2022.
Her reasoning for joining the Order was because of a friend, Flare, who was consistently seen playing daily.
Poly initially joined for this reason but chose to stay because of her interest in the combat and youngling classes.
She also believed the community was welcoming to newer members.
Polyfrost has served the Jedi Service Corps for much of this time as an Instructor and eventually Head of Advancement.

# Section 1
Originally a Padawan to the former Jedi Master EnvyNix, Polyfrost would learn most of what she knows from the current Jedi High Councilor Vanestc.
Van would be assigned to Poly as her mentor within the Jedi Assault Team.
Poly would learn many things from her mentor during this time; such things include how to efficiently use a form that was infamous for being one of the worst at the time, as well as helping Poly understand how our Order’s specializations work in tandem with each other to benefit the Order’s progression.



# Section 2
Vanestc eventually convinced Poly to join the Jedi Praeceptors within the Jedi Service Corps.
Initially hesitant, Poly would be convinced, thus kick-starting her career in the organization.
Poly would show resilience and a love for the Jedi Service Corps, growing and teaching throughout her time there.
Eventually, her efforts would be rewarded as she was given the rank of Master and a temporary seat on the Council of Reassignment on the 21st of July, 2022.

Poly could only do a little as a Councilor on a temporary seat.
However, her work would truly begin as DercyeNix, the former Head of Advancement, would step down, leaving an empty permanent seat as the Head of Advancement on the 18th of September, 2022.
As the Head of Advancement, Poly overlooks and manages the Jedi Service Corps.
This ranges from all students, Mentors, and Instructors; Poly is directly responsible for managing this path to Knighthood.
As a permanent Councilor on the Council of Reassignment, Poly would be directly linked with the Service Corps due to the majority of specializations under the council hailing from the Service Corps.
Poly’s time as Head of Advancement has seen her change the organization many times, including the progression system.
Previously, Initiate IIs were locked to a phase system, and to progress, they would first have to pass the previous phase.
In Poly’s eyes, this was redundant and did not provide much freedom, so instead, she would remove it for an open curriculum where the Initiate IIs could take any class at any time.



# Section 3
Poly and Van had reworked the Jedi Service Corps, and it had worked.
One of her most recent changes to the Jedi Service Corps was the addition of the Padawan Training Course.
Originally a running joke, this course would hold its first class on the 12th of February, 2022.
The course would exist to teach new Knights how to train their Padawan best.
It went through each of the three Jedi Service Corps classes but was revamped to prepare Padawans for Knighthood specifically.
