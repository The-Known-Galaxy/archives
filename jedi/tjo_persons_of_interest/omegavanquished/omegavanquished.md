# Introduction
OmegaVanquished was a recognized member of the Jedi Order who was respected for his dedication to the Jedi Order, and his eminent leadership as the fourth Jedi Temple Guard Commandant.
Omega did not only achieve Temple Guard Commandant, but also Jedi Master and Councillor of Reconciliation.

# Section 1
OmegaVanquished joined the Jedi Order alongside a friend of his, this was during the dawn of its golden age, on October 26th 2020.
During the time Omega joined the Order, progression was based on competence.
This is why he essentially traveled through the hierarchy rather quickly.
OmegaVanquished became a Temple Guard Instructor two weeks after he joined the Temple Guard; became a Temple Guard Captain two months after, and a Commandant a few months later.
When Omega was Temple Guard Commandant, his responsibilities were rather simple; it was to report to the Chief of Security and lead the Temple Guard in his own image.
Omega’s regime mostly focused on expansion and management.



# Section 2
OmegaVanquished found his master, SparrowElysee, one week after he passed his Crystal Gathering.
Throughout Omega’s tenure in the Jedi Order, he was only a Temple Guard.
“My time in the division was honestly the best times I have ever had on the platform, notably during that 2020 era.
Serving under and with some of the greatest leaders and companions was a blast, and it is hard to put in simple words how great that age really was.” Omega made his journey with various people, but notably, those who stood out were AxisMorningstar, who attended the same Crystal Gathering as Omega and FNTSlat, an individual who Omega joined the Temple Guard with.



# Section 3
The one award Omega received, was  the Jedi High Council Excellency Award, which was originally called the Jedi High Council Competence Award.
However, it is not the award that means much to Omega, the bestower does.
Omega was awarded by a former Master of the Order and Chief of Security Vermened.
“Vermened without doubt is the most influential figure I have met here, and working under and with him has been a thrill throughout the past two years.
He has served as a role model, and a great friend.”

OmegaVanquished spent his entire time in the Temple Guard and around 10 to 11 months as Senior Command.
“But it was not the position that was meaningful, it was the people that I worked with.
KingBurayden, Joelbloxx, VexillumUsh (now known as KennaexMalvern), Authenticryan2222, ExcubiarumTenebris, Vermened and many more allowed me to experience a tenure unlike any other in this community.”
