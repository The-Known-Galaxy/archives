# Introduction
Jedi Master ColdLazyMia, now known to many as Elder Mia, was a proactive individual both for and within the Jedi Order.
From her time as a Padawan to her time as Head Artisan, she always had a proficiency for the work she did within the Order, and is admired and respected by many of her peers.

# Section 1
ColdLazyMia joined the order on November 5th, 2020, after she was recommended it by her sister, who saw a group ad for the Jedi Order.
She first got to experience the Jedi Sanctum, where many people that had already inhabited the group for awhile helped and guided her throughout her first few experiences within the Order.
Though she briefly lost interest in pursuing the Order when she reached the rank of Youngling I, she returned later in the year, eventually reaching the rank of Jedi Knight in March of 2021 on an account named lyraez, though with the permission of the Jedi High Council, she returned to the account she originally started on, ColdLazyMia.



# Section 2
After reaching the rank of Jedi Knight, Mia was quite unsure of what she wanted to do next, she didn’t think herself to be proficient in combat or writing.
Following the advice of her friends, she decided she wished to be a Jedi Artisan, due to her inclination to host trainings for the Younglings.
On May 5th, 2021, she took and passed her Jedi Artisan trials, officially reaching the rank of Advanced Jedi Knight.



# Section 3
In the beginning of her time as an Artisan Mia did not host Crystal Gatherings very much but soon after hosting a few, She began to love hosting Crystal Gatherings and grew to enjoy them.
Around this time, the Head Artisan introduced two new ranks to the Artisans Assembly, which where those of Senior Artisan and Assistant Head Artisan.
 She at the time held the rank of Jedi Instructor in the newfound Jedi Academy, where she helped build the Academy Database we know today.
When the two new ranks were introduced, she was then appointed as a Senior Artisan due to her proficiency in hosting Crystal Gatherings as of that time.
Aspiring to reach Assistant Head Artisan, she gave herself a goal: Reach 100 Crystal Gatherings, and to her surprise, she accomplished this goal.



# Section 4
When she was a few months into her tenure as a Senior Artisan, the Head Artisan departed the specialization, leaving the seat vacant.
On October 2nd, 2021, she was messaged by Jedi Master PoH to join the Jedi Temple on Ossus, where she would notice herself at the rank of Jedi Master, and that day be appointed to the rank of Head Artisan for her profound work within the specialization.
She, like her tenure within the Jedi Academy, helped make the first Artisan Database, providing a lot of the helpful resources and formatting that the Jedi Artisans use to this day.
Though she found a lot of enjoyment in the role of Head Artisan, many personal problems had started to affect her work abilities for the post, so on February 14th, 2022, she resigned from the post of Head Artisan, cementing herself as one of the true founding members of the specialization, and a stepping stone for the Head Artisans after her time.
