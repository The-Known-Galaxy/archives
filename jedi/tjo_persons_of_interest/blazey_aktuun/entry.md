# Introduction

28th of October, 2020.
On this ordinary Wednesday, someone quite extraordinary would enter the arms of the Jedi Order.
An individual that goes by the alias of Blazey would become something special.
Upon joining, she realized that combat was not her specialty.
With this acknowledgment, she looked to follow a different route; lore.
Following this endeavor, she became a Lore Keeper and worked within the Jedi Service Corps.
Her task as a Lore Keeper was to ensure all students in Phase I successfully made their way to Phase II.
Not long after, Blazey found herself becoming the Chief Lore Keeper, securing her place as a Minor Councilor.

Blazey had initially struggled to find someone who would take her as a padawan.
Having no Jedi Service Corps back then would make it difficult for individuals who couldn't find a Master.
Thankfully, she had become friends with SpartanMorningstar, who at the time was a padawan.
Spartan promised that if Blazey had no Master by the time they became a Jedi Knight, he would take Blazey as his Padawan.
The inevitable had arrived, and Spartan kept to his promise.
Soon after, Blazey would eventually become a Jedi Knight.
Throughout her journey, Blazey would raise several padawans, most notably former Master of the Order WolfSupport and former Jedi High Councilor reyrosky.

From here, Blazey spent around three months as a Knight before finally becoming a Consular, having the Caretaker ValSenko take her trial, which she describes as the most worrying 10 minutes of her life.
As noted earlier, Blazey's chosen specialization was Lore Keepers, now known as Jedi Seers.
She worked arduously, with her efforts paying off and being selected as the first Chief Lore Keeper.

# Section 2

Upon Blazey's unretirement from Jedi Elder, she was reinstated as a Jedi Master.
With the unretirement, she had the task of joining a specialization.
Blazey settled with becoming a Jedi Sage under the Council of First Knowledge.
Blazey's duties consist of ensuring the temple's safety and healing Jedi if need be.
Her other duty is within the Librarian’s Assembly, with her role being the Oversight of Article Production.
This entails ensuring all individuals within the Librarian’s Assembly are writing the articles they claim.
This aforementioned task is instrumental to the success of the Librarian’s Assembly, as it guarantees the continuation of produced articles.

"Sometimes a road is bumpy, and trying to advance without combat may seem hard.
But it isn't the combat that makes a knight or a master.
Combat can be learned from others, but attitude and how one acts cannot.
Focus on how you act and present yourself.
Find your balance." - Blazey
