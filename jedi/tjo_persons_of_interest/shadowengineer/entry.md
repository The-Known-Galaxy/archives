# Introduction

ShadowEngineer, also known as Shadow, is publicly known for his commitment to the Jedi Order as a Jedi Architect, as well as an active Jedi Master.
He also holds a long record of service in the Temple Guard division, holding the rank of a Captain at the time of writing.
Along with his unique path of rank progression in the Order, he is an open and experienced person with many talents and qualities.
He has been a member of the Jedi Order since August 2021, and he certainly is not getting discouraged by his work.
He loves computer science, enjoys listening to music as well as creating his own, and is a long-time Star Wars fan.

# Section 1

Shadow’s journey within the Jedi Order began on the 11th of August 2021, when he joined the Order as a Force-sensitive, having seen one of his friends on the Jedi High Council.
On the same day, he passed his Basic Newcomer Training and began his journey in the Order.
Shortly afterward, he saw the Temple Guards on duty and decided then and there that joining them would be his goal.
As an Initiate, he did not hesitate much before joining the Jedi Service Corps to prepare for his Knighthood Trials.
Shadow quickly advanced to Phase IV, the final phase before graduation, displaying the ability to learn quickly.
Although graduating from the Jedi Service Corps may have seemed like the next goal to achieve, Shadow decided that his expectations towards the organisation had not been fully met.
He left the Service Corps in search of a more suitable path.
He did not have to wait long.
Fortunately for him, his activity and potential were recognised by catawack2, a Jedi Consular, who gladly accepted Shadow as his Padawan.
The two shared a friendship and a rewarding bond between a teacher and student.
They also found a common interest in programming, which made this bond even stronger.
After around a month of training, Shadow underwent his Trials and passed with satisfying results.

# Section 2

Unlike many others, ShadowEngineer had already thought about the Advanced Jedi Knight Specialisation he wished to join after becoming a Jedi Knight.
After around three weeks, he attended a Temple Guard tryout and passed it on his first try.
His career in the Guard began on the 17th of December 2021.
To this day, Shadow is still eager to supply the division with his insights and skills.
Because of his decision, Shadow lacked the occasion, and the willingness, to ever train a Padawan.
This does not mean that he has not had any teaching opportunities since then.
Instead of training with a classic Padawan, Shadow decided to increase his commitment to the Temple Guards by taking part in mentoring a new generation of Candidates to the rank of Guardsman.
During his time there, he mentored four Candidates and aided each of them with their progression within the Temple Guards.
His first trainee, TheRamiBlox, has reached the rank of Warden and is still an active member of the division at the time of writing.
These mentorships were a great factor in strengthening Shadow’s bond with the Temple Guards.
This bond never wavered, even as he was awarded the rank of Captain.
Along with the ability to lead his fellow Guards into battle, organise events, and support the division from a more administrational perspective, he also was able to gain one of his best memories since he joined the Order.
This memory is a day when he would lead a team of fifteen Temple Guards during a rally.
Together, they worked as a team and defeated their enemies, having fun with each other the whole time.
To this day, Shadow mentions this experience as one of the most unifying moments of his time in the division.

It is worth mentioning that along with his career in the Temple Guard, ShadowEngineer also developed himself as a member of the Jedi Order.
On the 30th of September 2022, he was awarded the rank of Jedi Master for his commitment as both a developer and a Temple Guard.
His work as a Jedi Architect, alongside Nidoxs and SolarHorizon, taught him much about creating, programming, game development, software engineering, and systems architecture.
He is currently serving as a Sith Architect.
His position allowed him to collect beneficial feedback and perspective from both Jedi and Sith, which can only support him in adding various improvements to the game, as well as fixing bugs and introducing many new features.

# Section 3

There is no doubt that ShadowEngineer is an interesting person, whose unique experience as both Temple Guard and a developer is not something commonly met.
As a Jedi Master, he is a candidate for the public Jedi High Council seat at the time of writing, along with his plans to pursue the rank of Commandant in the Temple Guard.
One of the philosophies that motivated and encouraged him to put in the effort and work towards his goals was the honest pleasure of seeing his actions’ effects from a first-hand perspective.
He also found it very inspiring to see other people get excited and happy about the results of his work.
As Shadow stated, “Hearing the phrase ‘oh this is so much nicer now’ lights a fire of a kind of flame in my heart that nothing else in life has managed to do, and that makes all the work worth it.”

He also shares three pieces of wisdom that helped him in his journey:

“Nothing ever has a sole reason.
Every outcome is a product of multiple factors, and the best problem solvers find all of them."

"Positive is only positive because negative exists.
Without the negative, positive has no meaning.
Without the positive, negative has no meaning.
Every coin and every war has 2 sides.
It is for this reason that an open mind is a powerful tool."

“Read books.
Why take 5 years to learn from your own mistakes, when you can take 5 weeks or 5 days to learn from someone else's entire life of mistakes.
