# Introduction

The ninth Battlemaster of the Jedi Assault Team and last Chief Lightsaber Instructor, Maravia_Strak is a Jedi Master and Permanent Councilor of Reassignment well known for their determination and skilled management of the various areas of the Order they’ve been involved in.
Starting out as a Force Sensitive on the 26th of September 2021, Mara initially joined the Order to quench their curiosity about the Order’s progression system, as part of their quest to find other Star Wars-related groups to take part in.

Mara reached the rank of Initiate just three days after; due to their pre-existing duties as a Jedi Councilor in Askavix’s Jedi Order, however, they halted their rank progression until February 2022 when they joined the Jedi Service Corps on the 28th, after their retirement from Askavix’s Order.

“My time within the Jedi Service Corps opened my eyes to how well organized and looked after the Order was, and the various opportunities open to those who graduated from it.
The moment I joined the Service Corps, I knew that was where I was meant to be.” Mara passed their Trials of Knighthood on the 8th of March, just ten days after joining the Service Corps.

Being enamored by the lightsaber combat system on Ossus at the time, as well as the attention to detail and magnitude of the temple, Mara was drawn to the Lightsaber Instructors ever since becoming a Service Initiate.
As a result, once they passed their Trials, they immediately began working on the requirements for their Advanced Knighthood Trials.
However, due to a change in leadership of the Lightsaber Instructors at the time they were eligible to take their trials, Mara’s aspiration was brought to a hiatus.
In the time since they have trained and raised three Padawans to Knighthood: Local_HD, AlexiusNoctis and Ghostly_KarambySW.

Growing “impatient” with waiting for their Lightsaber Instructor trials, Mara decided to join the Jedi Peacekeepers in order to “see what else there is to offer”.
Although failing their trials initially, they were finally promoted to an Advanced Jedi Knight on the 6th of April 2022, when they officially joined the Peacekeepers.
However, Mara ended up spending just two weeks in the specialization; the reasons being cited as a lack of motivation and a feeling of being unsuited for the work that the Peacekeepers did.
They felt that the Peacekeepers’ style of diplomacy before action was not suited to their liking - hence, Mara ended up transferring to the Council of Reassignment, passing their trials and joining the Council as a Lightsaber Instructor on the 22nd of April 2022.

“Being a Lightsaber Instructor…, I thoroughly enjoyed my time there - I was very committed to the Service Corps and I learned a lot about Lightsaber Combat from it, which really was my aim from the start.” Mara’s commitment to the specialization and the Service Corps as a whole earned them the esteemed position of Jedi Master on the 10th of July 2022, followed by the title of Chief Lightsaber Instructor on the 31st of July 2022, two and a half weeks after attaining the rank of Master.

Mara has since then earned numerous positions and accolades for their extensive work within the Jedi Order and the Council of Reassignment.
They have been the recipient of the Jedi High Council Excellency, Leadership, and Combat Excellence awards - but Mara feels that the latter is the one that matters most to them.
“My motivation to stay in this Order has always sparked from lightsaber combat, and being the best duelist I can be.
My goal was to be recognised for that, and that is exactly what I have done.” Mara is one of the few individuals to have held a prestigious seat on the Jedi High Council, occupying the 12th chair on the 17th of September 2022 and serving for two months.

Their love for combat and dueling is what led them to join the Jedi Assault Team on the 19th of March 2022, quickly rising up the ranks to become a Vindicator.
Honing their combat skills in the Assault Team led to them securing third place in the Duelist of the Order competition for April 2023.
Wanting to gain new experiences in the Order, though, Mara joined the Librarian’s Assembly on the 7th of July 2023, where they ranked up to Scholar.
Alongside these already time-consuming positions, Mara aids the Known Galaxy community as a whole as a Community Moderator, Senior Beta Tester for future projects, and Senior Apparel Advisor.

“The awards and titles are simply accolades that allow me to do the job I believe needs to be done… Everything else that I possess, is a means to an end.
I am the Chief Lightsaber Instructor because I care for the Jedi Service Corps, and I want to do whatever I can to help it run.
I am a Jedi Assault Team Vindicator because working with others that are as passionate about combat as I am is what I enjoy the most, and I believe I have a good analytical thought process to assess situations and come up with solutions to them.”
Owing to the structural changes made to the Jedi Service Corps and the Council of Reassignment as a whole, the Lightsaber Instructors were one of three specializations from the Council to become defunct, making Mara the last person to serve as the Chief Lightsaber Instructor.
She ended up trading one position for another, though, and was made the ninth-ever Battlemaster of the Jedi Assault Team on the 5th of October 2023 - a position well deserved.
