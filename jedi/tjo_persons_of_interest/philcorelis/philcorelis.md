# Introduction
PhilCorelis was a respected member of the Jedi Order who was recognized for his dedication to the Jedi Order, and his exceptional leadership as the sixth Jedi Temple Guard Commandant.
Phil did not only achieve Temple Guard Commandant, but also Jedi Master and Councillor of Reconciliation.

# Section 1
PhilCorelis joined the Jedi Order on the Second of February, 2021.
Phil joined the Temple Guards roughly a month later.
He climbed the ranks to Temple Guard Captain around August due to complications with the Temple Guard command at the time.
After a few months he became the Temple Guard Commandant on January 15th, 2022.
Phil’s responsibilities were making sure to create and maintain an elite division of law enforcement authorities whilst having a small, close-knit community that enjoyed being in the Temple Guard.



# Section 2
PhilCorelis had only been in the Temple Guard.
However, before he joined the Temple Guard, he was trained by his Master, YokRockefeller, who was also a friend of his.
Phil himself had trained around four to five Padawans.
Phil really enjoyed his time in the Temple Guard.

Combined with Phil’s previous experiences leading and building Temple Guard, he finally had a chance to make what he felt would be a worthwhile Temple Guard.
“This group had owners and contributors who were willing to let the Temple Guard Command make decisions and improve the group, so I was able to get to work and set standards that are still held to this day.”



# Section 3
PhilCorelis made his journey alone, which was a little painful in the Temple Guard according to him.
However, Phil started to branch out to people he had seen after he became a Jedi Master.
The former Temple Guard Commandant received the Jedi High Council Excellency and Leadership award for his great work in the Temple Guard.
“I felt as if the awards were unnecessary, as I was doing what I felt was needed, while the position meant a lot.”
