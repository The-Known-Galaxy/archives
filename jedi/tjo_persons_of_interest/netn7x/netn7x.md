# Introduction

Fourteen months ago, on July 18th, 2021, Netnix took his first steps within the Jedi Order.
Despite quitting Roblox three years ago, his close friend KittNix returned from Basic Training in the United States Army.
Kittnix suggested that their friend group consisting of SayianLannister, SebbNix and Netnix join the group to check it out and have some fun over summer break.
The four planned to stick to their friend circle and chill by themselves, but that did not go as planned.
Little did they know, they ended up branching out through the Order and creating long-lasting friendships outside their initial group.
Netnix has gone on to achieve greatness and received many awards for his dedication and faithfulness to the Jedi Order.
He has been awarded the Jedi High Council awards for activity, combat excellence, general excellency, and leadership.
The path of Jedi Master Netnix is one for the archives for all to learn from and aspire to replicate.

# Section 1

Netnix quickly rose through the Youngling ranks and became the Padawan of KittNix.
On August 12th, 2021, Padawan Netnix ascended to the sacred rank of Jedi Knight after passing his Knight Trials.
Net first thought he wanted to continue his journey in the Order as a Lightsaber Instructor in the Jedi Service Corps, under the Council of Reassignment.
However, about a month later, Netnix ended up taking his Advanced Jedi Knight Trial to become a Jedi Praeceptor, though working within the Service Corps anyways.
Net worked hard, put in the hours, and quickly became a Jedi Instructor within the Jedi Service Corps a month later, though his time as a Jedi Praeceptor would come to a close a few weeks afterward.
After two months of service as a Praeceptor, Net decided to pursue his initial goal and transferred to the Lightsaber Instructor specialization.
A quick week later, Master FloatYouuurBoat announced that Netnix had ascended to Jedi Master.
Unfortunately, Net was burning out from the Lightsaber Instructors behind the scenes.
He wished to find something with a lot of variety and little repetitiveness.
Four days later, Master Unite5000 inquired if Netnix was interested in becoming the Chief Investigator, with the backing of Master Float.
Net considered this proposition very extensively as it was a field that he was interested in pursuing in his real life and would bring something fresh to experience within the Order for his burnout.
However, with great humility, Net chose the honorable path and requested to become a regular Jedi Investigator instead in order to learn the ropes of the specialization.
Netnix quickly discovered the disorganization, lack of collaboration, and lack of a clear vision within the specialization.
He began creating a list of changes to revamp the Investigators.
After sending these suggestions through the proper avenues, Unite, Excub, Float, and iSing decided to put their faith in Net and appointed him as the Chief Investigator on December 13th, 2021.
Thus, he began his journey to overhaul and reorganize the Jedi Investigators to achieve their mission and goals for the good of the Jedi Order.

# Section 2

Netnix has been Chief Investigator for over ten months now.
When he began his tenure as Chief Investigator, there were about 130 cases completed.
As of this biography, 187 more cases have been completed during his ten months.
In celebration of the Investigators surpassing a whopping 300 cases, he hosted a Discord Nitro giveaway to celebrate all the hard work of his faithful, dedicated employees.
Netnix’s favorite aspect of being the Chief Investigator is hard to pinpoint.
First and foremost, he loves the people he leads and believes “they are some of the most competent and well-rounded individuals a leader could ask to work with.” The environment within the specialization is quite open and friendly.
Teamwork is everything to the Jedi Investigators under Master Net.
His second favorite thing would be his ability to ensure this community is kept safe and friendly.
Being able to lead the charge against malicious and negative acts is very sacred to Netnix.
He strives to keep everyone in the Order accountable.
Not only does Netnix love to ensure his specialization is up to standards, but he is also always looking to recruit into the Investigator squad.
For those aspiring to become a Jedi Investigator one day, Net recommends you are “always ready to write, listen to people, and be good at analyzing reports.” Out of the 300+ cases that the Investigators have completed, only the reports with sufficient evidence backing them up are included.
Many reports do not end up having a strong enough reason or charge, so they end up being dismissed.
Occasionally, a warning will be warranted in place.
Being reported in itself does not guarantee a tribunal will occur; instead, it is up to the analysis and expertise of a Jedi Investigator to make that decision.
Netnix believes it is imperative to be cautious in deciding whether a report goes to a tribunal, as it can tremendously affect someone’s career within the Order.
As such, he recommends people interested in joining the specialization have an open mindset and always be open to different points of views.
The best way to demonstrate interest would be to reach out and start asking questions to any Investigator!
The specialization may sound very intimidating with a lot of hard work, but Net believes anyone can excel if they put in the effort.

# Section 3

Netnix did not stop his path to greatness as Chief Investigator.
On January 30th, 2022, Master Net got elected to one of the two month rotating seats on the Jedi High Council alongside his friend and mentor, Master Float.
Following the conclusion of his two-month term, he and Float were appointed to the two six-month Semi-Permanent Seats.
While serving in this prestigious position, Net has provided insight and opinions on all matters brought to the Jedi High Council’s attention.
He also ensures he considers the voice of his fellow Jedi when stating his views.
In the meantime, Master Netnix had been a highly skilled and hard-working member of the Jedi Assault Team division, which he joined with his good friend SayianLannister on the First of September, 2021.
They both progressed in combat for a bit until Sayian went to focus on school.
Net concentrated primarily on improving combat with force movements, utilizing low-flips heavily for an agile playstyle to confuse his opponent and get cheap hits while his opponent was off guard and incorporating multi-hits into them.
While improving his combat, it led Net to his main form Ataru, which he thinks is the best form.
He has ascended to the high rank of Captain currently and served under five Battlemasters.
He strives to recruit skilled fighters into his team alongside fellow Captain Vanestc through tryouts and raids for the division.
Additionally, no matter how high up he climbs, he always remembers that Initiates are the future and create the backbone of the Order.
As such, he has taken a whopping twenty-one Padawans throughout his time, being, IstroNix, rice_paddies, MellOTR1, Perio_Laxima, PsychNix, Pure_Rebirth, TuskeNix, ValiosNix, Joopnix, TalziNix, CaitlynNix, his son GalaxyNix, GleamzFroston, VaaSerrus, Misscripto, AnnieElder, VayuNix, VoltexNix, illusant, CammNix, reyrosky, AbsxrdNix and yuni1700.
Many of his Padawans have gone off and achieved great things, from becoming part of his Jedi Investigator specialization to becoming Jedi Masters, becoming renowned fighters, and more.
Netnix has hosted every Duelist of the Order since November, 2021.
He attained the Jedi High Council Combat Excellence Award after barely losing to RileyOnika in the April Duelist of the Order semi-finals.
“Combat was a very good stress reliever for myself, and those that practiced with me heavily were some of the most chill times in the Jedi Order.” Finally, all the hard work paid off for Master Netnix on September 17th, 2022.
Following Master Unite’s retirement into Jedi Ghosthood, Grandmaster TiberiusMalvern announced to the Order that Net would be ascending to the top.
Netnix had made it to Senior Councilor of the Council of Reconciliation.
After leading the Investigators out of darkness into the light, Master Netnix will now have the opportunity to strengthen and lead his minor council alongside Chief of Security ExcubiarumTenebris into its next era.

# Section 4

It is no secret that Master Netnix has bountiful wisdom to spread to every member in the Order.
His lasting message he hopes everyone takes to heart is that “everything happens for a reason.” He quit Roblox due to his disinterest and desire to separate from the platform, but his own Jedi Master, KittNix, drew him back to Roblox.
Had Netnix not returned, he would have missed out on so many friendships and happy memories throughout this past year.
Net is very loyal to his friends and hold the following very dear for all their support and friendship: vanestc, PrimeSicarius, AlrightyAdrian, GutsNix also known as MarcosMalvern, RahmNix, TuskeNix, AbsxrdNix, LxthalNix, Solito1020, DercyeNix, GleamzFroston, JakesNix, “Inesnix (my son)”, CammNix, SeniorNix, JoopNix, RileyOnika, kurtnicolo, Unite5000, Flare_Valentine (Flate), Kybrenic, FoxtrotMalvern, reyrosky.
