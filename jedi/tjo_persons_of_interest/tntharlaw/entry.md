# Introduction

Initially joining the Jedi Order in 2020, TntHarlaw, or Tnt11223344tnt as he was known then, would stay as a Force-sensitive for quite a while.
However, in May 2021, Harlaw decided to progress in the Jedi Order to find an escape from his day-to-day life.

Throughout his time, Harlaw had achieved many ranks, even reaching the head of his respective Specialisation, the Seekers.
As a Jedi Master, Harlaw would refuse to participate in competitions around the Order as he preferred to focus solely on the Seekers over any other division.

# Section 1

Harlaw has been in the Jedi Order for over a year; during this time, he has reached the rank of Master and led the Seeker specialization through its most challenging moments.
Harlaw has also raised many young Padawans to the noble status of Jedi Knight.
However, Harlaw believes that a Master must prepare their Padawan for their Knight Trials, teaching them everything the Master knows.
They do not have a claim over their Padawan and should treat them as friends and mentorees.

# Section 2

As the head of the Seekers, Harlaw helped reform the specialization through a difficult time.
Currently, the Seekers reside on the Council of First Knowledge.
However, they were previously on the Council of Reassignment, helping with Initiates in the Jedi Service Corps.
The Seekers would also be responsible for keeping hold of any data relating to the Order.
The Jedi High Council removed all of their previous duties during the transfer to the Council of First Knowledge.

After the move, Harlaw would be responsible for helping reform the Seekers, moving them in a new direction, and creating the Galactic News Network, or GNN for short.
He also assisted with recreating the Council of First Knowledge in a way that represented their specializations and divisions instead of ruling over them.

# Section 3

Eventually, TntHarlaw would retire on the 7th of July, 2022.
A controversial retirement but ultimately a needed retirement.
Harlaw, along with the Council of First Knowledge, decided that for the Seekers to carry on working efficiently the way it was, a new head would have to be appointed.
Initially deemed unworthy of Elder, this would eventually change.
Retiring as a Jedi Elder with many accomplishments, he would step down from the Seekers and the Council of First Knowledge.
