# Introduction

AnimatedEcrux was a revered member of the Jedi Order who was remarkable for his fidelity to the Order and his tight and robust leadership.
On the 30th of October 2020, Animated joined the Order as a Force Sensitive.
His reasoning for joining the Order was self-discovery and a friend, OmegaVanquished.
Both of them joined the Temple Guard within a month of each other.
Animated stayed in the Jedi Order because he wanted to help others, and after stepping down as Temple Guard Captain, he was eager to help the Order in some other way and fill a gap.
Animated has not only been a Temple Guard Captain, but has also had a seat on the Council of Reassignment as Head Seeker, Head of Advancement for the Jedi Service Corps, and Deputy Editor of the Jedi Chronicle.

# Section 1

Animated became a Padawan, but disowned his master, Jedi Knight pololemon, due to pololemon's inactivity.
He then joined what was then called the Jedi Academy, the forerunner of the current Jedi Service Corps.
Animated took part in a few classes but ultimately chose to leave the Order.
However, he joined the Order again a day later to pursue another master.
As a Padawan, Animated tried out for the Temple Guard and successfully joined the division.
He was one of the few Padawans who were able to join the Temple Guard before the requirement changed to Jedi Knight and higher.

Upon joining the division, he was forced to disown his master.
After joining the Temple Guard, Animated obtained a mentor but asked to be arranged with a more active and experienced one.
He was then assisted with the Trials of Knighthood and Trials of the Guard by the infamous former Chief of Security, ExcubariumTenebris.
The Trials of Knighthood took place on the 13th of January 2021, while the Trials of the Guard took place on the 28th of January, 2021.
“I bounced from one master or mentor to the next.
My lack of training with my Jedi Knight masters taught me to be self-sufficient.
My training with my Temple Guard mentors taught me discipline and a thorough understanding of the laws and workings of the Order.”

# Section 2

During Animated’s time in the Temple Guard, he only mentored one person to complete their Trials of the Guard.
However, he trained at least five Padawans after he left the Temple Guard.
“And anyone who was an Initiate II under my leadership of the Jedi Service Corps, I view as my own, too.” While AnimatedEcrux stayed in the Temple Guard, he progressed up to Temple Guard Captain at one point.
However, he stepped down around a week later because he felt he did not meet the criteria to stay as Temple Guard Captain.
Animated stepping down allowed ExcubariumTenebris to rightfully progress in the Temple Guard.
Animated remained in the Temple Guard as a Warden until he left and was granted the rank of Jedi Master for his efforts in the Temple Guard.

# Section 3

After leaving the Temple Guard, Animated decided to join the Council of Reassignment as a Jedi Seeker.
He eventually became Head Seeker on the 15th of May 2021, he also led the Jedi Service Corps from the 12th of May to the 19th of September 2021.
Animated also joined the Librarian’s Assembly on the 6th of May, 2021.
He advanced to the rank of Archivist in the Librarian's Assembly and was later promoted to Librarian.
Unfortunately, his promotion did not last long, as the Caretaker of First Knowledge at the time demoted him back to Archivist because the Chief Librarian made the decision without consulting the rest of the leadership.
Animated remained in the Librarian’s Assembly as an Archivist until he retired.
He wrote, edited, and revised over 30 articles, but he is most proud of his “Great Jedi Purge” article.

# Section 4

Animated's greatest accomplishment was a complete reform and revival of the Jedi Seekers.
He provided numerous helpful documents, including ones for Knights and other Order members, as well as Padawan mission records, Jedi Service Corps mission documents, and path progression posters.
He not only imparted his knowledge to Knights but also shared his expertise with Masters, educating them on the intricacies of the Order.
In his prime, Animated cherished the Jedi High Council Activity Award he received for his dedication to the Jedi Service Corps and the Council of Reassignment.

Overseeing the Jedi Service Corps and witnessing the transformation of eager Initiates into Jedi Knights brought him great joy.
Together with his team, they taught them not only the ways of the Orde,r but also how to be exemplary Knights.
Some of these Knights even went on to become Masters.
Although Animated was not officially their master, he made every effort to support them throughout their journey, considering them just as important as his own Padawans.
“I just wish I had been recognized for my efforts within the Temple Guard.
Many people don’t know or have forgotten I was a Temple Guard.”

# Section 5

During his time as a Head Seeker, although he loved the position, it became burdensome as he struggled to find a purpose for the specialization's existence.
To his surprise, many Knights joined the specialization, which thrilled him.
Animated was also part of the original cohort of beta testers for Ossus, along with other now-notable members, where he helped Nidoxs and the leadership at the time by bug-testing and suggesting ideas for the game.
At that time, he used the username "anitaanil" but later changed it to "AnimatedEcrux" after leaving the Temple Guard.
Unfortunately, the "Ecrux" bloodline dwindled soon after Animated joined it.

AnimatedEcrux retired on the 19th of September 2021, due to commitments in life.
