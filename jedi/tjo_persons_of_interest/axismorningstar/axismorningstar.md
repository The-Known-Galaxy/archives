# Introduction
AxisMorningstar joined the Jedi Order on October 26, 2020 because he had many comrades from Morningstar in the Jedi Order; he also highly appreciated what the Order had to offer.
He had made commendable contributions to the Order during his service and is currently in the position of Jedi Elder, and as a Ghost of the Librarian’s Assembly.

# Section 1
As a Padawan, AxisMorningstar was under the teachings of Vyravagous, also known as RavMalvern or VeneficusTemenos who is now a Darth in the Sith Order.
Through AxisMorningstars career, he has taught and raised several Padawans each with successful careers which goes to show how successful AxisMorningstars teaching methods must have been.



# Section 2
Throughout his career, AxisMorningstar has been in key roles.
He was a member of the Jedi High Council in which he made it his priority to make sure those who work hard were recognised for their service and as a Sage Master he made sure the Sages upheld their responsibilities to protect those who couldn't protect themselves on the front lines against the Sith.


He was also a Gate Captain in the Temple Security Force before it was disbanded in 2022 in which his role was similar to his role as Sage Master, to protect those who couldn’t protect themselves at the Gates on Ossus.
He was the Curator of Records which oversaw all promotions and the Librarian’s Assembly entirely, alongside Chief Librarian Cannon, but as a Jedi Elder and Ghost of the Assembly, he simply advises the current Sage Master and Chief Librarian.
 

“In this Order there is no true route to success.
You need to find something that you are good at as well as enjoy and excel in it.
Give your best to the order and you will be recognized for it.
The road can be long, boring, and tough.
But at the end of the day it’s worth it.”
 - Jedi Elder AxisMorningstar
