# Introduction
Vanestc was a recognized member of the Jedi Order who was renowned for her dedication and leadership.
Vanestc joined the Order on the 15th of September, 2021.
Vanestc achieved not only the position of Jedi Assault Team Captain, but also the rank of Senior Councilor of Reassignment on the 22nd of April, 2022; overseeing the Jedi Service Corps and a permanent seat serving on the Jedi High Council as a Jedi Master.
Vanestc has also received high praise in the form of the Jedi High Council Activity and Leadership awards.

# Section 1
Joining on the 15th of September, 2021, Vanestc started her journey as a Padawan where her master AbsxrdNix genuinely the biggest role model and great friend was.
After Knighthood, where she trained roughly 8 Padawans to Knighthood, Vanestc continued her journey as Jedi Watchman on the First of November, 2021 serving under the Council of Reassignment.
She ended up becoming a Jedi Master and the Head Watchman exactly one month after, on the First of December, 2021.


Unfortunately the specialization was removed on the 11th of January, 2022, but Vanestc was put as the Head Praeceptor and tasked with overseeing Phase III aka the Leadership Phase of the Jedi Service Corps.
After spending some time as Councilor of Reassignment, Vanestc eventually left to become a Jedi Investigator, serving under the Council of Reconciliation on the Ninth of March, 2022.
One month later she was invited to join the Jedi High Council for the remainder of the Rotating Public Seat, as well as being invited to become a Senior Councilor of Reassignment on the 22nd of April.
Vanestc was nowhere near as confident as she was as Councilor of Reassignment.



# Section 2
Vanestc has said that she did not expect to be put in charge of a specialization or get awarded for her work, let alone sit on the Jedi High Council.
She has gone on an amazing journey with Senior Councilor of Reconciliation Netn7x, Former Head of Advancement AbsxrdNix, Head of Advancement Polyfrost, Battlemaster DercyeNix, Head Praeceptor OceanDemici, Jedi Knight JoopNix, Former Head of Advancement AustinVKaril and a lot more people but they simple cannot all be named.
There were people in The Jedi Order who did have faith in her and trusted her with positions that would have been far outside her comfort zone.


Being out of her comfort zone, Vanestc was able to work on specializations and divisions she cares for, to change things for the better and meet some amazing individuals along the way.
Vanestc has said that she gets to run the Council of Reassignment alongside some of the most talented people she has ever met within the Order, which is something she is still incredibly grateful for.
While out of her comfort zone, Vanestc was also able to work on her main Lightsaber Form, Soresu, which she says is "easily the best form in the game."
