# Introduction
Having been in many notable positions, reyrosky was a renowned member of the Jedi Order.
He has served in several divisions, ranging from the Temple Security Force to the Jedi Assault Team, all the while doing his best to leave a positive impact.
Undoubtedly, he has been one of the most significant contributors to the community.

# Section 1
Reyrosky became a part of the Order on the fifth of May, 2021.
He joined the Jedi Order as he and his friend, FoxtrotMalvern, were bored of other ROBLOX games.
This led to the duo becoming invested in the Star Wars genre, eventually discovering the Jedi Order, in which they would each play a major role.
He would then train under Blazey_Kitsune as her Padawan and progress in the Order.
Following that, he would come to bring up two Padawans - his friend, FoxtrotMalvern, and AeIithia.



# Section 2
Having a deep interest in combat, compounded by his being in the Jedi Assault Team, reyrosky would become a Paladin for his first specialization.
Following the retirement of then Head Paladin, SanctusTenebris, reyrosky would take over and be inducted into the Council of First Knowledge.
As a Councillor of First Knowledge, he would spearhead the creation of the Path to Knowledge class that is still used to this day.
Moreover, he would attempt to give Paladins a role within the Order, which they had lacked.
Unfortunately, his efforts were short-lived, as the specialization was shut down.



# Section 3
After the shutting down of the Paladins, reyrosky became a Peacekeeper under the Temple Security Force, once again trying to find a role for them.
His time in the Temple Security Force would see the retirement of Gate Master VexillumUsh.
Due to this, Masters Unite5000 and iSingTooMuch would grant reyrosky the position of Gate Master.
Taking this chance, he remade the entire Temple Security Force Discord server, introduced squads, and implemented Sages into the division for assistance.
This was all in a bid to improve the division.
Not long after reaching the rank of Gate Master, reyrosky would also attain the position of Vindicator in the Jedi Assault Team.



# Section 4
While serving as the Gate Master, reyrosky would see himself as a nominee for the publicly-elected Jedi High Council seat.
He would ultimately succeed in becoming a member of the Jedi High Council.
As a High Councillor, he would try to implement many things to improve the group - rank evaluations, clarification on what Instructors are, and so on.



# Section 5
Alas, albeit understandably, reyrosky would retire from the Jedi Order once his term as a Jedi High Council member ended, leaving behind a significant legacy.
It was during this time that Vermened had requested for reyrosky to join the Dark Council to assist in building the foundation of the Sith Order.
However, realizing how burnt out he had become in The Known Galaxy, he refused and stepped away from all responsibilities in the group.



# Section 6
Reyrosky’s time in the Order under many positions has given him invaluable wisdom.
He wishes for members of the Order to “always have fun here” and not “focus on climbing the rank ladder” so that they can do what they want to do and enjoy their time.
