# Introduction

Twin_vv joined the Jedi Order in November of 2021 because of his interest in Star Wars, as well as to join his friend AxisMorningStar being there and due to his enjoyment of Star Wars, but unfortunately, he left in February of 2022, and yet again came back fully in December of 2022 and give the Jedi Order another shot.

# Section 1

Twin had shown huge dedication to only one specialisation, the Jedi Seers.
He journeyed from the rank of Seer to Senior Seer, to Associate Chief Seer, and then to the rank of Chief Seer on the 25th May 2023, because of the departure of DylanMalvern.
He gained this rank due to his hard work throughout his interim period and his dedication since becoming a Jedi Seer.
During Twin’s time as Chief Seer, he welcomed many people to the specialisation and transformed it into a little community where everyone felt welcomed.

# Section 2

Twin had met many new friends during his time as Chief Seer, one of the most best people he met were JowsDemici, Vanestc, and Polyfrost.
JowsDemici assisted and motivated him during his time in the Jedi Order, and he has become an amazing friend to Twin.
Vanestc and Polyfrost were great leaders of the Jedi Council during Twin’s time in the Order, and they generously assisted him during his first days on the council.
However, his most notable friend in the Jedi Order was AxisMorningStar as he got Twin to join the Jedi Order and assisted him within the group.
He also helped Twin reach the rank of Mentor in the Jedi Service Corps.

# Section 3

Due to the unfortunate removal of the Jedi Seers, he later took up the role of Head of Advancement, now named Taskmaster.
Twin has revamped the Jedi Service Corps greatly.
He has opened the Jedi Service Corps to Knight and above, allowing them to be able to teach there.
Another key change he brought to the Jedi Service Corps was creating more of a community for Mentors, Interns, and Instructors, allowing them a comfortable place to talk and have fun.
Some additional changes Twin brought included: weekly meetings, boosting community engagement, and making the  Jedi Service Corps into a better organisationthan it was before he started making changes.

# Section 4

Twin hosted a job fair on the 2nd of December 2023, where he assisted all specialisations in advertising, and allowed them all a chance to shine so they could possibly gain more members.
At the end of the job fair, Twin announced his retirement and finally took the rank of Elder.
