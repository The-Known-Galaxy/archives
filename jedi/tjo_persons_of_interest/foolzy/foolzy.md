# Introduction
Foolzy is a recognized member of the Jedi Order for his dedication and renowned leadership.
On February 28, 2022, Foolzy served as the Headmaster of the Jedi Academy, occupying a seat on the Council of First Knowledge.
Three months later, Foolzy occupied the 11th seat on the Jedi High Council and served for two months.
Throughout his career, he was awarded the Activity, Excellency, and Leadership Award by the Jedi High Council.

# Section 1
On December 4th, 2021, Foolzy joined the Sith Order as a Hopeful due to the influence of his cousin, Redjaal.
Soon after, he transferred to the Jedi Order.
When Foolzy joined the Order he was ignorant and not prepared for his journey as a Jedi, Foolzy was not interested in hosting trainings at first.
But after Jedi Knight ThosapBrawl trained Foolzy to Knighthood, Foolzy was given the chance to be supervised by an Academy Instructor.
Foolzy was all about showcasing his creativity and willingness to help the Jedi Order.
That was the time when he found his purpose which was to become the best Academy Teacher he could possibly be.
Foolzy believed that hosting a training for a Youngling would start their journey to becoming a Jedi Knight.
Through this mindset, nothing held Foolzy back.
He even was the first Academy Teacher to host 100+ Youngling trainings as a three-week-old Teacher Foolzy also broke the record for most trainings hosted in one day, which was twenty, as well as the most Youngling Trainings hosted which was 316.

After Knighthood, Foolzy began his journey with the Jedi Sages on the 29th of December, 2021 under the former Sage Master AxisMorningstar.
Foolzy’s main reason why he joined Sages was that he liked to help people and the ability to heal.
Foolzy had many plans and ideas for the Sages that he would love to offer.
The Sage Handbook used to be just writing and a few paragraphs about Sages itself.
Now, it is something more with Foolzy’s knowledge behind the tips and tricks for healing.
Under Sage Master Inesnix, his leadership they were able to create the Sage Trainings where Sages will gather once a week to learn about the art of support.
Not only this, but Foolzy also created the Sage Database Spreadsheet with the assistance of Sage Master Inesnix.



# Section 3
Once the Academy Instructor applications were open, Foolzy took the opportunity and applied immediately.
After becoming an Academy Instructor, he made sure he asked as many questions as possible as he believed he will make little to no mistakes if he was to do so.
As Academy Instructor Foolzy was in the open water, he had the opportunity to prove his worth as an Academy Instructor.
That is why he supervised 15 trainings in his first week.
After this, Foolzy’s next step was to become an Assistant Headmaster so he could share his thoughts on the training guide.
When he became the Assistant Headmaster, Foolzy asked a question to the team about the duties of an Assistant Headmaster.
He was then given a database and a monthly review.
After one month, Foolzy became the Headmaster of the Academy, with his first order of business was to hire Assistant Headmaster that deserve the position.
After Foolzy hired his Assistant Headmasters, they began the massive change throughout the Academy.
One of those changes is that former Assistant Headmaster DementedDroid created the Academy Spreadsheet which Foolzy revamped to what it is today.
The Headmaster of the Academy Foolzy believed in “working hard to work less.” If Foolzy put in the maximum amount of effort, everything will soon run smoothly, like a flowing river.
Being the Headmaster of the Academy, Foolzy makes sure everyone is tended to including himself as Headmaster hosting Youngling trainings, displaying to the Academy team that he is there for them.



# Section 4
Foolzy was given an opportunity to see what it was like as a Jedi High Councilor as the 11th Jedi High Council temporary seat of the Order.
This opportunity was an amazing experience for Foolzy.
He loved interacting with the community regarding law changes and community-based updates.
As a Jedi High Councilor, Foolzy had the chance to delve deeper into confidential topics.
Not only this but Foolzy was also given the opportunity to help recognize all the Academy staff’s efforts to host through the Jedi High Council.
This two-month experience was a big eye-opener to what the Jedi High Council has to deal with on a daily basis for Foolzy.



# Section 5
Throughout his time within the Jedi Order, Foolzy had a very unique way to select his future Padawans.
From January to March 2022, Foolzy hosted a Padawan Trial every time he was short on Padawans.
Foolzy would take the Initiates through three different trials: Trial of Lore, Trial of Combat, and Trial of Scenario.
Each Trial had a specific location within the Great Jedi Library on Ossus and was all scored up to an overall number of 30.
The Initiates with the highest scores would become the new Padawan of Foolzy while giving the other Initiates to spectators if there were any.
The newly appointed Padawans of Foolzy would join a top-secret Padawan server he owns where the Padawans would be given a step-to-step guide on where to start with their Knight Trial document, essentially making Foolzy’s work easier in the long run.


Foolzy would also host Padawan Combat Training where they would go through some practice rounds with his Padawans; after the practice rounds, he would teach them some combinations on how to duel properly.
Once the Padawan Combat Training is complete, the Padawans will come out three times better than they were before.
At one point, Foolzy had four Padawans during his time as Jedi High Councilor.
Though this was when Foolzy had a mental breakdown as he had too many duties in The Jedi Order.
During his time training Padawan, he learned that not giving his all will only let him down.
Foolzy has trained 31 Padawans throughout his career.



# Section 6
Throughout Foolzy's career, he has hosted events such as “The Great Youngling War” which was an event for Teachers to host the most trainings, “Initiate Scout Event” which is where Initiates showcase their skills for an opportunity to be chosen by Jedi Knight or above as a Padawan and the “Jedi Order Wide Hosting Event” which is where all Academy Teachers, Instructors, and Jedi Masters compete to host/supervise the most Youngling Trainings/Uncertified Teachers/Knight Trials.
Foolzy made these events to bring activity back to the Order and help the community thrive once again.
