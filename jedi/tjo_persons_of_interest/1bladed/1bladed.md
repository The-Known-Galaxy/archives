# Introduction

1Bladed joined the Jedi Order on March 15th, 2022.
Bladed found himself joining the Order as a joke with his cousin, 3Bladed.
Bladed eventually grew to respect, and enjoy the system of the game, and the beauty of the architecture; so he decided to remain in the Jedi Order and take it seriously.
The ranks Bladed has held and currently holds are Councilor of First Knowledge, Jedi Master, Head Mystic, Senior Academy Instructor, Instructor, Jedi Mystic, and Jedi Knight.
He has also been rewarded with the JHC | Excellency Award, JHC | Activity Award, JA | Medal of Activity, and JA | Performance Award.

# Section 1

Bladed became the Padawan of HermesPrice on April 12, 2022.
Unfortunately, HermesPrice was arrested, demoted, and eventually left the Order.
Because of this, the duty of raising Bladed to Knighthood successfully was passed down to Jedi Master ValiantPrice.
Bladed completed his Padawan training and became a Jedi Knight on April 28, 2022.
Bladed has successfully trained three Padawans to the rank of Jedi Knight, two of them reached Jedi Instructor and the third one became an Artisan.
Though he had multiple Padawans in the past, they left in the middle of their training due to boredom.

“He was rather patient with me as time went on.
We would run around the temple to take pictures as a way to practice joy as a way of teaching me virtue without really telling me, which I think is nice in the end.
During training, he would guide me on what to do and give me tips on how to improve.
He would always let me know if I was showing improvement as we trained and was patient with and told me that I could take my time.
He practically taught me virtue while I was his padawan without even realizing it, even now looking back, that was probably nice to learn virtue while under his wing.
He taught me skills that I needed that prepared me for being a teacher and an instructor as well.” - Jedi Instructor GREENSRROW

# Section 2

Bladed successfully passed the Jedi Mystic trials on May 14th, 2022.
He still serves as a Jedi Mystic and has been part of the Mystic specialization since its reform from Jedi Arbiters.
“My time as a Mystic has been a rewarding one.
I was always very fond of hosting classes and teaching to new and old members within the community.” - 1Bladed

Bladed was added to the Senior Academy Instructor team on June 28th, 2022.
He was granted the rank of Jedi Master a few months later, on December 31st, 2022.
Shortly after, he was appointed as Head Mystic and Councilor of First Knowledge, on January 20th, 2023.
As a Jedi Master, his responsibilities are maintaining a good and friendly environment within the Order, making sure that everyone’s needs; whether that be new players or veterans, receive the proper treatment.
Bladed’s duty as Head Mystic is pretty simple, he oversees and runs the Jedi Mystic specialization under the Council of First Knowledge.
As a Councilor of First Knowledge, he must represent his specialization on his seat on the Council of First Knowledge, and become part of the Order’s governing body.

# Section 3

1Bladed mainly progressed through the Jedi Order alone, but he had close friends that he made on the way that made his progression so much more worth it and valuable.
Friends like Jedi Masters Justine and MousePrint, and his former Padawan, Jedi Mystic GREENSRROW.

“The awards that I have obtained show my devotion and performance as a hard worker within the community.” - 1Bladed
