# Introduction

Unite is a well-known member of the Jedi Order who was renowned for his dedication and leadership.
Unite joined the Jedi Order with his friend on the Seventh of November, 2020; during the 2020 quarantine, Unite joined the Order for fun and dedicated a large portion of his time contributing to its legacy.
Unite5000 achieved not only the position of Senior Councilor of Reconciliation, but also Jedi Consular, Jedi Sentinel, the Jedi High Council Kindness, Excellency and Activity Award.

# Section 1

When Unite joined the ranks of Jedi Knight on the 30th of December 2020, he was very interested in the process of writing articles for the Grand Archives, and he always wanted to be an official member of the Librarian’s Assembly.
That is why he became a Jedi Consular because, back in his time, individuals had to be a Jedi Consular to write articles.
Unite was not only in the Librarian’s Assembly but also in the Jedi Assault Team.
After two to three months, Unite realized that he had made a mistake, because he could not fit in with his fellow colleagues as Jedi Consular.
That is why he decided to find a new specialization where he could contribute more.
These were the Jedi Investigators.
Unite prepared, re-took his Advanced Jedi Knight trials, and passed on the Second of March.
At first, Unite was a Jedi Recruiter; he recruited over 500 people that joined the Order.
When that phase passed he had finally got ranked to Jedi Investigator after being accepted by former Senior Councilor of Reconciliation ZestyTrev.
During the time Unite was a Jedi Investigator, he learned how to work as a team with people around the globe and how to patiently work and wait for it to be recognized.
After two months as a Jedi Investigator, Unite was promoted to Jedi Instructor on the 15th of May, because of all the work and effort he gave in every possible way.

Unite5000 has trained over 20 Padawans.
Some of them reached the rank of Jedi Master, such as Jedi High Councilor Truenks and Jedi Master GutsNix, also known as MarcosMalvern.
Unite puts effort not only in the Padawan branch but also in the Librarian’s Assembly.
He wrote over ten articles.
Unite also put effort into the Jedi Service Corps, where he hosted leadership classes for many individuals who made it to the rank of Jedi Master.
After a week as Jedi Instructor, Unite got promoted to Jedi Master and received a seat on the Council of Reconciliation as the Chief Investigator.
After Unite accomplished everything he wanted, he saw opportunities to rise, such as the Jedi High Council Temporary seat.
He was known as the “Chill Jedi Master that always helps everyone,” so Unite had a good chance at the elections.

Unfortunately, Unite was not considered capable of upholding the responsibility of the Jedi High Council Temporary seat because he was still a new Jedi Master.
However, Unite was lucky; after two weeks, a permanent seat of the Jedi High Council had to retire.
That was the moment when the Jedi High Council invited Unite and the Master of the Order KennaexMalvern to replace the Temporary seats, which they did great.
After the period Unite was on the Temporary councilor seat, he rejected a re-election because he wanted to give other individuals a chance to be on the Jedi High Council.
After one month,  the Jedi High Council proposed to Unite and former Chief of Security iSingToooMuch the honor of being a Senior Councilor of Reconciliation.
Their responsibilities were to look after the Council of Reconciliation, but iSing was more responsible for the Temple Guard, while Unite was more responsible for looking over the Council of Reconciliation.

After some time passed, iSing retired.
A new Chief of Security had to be elected.
The candidates were the Council of Reconciliation representatives.
Unite was offered to be the new Chief of Security, but he rejected any offer.
Instead, Unite chose ExcubariumTenebris to take such responsibility, because he was the Temple Guard Commandant for over six months.
Excub was deemed not only a great leader but also a good friend that always cared for his co-workers and for his people.
For over a year, Unite has been in his position; he has seen a lot of changes, many people left, and new people came up with new ideas.
Unite5000 mentioned that the group's most significant attribute is that the group accepts every new idea and debates on it.
Unite decided to retire, which was not an easy decision, but he had to leave this group behind and focus on his life.
The Jedi High Council celebrated all of Unite's work by granting him the rank of Jedi Ghost as a notable member who left an impact on the Jedi Order.

“There is nothing impossible if you do not try, that is how I earned every role and every award.
Patience and passion were the key elements in what made a simple Jedi knight a Jedi High Councilor.” - Unite5000
