# Introduction
The desire for a clean start to a journey is one that many can relate to.
CannonMalvern is of no difference to this statement.
Cannon’s journey within the Jedi Order began on 04/04/2021, splitting the path from a previous Order to gather himself and push for a better tomorrow and a brighter future within this Order.
Intrigued by the community that the Order held, Cannon took his first steps toward building the foundations of his future legacy by taking an immediate interest in the Librarian’s Assembly, a sheer path from the prior history he had regarding law enforcement.

Taken under by LidaLucifer, Cannon was placed in an unexpectedly autonomous scenario for his Knighthood Trials, where he had to forge his own path due to the absence of the prior mentioned Master, and once he was Knighted, Cannon continued on to forge his legacy and earn an abundance of awards, such as the Grandmaster Recognition, Kindness, Leadership, and Expansive Knowledge awards.

Along with the achievements came an increase in notoriety and rank, garnering the titles of Lore Keeper, Jedi Instructor, every single Librarian’s Assembly title, Novice within the Jedi Assault Team, Division Leader, and most notably; Chief Librarian of the Librarian’s Assembly and a seat on the Council of First Knowledge as a Jedi Master.

Overall CannonMalvern has taken thirteen Padawans thus far and those that made it through have all seen bountiful career paths within the Order thanks to Cannon’s effort in training them.

When asked what kept CannonMalvern going as the Chief Librarian of the Jedi Order, he replied “What keeps me going is the others around me and my leadership team.” 
When questioned on what the main pillars are for the Librarian’s Assembly, he responded with “Community and dedication.” 
When given the opportunity to pass along a piece of advice for newly Knighted Jedi, he provided these words; “Be yourself, and listen to those under you, around you, and above you.”
