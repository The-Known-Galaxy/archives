# Introduction
SciFalded is an adroit and well-esteemed member of the Jedi Order.
He would have his first experience in the Order by visiting Dantooine with GalekVerandus.
Moreover, unlike most in the Order, SciFalded has former experience with Nidoxs, someone he deems a great leader from his time in previous groups.
It was around a year after his first visit that he would receive an invitation from BookZulfor to join the Order, believing SciFalded’s familiarity with the genre would make him enjoy it.
Despite his skepticism, his knowledge of Nidoxs’s involvement would ultimately solidify his willingness to join on the 17th of July, 2021.

# Section 1
SciFalded would begin his journey as the Padawan of someone well-known to him — GalekVerandus.
Following his ascension to Knighthood, he would raise a number of Padawans: the former Jedi Master Shad0wSeer, soggydoggy2019, FastoniTix, BraydenBode, and hshelscott.
He then would become a Jedi Consular, specializing as a Sage — a position he still holds to this day.
It was during this time that he would even become the Scholar of the Order in August, showcasing his deep knowledge and passion in lore.
From the 7th of September to the 30th of September, SciFalded would hold the elevated position of Senior Sage.
Nearing the end of that year, on the 14th of November, SciFalded reached the rank of Librarian in the Librarian’s Assembly.
His efforts within the Order would be recognized in the following year, on January 11th, when he was promoted to the rank of Jedi Master, where he remains today.



# Section 2
As of the present day, SciFalded holds three main responsibilities.
Firstly, he is the Overseer of Historians in the Librarian’s Assembly and participates in Librarian votes regarding new Students and promotions within the division.
He also tries to steer the division in a positive direction through his counsel and ideas, along with assisting the organization of the Scholar of the Order competition.
Outside of the Assembly, SciFalded maintains his Master duties and makes an effort to ensure civility within the group’s communication server.
Lastly, he also participates in Sage deployments on Ossus and Dathomir to medically assist fellow Jedi in need.

A seasoned member of the Order, SciFalded’s words of wisdom are the following:
“Be chill with everyone; don’t take the group too seriously.”
