# Introduction

Jedi Knight AfekLucifer, former Jedi Master, joined the Jedi Order in late 2019.
Throughout his time within the Order, he achieved many great things, gaining many great titles and awards.
Some of these titles include Jedi Master, Battlemaster of the Jedi Assault Team (JAT), Head Weapon Specialist, and later Elder as he retired.

# Section 1

Afek joined the Jedi Order surrounded by fellow friends who had joined before him.
These friends would go on to further his learning throughout the Order, helping him with any problems he had.
One of these friends, CristopherLucifer, went on to further Afek’s learning as they became Afek’s master.

Afek would eventually go on to take on Padawans of his own.
However, after passing their Knight Trials, most of them would go on to become inactive or leave the Jedi Order entirely.

# Section 2

Sitting on the Council of Reassignment consistently for around six to seven months, Afek managed the JAT for this time with no issues internally.
As well as managing JAT, Afek also helped implement enormous changes for the Advanced Jedi Knight path called Weapon Specialist.
These changes made it easier to join as well as easier to understand what the specialization actually did.
Due to his efforts within the Jedi Order and the Council of Reassignment, Afek was made Head Weapon Specialist.

# Section 3

After serving his time in the Council of Reassignment as Battlemaster and Head Weapon Specialist, Jedi Master AfekLucifer retired as a Jedi Elder in October 2021.
Throughout his time in the Jedi order, Afek had achieved a lot.
Without his contribution, Weapon Specialist may not have been the same as it is now.
