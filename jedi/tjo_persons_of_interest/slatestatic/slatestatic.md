# Introduction

SlateStatic is a very well-known member of the Jedi Order who is recognized for his dedication and leadership.
Slate joined the Jedi Order on November 26th, 2021.
He wanted to get involved in a community, in this case, a Jedi group.
Slate saw a friend of his playing as a Sith Knight at the time.
Slate is the Keeper of Antiquities, the second Senior Councilor of First Knowledge.
However, some may know him as a Head Mystic, or Head Arbiter.
He has also been a Lightsaber Instructor and Jedi Paladin.

# Section 1

Slate has really only been in two specializations, he became a Jedi Knight on December 11th and spent two weeks preparing for his Lightsaber Instructor trials.
After passing the Lightsaber Instructor trials on December 28th, he served the specialization for only nine days before transferring to what was a newly revitalized specialization at the time, Jedi Paladins, serving under the Council of First Knowledge.
At the time Slate transferred to Jedi Paladins, which was on January Sixth, the Head Paladin was MarcosMalvern.
Transferring in such a short period of time was technically illegal according to the Law of Conveyance, but they did not realize it until about a month later.

# Section 2

Slate was made an Instructor on January Eighth.
Two days later, the Instructor rank changed to an extra-curricular role, so in complete dismay, he ended up being made Jedi Master on January 10th.
Paladins ended up splitting into Arbiters and Peacekeepers, and the Caretaker of First Knowledge at the time appointed Slate to be the Deputy-Head Arbiter, he served under creation_v1 who was the first Head Arbiter, and laid out the philosophical elements we use today, the Jedi Virtues, Vices, and Principles of Knighthood, along with additional information that Slate did not have officially recognized or published until later.

A few months later, on April 24th, 2022, Slate was appointed Head Arbiter.
It eventually turned to Jedi Mystics, and that was when his duties became focused on building a philosophy to be taught to Jedi Knights-in-training and then developing a curriculum for which Jedi Mystics still use to this day.

# Section 3

Meanwhile, Slate committed the rest of his time to the Jedi Assault Team and rose to the rank of Warrior, which saw him hosting pieces of training within his Squad and for the rest of the division.
Slate’s master was RahmNix, he picked Slate because he was blue, just like Rahm himself.
However, to this day, Slate tries to remind Rahm and his other Padawans that Slate is not like them because he is Chiss and have always been Chiss, not just some blue guy.
His Chiss name is Tes’lat’ethima, therefore his standard galactic name is Slate.
Slate trained two Padawans himself, all the other Padawans he had were inactive.

# Section 4

There was not one particular person that Slate grew alongside, but FallenValiant was one of the first people who welcomed him into the group and in fact Slate modeled a lot of the ideas about what makes a “Good Jedi Knight” off of him and a few other people; such as lucasj26, and SigurdGravidus.
Those people have contributed to Slate’s upbringing early on, and many, many more have contributed since then.
Regarding lightsaber forms, Slate has always preferred Form II, Makashi, and Form VI, Niman.
“Not only am I most accustomed to Makashi, it also just looks "right" for my character's avatar/robes.”

# Section 5

Slate has received a Jedi High Council Excellence Award for his work early on in the Jedi Paladins/Arbiters, and he also received an Activity Award due to his Knight Trial hosts during a time when there was not a lot being hosted.
“My awards truly don't mean a whole lot to me, of course I value them, but I also think there were lots of unrecognized contributions early last year.
That is something I want to be mindful of now that I am on the High Council.
However, my role as Head Mystic was important to me, not so much as the title, but the work I was doing was something that I wanted to do for the 4 months prior as a Paladin and an Arbiter, I wanted to teach the ideas I had to the group because I felt that it was something the group lacked.
To this day I think it still needs some work to make it more effective, but it was entirely about the teaching that I valued in the role”
