# Introduction

Temple Guard Commandant Flare_Valentine joined the Jedi Order on the Third of October, 2021.
The reason she joined the Jedi Order was because of a friend who recommended it.
After she joined, she quickly became motivated to go through the ranks.
Flare_Valentine has been in the Temple Guard since the 8th of December, 2021, and is known as the Seventh Commandant.

# Section 1

Flare_Valentine was originally the Padawan of former Jedi Sentinel XRemusRO, the one who invited Flare to join the Jedi Order.
After Remus transferred Flare to join the Temple Guard, former Jedi Master DivineTemenos took over as her master while she completed her Trials of Knighthood.
Flare did not train any Padawan herself, because she joined the Temple Guard two weeks after she became a Jedi Knight, which was on the 20th of November, 2021.
Despite not having trained any Padawan, Flare did train two Temple Guard Candidates during her time in the division.

# Section 2

Flare_Valentine joined the Temple Guard on the 8th of December, 2021, and has been in the Temple Guard since.
She currently serves as the Seventh Commandant, and Jedi Master on the Council of Reconciliation representing the as the Head of the Temple Guard.
She obtained the rank of Jedi Master with the Commandant title, which she earned at the rank of Warden in the Temple Guard.
This means she skipped the rank of Captain, due to the Sixth Commandant retiring.
As a Temple Guard, Flare was never allowed to receive Jedi High Council awards; however, she has earned Temple Guard awards, including an “Outstanding Officer” award given to her by her Senior Command.

# Section 3

Until Flare got into the Temple Guard, her journey was spent with her friend and master XRemusRO.
In Temple Guard, people came and left pretty often, so she cannot say she had a journey with any one person.
Flare currently serves as the longest Commandant.

“My time in the Temple Guard has had its highs and lows.
I’ve had my inactive moments and moments where I was so active I got burnt out.
The division itself has had highs and lows, in which I have managed to fix during my time.
To this day I continue to work towards a better division and specialization and do my best to make it the best it can be.”

“It means a lot to know I can be trusted with such responsibilities and knowing that my work is appreciated.
It makes my time here feel worth it and gives me accomplishment.”
