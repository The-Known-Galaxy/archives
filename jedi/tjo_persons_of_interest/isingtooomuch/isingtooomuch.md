# Introduction

Jedi Master iSingToooMuch, now known as Elder iSing, was a notable figure within the Jedi Order.
From his time as a Padawan to his final days within this community, iSing was someone that could confidently say that he made a mark on this community.

# Section 1

He joined the Order first in late October of 2020, in what he referred to as the “galaxy-wide” pandemic, a time in which a lot of our members were locked inside due to real-world happenings.
His early days within the order were seemingly simple, he participated in the events required to become a Jedi Knight, and accomplished his task.
As for who his Master was, due to the time that has passed since then.
The Jedi Elder could not recall the name.

# Section 2

The first specialization that the Jedi Elder joined was the Jedi Watchmen.
At the time, the specialization was in it’s first few forms, known as quality-checkers, and seen in very limited numbers due to it’s constant revolving around the lore of the galaxy.
The watchmen also acted as guardians of planets, though since only one existed at the time, this duty was more scarce to the already small-numbered specialization, but nonetheless, the Jedi Elder upheld the duties required of him, and tried to maintain a positive space for his colleagues, himself, and those he protected within the Order.

# Section 3

The Jedi Elder had a notable Padawan he remembered quite fondly, named zanny, he was the only Padawan the Elder could recall completing his training under him, the Elder recalled the experience as eye-opening to the role and dynamic of Master/Apprentice for him.

# Section 4

When the Jedi Elder departed in early 2022, he was the Chief of Security, serving as the First Seat on the Council of Reconciliation.
The Elder had acquired many different titles throughout his tenure, but he was still grateful, and wise of where he came from.

“Cannon, you're my little archive greeter, and you always will be.”
“May the Force be with you, to all who read of my wisdom and foolishness.”
