# Introduction

PrimeSicarius, also known as Prime, joined in the early days of the Jedi Order’s group development and from what has been observed.
He has been accommodating, intelligent, and a logical thinker throughout his time.
PrimeSicaruis works with directing the Council of Reassignment and its specializations, holding crucial titles, and taking immense responsibility for the Order, which he has been doing for two years.
PrimeSicarius joined the organization after wandering across multiple groups but ended up in the Jedi Order.
He was instructed and taught the ways of the force by his former master, TimelessHarmony.
After accumulating Knighthood, Prime went on to take over six Padawans later on during his career.

# Section 1

PrimeSicaruis officially started his journey in the Jedi Order in late August 2022.
PrimeSicaruis was a curious wanderer in the galaxy, joining several different groups until he stumbled upon the Jedi Order.
It caught his eye and fetched his attention.
Prime raided the group for a couple of months and later started growing interest in it.
He decided to start his journey and began climbing the ranks.
The community back then was small but had a significant purpose.
PrimeSicarius was more attached to the blade and combat-oriented activities within the Order.
Due to that reason, he began working with the Council of Reassignment and achieved very crucial titles like Barsen'thor and a permanent seat on the Council.

# Section 2

With these ranks, Prime had many responsibilities, such as making sure the Council of Reassignment and its specializations run smoothly, voicing the community, implementing new ideas for the rest of the Order, illustrating and presenting the Council of Reassignment and its specializations with excellence, and clearing the atmosphere for the people he leads.

PrimeSicarius has contributed a lot to his respective Council.
Reforming and adjusting some areas, mentoring others, and implementing handbooks, regiments, and events.
One notable job he was given was to help decide some roles for the Jedi Service Corps and Jedi Assult Team back when the Council of  Reassignment was in its early stages.

# Section 3

When PrimeSicarius was an Initiate, he was taken under the wing of TimelessHarmony.
His master’s teachings were one of the primary reasons for his success.
He was taught about leadership, and how to endure the blade.
Prime spread these teachings he acquired from his master to the Padawans he trained and instructed.
Some notable and most recent ones are PoH, dire_dread, EternalBlades, Trexori, VoltexNix, and 5PH.

PrimeSicaruis believes that to do extraordinary things in the order of an individual’s career, they must maintain balance, control their sentiments, and stay modest.
Do not let other minds drag them to perform illegal actions because of the fun of it.
They must scent the elements of the world that the eye cannot see.
Construct a stair of the components of failure and have an understanding of why the staircase is not stable.
Do their best to create a bond in the community, and share a laugh.
