# Introduction
adrianbound, formerly known as AlrightyAdrian, was an admired, respectable, and well-liked member of the Jedi Order.
Throughout his time within the Order, he made many lasting impacts and gained numerous recognitions and awards.
He served in many esteemed positions, such as a Temple Guard Officer, Keeper of Advancement, and Head Seeker.
His most notable achievement was being on the Council of Reassignment acting as the longest-standing Battlemaster of the Jedi Assault Team.
During his career, he received the Jedi High Council Leadership and Combat Excellency awards.

# Section 1
Adrian first joined the Order on January 13th, 2021, after being introduced to the group by his older brother.
They both enjoyed the game, atmosphere, and community while they progressed through the ranks together.
Adrian went through the Jedi Service Corps in order to achieve Knighthood.
Although Adrian did not have a formal master, he considered RavMalvern as his mentor.
Rav played an essential part in Adrian’s career, helping hone his lightsaber combat and playstyle.
Adrian was a well-rounded individual, serving under all three minor Councils, allowing him to gain a considerable amount of knowledge and experience.


Adrian joined the Temple Guard on April 28th, 2021.
He served dutifully, eventually achieving the rank of Advanced Jedi Knight.
By showing leadership and dedication, he was appointed as a Temple Guard Officer.
During his time in the Temple Guard, he learned the importance of discipline, holding himself accountable for his actions, as well as how to be a leader.
These lessons helped him prepare for larger leadership positions he would take on in the future.
After leaving the Guard, Adrian wanted to explore the opportunities open to him.
This was when the Jedi Assault Team caught his interest due to how respected they were as well as their purpose and customs.
This, along with the support of his friend Kekansi, convinced Adrian to join the Jedi Assault Team and strive to become the Battlemaster.
To prepare himself for this goal, he would assume other leadership positions, starting under the Council of First Knowledge as an Artisan, then transferring over to the Council of Reassignment as a Lightsaber Instructor.
Once again, his excellent leadership and willingness to take action eventually led him to achieve the position of Keeper of Advancement, where he led and made lasting improvements in the Jedi Service Corps.
He then transferred back to the Council of First Knowledge as the Head Seeker.



# Section 2
The experience and wisdom he gained during his time within these specializations helped prepare and qualify him to become the Battlemaster of the Jedi Assault Team.
Adrian joined the Jedi Assault Team on July 11th, 2021.
He climbed up the ranks and took the initiative when he saw problems.
After the retirement of Skaxon—the previous Battlemaster—he was elected to be the Battlemaster.
He would lead the division through its arguable prime by engaging with the community, making trainings creative and interesting, helping create the Jedi Assault Team’s reputation of having skilled and capable duelists, and overall making the division an amazing place to be within.
One of his goals was to make the Jedi Assault Team hold a sense of community, a place where its members could form friendships and engage with each other while also being held responsible for their actions.


Of course, with every path there are obstacles.
Adrian’s career within the Order was no different.
Being the Battlemaster was no small task, the well-being of an entire division stands upon their shoulders.
When Adrian first became the Battlemaster, the Assault Team went under major changes.
The division limit was raised from 25 to 50 members.
The activity was not the best prior to when Adrian was the Battlemaster, so being able to raise the division capacity was a huge achievement and signaled that activity was picking up.
But at the time there were only three officers within the division, Adrian included.
Hence, there was a lot of pressure on them to navigate these changes.
But with the newfound activity and the excellent problem-solving skills of the officer team, the Jedi Assault Team was able to maintain activity while keeping its standards.



# Section 3
Within the Order, Adrian met many incredible people that helped him get to where he is today.
One of these people was his first Padawan, Floatmanmichael.
They had an excellent Master-padawan bond, both learning from each other and improving themselves together.
Kekansi, MarcosMalvern, and Netnix were also some of the key people who helped Adrian achieve the rank of Battlemaster.

Adrian retired and became a Jedi Elder on September 18th, 2022, due to not having enough time to commit to the group.
He felt that he accomplished everything he wanted to within the Order, allowing him to retire with no regrets.
Adrian was an excellent role model and left a positive impact on many members of the Order.
He paved the way for the future of the Jedi Assault Team, and his impacts are still present within the Order to this day.
