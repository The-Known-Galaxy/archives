# Introduction

ValSenko is a recognized member of The Jedi Order who was respected for his dedication to the Order and his renowned leadership.
In October 2020 ValSenko joined the Order as a Force Sensitive.
ValSenko obtained not only Caretaker of First Knowledge of which he is known and still holds the title, but also the rank of Master of the Order on July 10th, 2021.
During his time in servitude, he had been awarded the Master of the Order Award Recognition and the Jedi High Council Award of Expansive Knowledge.

# Section 1

ValSenko joined the Order in October 2020 alongside his comrades Kavarlamares, JedAlkion, and Celedrian.
ValSenko spent around 2 days as a Youngling before all four of them achieved the rank of Jedi Master, though ValSenko was appointed to Master on October 8th, 2020 which is earlier than his comrades.
ValSenko considered Grandmaster TiberiusMalevern as his official mentor as he’s helped Val progress since the day he joined as a Youngling.
ValSenko has trained around 10 Padawans to Knighthood and has been a part of all three divisions throughout his career, however, he has the most experience within the Librarian’s Assembly as he is the official founder and leader of it.

# Section 2

Just like Master Vanestc, Master ValSenko is a practitioner of the third form of lightsaber combat, Soresu also known as the Way of the Mynock or the Resilience Form.
After ValSenko was appointed to the rank of Jedi Master, he held a title under the Council of Reconciliation.
During that time frame, the Council of Reconciliation wasn’t fully established.
Because of this, ValSenko wasn’t considered an official founding member of the Council.
ValSenko was also appointed to Jedi High Councillor two weeks after being tasked with establishing the Council of First Knowledge and the Librarian’s Assembly as the Council of First Knowledge’s Caretaker of First Knowledge.
As mentioned before ValSenko was elected as Master of the Order on July 10th, 2021 following Vermened’s resignation from his position.

# Section 3

ValSenko was given the Award of Expansive Knowledge by the Jedi High Council because of his extensive service within the Librarian’s Assembly as its founder.
Though every title and award he obtained is important to him because they serve as proof of his contributions and recognize him as a built-in figurehead of the Order’s history.
