# Introduction

AmaanCon first joined the Jedi Order over two years ago, on the 26th of October, 2020.
At that time, Amaan had a few friends within the Order; due to this, he had decided to join.
Throughout his time in the Jedi Order, Amaan had accrued many ranks and titles.
Some of these titles include: Barsen’thor, Head Weapon Specialist, Head of the Council of Reassignment, Jedi Master, and the Jedi High Council.

# Section 1

The Jedi Order was founded on April 30th, 2020.
Half a year after its creation, there would be a Force Sensitive to join.
Little did he or anyone else know how much AmaanCon would contribute to the Order.
Amaan would go on to spend months within the Order, surrounded by friends new and old.

HaileyMalvern would be the one to take Amaan on as her padawan.
Hailey would teach Amaan the ways of the Jedi Knight.
With Hailey as his Master, it wouldn’t be long for Amaan to pass his Knight Trials and be awarded the rank of Jedi Knight.
This was only the start of his journey within the Order.
Over his time as a Jedi Knight onward, AmaanCon would take many on as his padawans.
Some of the most notable Padawans he had are AustinInnix, Fabricator Sophie, and HenryRuarc.
These Padawans would go on to do great things within the Order; Austin would go on to join the High Council alongside Amaan.
Sophie would become a developer for The Known Galaxy (TKG).

# Section 2

AmaanCon would eventually go on to join the Jedi Assault Team (JAT) as well as become a Weapon Specialist.
His efforts in the Jedi Assault Team would not go unnoticed, as he would eventually be appointed to the position of Barsen’thor.
Amaan would oversee the Jedi Assault Team, and nothing would happen within the division without his approval or recognition.

Aside from Barsen’thor, AmaanCon was also appointed the Head Weapon Specialist due to his efforts in the specialization.
Alongside other members, he helped reform the Weapon Specialists.
After heading both the Jedi Assault Team and Weapon Specialist with no issues, Jedi Master AmaanCon was appointed Head of the Council of Reassignment.
Amaan would be tasked with overseeing every subdivision within this Council as well as hosting frequent meetings with the heads of each one.

# Section 3

Eventually, AmaanCon would step down from both the Council of Reassignment and the Jedi High Council.
Jedi Master AmaanCon would go on to retire from the Jedi Order In of May 2021.
Throughout his time in the Jedi Order, AmaanCon had achieved great things, taught many Jedi, and spread wisdom to all.
He had protected our temple and fought relentlessly against the Sith as Barsen’thor.
His retirement was a long time coming, and regardless, he will be missed.
