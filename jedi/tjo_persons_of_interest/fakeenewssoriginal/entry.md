# Introduction

FakeeNewssOriginal joined the Jedi Order on the Fifth of February 2021.
Fakee was really interested in Star Wars at that time, and he was looking for a quality group.
Fakee was pretty much hooked up after he joined the Order.
“It was a very beautiful map, and there were a lot of very nice players willing to answer any questions I had.”

# Section 1

FakeeNewssOriginal ascended to the rank of Jedi Knight on the Ninth of March 2021.
He Knighted roughly one month after he joined.
About three months later, Fakee passed his Advanced Jedi Knight trials and became a Jedi Artisan on the 22nd of June 2021.
As an Artisan, his responsibilities mainly consisted of hosting Crystal Gatherings and helping people with Ilum-related issues.
Fakee hosted a lot of Crystal Gatherings in his first few months as an Artisan; he has hosted a little over 100 Crystal Gatherings in his entire career as an Artisan.

# Section 2

Three weeks after Fakee became an Artisan, he was promoted to Jedi Instructor.
Once he was promoted to Jedi Instructor, his responsibilities increased to that of a more administrative position.
He now was tasked with moderation and de-escalation.
Fakee was made a Senior Artisan shortly after he was promoted to Jedi Instructor.
As a Senior Artisan, he was tasked with the same general Artisan duties as before, but additionally, he was expected to play a part in overseeing the specialization, and its members and making sure everything was running smoothly.

# Section 3

Sometime later, Fakee was promoted to Assistant Head Artisan.
As an Assistant Head, his duties were not too different, except for the fact that he also oversaw Senior Artisans now.
A few months later he was promoted to Jedi Master on the Eighth of January 2022.
When he was promoted to Jedi Master, his duties did not change too much.
He did have authority over Instructors now, and he was more respected as a member of the community.

# Section 4

About a month later, Fakee was promoted to Head Artisan on the 14th of February 2022, making him not only Councilor of First Knowledge, but also the position he has been in for a little over a year now.
As Head Artisan and Councilor of First Knowledge, he was put in charge of the entire Artisan specialization.
This means that he has to host Artisan trials, along with managing every member of the specialization.
Fakee also has to make decisions based on the Artisan’s activity and involvement within the specialization.

As a Councilor of First Knowledge, he oversees the operation of all Council of First Knowledge specializations.
However, this is in a more minor role compared to his specialization.
Fakee, along with other Councilors of First Knowledge, offer their vote and opinion concerning any proposed change, or event regarding any Council of First Knowledge specialization.

# Section 5

Originally a Padawan to the former Jedi Knight ZeroSicarius, Fakee served as ZeroSicarius’ Padawan for three weeks.
None of Fakee’s Padawans have failed the Trials of Knighthood; however, a good amount of them went inactive during their training.
Fakee has been in the Jedi Assault Team, the Librarian’s Assembly, and the Jedi Academy; he is still in the Librarian’s Assembly as a Scholar, and in the Jedi Academy as an Academy Instructor.

FakeeNewssOriginal has received the Jedi High Council Leadership Award due to his efforts in the Artisan specialization.
That award is very important to him because he has spent a lot of time working in the Artisans, and still keeps working in it.
The position of Artisan and Councilor of First Knowledge is also very significant to Fakee.
“Artisan has been my only Advanced Jedi Knight path, and I have held that role for over a year and a half.
I have made a lot of good friends working in the Artisan specialization, and I also really value the relationships I have made within the Council of First Knowledge.”
