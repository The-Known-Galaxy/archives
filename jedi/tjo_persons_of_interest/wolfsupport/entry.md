# Introduction

Wolfsupport joined the Jedi Order on January 24th, 2021.
He joined the Order because he saw multiple people he knew being on Sanctum, and went to check it out.
Wolf had been in another Jedi Order before, but it had been a while so he decided to try one again.
WolfSupport was an exceptional Master of the Order before KennaexMalvern took the responsibility over.
He held not only the title of Master of the Order but also Sage Master, Master of Shadows, and Chief of Security.

# Section 1

Wolfsupport had many responsibilities for the different positions throughout his time in the Order.
The three most notable positions were the Master of Shadows, Chief of Security, and Master of the Order.
As the Master of Shadows, he anonymously led the secret organization known as the Jedi Shadows.
Identities of Wolf, and his Shadows were known only to the Senior Councilors of First Knowledge, the Master of the Order, and the Grandmaster.
They were tasked with performing both internal and external intelligence operations to maintain the security of the Order.

As the Chief of Security, he led the Council of Reconciliation alongside the other Senior Councilor of Reconciliation, as well as having direct oversight over the Temple Guard, and of course, participating on the Jedi High Council.
Last, but not least, as Master of the Order, Wolf effectively led all day-to-day operations of the Jedi Order.
His most prominent, and involved job was hosting, and moderating the weekly Jedi High Council meetings.

# Section 2

Besides the titles Wolf held, he has also been in a few different specializations.
He initially was in the Jedi Investigators for one day before being recruited to join the Jedi Shadows program.
As a cover identity, he joined the Jedi Sages and eventually became the Sage Master in conjunction with his role as Master of Shadows.
Wolf thoroughly enjoyed his time as a Shadow and was honored to be an integral participant in stopping the DDoSe attacks the Order endured consistently in April and May of 2021.
Wolf was in both the Jedi Assault Team and the Librarian’s Assembly as he ascended the ranks of the Order.
Later, as the Chief of Security, he technically was in the Temple Guard as well.

Wolf still remembers a Jedi named marqtiger who he trained with often as an Initiate and a Padawan.
Marqtiger and Wolf’s master, Blazey_Kitsune, were the ones he spent the most time with as a Youngling, Initiate, and Padawan.
Wolf himself trained eight Padawans.

# Section 3

Even though the game has endured multiple drastic combat changes, Wolf has always been a Form II user.
He has also received the Leadership Award, Excellence Award, and Master of the Order Recognition Award.
He has truly been grateful and honored to have served for so long on the Jedi High Council both as a member and as the leader of it.
“I met and worked with many wonderful people and learned leadership and collaborative skills that have translated into who I am as a person and my future life experiences.”
