# Section 1

Early in his career within the Order, AustinVKaril served as a Padawan under his Master, AamanCon.
After becoming a Knight, he had around 6-8 Padawans of his own.
When he served as the Head of Ambassadors, he reformed the specialization into one of its previous duties, which focused on diplomacy.
Afterward, he began working in the Jedi Service Corps as the Head of Seers and the Head of Advancement.
Once he was given the rare title of ‘Head of Advancement’, Austin reformed the Service Corps to where it was more functional and active than with the leadership before him.
When asked about any advice he would give, Austin stated that people should “take \[their\] time ranking up” as it was his “biggest downfall when \[he\] was at \[his\] peak.”
