# Introduction
ExcubiarumTenebris was an esteemed member of The Jedi Order who was renowned for his dedication towards the Order and his tight and strong leadership.
On the Fifth November 2020 Excubiarum joined the Order as a Force Sensitive.
Excubiarum obtained not only the position of Fifth Commandant on the 26th of July, 2021 but also the rank of Chief of Security on the ninth of January, 2022 serving as a Master on the Jedi High Council.
During his time in servitude, he had been awarded the Excellency and Leadership awards which fit his length of time within the Order and effort he put into improving the community.

# Section 1
Excubiarum joined the Order on the fifth of November, 2020.
Excubiarum had already known a member of the Order known as ValSenko.
They had previously known each other from outside the genre, and this had been an incentive for Excubiarum to progress through the ranks as he had a friend with him.
However, this was not his only reason for him to quickly rise through the ranks of the Temple Guard.
Excubiarum had decided early on that he was going to put the entirety of his time and effort into the Temple Guard, serving it well and improving it how he saw fit, though later on this idea was twisted to the Order itself rather than focusing on the Temple Guard subsection of the community.
It was on the 22nd of the same month that he became a Candidate within the Jedi Temple Guard, an impressively short timeframe to obtain such a rank, in which he shortly took his Guardsman Trials and became a Sentinel and Guardsman on the 29th of November.
Within his time as a Guardsman, the Tempe Guard underwent new leadership - the Former Commandant, KingBurayden, retiring his position - as Joelbloxx came into power as the Third Commandant.


During Excubiarum’s days as a Guardsman he worked extremely hard until he eventually reached the position of Instructor on the 26th of December.
Unfortunately, on the ninth of January, 2021, he retired from his position of Instructor for reasons unknown.This was short-lived, however because on the 27th of February he was promoted to Instructor again.
Less than a month later on the eighth of March, 2021 he was promoted to Warden within the Temple Guard.
Excubiarum attributes the short timespan between these two promotions to the former Commanders knowing how capable he was and the trust within him showed itself with his performance as Warden.
Excubiarum had observed many shifts within the Temple Guard community as well as the whole populace community in a manner that very few have, he credited this to his continuous involvement within The Jedi Order’s affairs.
Continuing to work diligently for approximately 2 months, he was once again promoted on the 21st of April to the rank of Captain.
This was a notable time within his career as it was his first time serving on the Senior Command of the Temple Guard.



# Section 2
Unfortunately, on the 10th of May, Excubiarum had once again retired as his position of Captain, only this time his reason for leaving was that he felt dissatisfied with leadership and he felt as if he had served his time.
However, the Temple Guard had fallen into disarray as soon as Excubiarum had retired - whether his retirement was directly involved within the Temple Guard’s disarray is unconfirmed.
This disorder within reached the higher echelons of the Jedi Order, the High Council and above.
On the 29th of the same month, the Grandmaster of the Order contacted ExcubiarumTenebris to attend a meeting concerning the affairs of the Temple Guard.
This meeting involved the Grandmaster, the Chief of Security and the Master of the Order.
The result of the meeting was an offer to Excubiarum in which he would be reinstated as a Captain within the Temple Guard and would use his leadership skills to remedy the Guard to the state it previously was, in which he naturally took the offer.
On the same day the largest purge of members within the Temple Guard occurred, leaving only a few Guardsmen - almost all command were kicked from the Temple Guard.
Excubiarum personally remarked that it was the largest Temple Guard reformation he had seen.
On the 27th of July Excubiarum was officially promoted to the rank of Commandant of the Temple Guard, being the Fifth Commandant.



# Section 3
During this new era of Excubiarum as Commandant of the Temple Guard, he worked hard to make repairs to the Temple Guard and Order itself that had been made whilst he was not in a position of power.
Excubiarum believed this was when he first realised he was now putting his effort into the Order rather than the Temple Guard; working for the betterment of the group rather than strictly the Temple Guard.
On the ninth of January, 2022, the former Chief of Security - iSingToooMuch - retired.
Inherently taking his place, Excubiarum was promoted to the rank of Chief of Security and was placed on the Jedi High Council.
To many people’s surprise, Excubiarum was temporarily demoted from the Council on the Fifth of February for three weeks.
The reasons for his temporary demotion are withheld from public knowledge as for the sake of Council discretion.
He said that he had “Grown too comfortable,” for the sake of people asking why he was demoted.
Within this time of punishment he came to realise the meaning of his position as Chief of Security and how fundamentally different it was from the Temple Guard, he admitted to his mistakes and learnt from them how a True Jedi should.
Excubiarum grew as a member of the Jedi Order, when asked what his awards meant to him he said “The High Council awards mean nothing to me now because every Councillor is expected to uphold the standards which merit the awards.”



# Section 4
Excubiarum credited a lot to his former Master when he was a Padawan; JamesEcrux.
He believed his willingness to take him in as a Padawan permitted for everything good and bad to come within his career as a member of the Jedi Order.
As a member of the Jedi High Council, Excubiarum wanted the Order to focus on education more than anything.
He believed that not enough people knew about the Jedi Law which resulted in many meaningless arrests which could’ve been easily avoided.
Excubiarum described his alignment as a Democratic Autocrat, and the one thing he essentially encouraged was opinion.
He often forced it out of his commanders, as their voices were expected to be heard and he would make decisions based on their opinions.
However, the Excubiarum’s autocrat side came in whenever he made a decision - it would be final.
He would tolerate zero dissent, if anyone refused to comply with his decisions they would simply not serve under him.
