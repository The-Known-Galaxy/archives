# Introduction
creation_v1 was a recognizable and astute individual in the early days of the order that continuously put effort and work into what he was yet to achieve.
creation_v1 did not have any other reason to join the order to begin his journey towards becoming a full-fledged Jedi Knight other than pure curiosity.
He initiated and continued his career under the Council of First Knowledge and its specializations, focusing on lore, knowledge, and education-oriented activities.
After ValSenko trained creation_v1, he took on three Padawan learners throughout his career.

# Section 1
creation_v1 marked his beginning in the order as of May 16th of 2021 towards the beginning of the group's founding.
He had a companion that introduced him to the group and creation_v1 was interested in the aspects of the knowledge elements, henceforth, decided to progress in that criteria.
The biggest and most notable achievement from creation_v1 was his promotion to Head Arbiter of the Council of First Knowledge.
He worked more in tune with the Librarian’s Assembly specialization, fulfilling his duties as a former Librarian.
The first ever specialization he joined was the Jedi Sages.
At the end of his time, he became a Lore Keeper, still serving under the Council of First Knowledge as it was his biggest interest.
At one point, he became a Gate Captain server under the Temple Security Force.



# Section 2
creation_v1 had many responsibilities as well since he had taken on some very vital jobs.
He was responsible to manage and upkeep Jedi Philosophy, going from Knighthood principles, Jedi Virtues, and the main Jedi Code.
During his time as a Librarian, he was tasked to take on the job of Overseer of Students where he made sure all Students made it just fine to their promotion to Scholar.
It was not a manageable duty, but it was not the most formidable either.
He worked with the Jedi Academy as well, making sure the Younglings are trained properly toward graduation.
He was trained too once by his former master, ValSenko that taught him the ways of the Force and made him what he became.



# Section 3
creation_v1 spread his teachings from his master across the order as well.
He took on 4 Padawans, ItsAntonyLuvv who he trained for three months successfully.
 He trained AlexanderArden for 3 months as well, however, AlexanderArden was dropped as a Padawan due to life circumstances not allowing him to progress.
He trained WhoopeyNight for one and a half to three months successfully as well.
Lastly, he trained ll_greywolf_729 as his last Padawan for a short period, however not to Knighthood unfortunately.

creation_v1 believes that an individual must live up to their nature and upkeep their loyalty to themselves and the order.
They should not become a figure they are not meant to become, they must instead represent the best of their honest selves and pass it down to others.
