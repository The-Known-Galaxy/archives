# Introduction
Jedi Master OceanDemici joined the Jedi Order on the 5th of August 2021.
At that time, Ocean thought the Order had a welcoming and kind community.
As a long-serving member of the Order, Ocean has seen many come and go; he has watched the Order grow from a small community to the large bustling group it is today.

# Section 1
Throughout his time in the Order, Ocean has grown into a mature and responsible Jedi Master.
His effort and time spent within the Order would not go unnoticed, as Ocean would reach high ranks.
Some of these ranks include the Head of Praeceptors, a Councillor on the Council of Reassignment, a Jedi Master, a Librarian for the Librarian’s Assembly, and finally, a member of the High Command of the Jedi Service Corps.

As the Head of Praeceptors, Ocean oversaw expansion classes hosted for Initiate IIs within the Jedi Service Corps.
These classes would teach the young Initiate IIs about all the specializations within the Order.
Ocean was appointed this rank on the 3rd of August, 2022.
As a result of his efforts within the Praeceptors and the Jedi Service Corps, he would receive this title.

A Councillor on the Council of Reassignment plays a significant role.
These few members would hold several meetings discussing the Council, the Jedi Service Corps, and Specializations.
Ocean has a permanent seat on the Council of Reassignment; this means he will remain on the Council until he retires.
Ocean was given a permanent seat because of his determination and hard work as the Head of Praeceptors.

The High Command of the Jedi Service Corps is a small group of members that directly oversee the ongoings of the Corps.
They would be directly responsible for everything that goes on within the organization.
Ocean’s job within the High Command is to ensure that everything runs smoothly and accordingly.

The Librarian’s Assembly is a group of Jedi that strive to protect the knowledge within the Jedi Order.
Not only that, but they also help preserve knowledge and information in the form of articles within our Archives.
As a Librarian, Ocean is in charge of monitoring the Archivists of the Librarian’s Assembly and the rest of the division alongside his fellow Librarians.
Each Librarian oversees a specific part of the Assembly, and Ocean manages any Lore Seminar within the division.
