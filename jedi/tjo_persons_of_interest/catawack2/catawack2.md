# Introduction
catawack2, also known as Catawack, joined the Jedi Order in July 2021.
His reason for joining was his love for Star Wars and the community.
The Order was initially suggested to him by AxisMorningstar.
Catawack first joined the Jedi Sanctum and stayed with the Order as they moved to Ossus.
Throughout his time, Catawack achieved many ranks and titles, showing dedication to Order-related causes.

# Section 1
As a Jedi Master, Catawack would ensure that the Order was flowing smoothly, as well as making sure that any Youngling trainings or Knight Trials were being hosted correctly.
He also fondly remembers enjoying his talks with many other members within the Order, such as GatoMorningstar.
He would enjoy these talks, whether it be how life was going or any specific Order-related cause.

Catawack would show dedication to his Padawans and the Order by rising through the ranks of the Temple Security Force, reaching Gate Master.
Despite the dislike of the Temple Security Force, Catawack remained with Temple Security Force throughout its time.
However, when the inevitable downfall of the division came, he had no other option but to retire.


His dedication to his Padawans comes as never letting them down or giving up on them.
Although his most notable Padawans would either retire from the Order early or disband and join the Sith, Catawack kept regular contact, offering advice and help where needed.



# Section 2
As a Sage, it was Catawack's job to help defend and heal fellow Jedi during Sith raids on Ossus or Jedi raids on Dathomir.
He would set up healing stations alongside fellow Sages to heal Jedi that needed it or defeat other Sith.
As a strong fighter and healer, Catawack helped make a difference during raids.

Catawack had been a Sage and a Gate Master for quite a while, but because of the downfall of the Temple Security Force and external reasons, Catawack retired on the 15th of February 2022.
To end this article, Catawack himself has asked me to give a few shout-outs to those who have helped make his experience within the Jedi Order a wonderful time.

 
Catawack wishes to thank all those who were there for him and helped him during his journey and would like to extend his sincere gratitude to the former Chief Librarian Cannon for allowing his experiences to be recorded in the Archives, as well as Axis for introducing him to this lovely community.
