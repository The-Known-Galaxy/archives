# Introduction

On June 3, 2021, BookZulfor became a member of the order.
He joined the order on the old map sanctum in search of a welcoming community and in the hope of passing on his knowledge from his previous Jedi Orders to ours.
He discovered our order completely by luck after joining a random Roblox experience.
Eventually, he decided he was going to extend his welcome within the Jedi Order, which led to him having positions such as Jedi High Councillor, Chief of Lore Keepers, and temporary Chief Librarian.
He was well known in the Jedi Order for his great knowledge.

# Section 1

BookZulfor didn't have a Master, so he had to go through the Jedi Service Corps route to reach Knighthood, which worked out for him because he received it after only 9 days of being in the Order.
Only soon after reaching the status of Knight, BookZulfor located and assigned himself his first padawan, known as,  lolpoker, whom he trained to knighthood very soon after earning the status of Knight, although his first Padawan didn't advance very far in this order because he unfortunately left.
Zulfor has trained three padawans during his journey within the order.
BookZelfur attained the rank of Advanced Jedi Knight on June 28th, 2021.
He joined the Council of First Knowledge and became a Lore Keeper.

On October 24th, 2021, BookZulfor was given the rank of Instructor, whose role during this time was to host knight trials for padawans and service initiates.
However, BookZulfor never hosted a knight trial because he wanted to focus on his Lore Keeper specialisation, which earned him the title of Jedi Master on December 12th, 2021.

This has opened up many opportunities for him because he was the Head of Lore Keepers following the retirement of the previous head.
As previously stated, BookZulfor did not have a Master, but he did have a mentor, Blazey Aktuun, who assisted him throughout the order by imparting wisdom.

# Section 2

BookZulfor had only hosted four Advanced Knight trials during his time as a Jedi Master, and some of those members are still with us, but they are not lore keepers.
BookZelfur was also a member of the Librarians Assembly and held the position of temporary Chief Librarian before  Master  Cannon.
Although he was only a Chief Librarian for a short time, he did an outstanding job, and as a result, he is still recognized in our order even though he has retired.

On March 27, 2022, BookZulfor was promoted to the position of  Jedi High Councillor.
He rose to the position of High Councillor due to his exemplary generosity, wisdom, and consideration for the order's members.
He will undoubtedly be remembered for a very long time.
During his stay in the order, he received two JHC rewards: extensive Knowledge and Excellence.
He has stepped down from his post as a temporary Chief Librarian to assume the position of regular Librarian.
As previously said, Book has accomplished many wonderful things for the order, including the resurrection of the Jedi seers.
Due to his hectic schedule, Book regrettably had to resign; however, he was given the title of Jedi Elder.
