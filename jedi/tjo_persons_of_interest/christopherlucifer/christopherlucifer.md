# Introduction

ChristopherLucifer joined The Jedi Order around September 16th, 2020, and he had been participating in saber-fighting genres since around 2012.
He joined just in time to see the last days of JamesCelestial as Grandmaster, right before Snatchup took that position.
As a matter of fact, he ended up being Grandmaster Snatchup’s Padawan.
He was promoted directly from Jedi Knight to a seat in the Jedi High Council.
This was entrusted to him so he could oversee the formation of the Jedi Assault Team as its first Battlemaster, as well as lay down the framework for the Jedi Service Corps.

# Section 1

Around the same time that Snatchup became Grandmaster, he began removing James’ old Jedi High Council members and replacing them with his own friends.
This of course only served to worsen the reputation of Grandmaster Snatchup, who was already suffering over having purchased the group from James.
James’ old followers formed a sort of rebellion, and they frequently raided the Jedi Sanctum.

# Section 2

ChristopherLucifer enters the equation, as he was taken as Grandmaster Snatchup’s newest Padawan at that time.
He reached Knight easily and was given a spot on the Jedi High Council not only to form the Jedi Assault Team as their Battlemaster but also to run the Jedi Service Corps.
His tenure on the Jedi High Council was a year and three months long, during which he had laid the foundations out for both the Assault Team as well as the Jedi Service Corps.

# Section 3

In the face of his most positive contributions, those who knew him know that he was not without a somewhat dramatic past.
Christopher was quick to speak on anything and everything, and he usually had no filter when he did.
As the group became larger, its members had little to no tolerance for this aspect of his character.
His mindset towards teaching favored combat and power rather than knowledge, and that mindset led to many disagreements of varying intensities with his fellow High Councillors.
His dissenters argued that his methods were not those that a Jedi would use to teach other Jedi.
To top it all off, he was the leader of the Lucifer bloodline, and to many outsiders, it seemed as though he favored Lucifer members over everyone else.
However, this may seem true, but that assumption was not wholly correct.
If anything, he punished the Lucifers, who misbehaved worse than anyone else, solely because they knew better than to cause problems for the bloodline at large.
Eventually, conflicts between members of his bloodline combined with others within the order and the gradually increasing size of the group, and intolerance towards his own demeanor became constant.
This ensuing personal and group conflict with the other High Councillors finally led him to permanently retire from the Order as a whole.

# Section 4

Overall, during his time spent in the Order, there were more positives than negatives.
He won Duelist of the Order twice, pushing back raiding Sith groups even if they outnumbered his own forces, and he was able to see the community explode in popularity while also helping people achieve their goals within the Order.
He laid down the frameworks of the Jedi Assault Team and Service Corps, and he served on the High Council for a little over a full year.
To those who knew him personally or those who served with him during his time in the Assault Team, the impressions he made will be forever remembered.
