# Introduction

The Arthurians are a sentient species native to the planet of Arthuria.
Arthurians have gray-ish blue skin color, white hair, and brown eyes.
Arthurians closely resemble humans with an upright posture, one thorax, two legs, two arms, feet, hands, a head, and neck.
One of the most notable differences other than their skin color is the location of their taste buds being in their hands.
Arthurians never use utensils while eating and view them as insulting.
Due to their taste buds being in their hands, Arthurians wear gloves when in public at all times except when eating.
In Arthurian culture and society white is viewed as a color of respect to be worn by those of authority only.

# Section 1

During the Clone Wars, the Arthurians remained neutral, siding with neither the Galactic Republic nor the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
At some time during the conflict, however, the Arthurians found the Confederacy to be disrespectful and rude, causing them to seek an alliance with the Galactic Republic.
The Senator of Naboo, Padm√© Amidala, was in charge of the negotiations with the Arthurians to join the Republic.
