# Introduction

The Duros were a humanoid and sentient species native to the planet Duro.
They had no nose, large eyes, smooth skin and green-coloured blood.
With their main language of Durese, they were a species that would adapt quickly, allowing them to dominate other worlds in numbers.
A well-known and famous Duros would be Cad Bane, a bounty hunter during the Clone Wars era.
The species would be described as “adventurous” due to them being one of the first cultures to create a ship equipped with a hyperdrive.
This meant that they could be found all over the galaxy.
After the new reign of the Galactic Empire, their homeworld would become the first of the Core World planets that were taken under control.
Due to this, many would either be criminals such as Cad Bane back in the day or would join the Rebel Alliance, trying to get rid of the Empire and restore the Republic.
