# Introduction

The H’drachi species were a humanoid cameloid creature with fur covering their bodies.
They wore cloth on their heads and bright, colourful robes.
The H’drachi were extremely connected to the Force, most of them being Force Sensitive due to it.
Unlike most Force Sensitive species, they are able to see into the future with something they called a “time-stream”, they would adopt this into their own traditions.
Just like Jedi Seer’s, they had their own Seer’s, they were extremely connected to the Force and could use the time-stream to see the future with accurate and high success rates.
If all H’drachi Seer’s came together at the same time to use the time-stream, they would have a 100% success rate of what they saw.
They lived on the planet of M’haeli in the Expansion Regions, this planet was very mountainous and had lots of snow covering the planet.

# Section 1

The H’drachi were mainly servants to the human race on their home planet after humans declared control of M’haeli.
Because the humans controlled the planet, the H’drachi had absolutely no control over what happened on the planet, or what happened to them, the humans controlled everything that came on, and left the planet.
This would lead the planet to be in the middle of multiple wars and conflicts such as, the Great Manifest Period, or the Clone Wars.
During the brutal Clone Wars, M’haeli sided with the Republic and were protected throughout the Clone Wars, but when it was reformed into the Galactic Empire, it was heavily controlled like all planets under the Empire.
The H’drachi highly disliked the Empire but stayed low because of a vision the H’drachi Seer’s saw from the time-stream.
This vision being, the Empire would one day be no more than history.
As the war raged on even more, it finally reached the planet of M’haeli, the Empire stayed in control over it and the H’drachi people until the end of the war, but in 127 ABY, they would once again be controlled but this time by Darth Krayt’s Empire.
This species has been controlled by others all throughout history, but they still had hope because of their ability to see into the future.
