# Introduction
The Rakata were a sentient amphibian species, originally Force-sensitive, that lived on the temperate planet of Lehon in the Unknown Regions.
A Rakatan individual would typically have a varying skin/eye colour with a distinctive tall head supporting short horizontal eyestalks on either side of their head.
They were adapted for Lehon’s environment, so they developed three-fingered claws able to dig dirt.
The Rakata spoke the language of Rakata but were able to communicate in other languages due to their intelligence.
Their society was largely split into classes, the most notable classes being the priest and warrior classes.

# Section 1
Some time before 36,453 BBY, an ancient reptilian Force-sensitive species from Dathomir, the Kwa, arrived on Lehon via an Infinity Gate, which was a highly advanced system of instantaneous transportation across the galaxy.
Similar to many other worlds before Lehon, the Kwa offered the then-primitive Rakata their knowledge of the Force and technology in trade for being enslaved.
Little did the Kwa know that the Rakata were actually cannibals and using the knowledge of the Force, drew from only its dark side.
This paired with the desire to hold dominion with Kwa’s influence allowed the Rakata to conquer other worlds in the Unknown Regions, establishing the Infinite Empire.
This is when the Rakata earned the name “The Builders”.
In their newfound empire, the Rakata captured Force-sensitives in the regions they took control of and induced dark-side emotions into them, which was siphoned into powering their warships and machinery.
Now desiring to use the Infinity Gates, the Rakata turned on their Kwa benefactor in a war that led to severe casualties on both sides, but the Kwa were able to deactivate most of the standing Infinite Gates to slow down the empire’s expansion.
By 35,000 BBY, the Rakata had spread all over the Unknown Regions and eastern section of the galaxy, even creating the dark-side imbued Star Forge and wiping out most of the mighty Celestial species with a curse.

The Rakata subsequently enveloped over 500 planets in the galaxy, rich in the Force.
However, their Force hyperdrive technology and Force Hounds only allowed them to travel to worlds with a strong connection to the Force, allowing many different planets to thrive in the empire’s shadow.
Due to this, they encountered several groups such as the Esh-kha, the Sith and the Je’daii that were in conflict with them, but the Rakata were able to stay victorious.
After a huge time of galactic supremacy, a civil war between factions in the empire by 25,200 BBY, caused by the corrupting effect of the Star Forge.
In the heat of this situation, a plague abruptly surfaced, thinning their numbers.
For the surviving Rakata, they were no longer Force-sensitive and couldn’t activate their technology.
Sensing this weakness, many enslaved species rebelled against their overseers, leading to the entire Infinite Empire collapsing in 25,200 BBY and surviving Rakata retreating back to Lehon.
Without access to the Force, survivors descended into savagery that resulted in isolated and warring barbaric tribes, which would remain that way for the next 20,000 years, while civilisations that had been under the control of the Rakata removed most traces of the empire in the galaxy.



# Section 3
Over time, these tribes would diversify in ideologies, some preferring aggression and others wanting to flee the system entirely to form the Rakatan Archipelago.
Only the Elder tribe was known to have records of the Builders that they once were and sought to destroy the Star Forge to erase their violent past.
The Elders thought it would be a fine chance to do this when Darth Revan and Malak arrived there in 3959 BBY, but Revan tricked them and took the space station for himself.
Having no power to do anything, the Elders were forced to watch their technology being used in evil ways.
Revan was eventually able to pull from the dark-side and destroy the Star Forge.
By 1000 BBY, the knowledge that Rakatan were once great rulers of the galaxy was a myth and lost to time.
The Rakata tribes on Lehon died out, leaving the last remaining individuals in the Rakatan Archipelago.
