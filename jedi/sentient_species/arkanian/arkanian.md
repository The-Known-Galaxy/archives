# Introduction

The Arkanians are a human-like species which hailed from the icy planet of Arkania.
During their evolution they started heavily manipulating their species making many subspecies varying heavily: some had 4 fingers, some 6, some had much more body heat generated and much more.
It is almost impossible to find a pure blood Arkanian.

# Section 1

Many Arkanians usually were very arrogant due to them having a large ego, the reason why their ego was so big was because of them being usually superior to most species.
Many Arkanans were scientists because of their way of manipulating genetics.
If you were rude to an Arkanian it was as bad as murder as they would lock you up usually.

# Section 2

Usually Arkanians believed that they were the ‘pinnacle of evolution’ so they would criticize guests to their planet.
There were also Arkanian Jedi with Master Arca Jeth being an example.
Usually Arkanians are white eyed, pure white skin and sometimes pointy ears due to their DNA being occasionally mixed with Sephi DNA.
