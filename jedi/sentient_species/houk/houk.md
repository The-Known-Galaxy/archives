# Introduction
The Houk were a humanoid, sentient species from the planet Lijuter in the Reibrin.
The Houk were big, and capable of building up heavy musculature.
They had large forearms, and strong, four-fingered hands.
Their skulls were thick and bone-ridged, into which sat very small eyes.
The Houk had a short and fierce temper, second only to that of a Wookiee, and could be very violent when provoked.

Due to their heavy builds, they were a common sight in the spice mines of Kessel.
Many others were gladiators, one of such being Borbig Drob, who fought during the early years of the Galactic Empire.
This Houk came to win the Stormblade Bloodfest nine times, becoming a well-known champion.
At the Gladiator Night event on Lothal, he fought a Feeorin gladiator called Warjak, before being defeated by the Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk’wassak’Cradossk, more commonly referred to as “Bossk”.
Another notable Houks was a gladiator who fought against a Wookiee known as Black Krrsantan alongside a Red Nikto and a Trandoshan.
Unfortunately, all three died in the arena.
There was also a Houk named Jorgatha, who served in the New Republic’s 61st Mobile Infantry on the city-world Troithe in 5.ABY.
