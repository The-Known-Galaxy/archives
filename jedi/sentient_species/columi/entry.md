# Introduction

One of the first sentient races to exist in the galaxy were the Columi.
Their massive heads, which accounted for more than a third of their about 1.75-meter height, and their skeletal limbs and legs made them immediately recognizable.
Another distinguishing characteristic was its enormous, black, lidless eyes with worm-like veins on the temples.
However, their mental evolution impacted their physical bodies as their condition declined.
As a result, their appendages' spindly arms and legs lost the ability to support their weight, including Columi's home world, which is a low-gravity environment.
Their bodies were reduced to serve as storage spaces for their hearts, lungs, and other priceless organs.
The evolutionary process brought up Columi's vital organs into their cerebral activity.

# Section 1

The Columi were once herbivorous lizards that inhabited the marshes of Columus, a planet with low gravity.
These species' ancestors used buoyant bellies to propel themselves on four webbed feet through the swamp.
They later developed the ability to walk on their rear legs, which enabled them to gather fruit from trees.
A few thousand years later, they experienced their next evolutionary stage and laid their eggs in trees, which offered them more protection from predators.
As a result, they eventually evolved to live fully within the trees, where they started to get hands instead of claws.
They also acquired prehensile tails as an alternative to the cumbersome caudal appendage they trailed around when they were quadrupeds.
In a few centuries, they developed tools that led to a quick succession of evolutionary advances.
Their transition to genuine sentience was characterized by losing their tails and the ability to walk on two legs.
They eventually started extracting minerals and other raw materials from the bedrock, using them to build towns elevated above the mud and trees and supported by massive towers.

# Section 2

Columi of the modern era were highly specialized organisms with brains of four cerebrums and more than one hundred lobes, each of which had a distinct purpose.
In addition to Columi’s highly developed brains, their eyes—the only link between them and the outside world—had become increasingly significant among their kind.
They evolved beyond being only photoreceptors, since they could perceive all the electromagnetic spectrum's wavelengths.
They could "hear" through their eyes by identifying and assessing the frequency of sound or radio waves.
Furthermore, they had lost their sense of smell and had only a hazy feeling of touch due to the heightened development of their visual thinking.
