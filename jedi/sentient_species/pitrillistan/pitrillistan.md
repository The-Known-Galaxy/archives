# Introduction
Born and originating from their homeworld of Pitrillistia, the self-aware entities were monstrously tall, often surpassing (7) feet.
Their planet hailed from the Mieru’kar sector, and ultimately, they were a species that adopted a pacifist ideology.

Their linguistic communication was reduced to simply musical clicks and rings.
The most interesting physical feature other than their height, was the dualistic nature of their body.
One half was insectoid, and the other was closer in biology to that of a humanoid.
They carried many similar characteristics to humans, having bipedal legs and arms alongside (2) eyes.
Due to their unique biological split, one arm had an insectoid claw clasps, whilst the other had (4) fingers.
They each had different functions, with the species often utilising the human hand to carry objects, and blasters.

Their feet ended in long talons which helped to carry their massive frames.
The Pitrillistian facial structure was also unique, having multi-coloured hair, horns and the covers on their faces.

The creatures also had a layer of fur that covered their wrists, and the shells on their back.
It was a colour of silver white, and in general, this complemented their overall appearance.

SOCIETY & CULTURE

Despite being multi-coloured biologically, the species chose to wear colourful clothing that included capes and clothes to drape over their tall backs.

These pacifist entities liked to carry staffs and blasters, not necessarily so that they could resort to violence, but rather that it was simply part of tradition.

Furthermore, their tall and intimidating frame often scared off most other species on their homeworld anyways, making these means of violence obsolete.

HISTORY
The Pitrillistia world is located in the Outer Rim.
Alongside many other species, it eventually fell prey to the Imperial faction in 4 ABY.
Fortunately, it was returned to neutrality in 7 ABY as it had little use to the Imperials.

Souleth’s author note: I’m going to nickname these the “Goliath'' species, and might venture on my own to learn more about their society since so little has been documented.
I might have to bring a droid to communicate with them though.
