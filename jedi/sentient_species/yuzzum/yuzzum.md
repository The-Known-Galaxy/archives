# Introduction
The Yuzzums were a sentient species, they were local to the Forest Moon of the planet Endor.
One Yuzzum individual named Joh Yowz who’d sometimes sang in the Max Rebo Band.
Yuzzums were shaggy- looking with fur covered bipeds with chubby bodies, who’d also had long legs which allowed them to run really fast and catch their prey on the Sanctuary Moon, planet Endor.
The sentient species Yuzzum’s hands were thin which ended in a four-fingered hand.
To describe how tall they were, they were taller than Ewoks.

# Section 1
The Yuzzums were expressed as “dreamy wanderers,” As for their society and culture, they didn’t have advanced stone-age technology like the Ewoks, whereas the Yuzzums used basic tools.
Their transportation were the Rakazzak beasts, as they domesticated them to hunt Ruggers who can also be known as rodents, Ruggers hid in tall grasses.
They were not only known for having basic technology but they were amazing singers as said, Joh Yowz who did love to sing in the Max Rebo Band.
They even could make greatly brewed Yuzzum wine, it was so overly strong that other species could not handle it safely, only when they mixed with sweeter wine from the Ewoks.
