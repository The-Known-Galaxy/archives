# Introduction
Part I
The Caarite were a species that originated from the warm planet of Caarimon which before the Clone Wars was being very polluted due to the Caarite who ended up making floating cities to help protect the animal life and plant life of their planet.
They had a unique set of two rows of teeth with their average height being three foot two.
The Caarite also couldn’t survive well in cold climates due to them being from a very hot planet.
The Caarite were usually a species with quite an eye for profit usually making shady deals with many criminal groups.
The consequence of these shady deals and  their short and friendly demeanor, they were barely ever trusted by outsiders.
The Caarite had their own language that was taught to them from birth named Caarimala; they also mostly knew Galactic Basic and some other language making them quite intelligent with communication.
They were also members of the Trade Federation but they were worried that the blockade of Naboo would destroy the Federation so they left and made their own cartel.
