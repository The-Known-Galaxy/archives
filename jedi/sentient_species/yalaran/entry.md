# Introduction

The yalaran were a sentient species located on the Wild Space planet, Yalara.
Jedi Master Broden Kel Verdox was worried the yalarans would not be ready to integrate into the galaxy at their state, and cloaked their planet.
Despite being hidden, an elite group of Nahgri commandos travelled to Yalara and slaughtered the Yalarans proceeding to guard the device after the eradication of the primitive species.

Yalarens, despite being classified as sentient, were a very primitive race compared to the other space faring species.
They had only reached a technological advancement that was hardly noteworthy.
Later around 14 ABY, a holocron was opened revealing the location of this planet once again to Tionne Solusar, a Jedi scholar.
Once the Jedi knew the planet had been discovered by another organization, Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker dispatched Jaden Korr to investigate this.
When he arrived, he encountered members of The Disciples of Ragnos, a sith cult unfriendly to the Jedi fighting against the commandos.
Korr defeated both fronts and warned Skywalker that this device would be too powerful to let fall into enemy hands, so he destroyed it with explosives.
Later on, Skywalker speculated that Darth Vader had discovered Yalara and commanded the Nahgri to eliminate the yalarens and guard the device.
