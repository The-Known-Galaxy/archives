# Introduction
Utapaun was a name for the two sentient species that thrived on the planet of Utapau.
These two sentient species were the Pau’ans and the Utai.
The Pau’ans were the aristocrats of Utapau and controlled most of the Government on the planet.
Before the Empire was formed, the Pau’ans had good relations with the Republic.
When Obi Wan Kenobi went to Utapau to confirm that the Jedi Hunter and General of the Seperatist forces was hiding on Utapau, he was greeted by a Pau’an named Tion Medon.
Medon told Kenobi that there was no war on Utapau unless he brought it with him, but this statement was a lie and Medon then whispered to Kenobi that they were being held hostage by Grievous and his droid forces.

# Section 1
The Utai were another native of Utapau.
The Utai were the workers and mechanics that shared their homeworld with the Pau’ans.
They were generally a peaceful race and were working most of the time.
They had a stubby appearance and their hands were stubby as well, having long fingers; they were well suited for work.
