# Introduction

Their species would be known to be ancient, Kwa’s was bipedal, meaning their species only used two legs to move around.
Kwa’s were just about three-meters tall, their skin was blue, and they had telepathic abilities.
These species could also run at incredible speeds.

# Section 1

The Kwa’s originated on their homeworld on Dathomir, located in the Outer Rim.
These species developed the Infinity gates witch allowed near-instant travel between various locations.
However, they could operate as superweapons, these superweapons would be stored in Star Temples.
This technology would build up the Kwa empire as the Kwa holdings.
When the Kwa’s have arrived on the planet Lehon, they encountered Rakata, and right away, the Kwa’s sensed that the native species were strong Force-sensitives.
The Kwa’s had made a grave mistake that day as they shared their knowledge of the force, and given advanced technology.

# Section 2

The Rakata would conquer and destroy.
In time, the Rakata would come to destroy the Infinity gates.
This led to a war between the Rakata and the Kwa.
The Kwa’s have begun to destroy or disable the Infinity gates on other world’s, whales they retreated from Rakatan aggression.
Kwa’s would eventually retreat to their homeworld Dathomir though some Kwa’s stayed on worlds such as Tython.
After the Infinity gates and Star Temples, Kwa set guardians to protect the Temples.
The Kwa’s was wiped out around the galaxy.
The remanding Kwa’s that survived the Nightsisters many Millennia later, they would fleed into the desert and form tribes, including the Blue Desert people and the Blue Mountain People.
