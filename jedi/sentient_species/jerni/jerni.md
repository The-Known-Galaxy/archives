# Introduction

The Jerni, who lived on the planet Jerne, once ruled over a glorious empire before being wiped out.
Shortly after the destruction of Alderaan, Lord Vader ordered a hunt for an eternity crystal once made by the Jerni that supposedly had the power to save Alderaan through time travel.
The Eternity Crystal, a relic that supposedly could reverse time to a critical point in history where time would then continue normally but on a different path.
Vader created many fake tapes that showed how the Jerni used the Eternity Crystal to reverse the war in order to gain peace.
This attracted many rebels, including Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, to Jerne to use the power of the crystal to save Alderaan.
