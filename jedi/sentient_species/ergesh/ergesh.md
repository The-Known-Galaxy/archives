# Introduction

The Ergesh were a sentient species indigenous to the planet Ergeshui.

# Section 1

The Ergesh were two meters tall and made up of plant materials.
Their sentient species were one of the few that evolved from plant-based organisms on their swampy homeworld Ergeshui.
Ergesh had unique ways of telling how old they were based on color.
For instance, the younger the Egresh, the greener it was, whereas the elder Egresh were browner.
The average lifespan of an Ergesh was 200 years, and a fully grown Ergesh could way up to half of a metric ton.
Ergesh would mate by planting a seed from their bodies into the Shoolbloorp Swamp during a special mating ceremony.
Ergesh had no concept of gender, meaning both Ergesh could produce one seed every two ergeshui years.

# Section 2

Even though Ergesh were bulky and heavy, their species could still float above water.
Not just this, but because of their physiology, they could breathe underwater, though they preferred dry land.
Ergesh had a thick layer of skin that acted as a strong protective layer against weapons.
Ergesh did not have faces.
They relied on sound waves for their sight.
These species could not be intoxicated or poisoned by most substances.
Their immune systems broke down such substances very quickly.

# Section 3

Ergesh were curious, intelligent, and gentle beings.
Their native language was basic.
It was said to sound like thick mud coming out of a rapid boil.
Ergesh personal names were long affairs.
As a species, they would be given nicknames that they would tolerate by off-worlders when dealing with them.

# Section 4

Every year on Ergeshui both moons would align on one day, making Ergesh act irrationally, violently, and even insane.
Ergesh was soon divided into 80 total clans, with each clan holding about 10,000 members.
Each of the eldest Ergesh from each clan would be a part of the governing body.
The Ergesh government met monthly in the communal pool.
Ergesh also kept in contact with the leaders of the New Republic to support the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.
In their dealing with each other, the Ergesh was nothing but fair and honest.
The Ergesh just wanted peace.
Ergesh also had great biotechnology of living starships called Starjumpers.
