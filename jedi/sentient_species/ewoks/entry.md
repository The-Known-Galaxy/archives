# Introduction

Ewoks were a small and hairy species that inhabited the forest moon of Endor.
These species were known for their medicine and other goods that appeal to otherworldly travelers around the galaxy.
They’re also known for their ancient tech and independent work.
An example of such ancient tech can be stuff like weaponry such as throwing spears, slingshots, and other early weapons that were used for conflict.
In other words, Ewoks are really skilled in outdoor survival and independent technology.

Regardless of their ancient gadgetry and remote homeworld, the Ewoks weren’t fully unknown throughout the whole galaxy.
The Ewoks who resided in Bright Tree Village, led by Chief Chirpa and their healer Logray, had contacts with many others outside their world.
This also includes species that resided in the forest moon of Endor such as the Yuzzums, Gupins, Lizard Warriors, and Teeks.
Unfortunately, only one type of species, the Duloks, rivaled the Ewoks and usually caused havoc for them.

During celebrations or any type of festival, the Ewoks usually like to sing and dance as a way of celebration and happiness.
It’s believed that music usually helps Ewoks enhance their work.
However, their instruments are usually self made due to them being resourceful and wealthy.
All the more, music to Ewoks is a way for them to get together in harmony and celebrate the things they’ve done.
