# Introduction

The Xaxax are a strange phenomenon of species that originate from the Unknown Regions.
Little is known about them, but that which has been documented is immensely interesting.
The Xaxax were a polar opposite of the Yuuzhan Vong, favouring technology and embedding it in every part of their society.
For unknown reasons, their civilization came to an abrupt end.
Fragments of their once great nation were left behind across many parts of the galaxy.

The Xaxax were sentient, and based on evidence, very intelligent.
Their technology grew to such advanced heights that they built a techno-world made of entire circuits and motherboards.
Their technology brought many traders to their world, which in turn made their economy flourish.

Other technological feats included their creation of many cures for horrid diseases, telecommunication devices, a massive space station and other entities.

Following their extinction, a group called the ‘Guardians’ prided themselves with the protection of the secrets of the Xaxax.
However, this false front of nobility was merely so that they could steal and pillage the technology.
Although their plight was good and pure at first, overtime, they merely stole the technology of the Xaxax.
Many used it to power their own spaceships, or sold it at foreign markets.
