In more further information, the appearance of the Nightmare demon were: A fur covered body, two tails, skeleton head and two hands with 4 fingers where their toes had only 3 toes.
Their toes were very much flexible which ended with a suction cup which made them able to stick on walls, etc with a better grip.
Their deep eyes would flash with a scary type of light, to show how small they could fit on a Human’s forearm.
The Nightmare demons in the galaxy evolved on the planet of Droxine, also located inside the Esstran sector of the Outer Rim of the galaxy.
By the name of this nearly mythical creature, it is clearly shown that they’re demonic, not angelic; the planet of Droxine is really close to the Sith Worlds.
In 3959 and 3956 BBY, the planet of Droxine was part of the territory taken by Darth Revan’s empire.
As said, it was believed that all of the Nightmare demons were completely wiped out before the Clone Wars, a not comparable argument that raged from 22 to 19 BBY which ended with the declaration of the new order made by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine in 19 BBY also known as Empire Day.
However a few demons did survive the slaughter such as Reist during the Imperial Period.
