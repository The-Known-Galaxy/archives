# Introduction

Faust were a tall humanoid sentient species native to the planet Adana, located in the Deep Core.
Faust often had a blue-grey skin, slendery look, double or sometimes possibly even more set of eyelids and some facial shapes including: long nose and large ears.
Apart from these features, Faust were almost identical to humans.
It was said that they often had to wear some sort of glasses or cybernetic eyes to see properly.
The reason for this was unknown, but the Faust believed that having double eyelids weakened their eyesight.

# Section 1

Faust preferred to rarely be in contact with the outerworlds to avoid being dragged to any wars or possible illegal works due to Faust being experienced in advanced scientific research.
