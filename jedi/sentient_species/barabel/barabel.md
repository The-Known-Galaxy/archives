# Introduction
The Barabel were a sentient reptilian species that lived on the dark world of Barab I, in the Outer Rim Territories.
During the day, Barab I’s red dwarf star Barab emitted radiation across the surface, so Barabel and other native nocturnal species had to seek shelter underground.
Growing up to 2.2 metres, they had a distinctive set of two-inch teeth and strong retractable claws, and their entire dark-coloured skin was covered in durable scales which could withstand a stun shot from a blaster.
Unique with two stomachs, the Barabel could consume copious amounts of meat, which coupled with physical features, allowed them to be naturally strong.
Led by a pack leader, Barabels lived in districts of up to 10,000 individuals.
They were renowned for being fiercely loyal and aggressive, while biological adaptations proved useful in hunting.
Individuals knew the language of Barabel, but most tried to learn other languages to communicate with the wider galaxy.
They didn’t have a sense of virtue like Jedi or other species had, often finding other people’s pain funny.
In the Barabel language, sounds for sadness and laughter had the same sissing sound.

# Section 1
Some time before the First Galactic Empire, Noga-ta and other Jedi Knights arrived at Barab I and settled a dangerous disagreement between the Barabel clans.
With the dispute settled, they deeply respected the Jedi and told stories of skilled “great warriors from the sky” over the ages, and began to trust the judgement of Jedi.
To many Barabel, this was the only contact with extraterrestrial species because most stayed on the planet, but some did choose to become mercenaries and brutes, while others chose to leave the planet and live on the swampy world of Abraxin at around 67 BBY.
It was some centuries later when Barabel began trading with other worlds, especially wildlife, hunters and Barabel commodities for weapons and metal goods, but they were still quiet on the galactic stage.



# Section 2
It wasn’t until the reign of the empire that conflict started to stir.
The Planetary Safaris company, backed by the Galactic Empire, saw an opportunity to use Barab I to illegally host hunting trips.
Captain Osted Alater was tasked to monitor the company’s investment in Barab I, and after discovering the Barabel to be sentient beings, the company was shut down.
The Barabel named their underground capital city after the captain, Alater-ka.
With attitudes of the species slowly changing, some Barabel were even taken in by the New Jedi Order, such as in the case of Saba Sebatyne who became a Jedi Master.
Eventually when the invasion of the Yuuzhan Vong arrived at Barab I, the Barabel experienced near extinction upon the invasion of the Yuuzhan Vong; only a few escaped the fires that enveloped their underground districts.
Not much is known of the Barabel species after these events.
