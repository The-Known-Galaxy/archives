# Introduction
The Sunesi were a humanoid amphibian species native to Monor II, with the strange ability to survive and breathe in the planets toxic air.
Sunesi had a diffuse nervous system and pink blood, as well as lungs that could take in the cirrifog air of their home planet.
At the age of 15 they enter a hibernation state and form a cocoon around their bodies, and then undergo a pupation period.

# Section 1
The Sunesi believed in reincarnation, a monotheistic religion that was formed based around the pupation period in their hibernation phase.
The Sunesi were not extremely prevalent across the galaxy, A Sunesi named Aqinos was Force-sensitive and raised to the rank of Jedi Master, shortly after being banished.
The Sunesi were capable of rendering electronic listening devices useless with their ultrasonic voices, involving the use of their large cranium, which resulted in the Galactic Empire and their agents referring to the Sunesi as “lumpheads”.
