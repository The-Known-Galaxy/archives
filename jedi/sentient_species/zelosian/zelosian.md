# Introduction
Zelosians are a race of sentient humanoid plants that hail from Zelos II.
They have characteristics almost identical to humans on the outside, except all members of the species have emerald-green eyes.
However biologically the Zelosians are very different to Humans; their blood is a chlorophyllic sap, the same green as their eyes, and a majority of their muscles are made up of cellulose fibers.

# Section 1
Similar to their Human counterparts, Zelosians are omnivores that are sustained by both meat and plant based substances.
However, Zelosians are unique in their biology as they can also, like a plant, photosynthesise using their skin to create energy for their body.
A notable Zelosian, Celot Ratua Dil, believed he could last up to a month or two by only consuming water and sunlight to photosynthesise rather than eating food.



# Section 2
Like many planets, Zelos II was subjected to ore mining by the oppressive Galactic Empire.
The Zelosian people were made unaware by the Galactic Empire that their efforts into extracting ore for them was to fuel the Imperial war machine.
After the Battle of Endor, Imperial presence was thought to have fled the planet.
Zelosian Galleros Nul declared himself to be the Mandated Commander of the people of Zelos through martial law; subsequently petitioning for Zelos II to be under the New Republic’s guidance.
