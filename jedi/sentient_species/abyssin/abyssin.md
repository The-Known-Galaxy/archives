# Introduction
The Abyssin species was a sentient humanoid species that lived on the planet Byss.
By the time of the First Galactic Empire, several Abyssin resided on the planets Phaeda and Dubrava.
Scaling up to around 2 metres, they exhibited a greenish-tan skin colour topped with brown or white hair and a distinctive singular eye.
The cycloptic species were normally seen as strong and are known for fast regeneration.
Due to these adaptations, an individual of the species was able to live up to 300 years.
The species was viewed as tribal, often reverting to the primitive ways of brute and violence, so was avoided by other species in the galaxy.
The Abyssin was known to have one name, such as Mador or Polcyc, rather than keep an additional family name like other species.
Communication between members of the species using the Abyssin language would be through the use of grunts and growls, though they were able to use symbols for written communication.
Nomadic tribes of Abyssin existed, and with the unstable resources on arid Byss, it didn't allow for a central governmental system to be established.
Tribes often clashed against each other in a fight for resources, called the Brooding - a fight that would involve warriors from each tribe fighting against each other.
The tradition was that the victorious tribe would claim the warriors of the losing tribe.

The Brooding often led to violent encounters with space-faring species, especially at times of scarce resources.
Even though this showcases the aggressive nature of the species, Abyssin tribes did collaborate peacefully through trade, if both parties had enough resources.
When Abyssin individuals became elderly and lost their regenerative power, they would either volunteer themselves to die in the desert or by their tribe.
First discovered between 15000 and 9000 BBY, the Abyssin were highly cautious with explorers like Arconan scouts when they tried to communicate.
To create relations and trust with the Abyssin, the Arcona shared their desert survival skills.
Hearing of the strong primitive species that inhabited Byss, travelers soon came to export Abyssin individuals off the planet as slaves.
Some were able to escape slavery, becoming bodyguards or mercenaries to survive in the galaxy.
Due to their brutish strength, some Abyssin were often deployed in several battles.
