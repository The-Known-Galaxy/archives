# Introduction
Native to the planet of Dathomir, the Rancor was a semi-sentient carnivorous reptomammal known for being utilized as mounts by the Nightsisters of Dathomir.
Standing at a startling nineteen meters in height, these colossal predators weighed in at several thousands of kilograms in the larger specimens.
While native to Dathomir, many adventurers found instances on various worlds ranging from Lehon in the Tempered Wastes to the core-world of Corulag.
Rancors were also known to some cultures to provide a rare delicacy, raw rancor-beast liver.
Rancors born on Dathomir were noted to have the ability to communicate amongst one another orally, providing a form of transmission of history from one matriarch to the next.
After mating, Rancor eggs were usually produced in pairs, with each hatchling standing at three meters in height.
These hatchlings would cling to the mother, one on the ventral and one on the dorsal until reaching maturity, in which case they'd go hunt on their own.

While it was notably seen as bipedal creatures, the Rancor was known to walk on all fours, especially while carrying their young.
Rancor flesh was able to deflect blaster bolts, which made them a target for sport hunters who would turn their hide into vests and boots for commercial sale and personal trophies.
Oddly enough, a symbiotic relationship between gibbit birds and Rancor exists, where the birds would clean the Rancor's teeth.



# Section 2
One of the many subspecies of Rancor included the Bull Rancor, which was found most commonly on Felucia, with some instances found on Dathomir.
While ordinarily solitary creatures that threatened even the mightiest of their native kin, they guarded the legendary "Rancor Graveyard" of Felucia communally.
Denoted by their much more pale complexion, an elongated tale with males having massive horns, Bull Rancors are genuinely one of the apex predators of the galaxy.



# Section 3
The Felucian Rancor was another subspecies of Rancor, which, while being of the same planet as the Bull Rancor, was usually the same size as the typical Dathomirian Rancor.
These specimens possessed a single horn and a rigid set of spinal plates.



# Section 4
The Jungle Rancor was another subspecies native to Teth and Felucia, possessing brightly colored flesh, sharp spines that run along with most of its body, and its webbed fingers and toes.
One specimen was noted to be on Dathomir, although those present stated that it was not native to Dathomir.



# Section 5
The Je'daii Order engineered a species of Rancor through alchemy at Anil Kesh on the world of Tython.
This subspecies came to be known as the Rancor-Dragon, possessing large wings and head tendrils.
There are no recorded sightings beyond that of ancient Tythonian scriptures.



# Section 6
Finally, there is the Tyrant Rancor, which was native to Dathomir and was noted as being of gargantuan proportions.
Known to grow almost twenty-meters in height and weighing in at nearly thirty tons, the Tyrant Rancor was the largest apex predator on the planet, capable of preying upon even other rancors.
