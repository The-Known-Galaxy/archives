# Introduction
Enzeen were a very hard species to find, as they were very rare and lived on the planet D’vouran, which was a planet that ate almost everything besides the Enzeen.
The Enzeen had dark blue skin, and instead of hair they had several needles with sharp ends on its head.
In Project Starscape, which was an attempt to take over Enzeen, Borborygmus Bog found the Enzeen and studied them.

The Enzeen would also be used as a distraction to come to the planet, allowing the planet to eat however it came.
This is possible because the Enzeen are a very rare species, and very few people ever saw an Enzeen.
The Enzeen also had a special connection with the planet, the planet would give the Enzeen food as a reward for gaining the attention of people and letting them come to the planet.
On top of that, Enzeen had a forcefield, protecting them from being eaten by the planet.
People also believed that the Enzeen came from another world, that or they were either created by something unknown.
