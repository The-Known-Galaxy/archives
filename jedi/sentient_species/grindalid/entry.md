# Introduction

Grindalid was a large slug or worm that was about 2 meters in height and was mainly carnivorous.
When in sunlight, these worms would burn, similar to a vampire.
This is because Grindalids have skin that is sensitive towards sunlight.
Grindalids also had several worm-like arms that helped them with utility and transportation.
A notable member of this species was Lady Proxima, the founder and leader of the White Slugs, a crime organization on Corellia.

# Section 1

Grindalids were similar to insects, and due to their native planet, Persis IX, they often had blisters when exposed to more light then they were used to.
In order to prevent this, they wore coverings and long coats.
Upon birth, Grindalids lived in pools until they were old enough to leave and walk.
Grindalids could also imitate and perfect human walking, as well as taking humanoid shape by putting on the armour and coverings they had.
The mother of a Grindalid would treat the young Grindalid by giving it small portions of meat for it to eat.
