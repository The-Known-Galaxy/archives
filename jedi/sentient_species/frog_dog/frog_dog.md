# Introduction
The frog-dogs were a species of sentient lizards that shared the characteristics of both frogs and dogs, hence their name.
They sported a bulbous head, long tail and two hands that they used to support their own body.
The frog-dogs had spiked teeth and a protruding tongue to support their carnivorous diet, made up predominantly of insects.
The creatures had no language of their own and communicated by producing hisses, hoarse croaks and barks.

As early as 3653 BBY, a large population of the galaxy were familiar with the existence of frog-dogs, although only a minor fraction were aware of their sentience.
The creatures themselves encouraged the misconception of them being unintelligent animals and used this to their advantage.
A large number of frog-dogs worked as spies and assassins but were frequently ignored as simple pests, enabling them to effectively infiltrate restricted areas.
 Many others allowed themselves to be the pets of wealthy owners, guaranteeing themselves a secure food supply and protection from their masters.
A notable frog-dog by the name of Buboicullaar lived as a pet in the palace of Jabba the Hutt and conspired to assassinate the notorious crime lord.
