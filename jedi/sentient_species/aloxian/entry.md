# Introduction

Aloxian was a species from the planet Zav Alox.
The young Aloxians wore a significant helmet that was made from the skulls of the voduun crabs.
These sentient species were born with so much strength.
Most of the Aloxian soldiers were children.
During the High Republic Era, there was an Aloxian named Qort who was a Jedi Knight.

# Section 1

Most Aloxians had blue skin, white hair, and brown eyes.
They were not able to speak the normal Galactic language, but their language was what they could speak instead.
Most Aloxians were very naturally violent and were born with amazing physical strength within them.
The Patrolian Farks decided that the reason they were so powerful was because of the voduun crabs that were everywhere on Zav Alox.
Some Aloxians could be Force-sensitive.

# Section 2

The Aloxians had their rite of passage, when they were young, they had to go out and try and murder a voduun crab, and if they succeeded, they had to wear the skull of the crab that they killed.
They believed the skulls calmed them and helped their aggressive natures.
The Farks believed in the skulls, and the beliefs in the skulls were why there was never a civil war within the species.
They believed that when their heads greatly grew and broke their helmets, it represented the Aloxians becoming their true and full selves.

# Section 3

Sometimes the Aloxians were captured as children and sold due to the fact they had great natural strength.
Sometimes they removed the childrenâ€™s skull hats to make them feel more murderous.
