# Introduction
The P’w’ecks were a species that originated from the planet of  Lwhekk, located in the Ssi-ruuk Star Cluster in the Unknown Regions.
Measuring at 1.6 meters the P’w’eck were distinguishable from other species from their homeworld due to their short tail and three-lidded drooping eyes.
The species was first discovered in 4 ABY on the outer rim world of Bakura, in servitude of another species known as the Ssi-ruuvi.
At the age of 15, P’w’eck would undergo a process of “ Enteched '', where their minds would be transferred into machines such as a  Ssi-ruuvi Battle Droid.

However, due to their religion, the P’w’eck thought that it was their duty to serve the Ssi-ruuvi, as in a few of their myths it was believed that the galaxy was founded by 4 eggs, and 1 of the eggs hatched into the god of the P’w’eck “P’w’itthki” and another into the god of the Ssi-ruuvi “Ssi”.
It is also stated that Ssi fought with P’w’itthki and defeated him, and allowed his children, the P’w’eck to live if they served the Ssi-ruuvi for the rest of eternity.

But in the end, it was a genuine P’w’eck uprising which gained the P’w’eck their freedom, as the P’w’eck were under the leadership of the clever P’w’eck Lwothin, an acclaimed prophet of the P’w’eck.
This was surprisingly an accident that the revolt had ever happened, as during the invasion of Bakura, Lwothin accidently shot and killed the leader of the Ssi-ruuvi, named Keeramak.
He then decided to order all the P’w’eck slaves to rise up against their oppressors and, when this worked, they fled to Bakura to find somewhere to repopulate and regrow their species.
