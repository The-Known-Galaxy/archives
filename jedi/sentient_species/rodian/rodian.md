# Introduction
A native of the Tyrius system's Rodia, the Rodians were a species of reptile humanoids.
Known for their distinct physical features and green skin pigment, the Rodians were infamous for their violent culture.
The harsh living conditions in the jungles of their homeworld forced them to develop cunning hunting tactics, which eventually led to the development of a culture that revolved around violence and death.
Despite their notorious reputation as bounty hunters or criminal henchmen in galactic society, Rodians produced artists, merchants, and politicians, some of whom were found even among the upper classes of the Core Worlds.

# Section 1
Rodians were green-skinned reptilian humanoids with distinctive facial features.
They had huge, round, multifaceted eyes, tapir-like snouts, and saucer-shaped antennas on the tops of their heads that detected vibrations.
Their skin had a rough, pebbly texture, except on their hands and snouts.
Their adaptable snouts collected and filtered the air, enhancing the Rodians' highly developed olfactory senses.
They could see into the infrared section of the spectrum, allowing them to sense the body heat of their hiding prey emanating from within the darkness.
Most Rodians kept in good condition due to their love of fighting and active lifestyles, while some became obese, typically those who could hire others to fight for them.
Rodians typically possessed green skin, but pigment variations were widespread, ranging from disfiguring birthmarks to coloring of the entire body.
Rodians possessed long, dexterous, sucker-tipped fingers, which denoted an arboreal lifestyle, allowing them to grip trees and rocky inclines.
Their skulls were crowned by a ridge of flexible spines that varied in volume, length, and even color.
Some Rodians also grew hair, which was more common among females.
Breasts and mammary glands served as other physical marker for females.
Rodians emitted a pungent, musky odor, which was an oily pheromone discharge that moisturized the skin and attracted possible mates.
The aroma defined identity, indicating to Rodians about a person's ancestry and breeding.



# Section 2
Rodian culture was shaped by their harsh environment, which required them to be skilled hunters and fighters to survive.
Their hunting practices and obsession with violence and death were ingrained in their ancestry, making the hunt central to their culture.
Over time, Rodia was dominated by a few powerful clans that eliminated or enslaved their smaller neighbors.
The leader of the most powerful clan proclaimed himself the Grand Protector of the Rodians, and subsequent Grand Protectors ruled all of Rodia as dictators.
The title of Grand Protector transferred from clan to clan as power and loyalties shifted.
Not all Rodians that made it off-world were bounty hunters or artists.
Some were refugees from clan feuds who left Rodia illegally in search of asylum.
Illegal immigrants and their descendants born off-world could travel the galaxy freely and work in various professions, from peaceful merchants and technicians to arms dealers and criminal henchmen.
Rodian authorities treated off-world-born Rodians as alien galactic citizens, and illegal immigrants were generally not permitted to return to Rodia.



# Section 3
The Grand Protector Navik the Red of the Chattza Clan governed the Rodians under the Galactic Empire.
Navik tightened emigration limits and forged alliances with the Black Sun and the Galactic Empire after provoking an inter-clan war and capturing power.
Navik brutally tormented his opponents, executing the entire Tetsu Clan.
The genocide was not limited to Rodia; Chattza hunters pursued Tetsu refugees off-world.
Navik’s reign came to an end when the Yuuzhan Vong invaded Rodia on their march to the Galactic Core, enslaving the population.
Under the guidance of Master Shaper Taug Molou, the extraterrestrial invaders intended to form their Rodian captives into lethal war beasts.
Molou disassembled his Rodian test subjects on a cellular level, reassembling their genetic code with parts from other organisms.
The Vagh Rodiek, mindless warbeasts that moved on crab-like legs and had half-meter-long sharp bone scythes in place of arms, were the product of this experiment.
Natural Rodian head-spines were modified into razor-sharp quills.
Rodians who managed to flee Rodia became refugees from persecution.



# Section 4
Rodians had a strong association with the criminal underworld, with many pursuing careers in off-world crime.
Rodians like Hulas, Menndo, Hako Armado, and Slyder all made names for themselves as successful bounty hunters.
The bounty hunter profession also led to the formation of many armament companies on Rodia, such as the Salus Corporation and Sancretti Arms & Munitions, which produced popular weapons like the N'Gant-Zarvel 9118 heavy carbine and the Repulsor throwing razor.
Apart from bounty hunting, Rodians were involved in other forms of criminal activities, such as piracy and organized crime.
Some Rodians became very successful in this underworld, such as the Black Sun Vigos Dardo, Clezo, and Avaro Sookcool.
Others, such as Reelo Baruk and Ne'Chak, formed their own criminal enterprises, frequently employing a large number of Rodians as lackeys.
Many Rodians were Force-sensitive and were members of the Jedi Order.
Dree Vandap participated in the New Sith Wars during the Old Republic.
A Rodian Jedi also took part in the Yinchorri raid on the Jedi Temple, the Battle of Geonosis, and the First Battle of Kamino.
Later, many Rodians like Kelbis Nu, Jovan Drark, Toile Senn, and Twool were all educated as Jedi Knights in the New Jedi Order.
