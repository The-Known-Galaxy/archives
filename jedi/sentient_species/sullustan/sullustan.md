# Introduction
The Sullustan are a humanoid species inhabiting the Sullust System in the Western Reaches of the Outer Rim.
They are commonly known for their wide jowls,  round chins, and large, dark eyes.
Sullustans are also famous for their engineering skills, many served as rebel fighters, pilots and officers during the Galactic Civil War and the New Republic era that would begin after the Battle of Jakku.
Many of them are professional engineers and designers.
Interestingly, the profession of Sullustan barbers is also respected for their famous skills.

# Section 1
Sullust, the natural environment of the Sullustan, was a volcanic planet located on the crossing of many important trade routes such as the Rimma Trade Route, Hydian Way and Nothoiin Corridor.
The atmosphere of Sullust was highly toxic and barely breathable for humans, which could be seen taking effect of the Sullustan natives, enhancing their ability to see without light.
Despite the planet’s dangerous nature, it was abundant in various mining resources.
The surface of Sullust would also be rich in natural caverns, later  utilised as a home to the natives.

Because of the mentioned harsh environmental conditions in which the Sullustan would live, members of this species have developed an underground network of tunnels serving as their civilisation’s foundation.
The state of Sullust’s atmosphere impacted its natives’ facial features, and living in the darkness improved their hearing and vision.
Because of the evolution, the Sullustan would develop defections during their first contact with sunlight.
It caused many of them to wear special goggles in order to protect themselves from these harming effects.
Because of their life in the tunnels, they became especially skilled at crafting arts, and especially mining.
The skills of orientation and improved hearing were also used by many Sullustan pilots who served in the Rebel Alliance.
The skin colour of Sullustans ranged between pink and pale, with only certain members of the species, mostly females, possessing hair.
It is important to note that the Sullustans’ first contact with the galaxy was said to have happened during their early collaboration with the Jedi.

Its placement near the planets Eriadu and Ord Ibanna allowed the planet’s economy to grow quickly.
Additional skills in crafting, tunnelling, mining, and engineering would soon turn Sullust into a capitalist society and caused Sullustans to earn a reputation as renowned merchants in the galaxy quickly.
Although the Sullustans would not travel away from their homeworld often, a few who did were respected for their adaptability and intelligence.
Two great examples of such individuals are Nien Nunb and Mayjeln.
A traditional Sullustan Warren-clan would consist of a female head of the family, a few husbands, and fathers, and their children.
Female members of the society were privileged to choose a mate, with whom they would create a new generation of Warren-clans.
Another important aspect of Sullustan culture was the concept of death.
Sullust, because of its cave systems across the globe, was said to have had a giant impact on the natives’ perspective of death, which resulted in almost all Sullustan tombs being dug and placed underground.
Such a procedure, called the tomb-walling ceremony, involved gathering the dead Sullustan’s relatives and organising every family member to place a stone block in the tomb’s foundations.
The youngest children would be the first ones to commit to the project, while the oldest members were tasked with finishing the tomb with their bricks.
