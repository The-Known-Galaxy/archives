# Introduction

The Gamorrean Species were sentient based on their average intelligence and capability of possessing emotions.
The species resembled that of a green-like swine along with humanoid characteristics.
Most of the race resided on the planet of Gamorr, an Outer Rim Planet.
The breed was most known for serving as personal guards to the Crime Lord, Jabba the Hutt.

Most known Gamorreans were rather tall as well as bipeds..
On the contrary, the species had conspicuous tusks out of their jaws.
The skin developed a sort of greenish, pinkish color without any observance of hairs.
The species distinguished two classifications of genders: the male type labeled as boars and the woman type labeled as sows.

# Section 2

Based on the research found, the Gamorrean species were believed to follow a clan-based society.
Most Clans were led by a Matron (female) as well as a Warlord (male).
The sows of the civilisation mostly farmed and hunted, whilst the boars waged wars and conquered new territories.
In spite of this, the community was still considered a matriarchy.
As the Matrons chose their Warlord through the criteria of combat skill.
Furthermore, Gamorreans were creatures with a basic intelligence mindset, therefore they tend to be stubborn and display strict loyalty.
In addition, the species hold their own type of dialect even if it only consists of squeals and grunts.
Finally, the race has trouble pronouncing other foreign dialects.
