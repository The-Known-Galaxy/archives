# Introduction
The Kumumgah were a civilization that once lived in the rich jungles of the planet Tatooine,  as claimed by  the Legend of Lehon.
However a B'omarr monk had stated that there wasn’t much evidence to support their existence.

Not much is known of the species.
The Kumumgah were known to be somewhat technologically advanced; so advanced that they even managed to develop space flight and started colonisation on various worlds against the discretion of the Elders of their species.
 As a consequence of this, the Rakata, a warrior race aligned with the dark side of the force that focused on conquering and enslaving, took notice, thus dominating the Kumumgah species and annexing them to the Rakatan Empire (also known as the Infinite Empire).
Over some time the Kumumgah attempted to rebel against their captors, failing miserably which led the lush world of Tatooine to be bombed by the Rakatan Empire this left it a desolate, dry desert planet.
The Kumumgah eventually evolved to species that commonly inhabited the planet due to the extreme climate change.
They were the Jawas and Sand People (Ghorfas).
