# Introduction
INTRODUCTION
A strange, fearsome and mysterious species, the Starweirds portrayed the characteristics and nature of the name given to them.
They appeared out of the stars, having no origin or homeworld and appeared at random on ships in hyperspace, or doing repairs in deep space.
The creatures had eyes that reflected light, platinum white hair that spiralled around their skulls and a thin skeletal frame.

Their bodies were unnatural, as if they were held together by thin layers of leather.
The Starweirds arms were long and ended in (3) claws that they used aggressively in their assaults on prey, since they were violent in nature.

The species is ironically known for hating force-sensitives, despite being force sensitive themselves.
They are powerful, harnessing multiple abilities that include force grip, lightning, sight and drain.

A notable Starweird is called the Starweird Queen who attacked the Jedi Council during the Great Galactic War.

BIOLOGY & APPEARANCE
These creatures having no origin, could be found exclusively in the infinite void of space.
Their skin was white and pale, which amplified the appearance of their bone-like structure.
It’s not confirmed, but many reports of those who encountered the species claim that the face of the creature morphs into their own, reflecting their faces.
This makes them terrifying.

Furthermore, the creatures have rows of fangs which complimented the talons on their hands.
Forcefields could prevent them from entering ships, but they had the ability to dodge and pass through most physically solid objects.

The species glided across areas of space, as opposed to bipedal walking.
This made them silent, and also slightly faster than humans.
They had no linguistic communication, but were regarded as intelligent nonetheless.


Just as they appeared out of nowhere, when they die, they leave no clues to that fact.
They simply vanish into the void of space unto which they came from.

BEHAVIOUR
The creatures aren’t known to be actual hunters of space travellers, but whenever they’re spotted they assume an extremely hostile approach.
They emit a telepathic scream that horrifies nearby entities within (20) meters.
This meant that the scream could be heard within the vacuum of space, despite there being no oxygen to carry sound waves.

Upon grappling with a victim, the species would tear them apart with its claws.
The species would focus all its energy on the force sensitives present if there were some presente.
This evidently proves their hatred as previously mentioned.

HISTORY
Jedi that studied this mysterious set of entities through some analysis have suggested that the species originate from a pure manifestation or output of the dark side.
This has never been proven but there is some merit when closely looked at.

During the first war between the new Sith Empire and the Republic, the Starweird Queen attacked the Jedi Council and a padawan titled Xerender.
Being force sensitives, this made them natural targets.
However, Jedi Master Wyellett rescued them and consequently protected them.

Unfortunately, in this conflict, he was captured by imperial squadrons.
However, they made it out successfully.

Souleth’s author note: I believe this species would be tremendously interesting to some xenobiologists.
I’m not sure how frequent their assaults are on spacers, but it would perhaps be for the greater good to discover some sort of detergent.
At the very least, the hypothesis that they come from the dark side of the force, should be looked into by the Jedi High council, as these beasts are dangerous.
