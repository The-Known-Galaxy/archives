# Introduction
INTRODUCTION
Stemming from the planet Nevoota, the Nevoota species were insectoids.
In contrast to most insectoid species within the galaxy, these were not hiveminds and for some undocumented reason were considered to be the most dangerous, and fearsome in the entire galaxy.

This unfortunately attracted the warmongering Mandalorians who engaged in war with the entities for a very trivial reason of simply testing their forces.

This (3) year war ended in the outright extinction of the Nevoota.

BIOLOGY & APPEARANCE
Within the insectoid species category, it is further divided into classifications, of which, the Nevoota were Vespid.
This means they were characterised by a set of (2) wings, a single stinger on the abdomen, and angled arms and legs that ended in dual grips with (2) talons each.

The colour of the species is undocumented, but it can be assumed that they were gray in colour.

Their stature and height was similar to that of an average human when taking into account their war with the Mandalorians.

HISTORY
Deriving from the Balmorra system of the Colonies Regions, these species were originally rumoured to be the most deadly in the galaxy.
This rumour originated from the Old Sith Wars, and little else has been documented as to why.

In 4024 BBY, the Mandalorians crusaded across the Nevoota homeworld to test the battle prowess of their Mandalorian Crusader corps.
This was to firstly, test the rumours of the Nevoota, and secondly, hone the skills of their own armies.

The Nevoota were led by Itchcharaka for (4) years, and he was regarded as strategic and intelligent.
Despite outnumbering the Mandalorians, and not fearing death, the Nevoota simply chose to evade and feign the Mandalorians right until they were hunted into extinction in 4021 BBY.

This war strangely defined the Mandalorians who marked the momentous occasion as historical in their culture.
It led to them glorifying the idea of death, and it now makes them famous for not fearing death either, but desiring it in a glorious way.

An Acclamator-class assault ship was once named the “Nevoota Bee” during the clone wars, and probably was attributed to the concept of not fearing death.

Souleth’s author note: “eponymous” is the term you use to explain the phenomenon of naming planets the exact name as their species.
This is incredibly common across the galaxy, and this term conveniently explains it.
