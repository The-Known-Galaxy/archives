# Introduction

Kitonaks were a species of sentient beings from the planet Kirdo III.
Their unique physical and psychological characteristics made them fascinating creatures.
These beings had a pudgy body, tough skin, and two pairs of lungs that allowed them to survive in the harsh desert environment of their home planet.
They were known for their extreme patience, musical talents, and nomadic lifestyle.

# Section 1

Kitonaks were little, stocky beings with two-toed feet on one leg and three fingers on both arms on the other.
Their skin color varied from off-white to pinkish.
They had thick skin that could fold to close weak gaps, keeping them safe from the harsh environment of Kirdo III's deserts.
Their twin lungs could hold oxygen for up to four hours, allowing them to hold their breath for extended periods of time.
Their mouths, ears, and eyes could all be closed, and they were all incredibly small to be seen with untrained eyes.
Kitonaks walked slowly, either by contracting and stretching their foot muscles or slithering slowly in a prone position.
They had a keen sense of smell, which was centered in sensory organs in their feet, allowing them to sniff their prey through the sands without being affected by the desert winds.

Kitonaks were very patient and never rushed.
This was due to the fact that they fed on creatures known as chooba, and they had to remain motionless for an extended period of time until a chooba approached them.
They lived in nomadic bands of approximately a hundred Kitonaks, following chooba herds as they migrated.
Kitonak technology was limited to crude, temporary tools and musical instruments due to their nomadic lifestyle and the tendency for their possessions to blow away in windstorms.
Their tribes were joined in a global participatory democracy; however, slow communications and meticulous thought processes meant that choices took years.
The "Telling of the Story" was the highlight of a Kitonak tribe's day.
Each night, the members of the tribe would take turns at storytelling, with each Kitonak adding their own details and plot twists.
A single story could take several nights to come to a conclusion.
These legends instilled in young Kitonaks the importance of patience.

Rain came once every ten years to their land.
Kitonaks went to the suddenly filled riverbeds for the "Great Festival of Life," leaping into the riverbeds for the "Dancing of Love" when this happened.
Females would emerge with newborn infants at the completion of this mating rite.
For the first year of their lives, Kitonaks clung to their mothers, later becoming strong enough to stand on their own, even during windstorms.
Kitonaks would reach full adulthood by the age of nine.
More daring nine-year-olds would flee overcrowded tribes to roam the desert in quest of less crowded tribes.

Kitonaks followed a deity called the Cosmic Egg.
Caves were thought to be portals to their fabled underworld, and no Kitonak was supposed to have returned from them.
The only other thing that upset them besides caves was quicksands, a more tangible danger on their homeworld, since predatory creatures able to swallow a Kitonak whole lurked within.
Kitonaks stuck in quicksand would easily wait patiently until help arrived, but the help was usually slow to arrive.

Kitonaks were noted for their talent as musicians.
Their musical instruments were often crude and temporary, made from materials found in their desert environment.
The Kitonaks used a musical language called H'nemthe that was based on their own unique tonal system.
They were capable of producing a variety of sounds and rhythms with their instruments, which included drums, flutes, and stringed instruments.

The Kitonaks were also known for their love of dancing, and their music often played a central role in their celebrations and festivals.
One of the most famous Kitonak musicians was Droopy McCool, who played the red ball organ and led the Max Rebo Band.
