# Introduction

INTRODUCTION
“The Millenia Species” often lived to over (1000) years old.
A variation of the humanoid species, and originating from Draethos (note that many homeworlds of species are often simply the same name as the species itself.) These relatively tall creatures have little documented about them, but the most famous of their species was Odan-Urr who essentially placed them on the roadmap.

He founded the Great Library of Ossus and is a symbolic token of the kind of culture and society that the Draethos have.

BIOLOGY & APPEARANCE
Carnivorous and predatory in nature, these species could be blue, purple black and in rare cases, even pink in colour.
They had a thick leathery skin that related to their reptilian ancestors.
Furthermore, due to having inherited the characteristics of many other species that lived underground, they have intensely trained night vision.

They had four-fingered hands that were connected by amphibian webs.
The same could be said about their feet, as they were bipedal creatures.

The Draethos had remarkably long lifespans, reaching adulthood at the standard age of (18) but only being considered “middle-aged” at (400) years old.
Another (300) years and they began their elderly journey as an “old” member of society.

The species, and their constituents are characterised by war and strategic intellect.
On top of this, the species prided itself on partial telepathy whereas they could communicate with individuals from far distances but could not actually read their thoughts.

SOCIETY & CULTURE
Long living Draethos established a society that took millenia to transcend to new ideas, and grow out of old generations.
This meant that the ideas and traditions of elders remained in usage for hundreds of years.

Most members of society were expected to engage in training, conflict, and hunting.
Many evolved from this, but became entitled and egotistical elitists who centralised around their social score.
Primitive concepts such as gladiators, and mercenaries were prominent in this society.
To further attribute to this, pacifist and peaceful ideologies were ridiculed by the Draethos.

This was to such a significant extent, that Draethos who wandered from the warlike mentalities were exiled from the world as a whole.

This ultimately meant that Draethos encountered outside of their homeworld demonstrated much intelligence, calm and the desire to pursue peace.

Souleth’s author note: Odan-Urr was one of these exiles, and despite this he built a magnificent library.
He is a perfect example of the concept that you do not have to be a product of a failed homeworld or society.
Make one's own legacy, as they say.
