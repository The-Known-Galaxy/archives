# Introduction

The Sentient mynock is related to the mynocks, they can also be called silicon-based sentient invertebrates.
They evolved on an isolated asteroid in the MZX32905 system; a star system in the Outer Rim near Bimmiel.
The creatures preferred their asteroid as their home, whereas is influenced by the dark side of the Force; it may also be called “the Home”.
The Physical characteristics of the Sentient mynocks was that they had triangular shaped yellow eyes, some even had hands on their wings (wingspan approximately 2 metres) and their skin colour was brownish tan.
Something unique about these creatures is that they have a very unique language meaning they use telepathy to speak, forcing their words in someone's mind.
It was to believe these creatures subsisted off stellar radiation and silicate materials, by predicting so the creatures lived on an isolated asteroid influenced by the dark side of the Force meaning the dark side energies made these creatures evolve.
Another reason that they could not reproduce anywhere else but “the Home”, that act was called “the Return.”

Throughout this culture it was fairly advanced, in point of their history the aristocracy retreated into the asteroid caverns; oxygen for mynocks effectively cutting themselves off from stellar radiation that they needed to survive, causing them to become exiles in their own caves starving to death.
One of the creatures had gotten the knowledge to tap in the dark side of the Force whereas which is already influenced in “the Home.” Eventually to become leader of the exiles, also getting new found powers causing to take on the other creatures living on that asteroid’s outside.
The powers were capable of many things, including: relying energy from living beings over huge distances also meaning their own sentient mynock.
In the end, they were extinct, causing them to be discovered by Sith Lord Darth Vectivus.
