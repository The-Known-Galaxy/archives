# Introduction

The Vors are a sentient species of reptilian creatures that lived within Vortex, a planet within the Glythe sector in the Mid-Rim, who possessed leathery wings up to 3 metres in wingspan.
Although possessing wings, Vors live underground in hummocks among others of their species.
Vors’ wings and hollow bones are adapted to the strong gales of their homeworld, allowing them to easily manoeuvre through the air even better than that of someone piloting a ship in the atmosphere.
Through evolution, the Vor species has adapted to the clean-pollution free air of Vortex.
This unfortunately gives the Vors a weakness to respiratory diseases in polluted environments outside of their homeworld.

They are typically seen as callous and emotionless by humans despite their ability to create music that is seen as beautiful by not only the Vors but other species too.
This musical talent is engraved into the creative, hard-working culture of the Vor species; their ‘Cathedral of Winds’ is famous for the beautiful music it plays as Vors fly through the doors and windows, playing the colossal building like an oversized organ.
The complicated structure of the cathedral is a compliment to the species intelligence; often compared to the Cerean’s level of reasoning.

# Section 2

Originally, the Cathedral of Winds was seen as a myth across the galaxy.
This changed when the Vors joined the Old Republic; Vors started performing an annual concert for the galaxy in which they played beautiful music that gained it enough reputation to be considered one of the Republic’s ‘Twenty Wonders of the Galaxy’.
Whilst the Galactic Empire was in power of the galaxy, Vors refused to play their annual concert as they spited the Empire’s rule.
The concerts soon began to happen once again.
Unfortunately, the original Cathedral of Winds was destroyed by Empire remnants in 11ABY.
Despite this, the cathedral was rebuilt and annual concerts continue to be performed.
