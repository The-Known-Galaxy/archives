# Introduction
The Voss were a sentient, humanoid species native to the planet of the same name, their capital city was Voss-Ka.
The Voss live in a totalitarian society defended by the Voss Commando and ruled by the Force-wielding mystics who served as seers and healers and whom the other members of the species considered infallible.

# Section 1
Originally the Voss is an evolved species of Gormak, this change happened when the Jedi arrived on Voss and started teaching on how to use the Force to some of the Gormak tribes, these tribes evolved to become the Voss.
They were born with a high rate of Force-sensitivity who displayed prominent sexual dimorphism.
The make Voss had blue skin and bright orange eyes, while the females had red skin and azure eyes.
They also don’t have distinct pupils and possess unique patterns of markings on their face, neck and body, this is a trace of their shared ancestry with the Gormak.
 The Voss voices had a slight mechanical tinge to it, making them sound like a droid or a machine.
With Training the Voss was able to access the Spirit World that existed on their homeworld to appear in faraway locations or to manifest as spirits after their death.



# Section 2
The Voss was mainly isolated on mountain-top city Voss-Ka and was literally outnumbered on their homeworld by the other nativ sentient species, the Gormak who were extremely hostile towards them.
The Gormak considered the Voss as an aberration to be eliminated.
 The Voss society tries to survive their constant struggle against the Gormak, the main protectors of the Voss were the Voss commandos, they are trained as scouts and in hand-to-hand combat and were ready to sacrifice themselves to protect the peoples.
The commandos were dispersed with multiple fortified positions across the wilderness of Voss.



# Section 3
The Voss were governed by the Three, who were chosen for either years, weeks or even hours according to the visions of the Mystics, the Three administered Voss-Ka, made policy decisions and coordinated the war against the Gormak.
The Voss laws were specifically for offworlders as they know the Voss will not violate any ruler's edict.
Despite this totalitarian nature of the government, the Voss was generally pleased with the rules of the Voss Mystics.
