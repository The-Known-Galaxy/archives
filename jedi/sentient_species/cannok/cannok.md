# Introduction
Cannoks were small predators native to the moon of Dxun.
They were aggressive to most species on the planet but were relatively harmless to Humans.
Due to a high rate of reproduction, Cannoks were considered pests but were able to survive most environments and the rigors of Dxun and were known for traveling in large packs.
They were squat and bloated with yellow-green dull hides that they used to see.
They had four, broad feet that contained sharp claws.
They had small tails as well as a ridge traveling down their backs, as well as sharp teeth that laid mainly at the bottom of their jaw.
Especially when traveling in packs, cannoks were un-frightened and not startled easily.

# Section 1
They were never known for disturbing large settlements or parties but were very known for attacking smaller groups made up of different species.
Despite their lack of attacking humans, some able-bodied men have been known to be killed by the beasts, using their sharp-teeth bottomed lips to bite into their prey.
They also survived the Mandalorian wars and even became quite an annoyance to numerous Mandalorian outposts in the area.
Many Mandalorians hunted the beasts down and killed them, but the Cannoks in the area never diminished due to being a quickly-reproducing species.



# Section 2
Cannoks, like most species on Dxun, were omnivorous.
This resulted in them eating anything they possibly could find.
Most sentients considered them pests, due to their tendency of eating tools or even eating components to ships, including phase-pulse converters.
Despite their pest activity, Cannoks were also shipped to, and used on several different planets to help boost their ecosystems.
This included the planet of Telos IV, a planet that was bombarded and destroyed by Darth Malak.



# Section 3
During its restoration, which was under the oversight of the Czerka Corporation and the Ithorians, Cannoks were shipped to the planet to boost its ecosystem, and to keep the herbivore numbers balanced to keep the last little bit of plant life on the planet intact.
The plan didn’t go as planned, as the Cannok numbers grew significantly on the planet creating a food shortage for all the natives.
The Cannok population soon took over the ecosystem due to its consistent growth, leaving no food left for the natives, and the Cannoks.
