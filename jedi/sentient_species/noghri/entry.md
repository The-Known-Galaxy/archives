# Introduction

The Noghri were a sentient species native to planet Honoghr within the galaxyâ€™s Outer Rim.
They were often described as humanoid, hairless, bipedal creatures that ran on all fours.
The Noghri were capable of giant leaps at a time, as well as their excellent agility.
The Noghri made exceptional trackers due to their amazing sense of smell.

# Section 1

Due to their excellent tracking skills and traversal, the Noghri were skilled assassins.
Skilled in both stealth and hand-to-hand combat.
The Noghri were vicious killing machines, incredibly strong, with razor-sharp claws and a sense of smell so strong they were said to be able to smell which family you hailed from.

The Noghri were notably smaller than most other species; however, this lack of height only improved their ability to stay hidden or move around faster.
A stern species, they rarely showed emotion or humor.
They preferred to use primitive weapons such as knives, spears, and their own claws or fists as opposed to more standardized technology in the galaxy, such as blasters, plasma rifles, and lightsabers.

# Section 2

Noghri were a species of honor and loyalty.
They had developed clans that were like close families.
Each of these clans would do anything for the other.
Fight for each other, kill for each other or die for each other.
It was very rare for a Noghri to be disloyal.
If this were to happen, it would not be anything to be forgotten easily.
