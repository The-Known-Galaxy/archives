# Introduction
The Diathim were winged humanoid species that lived on moons.
Their legendary appearance was spread throughout the galaxy by space pilots from the Core to Outer Rim Territories.
Most of the stories were about their height and beauty, their white silvery glowing skin, and the six beautiful wings on their back that resemble those of an angel.
This angel-like species lived on a planet named Iego, which resided on the fringes of the known galaxy.
In the surroundings of the planet were thousands of moons, and living on these moons was the Diathim.
They specifically lived on the moon Millius Prime.
Eventually, the planet and the moons were destroyed by a LaserWeb Defense Station, which was deserted by the Separatists.

# Section 1
These mysterious species, who lived alongside the Maelibi, have a bright blazing white with a yellow tint aura.
They were thought to be made of pure energy due to their bright aura.
However, due to their intense radiance, it would become a challenge to write out their biological details.
From the many accounts who have seen them, they were thought to be two to three meters tall, slender, with six beautiful white wings protruding from their backside.
An example of a Diathim, seen by Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and two other Jedi, described her with wings, milky white skin, blond hair, light blue eyes, a tiny nose, and long limbs.
Though many have different observations of the species, it was no doubt that they could fly and glide through the air.
Their capabilities allowed them to even go out as far as space without using protective gear.



# Section 2
Although the Diathim were described to have an aura of kindness, they were very infatuated with spacecrafts.
This prompted them to occasionally mob those who came by and hypnotize the pilots of these spacecrafts that came around their planets and crash them.
For this sole reason, they were regarded as dangerous creatures.
Because of this reason, not many came by, so their planet's habitat was unknown.
It was believed that they had no language of their own; however, they were aware of the Galactic Basic Standard.



# Section 3
Long ago, when the Diathim evolved on the planet of Iego, they began to inhabit their 42 moons.
There they lived alongside the Maelibi, tall burrowing beings that ate castaways.
They have been known since 25,793 BBY.
At this time.
the Galactic Basic had yet to be normal.
and so with the language at the time, a “space angel” referred to an innocent and selfless person.
Millennia later, in the Clone Wars, some Diathim were forced to leave as the Separatists installed a laser grid system onto the planet, forcing people to stay on the planet.
However, this contraption was deactivated by the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, as requested by Diathim refugees.



# Section 4
On the planet Tatooine, young Anakin Skywalker had mentioned the Diathim before.
This was when he saw the beauty that is Padme Amidala.
He compared her to the Diathim after hearing about their beauty from various pilots and traders.
