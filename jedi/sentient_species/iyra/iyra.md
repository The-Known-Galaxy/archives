# Introduction

Iyra, a species of sentient cephalopods.
They were from the water planet F’tral.
They each had four limbs that spread from the radially symmetrical body.
The Iyra had a mouth, and had one eyestalk that grew for each tentacle.
As they grow older, they get more limbs and eyes.
They had leathery skin which was elastic, they could also change colors which helped them camouflage.
Although they were known as an aquatic species, they were able to survive on land.
Iyra was governed by a rigid caste system, the more tentacles you have you will be at a higher position.
If an Iyra was careless enough to lose a tentacle through an accident or combat, they have to destroy an eye which would put them in a lower caste.
The lowest caste was composed of four-armed Iyra, who were responsible for raising the young.

# Section 1

The Iyra had round bodies with tentacles around the base of their body.
They were covered in rubbery skin and could change colours, the change of the colour of their skin helped them camouflage at times, they could blend themselves as the environment around them.
They didn’t change into only one color but many, they could have stripes, patterns and many more in the individual’s control.
An Iyra had at least four tentacles which were flexible, elongated body structures that were in a conical shape which flattened out at the undersides of their tentacles.
They had two rows of suction cups that lined up at the bottom of each tentacle, which allowed the appendages to serve as fine manipulators.
Each tentacle was paired with one eyestalk, which had a sclera and a pupil, which was also protected by heavy lids.
They had a flexible body, which allowed them to squeeze and move freely, this gave them a great swimming speed.
