# Introduction

The Elomin was a species native to the planet Elom, sharing the planet with another species also called Elom.
The Elom lived underneath the ground, meanwhile the Elomin lived on top.
Most Elomin had reddish or orangish-brown skin, however there are a few that have different tones of skin, such as a dark shade of purple.
Similar to the Zabrak and Dathomirian, the Elomin had horns around the top of their head, as well as tusks in the nose.
They grew to 1.6 meters and lived for about 110 ten years on average.

# Section 1

Elomin had quite a different anatomy than the regular human.
It consisted of 4 stomachs and 6 hearts, plus pointed ears and spanchons.
Elomin were an advocate of personal hygiene, as they cleaned themselves a countless amount of times.
On top of that, Elomin were near perfectionists, as they tried to put order into anything they could, which often led to many mistakes.

# Section 2

When the Elomin first settled in Elomin, they did not have any knowledge of the life forms living beneath them.
The reason behind the Elom going underground was due to lack of water, therefore they had no choice but to go underground.
After finding the Elom, the Elomin decided to imprison them, and act as if they were and fit to do labor.
This was quickly established when the Galactic Republic found out.
The Elom were freed soon afterwards, but the Elomin still were in power.
In the Galactic Empire era, the Elomin were forced into slavery.
The Elom made several attempts to liberate the enslaved Elomin, and were mostly successful.
After the fall of the Galactic Empire, both the Elomin and Elom started living together, much differently than before.
