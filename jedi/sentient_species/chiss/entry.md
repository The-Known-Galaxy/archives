# Introduction

The Chiss were a human-like sentient species.
They usually had blue skin, dark blue hair, red eyes, and came from the planet Csilla.
They formed tightly-knit families that dominated their society.
The Chiss Ascendancy, their governing body, was located in the Unknown Regions and had very little contact with the rest of the galaxy until Grand Admiral Thrawn rose in the Galactic Empire.
Before that, they were considered a legendary and mysterious civilization within the Unknown Regions.

They were often mistaken for Pantorans, though they had distinct features like red eyes.
Chiss possessed enhanced senses compared to humans, with sharper hearing and faster reflexes.
Force-sensitivity, known as Sight, is very rare among them, mainly manifesting as precognition (Third Sight) and telepathy (Second Sight), which is almost exclusive to females.
When Chiss age, their Force abilities usually lessen and in the end, disappear.
The secrets of Second and Third Sights are well-kept within the Chiss Ascendancy, with many Chiss unaware of their full extent.
Force-sensitive Chiss girls are trained as navigators for their fleet in the Unknown Regions, known as ozyly-esehembo or “sky-walkers” in Cheunh.

# Section 2

The Chiss Ascendancy’s ruling class was known as the Aristocra, with the Chiss Syndicure serving as the supreme parliamentary and executive body.
Their military consisted of the Chiss Defense Force and the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet.
The Chiss were renowned for their military might and doctrine in the Unknown Regions, leading to legends of them as noble blue-skinned warriors among species with no direct contact.
The primary Chiss language was Cheunh, but they used trade languages like Meese Caulf, Taarja, Sy Bisti, and Minnisiat in rare contact with outsiders.
Chiss names were multisyllabic, consisting of three parts, with shortened variants used for convenience.
Chiss were omnivorous and consumed foods like yubal, cheese, and plant products.

# Section 3

The Chiss hailed from the planet Csilla in the Unknown Regions.
They were called “The Chaos” because of the region’s hazardous navigation.
In the past, the Chiss had contact with the greater galaxy and were involved in ancient wars between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.
Eventually, they withdrew from the galaxy and sealed their borders.
They were ruled by the Chiss Ascendancy during the Republic and Imperial Eras.
Even with their secrecy, one Chiss named Mitth’raw’nuruodo, or Thrawn, became a Grand Admiral in the Galactic Empire and participated in combating the early rebellion.
Some Chiss individuals, like female mercenaries and spies, had interactions with the greater galaxy during the Galactic Civil War.
