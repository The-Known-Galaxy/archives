# Introduction

“You have to understand that Bothans think in terms of political and persuasive influence, not military power.
The typical Bothans goal is to go through life getting more and more people to listen to what he has to say.”
Sena Leikvoid Midanyl.

A proud and cunning species originating from the Bothawui planet and its constituent colonies.
Bothans resemble a hybrid of various feline and canine species which compliments their characteristic nature of choosing politicians and spies as their favoured jobs.

# Section 1

Bothans and their culture presided over an ancient text called “The Way” which ultimately stated that the pursuit of power and influence was integral to the life of a Bothan.
It has moulded and shaped the Bothan’s legacy both culturally and historically.

The Bothans had developed an extensive spynet that had its roots in most political areas ranging from the Galactic Empire to the New Republic.
Their species favoured the side that gave them the most political influence or power.
However, their Spynet aided in the defeat of the Death Star thus the New Republic has been in their debt.

Interestingly, the Bothans have a survivalist state called “ar’krai” which is essentially a compulsory call to conscription.
Every single Bothan regardless of health state, gender or age had to engage in military combat to ensure the survival of the species.
The last time this was used was during the Yuuzhan Vong war.

Bothans speak a language called Bothese, with the written form assuming the name of Botha.
Their government system is similar to that of the Jedi in the sense that they’re led by a Bothan council.
The population is divided into various clan and family names, and their military comprises of several corps with different purposes.

# Section 2

In conclusion, Bothan’s are an interesting and diverse species that the Order should engage in negotiations with, provided that the sceptre of caution is held on to tightly.
