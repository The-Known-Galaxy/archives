# Introduction
Most commonly native to the planet Coruscant, Humans were bipedal, social, and incredibly intelligent.
While most Humans tended to live on Coruscant, many still lived on other planets such as Tatooine, Alderaan, Naboo, and Jakku.
Being one of the most common species in the Galaxy, Humans lived on almost every colonised planet.

# Section 1
Because of their prevalence in the galaxy, there were many Force-sensitive Humans throughout the Jedi and Sith Orders.
Some of these Humans would go on to shape the very future of each order.
Along with being seen throughout the Jedi and Sith Orders, Humans were also very prevalent during the Clone Wars.
Each clone trooper is a clone of the Human Mandalorian male, Jango Fett.



# Section 2
Many in the galaxy were considered “Humanoid.” These creatures were Human in shape but far different from actual Humans.
These could be bipedal, sentient creatures; while similar to a Human in appearance and sentience, there would be features on the species that would differ from a Human, such as horns, markings, scales, tails, and so on.

Humans require a bare minimum of water, food, and oxygen.
Without these necessities, a Human would not last long.
The skin of a Human could vary from a darker tone to a lighter tone.

From politics to the military to science, Humans covered many careers, with many of them being famous in their specific fields.
The Galactic Emperor himself was a Human male hailing from Naboo.
Along with other species in the galaxy, Humans have shown to be sensitive to the Force.



# Section 3
Some notable Force-sensitive Humans consisted of Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight.
His son and daughter, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa were also Force-sensitive and proved themselves to be strongly connected with the Force.
Because of the number of Force-sensitive Humans, there were many in each order that would go on to prove excellent in their specific duties.


Some of these Jedi and Sith included the likes of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Human male from the planet of Stewjon; Mace Windu, the Master of the Jedi Order; Darth Sidious, the Emperor of the Galactic Empire; and finally, Darth Jadus, a Dark Lord of the Sith during the Great Galactic War.
