# Introduction

The Gerbs were a sentient being who comprises the hares, rabbits and pikas species; native to the Moon Yavin 13.
Theyâ€™re basically look-alikes with rabbits and hares by being covered with fur, large pink ears and huge black eyes.
Gerbs live underground in warrens, mostly with ten family members, keeping each other safe.
They usually hop around and practice easy farming on a number of grasslands of the desert moon.
They are also a very smart species meaning they have their own language: squeaking Gerbese language and the hissing Slithese language, spoken by the Sliths.

# Section 1

Gerbs were able to live in peace and health with the Sliths, as both species Gerbs and Sliths usually left eachother alone.
Each of them have a certain type of unique power but knew not much about offworld affairs and technology on Yavin 13.
Gerbs were immune to Slith bites which were venomous to other species.

Worldwide, there were 24 million Gerbs, 19 million Slith in total 43 million sentient beings.
The Yuuzhan Vong invaded Yavin 13 and the Yavin 8 with no life remaining, also meaning the extinction of Gerbs and Slith.
