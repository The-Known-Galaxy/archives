# Introduction
Devaronians, humanoid sentient species that originated from the planet Devoran.
They spoke Devaronese and Galatic basic.
They were Carnivores so their diet consisted primarily of meat and almost no plants.
Although they were humanoid their body structure was different.
They had the usual head, hands, legs, feet, and torso just like humans do: but they had some extra things along with that.
Devaronians had sharp teeth and also had ears that pointed out.
Devaronians had black-colored blood due to different chemical compositions and had two livers.
They are known to be resistant to poisons and high temperatures.

There were only two genders of them male and female, males had horns and no hair; females had hair with no horns.
Devaronians had a higher average force sensitive population than most sentient species.

# Section 1
On the planet Devoran they lived in a matriarchal society.
Females had most of the power and influence in society and in government.
It was thought that males weren’t actually exempt from rising in power, they just preferred not to and were often nomads instead.
They explored different places while staying loyal to their family at home.
Though lots of them were force sensitive, the Jedi or Sith way never really applied to their society so there were very few that ended up trained in the force.
Their passion for exploring was very strong as they were known to create their own hyperdrive systems without input from any outside populations.
Due to this, it was likely that you would encounter a few of them during your own travels.
However, since The Clone Wars, they aren’t seen as often.
