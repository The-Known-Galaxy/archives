# Introduction
The Kintan Crushers were a species native to the planet Kintan.
Similar to the Kintan Strider, the species was semi-sentient, however the Kintan Crushers were often more intelligent then the Kintan Striders.
This is simply because the Crushers had the ability to follow orders and the Striders often did not.
The Crushers had spikes down their spine, and their skin was mostly gray or brown.
On top of that, they had enormous fists that they could use in combat and whatnot.

# Section 1
The Crushers were mainly used for brute force, as their upper body was extremely strong, although they had smaller legs.
Crushers came in many sizes, as some of them were taller than many humans combined.
They also had 4 claws on each of their hands as well as 2 sharp teeth.
When running, they combined both their legs and arms to propel themselves forwards.
Some Kintan Crushers were even able to cause earthquakes, using their arms.



# Section 2
On Kintan, the Crushers would often be in small groups, however, it was not rare to see a Crusher by itself.
The Crushers would hunt for food, with the support of their aggressive traits.
Many Kintan were used by the Hutt Cartel, for example, the palace of Kaggara, on Nal Hutta.
They were used as enforcers, and they were trained by handlers.
The Kintan Crushers also went by many names, such as the Kintan behemoth and Kintan warhounds.
In battle, the Kintan Crushers used their fists to harm enemies, or knock them down and then proceed to stomp on them.
Crushers also used rocks and boulders as a weapon that they could throw at a target.



# Section 3
When Kintan was showered with an extreme amount of radiation, it caused many mutations, creating species such as the Spine Dragon through evolution.
The Nikto hunted the Spine Dragons into extinction, as well as the Kintan Striders, however a few striders were able to escape, as they had some defensive ability.
In a war between the Hutts and Xim The Despot, the Hutts had convinced the Nikto to join their side.
Soon after this, the Third Battle of Vontor occurred, and the Hutts gained victory, expanding the Hutt Space.



# Section 4
Beyond their home planet, on Nal Hutta, the Hutt Kaggara placed many Kintan Crushers as a defense.
The most terrifying of all the Kintan Crushers of Nal Hutta, was the Foreman Crusher.
The Foreman Crusher guarded a droid factory owned by Kaggara, but was taken down and chained by a few Twi’leks, until he was needed.
Soon, some hostile infiltrators would successfully bypass the many Kintan Crushers, which led to the release of the Foreman Crusher.
The Foreman Crusher was killed and allowed the infiltrators to push forward in their invasion.
