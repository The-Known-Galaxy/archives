# Introduction

The Yinchorri are a reptilian, humanoid race resembling a turtle, born from eggs, living on the planet Yinchorr.
The Yinchorri lived in different city-states where they had their own different rules, military, leaders, etc then other city-states.
They had very thick and rough skin being the colours brown, or dark green.
They stood at 2.7 meters, or 8 feet on average for both male and female Yinchorri.
They divided themselves into two breeds, the intelligentsia, working on government of the Yinchorri and their homeworld, and the warrior caste, those being the most vitous of the Yinchorri.
The Yinchorri were Force Sensitive creatures, making them immune to the Jedi mind tricks, it also creates a force-devoid bubble around them where people wouldn’t be able to use the force past that point.
It’s believed they evolved in their time to resist force users such as Jedi or Sith.
The Yinchorri believed if one was not vitous, violent, and aggressive, they would be deemed as unworthy.
Due to these beliefs, it made the Yinchorri race even more vicious and dangerous.
They were very manipulative, which is why, during the Galactic Empire’s reign, they aided Emperor Palpatine in the Galactic Civil War.

While working for the Empire, they lended their planet for Imperial Agent Training Camps, the Empire left Yinchorr alone besides the Training Camps.
The new Governor of Yinchorr captured members of the Council of Elders of the Yinchorri people in exchange for Princess Leia Organa, the Yinchorri accepted, without knowing the Governor wouldn’t keep their word.
They lured her to Yinchorr, telling her they’d join her, she accepted to come to the planet.
When they got close to landing, TIE Fighters shot the ship down, killing the Yinchorri pilots and leaving Leia Organa alive.
Once the Yinchorri people found out what happened, they attacked the Governor and all Empire camps on Yinchorr and defeated them, taking control of the planet and making the Elders of Kol-Kachom the leaders of Yinchorr.
They became a part of the Alliance, aiding them like they aided the Empire.
The Empire soon found out about their actions and decided to punish the Yinchorri people for treason.
The Empire sent TIE Bombers and completely destroyed the planets, Rebel bases, and most of the Yinchorri.
All surviving Yinchorri became nomads and traveled the galaxy.
