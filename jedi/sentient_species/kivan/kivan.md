# Introduction
The Kivans were peaceful and kind people, native to the Planet Kiva.
The Kivans were known by many as artists and architects, as they had lots of knowledge.
“A beautiful civilization thrived on Kiva” - Kivan Wraith, soon to end in such chaos and sadness.


When life on Kiva was cleaned off from an experiment, they appeared as dark shadows with red eyes.
A lot of this was blamed on many people, not knowing who started the experiment.
They believed that Mammon Hole,  one of the scientists, was involved in the dark experiment and the fate of Kivan, leading him to be killed when he arrived on the planet many years ago.
Soon to be known, Borborygmus Gog was the true one to blame, also a mastermind of Project Starscream.
They all tend to meet at point upon him, and the Kivan ghosts along with Borborygmus Gog vanished without a trace to where he was located.
