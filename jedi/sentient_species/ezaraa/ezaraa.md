# Introduction

The Ezaraa species was a sentient humanoid species that lived on the planet Ezaraa.
Not much is known about their visual features, but they were often seen with armor to reflect their warmongering nature.
Being a violent carnivorous species, they formed into a dominion on two continents of the planet Ezaraa.
This group exhibited xenophobic thoughts in their goal to overthrow the Galactic Empire that had invaded their planet - they would consume the flesh of all the lesser species and take over the galaxy.
Steps taken included trade.
The dominion visited the Auction of the Rur crystal containing the Eternal Rur, the artificial intelligent conscience of former Jedi Rur.
He attempted to trade the sentience to Doctor Chelli Aphra for 0.00001% of their Imperial revenue.
Before the auction could be useful for the Ezaraa, the Eternal Rur was able to escape its container and promised to seek revenge on those who attempted to buy it.
It gained control of several droids, including a Cyban Front droid.
The result was the massacre of the Ezaraa, alongside the other buyers, in the Skirmish aboard the Sorca Retreat by the gunfire.
