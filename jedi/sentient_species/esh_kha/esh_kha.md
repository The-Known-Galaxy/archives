# Introduction

Even the Rakata hated the Esh-kha, to such an extent that a war was waged upon them that engulfed the entire galaxy.
This is a good foundation to understand when looking into and investigating the essence of the Esh-kha.

These alien species were parasitic in nature and eventually imprisoned on Belsavis a millennium ago to contain their violent nature.

# Section 1

The Esh-Kha, alike to many species in the galaxy, are humanoid.
They however exhibited features resembling a horse with rounded muzzles.
They also walked exclusively on their toes.
The species had gray-skinned and brown-skinned variants with muscular legs and harshly carved out foreheads.

# Section 2

Similar to the Killik, the Esh-Kha embodied a hive society meaning that their thoughts, ideas, beliefs, and characteristics were replicated across every individual in their species.
Females were used often for the sole function of breeding.
The Esh-Kha were efficient in their functionality, often breeding individuals who grew up into roles that they fulfilled for their entire lives.

This included Force-sensitive savants, skilled warriors, and patriarchs who acted as leaders.
The Esh-Kha were unique in the sense that names were not given at birth, but rather gifted to them once they exhibited special abilities.
“Razer mind”, “Water Thinker” and “Swift blade” were examples of this.
These names allowed Esh-Kha to mould into certain individuals who were recognised for their talents through their names.

The Esh-Kha are believed to have become violent simply for their distaste towards non-hive-like species and thus imposed their wrath on these “inferior” nations.

# Section 3

At one point, and following on the quotes listed above, the Esh-Kha were seen as the most feared species in the galaxy.
This is evident in the carved writings on the Belsavis prison walls.

The Esh-Kha in their history had wiped out countless civilisations, and campaigned ruthlessly into many unchartered territories.
The species was eventually collectively led by the “Hallow Voice” , a united leader who encouraged the nation to adopt a more peaceful approach.
This had its downfall though as a massive surge of population ensued.

The Hallow Voice responded by taking a large portion of his followers to settle on other worlds.
Despite this move to peace, the Esh-Kha are still widely regarded as violent and aggressive individuals.

The Rakata, a feared species as well, angered by the Esh-Kha’s expansion, created a large invading force to stop the Esh-Kha.
It was successful and drove them to close extinction, the remaining survivors were imprisoned as previously mentioned on Belsavis.

A hologram was cruelly placed on Hoth that illustrated the thousands of Esh-Kha who were being punished on Belsavis.

# Section 4

During the Cold War, the Esh-Kha were freed from their stasis and consequently resumed their conquest of the galaxy.
With this, they gained more fearsome technology and might which further amplified their campaigns.

The Sith also aided them in their escape, whereas the Esh-Kha gained Rakata technology and devastated neighboring systems.
The Sith had a surprising interest in the Esh-Kha and Darth Synar had been noted as wanting to conscript force-sensitive Esh-Kha into her armada with a subjugation device.

# Section 5

These species were immensely involved with the Rakata, Jedi, Sith and various other nations.
They are ancient and worth studying in terms of strategy and how to deal with hive-like entities.
Their war-mongering tendences nearly shattered the galaxy, and are an exceptional case whereas negotiation wouldn’t work.
