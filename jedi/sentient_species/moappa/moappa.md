# Introduction
The Moappa is one of the most intelligent species that lives in the seas of Mon Calamari.
They formed a sentient group of intelligence from the mindless creatures.
There were millions of these glowing creatures in the ocean, they were seen as harmless at first.
When threatened, they would form into large groups forming enormous group organisms to defend.
If one dies, they would be easily replaced.

# Section 1
Moappa were a primitive invertebrate species.
An individual Moappa had a cone shaped head with several small tentacles at the base with one large tentacle at the centre of the base.
They were a glowing light pink species with a delicate appearance.
An individual Moappa alone is completely mindless, but if that Moappa was surrounded with many more Moappa they would have a strong connection together which would increase their intelligence.
Sometimes they could be seen in a humanoid form, others as a series of long connected chains of Moappa.
This species can split into pieces and be re-combined.
If one Moappa has been destroyed, others can fill in the gap.
They communicated through telepathy; they could also project their thoughts to other non-Moappa.
But unfortunately for them, they were unable to read minds.
