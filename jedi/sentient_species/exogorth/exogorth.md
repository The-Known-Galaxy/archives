# Introduction
An Exogorth was an enormous slug that lived in asteroids.
These space slugs often moved to other asteroids to hunt or to live in.
It lived off of smaller life forms in space, as well as parts from broken ships that happen to come near.
Most Exogorth were about 10 meters in size, albeit there are some that grew much larger.
Exogorth had an average lifespan of 30,000 years, making them one of the longest living species.

# Section 1
Many Exogorth had different appearances, or variants, for example Cularin slugs or the Crimson slugs.
Crimson slugs had a dark red line outside their body that went from top to bottom, therefore establishing their name.
Another variation, the Giant slugs were space slugs that grew much more than the regular Exogorth, up to 900 meters.
Many of these large Exogorth were found throughout the Algunnis system.
Exogorth, being space slugs that would eat almost anything it could find, were also used as a defense, by plotting many Exogorth around a certain planet or location.
By doing this, it was extremely rigorous to get through, being an excellent defense for those who managed to do it.
Some also figured out how to control many features of the Exogorth, such as its hunger and size.



# Section 2
In reproduction, an Exogorth would split into two more similar slugs.
Once being split into two, unlike other species, the Exogorth would go off and find an asteroid to make a home in.
Rarely, once an Exogorth starts to molt, it would grow to extreme sizes, becoming a Giant slug.
However in most cases, the Exogorth would grow up to be around the size of the previous Exogorth that it split from.



# Section 3
The Exogorth used their sense of smell, or its ganglioni to hunt for prey.
It used the friction of the asteroids and launched themselves from the asteroid for transportation.
Exogorth also had 4 hearts, as well as an esophagus.
Space slugs’ main predator was the Colossus wasps, which grew to 1000 meters in size.
In some extremely rare cases, an Exogorth would have a mutation that allowed it to grow to a kilometer.
These Exogorth would have many life forms living inside its belly, creating an ecosystem.
