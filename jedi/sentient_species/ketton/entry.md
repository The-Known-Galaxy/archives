# Introduction

These sentient mammals, also known as Ketton, have an average height of one point three to one point seven meters and are native to the planet Ket residing in the Inner Rim.
The Ketton prefer to seclude themselves similarly to nomads, as they wander the Great Dalvechan Deserts.
Correlating to their tendency to explore the deserts, the Ketton have slit-like eyes and large fangs that help them to adapt to the harsh weather for a long period of time.
Despite the Kettonâ€™s frightening appearance at first glance, they are a reposeful group of people and usually have a preference of not resorting to their fangs in combat.
Ironically, even though the Ketton have a reclusive way of living, a Ketton would not hesitate to help out their fellow brethren from any danger.
