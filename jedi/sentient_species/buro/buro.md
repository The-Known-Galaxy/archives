# Introduction
The Buro were a species of sentient insects, as it was considered ethereally beautiful by other species.
The Buro were native to Kaisa, a planet located in the Corva sector of the Outer Rim Territories.
The Buro has never been offworld, but their homeworld received some visitors; humans in a geological survey starship, Destroying their forests leading to the extinction of Buro species.


In 24 ABY, an anti-human organization was aware of the extinction of the Buro and the crew.
They were called the Diversity Alliance.
Leader of the Alliance was Nolaa Tarkona, tasked the Chironian operative Lusa with clearing the navigation computers of the survey crew’s starship for their next jump to hyperspace.
However,  Lusa was not ready to go through with this “act”, where she confessed her sabotage to the Diversity Alliance before getting ready to jump to hyperspace.
