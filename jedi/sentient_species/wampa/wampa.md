# Introduction
The Wampas were native to the frozen planet of Hoth in the Outer Rim Territories.
They are known to be ruthless in catching their prey.
Their diet was essentially anything that they could find on Hoth, most commonly, Tauntauns.
Their white tatted fur kept them warm in the freezing temperatures, and they dwelt in caves to avoid the snow blizzards.
They were very aggressive, and they were notorious for leaving messes as they used their claws to tear open carcasses, leaving lots of blood.
If caught, they are sold on the Invisible Market to Crime Lords, who used them as cage pets to murder the unlucky specimen to end up in there.
They were feared within the Galaxy but made great hunting prey for the Trandoshians in their arenas.
Their notorious sheer brutality made anyone quiver once they set their eyes on a Wampa, knowing that it was the last thing they were going to see.
