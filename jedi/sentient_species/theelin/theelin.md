# Introduction
The Theelin were a sentient human-like species with an unknown origin, renowned for their vibrant hair and patterned skin.
The species consisted of pure-blooded individuals like most other species, but also included hybrid individuals.
The possibility of breeding between Theelin and other near-human species gave every single Theelin unique characteristics such as different numbers of fingers/toes and differently shaped horns and was responsible for the diversity.
The only feature that seemed constant was that they grew to about 1.7 metres as adults and that most spoke the Galactic Basic Standard.

# Section 1
During the First Galactic Empire, their colourful appearance and notable sense for fashion allowed the Theelin to be ideal performers, such as in the case of the female religious singing group called the Divas.
However, Theelin hybrids faced discrimination even if they were loyal to the empire.
The Theelin Shug Ninx is an example of someone who stopped working with the Empire because of this.



# Section 2
In the subsequent years of the empire, mutations in the Theelin’s gene pool arose which caused individuals to become infertile.
To crimelords like Ingoda the Hutt, the Theelin became more priced as commodities than individuals, leading to more enslaved Theelin.
Even after several methods to save the species through breeding with other near-human species, more and more were unable to have children as time went by.
Eventually, the rate of infant death was so high that the population couldn’t recover its numbers; it was predicted that they all died out by 10 ABY.
