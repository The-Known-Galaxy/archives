# Introduction

The Revwien were a sentient plant-like species that originated from the jungle planet of Revyia which was located in the Veragi Sector of The Outer Rim.
They got their mobility from the large leaves sprouting from their cylindrical shaped body which also gave them the senses of touch and smell..
They were heavily nomadic and believed in the philosophy of Tyia which said that all species had a spiritual bond with each other and was also the Revwien word for breath.
The Revwien had good reputation with them even helping Jedi after Order 66 had struck the Galaxy.
There were some force sensitives in their species who all seemed to heavily believe in Tyia.
They were a very colorful species as they had many color variations including but not limited to red, yellow, blue and green.
Where most species head would be located, the Revwien had a large seed cluster which is presumably how they reproduce.

Revwiens believed heavily in honor and were a friendly species with them usually helping everyone in need.
Most Revwiens also had their truthfulness as their weakness as well with them being brutally honest with answers to questions or statements.
They were very unsettled by the idea of death being eternal and usually were stressful in violent situations.
Due to the Revwiens being so plant like they were often hunted by the Herbivores of their homeworld who mistaken them for being plants making them have to be semi-nomadic so they can get away in dire situations where their life is on the line.
Most of the time to get out of these attacks the species tamed wild carnivorous animals to protect their camps like a large wolf like species native to their land named the Urpine.

Once the Revwiens made contact with outside worlds they were fascinated by their technology like blasters and ships as they usually used other plants in their civilisation.
They used them for light sources and other things including even weapons with an example being seed pods that they threw similarly to a grenade.
Even though they were very excited by the thought of heavily advanced technology they didnâ€™t feel very safe when seeing ships flying in the orbit of their homeworld due to it being able to kill many of them effortlessly.
Eventually the Revwien expanded all over the galaxy to spread the word of Tyia to people and to help Jedi who they believed were given their power by the being who created all.
Eventually Tyia was one of the only Force beliefs that was openly practiced under the empire with the empire not enforcing its downfall.
