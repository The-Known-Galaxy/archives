# Introduction

The Baragwins were reptile species, they are designated as Sentient species because they had the ability to think, communicate, and create tools.
They were located inside the Epsi Collective sector on the planet named Old Barag.
The Baragwin were large species with their skin color dark olive and gray, a very well known characteristic is that they have yellow eyes.
However, there are not any differences between female and male Baragwins they look the same with a big head and their well known yellow eyes and dark skin.
The Baragwin skin has a feature to deflect many physical attacks, they could also sense feelings with their nose.
The biological benefits of the Baragwins led many Baragwins to become criminals and bounty hunters.

A well known Baragwin is Hermi Odle a male Baragwin who was working for Jabba the Hutt, he was a weapon specialist born and raised in the sand planet of Tatooine, his early life shouldnâ€™t be good, because we know that the conditions of life were very poor in Tatooine that's why the most criminals and bounty hunters are hiding in Tatooine.
Hermi Odle being raised on this planet made him become a gangster and work with Jabba the Hutt, a famous crime lord.
Sadly Hermi Odle found a tragic death on Tatooine at 4 BBY.

Baragwins were also talented weapon smiths.
