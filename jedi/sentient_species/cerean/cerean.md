# Introduction
Cereans were humanoid mammalian species native to planet Cerea.
These species were very cultured, distinguished and quite intelligent.
Cereans held large binary brains located in their tall heads, which allowed them to have spectatural thinking abilities, which they were mostly known from.
They also had dual hearts that provided extra blood for their brains and other organs.
Apart from these two unique features, cereans were physically close to humans.

Cereans could usually be found inside the Jedi Order, however due to the low birth rates for this particular species, cerean Jedi were exempt from the Order’s pledge of non-attachment.

# Section 1
Cereans preferred to live in isolation from the wider galaxy and in a low-tech society they had created.
Cereans wanted to protect their planet’s nature from the overwhelming technological territory that was spreading throughout the galaxy.
However, planet Cerea was a home to many outsiders that were only allowed to use technology they brought with them, but could only remain within the Citadels constructed by the Cereans.
Meditation was a vital part of cerean’s daily routine.
