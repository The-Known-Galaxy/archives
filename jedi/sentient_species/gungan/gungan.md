# Introduction

The Gungans were a sentient species who were suited for both land and water, and were native inhabitants to the planet of Naboo.
The Gungans were an amphibious species, being suited for treading on land, and traveling through water.
They had industrialized underneath the surface of the water, creating cities such as Otoh Gunga.
Gungans were tall humanoids, and they had a flexible structure, muscular legs and tongues, and many more other characteristics designed for living in the waters of Naboo.

# Section 1

The Gungans were not alone on Naboo.
It had been hard for the Gungans to communicate with the human inhabitants on the surface of the planet until the invasion of Naboo, hosted by the Trade Federation.
The Gungans united with the Republic governance of Naboo to end the invasion, ceasing the destruction of the planet itself.
Backing up the Gungans were one individual named Jar Jar Binks who would become the Junior Representative of the Gungan species in the middle of the Galactic Senate, who served alongside the Queen of Naboo Senator Padmé Amidala.

Furthermore in their culture, the Gungans had highly state-of-the-art technology.
This includes bubble projectors, bongo submarines and a huge amount of weaponry.
The Gungans favour using their technology that makes their environment of their world.
For instance, they used energy plasma that was extracted from their planet’s crust where they could power their cities and weaponry.
Gungan’s also tamed animals such as the Kaadu, Falumpaset, and Fambaa for use in combat and transport, instead of using starships, or any modern vehicular devices.
