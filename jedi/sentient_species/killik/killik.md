# Introduction

“The Kind” as they referred to themselves were a sentient hive mind of insects who varied in size from that of a termite to the scale of a battleship.
Their structures were largely constrained to tall hills and mounds with buried holes dug into the sides.
These mounds, throughout their history, can be found in the Unknown Regions, and more notably, Alderaan and Alsakan.
Their species disappeared long ago in the Killik Twilight, discussed later.

# Section 1

As previously mentioned, their size was very diverse.
Their species spread across many hives called nests whereas reproduction took place.
Interestingly, each nest’s members displayed a unique set of physical characteristics specific to that nest.

The Killiks had a wide range of communicative techniques which did not include vocalisation.
They utilised electromagnetic transmissions, chemical pheromones and telepathy that went over long distances.
The chemical pheromones - it is unsure whether this is purposefully done or not - can alter the layer beneath the cerebral cortex of the brain of any species including humans.
This process created “Joiners” or “Bughuggers” which were species absorbed into the hive mind of the Killik.
This is a particularly interesting phenomenon exclusive to the Killik that will be mentioned later.

# Section 2

The Killiks each had specific roles within the hives, some included the membrosia givers, the warriors, attendants and the assassins' bugs.
This often determined what kind of Killiks could be force-sensitive, although - again, it is uncertain whether it was purposeful or not - the Killik knew how to breed the right type of Killik to ensure more force-sensitives were present in their species.

Their physical appearance revolved around a hard chitinous exoskeleton which allowed them to hibernate for long periods of time as it resisted erosion.
Their body had spiracles which expanded to allow breathing.
This was often exploited but enemies, as poison would close the spiracles and choke Killiks to death.
Killiks had (4) arms with (3) claws on each and legs that were more than capable of carrying them long distances.
The Killiks females had an important role and made up the majority of the species as males were only needed for breeding.
Females were able to lay over (1000) eggs a month, and within a year they would be foot soldiers ready for battle making the Killiks a formidable force during attrition battles.

# Section 3

The Killiks as a species were a hive mind making them all collectively one individual.
They each utilised a palindromic name; the same backwards as it is forwards.
This is evident in their name, the “Killiks”.
Their telepathic abilities were gifted to Joiners who would eventually lose their own will if exposed to a high enough amount of pheromones.

The Killiks, due to their hive nature, had a terrible perspective of history as every single memory, thought, belief and perception were muddled into one tunnel.
This meant that the memories of Joiners would also influence Killik history.

These aspects were exclusive to each nest.
Different nests had to communicate to each other utilising normal language.

It is rumoured that UnuThul had immense power as he was able to impose the Dark Nest’s will on nests far across the galaxy which is simply impossible in biological terms.
Most nests would not follow the will of another nest unless it’s Will was impossibly stronger.

# Section 4

Killiks had an infatuation with survival and thus reproduced at a high rate.
It also meant they would engage in civil wars without question, which occured.
Members from different nests often varied significantly as their physical traits adapted to their respective planet climates.

Interestingly, Killiks despised liars and thus rarely allowed them to become Joiners and even attacked them at times.
Killik nests would also differ in characteristics based on the Joiners that they had created.
If they had absorbed many miners, they would resemble a mining clan.
If they had adopted politicians, then they would begin to portray diplomatic traits which are present in the historical part of this case study later on.

Killiks were an artistic species who created beautiful rituals, specifically during dance ceremonies.
When needed, they acted as an unstoppable and unified family that would take the different talents of each hive and use it in war.
The Kolosolok and Rekker hives produced juggernauts whilst the Aebea and Qeeq provided air assaulting Killik.
At other times they could be cold creatures, abandoning injured or disabled Killik.
When food could not be found, some of them simply chose to die without a fear of death or a love of life.

# Section 5

It is hypothesised that their increase of the absorption of Joiners in the later years was due to some collective realisation that more Joiners would help them expand quicker.
This idea was inspired by multiple species under one banner being able to do more.

# Section 6

“The Killiks are tied to the history of the galaxy in a way we don’t understand yet.
They were living in cities before humans learned to build, and they were a civilization before the Sith were here when Centerpoint and the Maw were constructed and driven from Alderaan by the beings who did it.”

The Killiks were born on Alderaan and have survived the span of time.
They shared the Pre-Republic era with species that include the Celestials, Gree, Kwa, Sharu, Columni, Taung and Humans.
Their hives spontaneously spread around the stars before 35,000 BBY.

The Celestials were rumoured to have conscripted the Killiks as laborers due to their effectiveness in physical stature.
Some time during this, the “Great Migration” occurred where some Killik stayed, and others spread to the stars.
These star inhabitants were helped by the Son and the Daughter, the famous architects, who guided the Killiks towards building wonders such as the World Puller, Still Curtain and Chasm of Forever.

The Killiks are an ancient species, and it’s stated that in their collective memories, the Thuruht hive were aware of how the Corellian system was formed.
This hive in particular, also was known to have imprisoned the “Abeloth” entity (refer to the respective case study to learn of this.) Furthermore, the Vulagool race seem to have a deep hatred for the species, though it is unknown why.

# Section 7

During the Killiks work in the Celestial slave camps, it is specified that the Killiks had done some unknown sin to anger them which caused the Celestials to kill most of the Killik laborers.

The Killiks later invaded Korriban and drove off the Sith, also for an unknown reason.
Following this invasion, the majority of Killiks scattered across the Unknown Regions presumably due to criticism from the Celestials.
It is rumoured that a Sith Killik was among them at this time.
Luke Skywalker hypothesised that they had to leave anyways, having consumed the majority of their resources on respective planets considering the size of their population.

A scientific study indicates that for some unknown reason, each generation of Killiks that were birthed, had less technological prowess and intelligence than the one before it.
This essentially meant that some of the later generations were unable to act as a hive organism anymore rendering their civilisation chaotic and ineffective.
This might also be attributed to too many Joiners having been absorbed into the hivemind.

# Section 8

Their species in terms of architecture and industrial potential was undeniably and insurmountably powerful.
When helped by the Architects they built massive space stations and mining industries.
They created a furnace that was powered by Force lightning.
The Killiks strangely enjoyed alcoholic beverages and used Ambrosia to do this.

Finally, their language or at least the vocal one that they rarely expressed, was tremendously hard to learn.
Touch and stress had varied meanings alongside (30) vowels that unfortunately all sounded like “U” to the human ear.

# Section 9

Many of the Killiks chose to remain in hibernation of Alderaan.
The Castle Lands or the surface of Alderaan was filled with mounds and hills leaving traces of their existence.
These Killiks would come up to the surface every few decades and be torn to shreds by the inhabiting humans who had an “Order of Extermination” which was an organisation dedicated to eliminating the emerging Killiks.

The Oroboro nests, as they were called, had a large number of inhabiting Killiks and emerged during the Cold War.
They engaged in conflict with the humans but were driven back through very vile methods.
House Ulgo of Alderaan used the “Pain Factory” to torture Killiks into leading swarms against enemies.
Doctor Parren studied these species so that he could essentially make pets of them, and even created a volunteer Joiner.
Weapons such as “Mother’s Milk poison” and the “Blood Boiler” were vile weapons used to break the spiracles of Killiks and were effective in killing them.
The Brood Totem was created to be deployed on enemy armies which lured swarms out of the ground who would consequently attack them.

Ambassador Hyllus, during this time, also attempted to create an alliance between the Sith Empire and the Killiks though they were already dwindling near extinction.

# Section 10

0 BBY their homeworld of Alderaan was destroyed but of no consequence to the Killiks since they had departed to their pocket of the Unknown Regions long before.
There they began to expand at a moderate rate to the point where they were noticed by the Chiss.
The Chiss, who had, had labour shortages following the Third Vagaari War and thus hired several nests to support their war efforts.

The Chiss were familiar with the Joiner phenomenon and thus imposed restrictions on their labourers to prevent contamination.
However, it occurred anyway since rival Chiss families sabotaged each other.
(2) entire families were absorbed, and to make matters worse, a starship named the Tachyon Flier carrying (3) Force Sensitives were absorbed into a Killik colony when they crash landed.
These ultimately sparked force-sensitive Killiks as well as the desire for individual freedom which Raynar Thul influenced upon the Killik when he became a Joiner.

# Section 11

The Killiks also began trade across the galaxy which solved the food shortages amongst them, this was also influenced by Raynar Thul who was now named UnuThul.
The Killik now adopted a principle of a single Will, the desire to unify and have a single purpose.
This translated to the desire for conquest and expansion, which led to the conflict with the Chiss Ascendancy.
The Killik began using hospitals for sick, and more advanced trade which were (2) previous issues that prevented their population from exploding.
Now it did.

By the Galactic Alliance era in 35 ABY there were an unexpected (375) nests.
These were guided by the Dark Nest who UnuThul controlled to begin invading the Chiss Ascendancy.
The Joiners were able to introduce the Killik into the Galactic Alliance but despite this, the Jedi delegation sabotaged Raynar Thul.
They made him think that the nests were aggressive and unnecessarily hostile out of instinctive traits.
He then decided to listen to Leia Organa by moving the nests to the Utegetu Nebula.
This fell under a peace agreement and cease-fire, concluded by the transport of the Killiks via Hapana Battle Dragons to these (14) planets.

# Section 12

To the Killiks' surprise, these planets had an unfortunate defense system that would envelop unwanted inhabitants with a devastating nova that would wipe them out.
This assaulted the Killik every time they altered the ecosystem with Fizz.
Fizz  consisted of nano-machines that melted down intruders on a molecular level.

This eroded the already tense peace agreement as the Killiks believed the Jedi had intended this to happen, but they were actually unaware of these defences.
The Dark Nest propagandised this lie and used it to begin a war against the Galactic Alliance.

Most famous of these battles occurred when the Victory-Class headed by Admiral Ackbar was captured.
Attempts for peace by the Jedi were futile when Jacen Solo attacked the Chiss hoping to lure them into attacking the Killik.
The Killik had many allies such as the Geonosians and Flakaxes, who also being insectoid species, were easier to absorb into the hive.

The Killiks eventually lost the war with Grand Master Luke Skywalker sealing their fate.
They retreated back to the pocket of the Unknown Regions.
The Jedi further guaranteed their submission by planting the Fizz nanotech all across the Killiks Colony planets.
This would act as invisible barriers preventing the Killik from ever expanding.
