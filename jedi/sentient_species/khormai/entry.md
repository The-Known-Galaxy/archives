# Introduction

The khormai, being native to the planet of Khorm, were a sentient and humanoid species.
The Khorman people have a tenacious large body with the anatomy of green smooth skin as well as mustaches and tusks.
They wore a special suit, designed for their environment.
These suits consisted of temperature adjustment systems and smoke stacks, which are its most notable features.
These suits also had a plus of armor, becoming their common standard attire.

# Section 1

The khormai had industrialized on Khorm, being able to make transportation systems such as rail jets, and domesticated aelids.
The khormai and their homeworld had great importance to the galaxy for their strategic skill and agrocite, an important resource mined there.

# Section 2

In the Clone Wars, a khormai warlord named Unger Gout was able to capitalize on Khormâ€™s agrocite deposits to make trade with the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
In exchange for ownership of the Planet and its belongings, Unger arranged enslaved khormai to mine agrocite for the Confederacy.
After he established his leadership over the planet, soon a rival khormai going by the name of Adaroo had established a resistance against the khorm oppressor.
Forces from the Galactic Republic then landed on the planet, allying with resistance forces to lead an assault against Gout and the Confederacy.
Pyrrhic victory was handed to the Republic, although losing many along the way, the assault had ended in Republic hands.
