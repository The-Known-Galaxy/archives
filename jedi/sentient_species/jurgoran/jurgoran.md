# Introduction

The Jurgorans similarly to the Yozusk, found themselves in conflict with the Gundark on their homeworld of Dromund Kaas.
The food chain was quite dynamic with predators often feasting on each other as opposed to the herbivores of the world.

The creatures varied in colour with a green outer shell, and yellow centerpiece.
They preferred large areas of swamp, and were considered amphibious animals.
This tough environment resulted in them having a hard outer shell, and sharp claws to defend themselves.

They also tended to walk on bipedal legs, and had (3) frontal face horns which were also used for defence.

Despite being non-sentient, they earned the respect of the Sith who inhabited Dromund Kaas.
This was to such a significant extent that many Sith named themselves “Lord Jurgoran” simply because the Jurgoran was known as a symbol of fortitude and strength amongst the Sith ranks.

Notable, Rora Seake, a Sith assassin was often accompanied by two Jurgoran pets during the Cold War.
However, Rora Seak alongside her pets were defeated by the Hero of Tython.
Refer to the battle of Belsavis prison case study for more context on this event.

Another Jurgoran was also recorded in history having entered hibernation near the cave of the Vur Tepe forge on Tython.
A Jedi Padawan had ventured into this cave while crafting their lightsaber, and ultimately slaughtered the disturbed Jurgoran.

# Section 2

The Jurgoran main branch evolved (or devolved depending on how one looks at it) into a species called the Cave jurgoran.
As opposed to being amphibian, they entrenched themselves in the dark and had bioluminescent scales that illuminated them in even the deepest of caves.
This eerie and glowing pattern often scared off the main branch of Jurgoran.
