# Introduction
The Slith were a sentient serpentine species that lived on the desert moon of Yavin Prime, called Yavin 13, in the Outer Rim Territories.
These beings grew to up to five metres and like snakes, they had scales and frequently had different patterns of stripes or spots amongst the species.
Their red eyes were protected by translucent eyelids that guarded their vision against the sandstorms that would occur on the moon.
The Slith had limited vocal potential, only producing a few sounds due to moisture evaporation that occurred in their bodies.
Therefore, they resorted to rubbing their jagged scales against the ground, which was called Slithese.

Living in nomadic tribes of 8-15 individuals, it had a male-dominated structure.
Tribes were led by an alpha male, who was assisted by the most senior male and female of the tribe after the alpha male, the "Lieutenant male" and "First Mate".
Most females were carers and hunters, while males were protectors of their traditions and the young.
The Slith were nocturnal hunters and would return to their tribes with their prey alive; venomous fangs paired with sidewinding movement allowed them to quickly paralyse their soon-to-be food.
During the day, they would hide away from the heat in places of shelter, either digging deep into the sand or in the shade of large structures like giant cacti.
Tribes had several ceremonies that included praying to spirits and worshipping gods, confirming the species’ sentience.



# Section 2
When the Elomin first settled in Elomin, they did not have any knowledge of the life forms living beneath them.
The reason behind the Elom going underground was due to lack of water, therefore they had no choice but to go underground.
After finding the Elom, the Elomin decided to imprison them, and act as if they were and fit to do labor.
This was quickly established when the Galactic Republic found out.
The Elom were freed soon afterwards, but the Elomin still were in power.
In the Galactic Empire era, the Elomin were forced into slavery.
The Elom made several attempts to liberate the enslaved Elomin, and were mostly successful.
After the fall of the Galactic Empire, both the Elomin and Elom started living together, much differently than before.



# Section 3
The Slith were largely unknown in the galaxy due to being many thousands of years behind other species, but even when contact was established, they preferred to stay isolated with their species.
There were some conditions that made them come out of this segregation, namely with the native Gerb species for trading valuable goods such as twilight lizards.
Eventually, a scouting team from the First Galactic Empire discovered both species on the moon, from which numbers of Slith were estimated to be around 19 million.
The Rebel Alliance sent their own exploratory body to the moon but accidentally brought a plague with them which was harmful to the Gerb.
When there was a chance that the plague mutated to harm humans, the Empire decided to demolish the moon’s surface to minimise the disease’s spread.
The rebels sought to prevent this from happening.
Crisis averted, the Slith stayed on the moon into the era of the Second Galactic Republic, with only a few knowing their existence, for example, Jedi Padawans on the neighbouring moon Yavin 4.
Yet another crisis occurred when the war-mongering Yuuzhan Vong attempted to invade the system to eradicate the New Jedi Order, leading to the extinction of life on Yavin 4, 8 and 13, including the Slith.
