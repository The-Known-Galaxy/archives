# Introduction

The Mikkians were a sentient humanoid species known for their bright coloured pigment skin and their mane of hair-tendrils.
Like humans, Mikkians had two arms with five fingered hands, including an opposable thumb, two legs and two front facing eyes.
The skin was known to be green, pink, red, yellow and blue while their irises could be blue or red.
A Mikkian’s colour could vary greatly even among close relatives like twins, parents and children.
Twins for example, could be yellow and green or even red and blue.
Mikkian’s tendrils were able to move independently while the number, form and pattern would vary from person to person.
They served as the sensory organ replacement of ears, though some Mikkians did possess ears as well.
The tendrils, however, were able to detect other information too, like humidity, temperature and radiation.
The Radiation detection was sensitive to the point they could almost see light and dark.
Their eyes was still their main visual organ despite this.
Some Mikkians were Force Sensitive and as such able to become Jedi or Sith with some training.
Notable force sensitive Mikkians are Jedi Master Twins Tiplar and Tiplee who fought and died during the Clone wars.
The twins were sisters and shared a blue mark on their forehead, while having red and yellow pigmented skin.

In Society Mikkians placed kinship and integrity above anything else, with their honesty sometimes coming off as blunt or rude to others.
They would often have a hard time adjusting to the more flexible views the other races had, with their complex code of honor enveloping all things in life.
The Mikkians did respect warrior traditions though they valued honor and discipline over things like victory and physical might.
The language Mikkian was a rather melodic flowing tongue made up from  multiple ancient dialects.
Many Mikkians were proud of this language, however, had no problems with learning Galactic Basic.
The Mikkian’s belief in the Force played a large role within the different religious traditions.
Due to this, they were quick to question the Empire when the Jedi Order was marked as traitors.
On top of this their tendrils had an important cultural meaning to them in their society.
Mikkian mythics as such used Tendril-readings to predict the future and every facet of them contributed to that meaning.
The Mikkian species come from the planet Mikkia, which has been a part of the Galactic Republic for thousands of years.
In fact they joined the Galactic Republic before the Galactic Civil War.
Being a secretive species, there is a lot of mystery with the Mikkians and such not much is known about their history itself.
