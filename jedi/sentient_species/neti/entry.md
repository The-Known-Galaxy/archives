# Introduction

The Neti were sentient shapeshifting plants originating from the planet Myrkr of the inner rim.
These sentient plants were force-sensitive.
They were between 2 to 5 meters tall, with brown or green skin similar to the bark on a tree.
They had multiple arms and some skilled Neti were able to morph themselves into humanoid trees with heights of up to 9.5 meters, as they descended from the trees of their home planet.
They could live up to 4000+ years and they spoke basic and Neti.
These plants only need 10% of the water that other species need, and they didn’t need food, but rather sunlight.
Without sunlight, they would die of starvation, unless they were in a force trance, a sort of hibernation that harnesses the force to allow the user to go for extended amounts of time without sunlight or water.

# Section 1

In approximately 4000 BBY, the Neti migrated from their home planet (Myrkr) to the planet for unknown reasons.
It is speculated by some scientists that they moved to the planet Ryyk, the homeworld of Master Ood Bnar of the Jedi Order.
When Ryyk was destroyed, the only survivors were Ood Bnar (who was offworld) and the Neti who continued to live on Nerit, a forest moon of Ossus.
One of them was the Jedi Master T’alla, who created the gardens of T’alla in the Great Jedi Library on Ossus and planted herself there.
