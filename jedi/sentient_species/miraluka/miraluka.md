# Introduction
The Miraluka were a sentient species that existed throughout the galaxy during the Clone Wars.
Their physical characteristics looked just like humans as they had brown tanned skin, gray or white hair, but didn’t possess eyes, giving their character a distinguishing factor.
Although Miralukas didn't have eyes, they had the ability of Force sight to make up for their supposed disabilities, giving them a reliable sense of sight that would be more enhanced than normal vision.
They did not have the ability to see colors, however, they did have the ability to recognise the living or dead.
This would allow them to come to terms with their lack of the ability to see color, letting them rise from their disabilities.
