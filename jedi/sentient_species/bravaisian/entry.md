# Introduction

Bravaisians were a species that originated from the planet Bravais.
Most of the time, Bravaisians could be spotted as Mazâ€™s Castle.
Bravaisans were long-snouted and very short.
They had very long tongues, which sometimes they used instead of their fingers.
Their skin colour was blue and they had very sensitive eyes, that they needed to protect from the sun by wearing goggles.

Unlike most people from this species, a Bravaisian named Sonsigo was able to grow hair on the back of their head.
While out of their homeworld, Bravasians were rarely seen without their glasses on.
Bravaisians used their snouts to go through soil and dirt so they could locate their prey or, hide from people.
Their main prey were tubers and insects, that they would suck up with their tongues.
