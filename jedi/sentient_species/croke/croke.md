# Introduction

The Croke looked like a snail with many small legs and their size could fit in a human hand, yet the Croke were able to use a force ability called Illusion Casting making the Croke able to make their size much bigger with the illusion.
The Croke originated from Crakull which was a planet located in the unknown regions and also were able to live up to 20,000 years of age.
The Croke took over a big chunk of the Unknown Regions named the Croke Reach.

# Section 1

The Croke eventually had a large civil war and at one point one of the factions employed the Lugubraa which were commonly mercenaries in the Unknown Regions.
The Lugubraa brought death and chaos, sometimes the Lugubraa even destroyed planets with Explume Minor as an example.
The Croke eventually brought a type of Lugubraa from the cloners of Kamino named the ’Blind Berserkers’ but the strain eventually started killing Crokes.

# Section 2

In the end, most of the Crokes gave up on the war and fled their planets resulting in the Croke species being scattered across the galaxy and broken apart as the rest of the Croke Reach either gets independence or is taken over again by different species.
