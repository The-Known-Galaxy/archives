# Introduction
An aquatic species with a predominantly hairless body enjoyed the comforts of the Porpor system.
It was presumed to be dominated by seaworlds, though this has not been confirmed.


These species have a relatively uneventful history other than the unfortunate instance of them becoming slaves to the addiction of Ryll spice.
This prolonged enslavement biologically changed a once pacifist species into a savage and barbaric civilization of hostiles.

This was eventually put to a brutal end by Gank mercenaries who horrifically wiped out every single Porporite in the ‘Gank Massacres’.

# Section 1
Little is known about their physical appearance and thus it is assumed that they portrayed the appearance of normal cetaceans.
Hairless bodies, with fins equipped to survive in oceanic environments.
Their only notable trait is that they produced entire populations very quickly due to their hormonal structure.

They can be described as incredibly strong, and rather large due to their successes against the Jedi, referenced later in this case study.



# Section 2
The infamous Ryll spice was found on Ryloth.
At first, it was used for medicinal purposes, and was a rather weak spice on the hierarchy of spices.
However, it seemed to have a very strong and adverse effect on the Porporites.
The Neimoidian species, proficient traders, introduced and delivered this spice to them.

Unbeknownst to the Neimoidian species, this trade would create a set of violent killers who began an unwavering conquest that swept across many planets.

The Jedi Order, following their duty as peacekeepers, were sent to fortify these worlds and slow down the invasion.
The Porporites not only defeated these small Jedi squadrons but also the Juggernaut war droids made especially for them.

This necessitated the usage of an extreme option which materialized in the form of Gank mercenaries.
These brutalists, arguably worse than the Porporites, killed every single one.
Within months, the species was extinct.

This put an end to the Porporites.
