# Introduction
Part I: Who were the Taungs?

The Taungs were a humanoid species of war-like people native to the planet Coruscant.
Most notable for founding the culture and religion we know today as ‘’Mandalorians’’, the Taungs were predominantly a tribal based culture who held dual control over the planet of Coruscant almost 200,000 years before the founding of the Galactic Republic.


They were extremely skilled hunters, warriors and gatherers who placed a religious view on combat and martial skill and consistently sought out warfare not for malicious or territorial gain, but more often simply to prove who could fight better.
Subsequently, honour, courage, strength, persistence and skill were the basis of Taung society.

Part II: Physiology 

The Taungs were an intimidating species, standing at an average height of 2 metres with gray and greenish skin as well as brightly glowing yellow eyes.
Their bodies moulded over decades of training and labour to become walking weapons, the Taungs were far more physically daunting and capable than the average human of the era.


They maintained sharp nail-like claws that we can only presume were utilized as a form of weapon in hand-to-hand combat as well as a bony structure to their bodies that likely evolved as a result of their physical hardiness.


Taungs were extremely resilient, comparable to that of the Zabrak species they could withstand blows that humans and other humanoid species could not, as well as endure physical activities such as running, climbing and fighting for far longer, giving them a natural advantage when hunting.


Their eyes shine a bright yellow, it is unknown if it provided them any sight advantages though due to the consistency in their evolution as a warrior-hunter species it would be safe to assume that it provided them some form of benefit, if only at least the intimidation factor of it.


The Taungs did have some nature of tentacle-like hair that would form on the back of their heads and necks but it is also unknown if this provided any additional capabilities or served a similar purpose to that of human hair.
Though it is known they would mimic these features on their helmets.

Part III: History 

Taung history dates back as early as the planet Coruscant itself, having evolved on the planet alongside the humans known as the ‘’Zhell’’ at the time.
Little is known of their early history up until the point of their war with the Zhell.
The Taungs and the Zhell would wage a great war on each other for centuries that would eventually result in the Taungs being forced offworld.
It is not known as to why this war started though it was likely due to the tribal and war-like nature of both the Zhell and Taungs at the time, seeing each other as different and therefore a threat.


The Taungs would be united in their war against the Zhell, who would now be commonly known as the ‘’Battalions of Zhell’’ in their own unified effort against the Taungs.
During this war a large volcano erupted on Coruscant’s surface that would decimate the Battalions of Zhell and provide a tremendous opportunity for the Taungs to take control of Coruscant.
However for reasons unknown after the Taungs had used this advantage the Battalions of Zhell would somehow regain the advantage and eventually force the Taungs offworld, claiming Coruscant as their own.



# Section 3
Under the rule of the newly found Mand’alor the First, the Taungs would colonise the world of Mandalore, naming it after their leader and rename themselves as Mandalorians.
Their first militant act would be to hunt the native species known as the Mythosaurs in order to make the world of Mandalore safe for technological expansion.
It should be noted that this species was hunted to extinction which is quite an extraordinary feat considering the size and deadliness of the Mythosaurs.


They would at this point adopt the Mythosaur as their cultural symbol and begin solidifying themselves as the Mandalorians, deciding to be ruled by the greatest Clan Chieftain and warrior at any given time, whom they would designate as ‘’Mand’alor’’.


After reorganising themselves into the Mandalorians they would then seek out new worlds to conquer.
In the earlier years of their conquests they would come up against little challenge and eventually turn warfare into a religious aspect of their society after their conquest and genocide of the Nevoota species, renaming their conquests as ‘’Crusades’’ and seeing themselves as holy warriors.
It would not be until they came up against the Mandallian Giants of Mandallia that they would find their first real challenge.



# Section 4
The Mandallian Giants were also a very tribal and militaristic society who would show cunning and skill when repelling the Mandalorian invasions.
The Mandalorians found their knowledge of warfare and skill to be so impressive that they offered the Mandallian Giants a place in Mandalorian society and took them on their future Crusades.
This began the Mandalorian trend of adopting new species and warriors into their ranks to bolster their combat capabilities and spread their religion and culture throughout the galaxy, eventually making the Mandalorians one of the largest and ferocious forces in galactic history.

While Taung history technically does not end at this point in galactic history, it should be understood that at this point their society had taken such drastic reformations and filled with so many non-Taung members that it would now be known as Mandalorian history instead.



# Section 5
Part IV: Societal structure and culture

Taung society was not particularly unique during the era of its existence.
It placed importance on warfare and conducting warfare honourably.
Those who could fight with immeasurable skill would often find themselves in leadership roles.
Such as Clan Chieftains positions or eventually the position of Mand’alor.
It is unknown if the species was inclusive of females in their warrior roles though judging by their liberal outlook on the inclusion of other societies and ability to unify their clans seemingly without difficulty suggests that female Taung would have little to no restrictions in comparison to the males.


Society was clan based but not medieval in nature, the Taungs knew the importance of technology and advancement and would mostly fight for sport or to prove martial dominance, instead of seeking to obliterate each other.
Despite the importance of clans, it was not uncommon for Taungs to leave Coruscant in search of work as warriors or to seek out various technologies or species to battle.
They were strongly nomadic and their clans would often relocate across Coruscant.



# Section 6
Taung culture was very individualistic, placing value on one's ability to be unique and to stand out.
This was most notable when designing their armour, each Taung could design their armour in a fashion unique to them.
This way of living would carry on into Mandalorian society for the rest of its existence.
The Taung and eventually the Mandalorians were not unified by opinion or how they dressed but instead their ideology.
The Taung valued honour above all else, founding the Canons of Honour, a list of guidelines similar to that of the Jedi Code in that it guided a Taung and eventually a Mandalorian on the right way to act in adherence to their societal expectations.
These Canons of Honour stemmed from the original tenants of the ancient Taung during their time on Coruscant.
Taung society was brutal in that an individual was essentially forced to be a warrior otherwise they had little place in the future of their clan.
Individuals who insulted each other or had disputes would settle them through blood duels to the death, a tradition that would be carried on into the Mandalorian Crusaders and Neo-Crusaders but would eventually be somewhat abolished due to its animalistic nature.
Despite their war-like ways the Taung did prove to be competent poets and even song writers.



# Section 7
Most notably the poem ‘’Dha Werda Verda’’ translated to ‘’Warriors of the Shadow’’ would become quite famous and was even used when training the Clone Army of the Galactic Republic.
They spoke an ancient version of Mando’a that they would refine later when inducting new species into Mandalorian society, this language became fairly famous with many of its words and names being used by non-Mandalorian societies in the future.

Part V: Notable Taung

Mand’alor the Ultimate

Undoubtedly the most notable of the Taungs is Mand’alor the Ultimate.
The leader of the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders during the Mandalorian Wars.
So ferocious, cunning and skilled was this individual Taung that he managed to carry out a full scale invasion of the Galactic Republic that would result in numerous genocidal campaigns, the subjugation of dozens of worlds as well as an economic and military loss for the Republic that would not allow them to recover for centuries after.
Never in galactic history has a collection of wildly different societies united so swiftly and struck such a blow to the galaxy as seen by the Neo-Crusaders.
It is safe to say that Mand’alor the Ultimate and his followers forever solidified the Mandalorians as some of the greatest warriors in the galaxy.
 


Mand’alor the Indomitable

Mand’alor the Indomitable was another famous Taung who rose to prominence during the Great Sith War.
It should be said that the names granted to Mand’alors were given through their actions, and to be titled Indomitable was by no means false when speaking of this Mand’alor.
Mand’alor the Indomitable was responsible for the conquests of dozens of worlds and laid the foundations that allowed Mand’alor the Ultimate to rally such a large force against the Republic.



# Section 9
If it had not been for Mand’alor the Indomitable’s overwhelming abilities when leading the Mandalorian Crusaders, then it is likely the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders would never have succeeded in striking such a massive blow against the Galactic Republic.




Part VI: Legacy

It is theorised that the Taungs knew that the legacy they had created with the Mandalorians would outlive them and so they did as much as possible to ensure their legacy would live on.
It could be argued that out of every species, of every society in galactic history, none created a stronger legacy than that of the Taungs.
Every part of modern Mandalorian culture and society even 4000 years after the Taungs is a representation of them and what they created.
The modern Mandalorian maintains an almost mythic status across the galaxy as a result of the teachings and history left behind by their forefathers.


The unique beskar’gam armour, the legendary fighting styles, the complex language, even the ironically peaceful poems and beautiful music of the Mandalorians all come together to represent the legacy of the Taungs.
