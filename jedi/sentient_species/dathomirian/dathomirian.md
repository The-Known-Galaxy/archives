# Introduction
The Dathomirians, also called Zabraks and Dathomiri, were a subspecies of Zabraks that lived on the planet Dathomir.
Females would have pale white skin with white hair such as Asajj Ventress but few had black.
Males on the other hand, would have either peach or yellow skin with few with red.
Examples of these would be the brother duo, Darth Maul and Savage Opress.
Another detail they had was horns, males had them while women did not.
Both would have tattoos to show their heritage with the Nightbrothers having more striping tattoos that covered most of their body.
The Nightsisters would have subtle tattoos that would blend in with their skin.
However, it wasn’t rare for a Dathomiri to be force-sensitive as many were.
Opress and Maul were force-sensitive and skilled at it due to their training and practice.
 Females, mostly Nightsisters,  would be witches and more dominant than men in society due to their power.
They would live as witches and call their leader(s) Mother in honour and respect.
Nightsisters would be known for their skills in “magic” and voodoo.
Males, mostly Nightbrothers, were non-dominant compared to females.
Living separate from the females, they would have to live a tough life to live and survive.
A Nightsister called Merrin would make all of the Nightbrothers her servants after the Battle of Dathomir.
They would usually fight one-another in a combat arena to show their strength, power and honour.
The boldest Nightbrother(s) would be selected to another rite of passage to fight beasts such as the Chirodactyls.

Ever so often, they would have a ritual known as the “Selection” which would let a female decide their mate.
Males would have to go through brutal trials to prove themselves worthy.
