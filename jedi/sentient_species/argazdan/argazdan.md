# Introduction

Argazdans are a subspecies of Humans located on the planet Argazda.
Argazdans similarly to humans, followed a set religion.
This was known as the Vianist faith which praised deities such as the Zhell of Coruscant and the goddess Via.
This green-skinned species, under the guidance of Governor Myrial abandoned the Republic and created their own respective nation complete with a navy.
Their reputation continued to soar downwards after they enslaved their neighbours and adopted a dictatorship that plagued the Kanz Sector.
The Lorrdians specifically were the most brutalised by the Argazdans and even created a form of kinetic communication after being banned from verbally speaking to each other.

# Section 1

The Lorrdians were subjected to harsh treatment, and were concentrated on the Slave Pits of Lorrd which also housed a biological superweapon.
Fortunately, this was never utilised as a squadron of brave Jedi Knights led by a Lorddian Jedi named Mari-Elan Nora assaulted the structure in retaliation.
This event prevented the weapon from ever being used, and also freed the Lorrdians from Argazdan tyranny.

The most infamous Argazdan under the name of Doctor Raygar was known throughout the Galactic Civil war.
He continued to wear his Slave master cloak even after the liberation of the Lorrdians.
This resulted in him often being criticised by his colleagues and passerbys.
The eccentric man spent the rest of his days searching for hidden weapons such as the one on the Slave Pits of Lorrd, and the Sunstar kept by the Ewoks of Endor.

# Section 2

The Argazdans differed very little from their Human counterparts.
They had a head, two arms and two legs with Human forms and shapes.
Their only notable differences included stark white head hair, light green or yellow-green skin, and yellow eyes.

Their choice of clothing also differed relatively from that of a humans choosing to adopt brightly coloured cloaks with heavy undercoated armour and red capes.

# Section 3

Ironically, for the most part, the Argazdan species adopted a political approach of conservatism often explicitly condemning the actions of the Galactic Republic.
Despite this, they were still known for their abhorrent moral values when it came to slavery.
Furthermore, during the Kanz Disorders the species developed technologies of mass destruction on par with that of the droid army.

After this period, many Argazdan’s were shameful of their past choices and history making efforts to negotiate peace with the Lorrdians, the former species they had subjugated.

Argazdans were inherently religious individuals choosing to spread their Vianist faith amongst neighboring species and planets.
They also had an extensive scientific network releasing expeditions into Yavin Prime.
A shadow was however cast upon these expeditions after one of the scientists, Doctor Raygar sacrificed his accomplice in the depths of the Slave Pits which would supposedly unlock the super weapon.
This actually awakened an ancient creature which is rumoured to have been a Zillo beast.
Doctor Raygar however detonated an explosive caving in the surrounding area.

# Section 4

The Argazdans descended from Core human colonists during the early period of the Galactic Republic.
After many years, their characteristics changed and features developed to acclimatise to the jungled world of Argazda.

They quickly advanced in technology gaining space flight, and creating their own religion.
The Argazdans also engaged in a diplomatic treaty with the Galactic Senate.
The Republic even fought on the Argazdans behalf against the Ereesi who they were fighting at the time.
The Republic, dismayed by the immorality presented by the Argazdan military, left upon completion of their duty.

The Argazda homeworld, flourishing in trade became a stop on the Veragi Trade Route further growing the economy of the Argazdans.

The species also participated in the Clone Wars but opted to ally with the Confederacy of Independent systems.
During this time, the Argazdan’s history of enslaving the Lorrdians have become a distant memory as they had established positive relations with the species by this time.
The population soared into the one hundred millions by the time the Galactic Empire came about, who they chose to ally with.

# Section 5

The Argazdans are an interesting species with a long and fruitful history.
They are worth engaging with in negotiation by the Order in future.
Their military might, and diplomatic tact when it is needed would be an excellent resource to have in times of great need.
