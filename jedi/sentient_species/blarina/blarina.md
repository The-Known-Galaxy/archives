# Introduction
The Blarina were a sentient species who was fairly short and native to the planet Rina Major.
They were particularly devoted to words and were famous for being complete liars.
Other species found it tough to tell different Blarina apart as they all looked indistinguishable, they used this superiority when dealing with others.
Blarina would often stick with each other when in face with a larger sized species.

# Section 1
The Blarina were short, rather chubby two leg sentient species who weren’t strong, as a replacement they were really quick, durable and ingenious.
They had armour-plated skin, capable of surviving in both warm, cold temperatures through relaxed wind as they were also resistant to poison and diseases.
They also had a wide face with a wide snout, small pair of eyes with cut pupils, a mouth with sharp teeth that contained more than a human, including incisors.
The Blarina had scaly pink coloured skin, while their eyes had a golden shade.
