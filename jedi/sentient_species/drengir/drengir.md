# Introduction
The Drengir were sentient species coming from a marsh planet.
Without a shape or form they were carnivores who’d eat on other animals all over the Galactic Frontier in the fallout of the Great Disaster and in the course of the High Republic Era.
As to how they look, they had many tentacles as well as an arrangement of teeth.
They’re a danger to the galaxy and the Jedi Order, meaning there was one Jedi who had putten their fate undoubtedly linked to the creatures.

# Section 1
A Jedi could wave their lightsaber where it would be simply unnecessary, the Drengir’s healing skills are impenetrable.
The Drengir were unable to be affected by blasters and signs of lightsabers, as they would reform with two bodies, with a shade of green they could bring dishonorable individuals to consume life.



# Section 2
Some Drengir were born of darkness, hate, and agony.
Later on they produced deadly poisons where it could kill a Jedi, and the bare presence of the Drengir inspired fear.
 This caused this ‘shadow’ that could be seen or heard  by other sentient species, even those who weren’t obtained by the Force.
Not only Jedi or species were affected by the Drengir whereas also plants where if a Drengir passed, their colour would be tainted black.
