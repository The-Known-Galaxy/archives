# Introduction
The Crown of Silk was a sentient living being that was located on the planet Cerea and was attracted to Force Sensitive people due to its own Force connection, this made it a dangerous predator due to being able to sense its prey regardless if they were using devices such as a cloaking device.
Although the creature itself was beautiful, it was also extremely dangerous.
The Crown of Silk was a predator despite its elegant looks, the being attached onto its prey like a crown would sit on a person, however it paralyses them and feeds on their energies for hours and hours.
Although it would not kill the victim, it would leave them dizzy for a couple of days, even up to a week.
The Crown itself was extremely vulnerable to anything, however the only known way that it would stop feasting upon its prey would be to use either fire or water.
Pulling the crown from the victim’s head resulted in damage to the brain.
The being would latch onto all creatures, and would only be active during the night.
The Crown of Silk released toxins to intoxicate its prey and render them unable to move, to then be feasted on as previously mentioned.
