# Introduction
The Gand was an insectoid species native to the planet of Gand.
They breathed ammonia which forced their species to wear respirators to survive in the oxygen-rich environments.
Gand was a sturdy three-fingered and two-toed insectoid sentient species with brown skin whose heads featured a pair of silver compound eyes.
Gands also possessed earholes along with their large compound eyes.
They had a large visual range of color spectrum including the ultraviolet spectrum.
However, they could not perceive color in complete darkness.
Although having three fingers, most Gands were notable for being able to punch through Stormtrooper armor, which would then become known as “Piercing Touch.” Their eyes were concealed with a layer of a keratin substance that covered their eyes from floating debris, most prevalently useful in sandstorms.
They were a species that was directly related to the Kel Dor and Tognath species, who also wore masks off of their homeworlds.
A notable member of this species is a bounty hunter named Zuckuss, one of the original findsman to flee their home planet.
The Findsmen was a mystic tradition that dates back centuries.
For the people of their planet that were pristine trackers.
They were also recognized for speaking a language of a similar name.
