# Introduction
To all Jedi delving into this case study, a word of warning: the Yuuzhan Vong and their history is something to be learned from, not toyed with.
These species are both inherently evil, and particularly dangerous.
Arguably, the Yuuzhan Vong have been and still are a greater threat to Jedi and the Republic than even the Sith.
These violent creatures and their beliefs collectively created a nation near unbeatable in war.
They are neither beaten by strategy, nor by fear and the Force has little to no effect on these beasts.

With that said, I have attempted to record the history of the Yuuzhan Vong within this case study to the best of my ability, I hope it does honour to the hundreds of Jedi who died collecting this knowledge.

The Yuuzhan Vong, one of three species to originate from outside the known galaxy which in itself presented many challenges when they were first encountered.
Their military is fueled by millions of Chazrach slaves who work tirelessly to manufacture and construct the Yuuzhan Vong’s war capabilities.

The Yuuzhan Vong in short have decimated over (350) trillion sentient beings in their infinite and unquenchable lust for war, and nearly obliterated the New Republic simply because they wanted to.

# Section 1
The Chiss and the Ferroans, other mighty species, feared the Yuuzhan Vongs and referred to them simply as the ‘Far Outsiders’.

Taking these facts into account, it should not be surprising that even the Force severed the Yuuzhan Vong from it’s connection.
Most Force abilities do not affect the Yuuzhan Vong, which strategically undermined the Jedi across many battles which occurred when the Yuuzhan Vong reigned down hell upon us.

They had an inherent love for war.
Those who sought out pain, and conquest often rose to the highest ranks, and this combined with them being religious zealots made them one of the strongest war machines in the entire galaxy.
The Yuuzhan Vong’s beliefs could not be negotiated with or broken, and they could not be deterred by casualties or pain.

The only thing they hated was technology, for some reason, they saw it as blasphemy within their religion and thus all their technology stemmed from organic and genetic engineering.
This also made their war tactics new and unconventional for the Republic.



# Section 2
The Yuuzhan Vong, despite being completely different in nature, resembled humans to a partial extent.
They had (2) arms, and (2) legs, but the similarities end there.
Most Yuuzhan Vong lacked kidneys, and were physically more evolved than humans.

They stood much taller, and thus by extension were stronger and heavier.
They also lived much longer than Humans, surpassing them by several decades.
Due to their religious beliefs, the Yuuzhan Vong utilised organ grafting (whereas parts of one's body were replaced with biological and ecological improvements found in nature) leaving them horribly disfigured with terribly pale skin textures.

Their faces were almost as if a Human had simply peeled off their skin, and sliced off their noses leaving a barren and hard skull.
In terms of hair coverage, some had long black hair whilst others were bold.

Distinct features included small blue sacks that would form under the eyes of a Yuuzhan Vong - in their culture this was regarded as beauty.
Furthermore, they had functionality whereas the sacks would expand or contract depending on the particular Yuuzhan Vong’s mood.
This made them frightening however, since the rest of their face showed no emotion nor changes.

Yuuzhan Vongs were commonly gray or yellow in skin tone, and notably bled a dark obsidian black which was often hidden by their black armor.



# Section 3
On top of all these factors, what made Yuuzhan Vong even more intimidating is that their nervous system through evolution evolved to ensure that Yuuzhan Vong could feel pain more than that of a Human or most other species.
It was incredibly sensitive and yet, Yuuzhan Vong’s still had a thirst for pain.

As previously mentioned, and one final note with regard to their biology, they had no connection to the Force.
Their intentions and desires could not be ascertained, intimidating even the most veteran of Jedi.
They could however be harmed indirectly if objects were hurled at them using the Force, and other means.
There is one exception though, being that of Force lightning and Force net, which (hypothetically) were on par with the evil of the Yuuzhan Vong and thus affected them greatly.

Some Jedi well versed in encountering the Yuuzhan Vong later developed the ability to telepathically sense the Yuuzhan Vong.
It was called Vongsense.



# Section 4
If one is still not convinced of the Yuuzhan Vong’s immense power, and lust for pain - they will simply by looking at the Yuuzhan Vong’s choice of weaponry and technology.

The Yuuzhan Vong due to their religious beliefs and certain superstitions chose not to use any sort of mechanical or electrical technology.
Furthermore, they absolutely opposed pollution of the natural environment and this sought after other methods.
They saw technology almost as their opponent, and not the actual people who made them.
The Yuuzhan Vong believed strongly in the natural cycle of life and death, the strong versus the weak.
Technology did not die, and thus simply by existing violated the beliefs of the Yuuzhan Vong who took this to heart.

These methods manifested in the creation of bioengineering, which is arguably more cruel than using traditional droids or spaceships in war.
The Yuuzhan Vong have become masters in this field, especially with their creation of biots.

Biots do and perform the same tasks any service droid would, but they are biological and bred to be slaves.
Biots could be any species, ranging from Wookiees to Humans and so forth.
The benefits of this choice were immense as biological beings were more resistant to work and had the ability to think and adapt.
Biots fueled their armies by manufacturing the countless weapons and war utilities that the Yuuzhan Vong required.



# Section 5
Their technology also included the Yammosks, a terrifying creature that resembled a human brain but was much bigger.
These bioengineered species acted as strategic planners for the Yuuzhan Vong.
Due to them being born solely to coordinate war, they were absolute prodigies.
Able to issue hundreds of commands to different battles simultaneously made them the brain behind the sledgehammer of the Yuuzhan Vong ground troops.

This strategy was further supplemented by Yorik Coral antennas the Yuuzhan Vong had placed on multiple worlds.
This created a telecommunication system that was arguably better than the galactic HoloNet.

In terms of physical combat weaponry, the Yuuzhan Vong used a wide range of bioengineered utilities.
Due to the nature of biological weapons, they were often able to adapt, change form and were tremendously volatile in combat.
It made fighting an average Yuuzhan Vong a very unpredictable task.

Examples include the serpentine amphistaff which changed form to resemble a spear, or whip at any given time.
This in conjunction with their Vondunn Skerr Kyrric armor which was immune to lightsaber strikes made Yuuzhan Vong a fearsome foe.

Less notable weapons included the ranged Plasma Eel, and Razor Bug alongside the melee Coufee and Tsaisi.



# Section 6
The transportation that the Yuuzhan Vong used to move their hundred thousand strong armies were also biologically engineered.
How they worked was quite complicated and hard to document, however in summary; the outer layer of their vessels (called Coralskippers)  protected the craft from normal gunfire, they had Yaret-Kor plasma weapons which melted away most of the defences of an average cruiser, their hull could generate anomalies that would not only break the shields of a ship but also pull them out of hyperspace leaving their pilots unconscious.
These factors made the Yuuzhan Vong deadly in space warfare, even against the most veteran of strategists or biggest of armadas.

It’s been well documented that with this immunity, the Yuuzhan Vong could travel safely throughout space without much interference and thus in their conquest, they sometimes left horrible plagues on several worlds.
These plagues, being engineered in a lab by the Yuuzhan Vong would decimate the inhabiting populace in the most painful of ways.

These ships due to being living beings essentially, had cognition hoods which would telekinetically bind a pilot to the craft.
A Yuuzhan Vong would place the hood on their head and they would become the ship until they took it off.
The pilot would even experience the memories of the ship and it’s feelings to some extent.



# Section 7
One challenge however was that the ships spoke a different language to the Yuuzhan Vong which left some complications for pilots when attempting to move the ships through complicated maneuvers.

In conclusion however, they overcame the barrier by simply communicating through images that both the pilot and the ship saw.
This connection usually overpowered industrial cruisers that were commanded by hundreds of pilots operating different tasks.



# Section 8
The Yuuzhan Vong’s were religious zealots.
This poured into all aspects of their culture and it cannot be emphasized enough.
They believed that their Gods had sacrificed themselves to create the universe whereas parts of their body became the planets and the stars.

Within this belief, the Yuuzhan Vong’s praised and worshipped these Gods to such an extent that they believed sacrificing their own bodies through organ grafting and glorifying pain in war honoured their Gods.
They saw the philosophy of embodying pain in every aspect of life as something that a Yuuzhan Vong should destine their life to.

This left many of the higher ranking Yuuzhan Vong permanently scarred and horribly scorched.
The Yuuzhan Vong who failed this ceremony of enduring pain in a lifelong task were given the name the “Shamed Ones”.
Rarely, some Yuuzhan Vong’s bodies reject organ grafting or physically couldn’t handle the pain.
They were consequently exiled for their perceived ‘failure’ and sent out into the galaxy.
This method of filtering their armies left only the strongest of Yuuzhan Vong left in their ranks.

Furthermore, the pain never stopped - it gradually got worse as a Yuuzhan Vong was promoted.
High ranking officials were expected to sever body parts and transplant them with the biology of other species to make them stronger, and closer to their Gods.



# Section 9
These operations often led to the death of higher ranking officials or as previously mentioned, they were sent into exile.


Yuuzhan Vong’s despite being ruthless with regards to this ceremony, held the concept of family close to their culture.
They resided in ‘domains’ which were groups of Yuuzhan Vongs that were related in some way.
Each Yuuzhan Vong served a different role in this organization and the domains created a hierarchy similar to a Human aristocracy.


Yuuzhan Vong were restricted to marry within their own domain, to marry outside was prohibited and would result in severe punishment.
This domain was a lifelong commitment, and required rituals and sacrifices to enter into.

The young members of their society such as Yuuzhan Vong children were forced to be raised in tight circles whereas they would not see their parents until much, much later.
Interesting phenomena occurred with regards to these children, deformed children were killed at birth, and when twins were born they were forced to fight each other whereas the winner of the two would live.

Yuuzhan Vong’s further established ceremonies in their way of life whereas the dead were simply sacrificed to the Gods.
They were either severed beyond recognition or burned to a crisp.



# Section 10
With these factors of their culture in mind, it is of no surprise that the reason they conquered much of the galaxy is not simply due to their desire for pain and honouring of their Gods but also to remove the technology from the galaxy.

They hated generic technology to such an extent that their ultimate goal in life was to wipe out civilizations that embedded it in their society.

In war, this belief was so strongly indoctrinated into every member that no foot soldier would ever disrespect his superiors and mutually a superior towards his inferiors.
This worked in their favour in combat, as this coupled with the fear of their Gods meant that they never retreated from battle.
If the indoctrination was not strong enough, those who ran would simply become ‘Shamed Ones’.

To make matters worse, the Yuuzhan Vongs, as previously explained, were in constant pain their entire lives.
Suffering was infinite and death would be the only saving grace, thus to die would be honourable and sweet.
This mentality made them absolute savages in open combat, they were fighting to die because they craved it so severely.



# Section 11
The Yuuzhan Vongs, even in battles they lost - which was tremendously rare - did not assist their opponents.
The Yuuzhan Vong would drag their dead away and sacrifice them to the Gods before their biology or technology could be studied and learned from.
This left them as mysterious as they were when they first entered the galaxy.

In times of great challenge, the Yuuzhan Vongs would literally institute mass suicide attacks.
They would send in hundreds of soldiers to enter into a fury of anger against enemy soldiers simply to tire out and wither away the enemy front lines.
These tired frontlines would later be decimated by elite Yuuzhan Vongs who used the strategic factors mentioned all throughout this article.

In rare occasions, some species were spared the wrath of the Yuuzhan Vong simply because the species had not affiliated themselves with technology.
This included the Ho-Din who’s biology naturally prevented them from ever creating technology.
This was the only solace that a society could have, to abandon technology or die at the hands of a Yuuzhan Vong brute.



# Section 12
The Yuuzhan Vong society was broken up into systems called Castes which were essentially roles allocated to each member of the Yuuzhan Vong.
They would perform these roles for the entirety of their lives, making them masters of their craft.

They had a king of sorts who fronted the society, and was referred to as the Supreme Overlord who spoke on behalf of their most powerful deity, Yun-Yuuzhan.

The Supreme Overlord oversaw the functioning of all the castes as he was the only Yuuzhan Vong who could directly contact and communicate with the God.

The Castes each had unique functions, firstly, there was the ‘Shaper’ caste.
These were the brains of the society, who facilitated the invention, construction and implementation of all Yuuzhan Vong biotechnology.
It broke into many sub branches, but it consisted of the engineers, the artists, ceremony hosts and so on.
The Shapers were one of the Castes that ranked higher in the theocracy and had its own ranks such as the Master Shaper, Adept and Initiate.

Secondly, the ‘Priest’ caste broke into sub branches as well and performed the religious tasks of the society.
Each branch focused on a different deity, and would spread the faith in different ways.
Their ranks divided into a ‘Mosthigh’ priest, a High priest, a priest, a seer and finally, a novice.



# Section 13
Thirdly, the warrior caste which was the strongest out of all the castes.
They obviously served the military functions of the society,  and trained members at a very young age.
Due to them beginning organ grafting and pain ceremonies longer and earlier than other Yuuzhan Vong, they were the most aggressive of the Castes.
Their ranks were made up of warmasters, supreme commanders, commanders, subalterns and warriors.

Fourthly, the intendant caste were essentially the accounts of the society.
They managed the logistics and economic operations which fueled the wars, construction, and moving of the society as a whole.
Warrior and Shaper castes could become intendant castes with time, experience and selection.
It broke into the High Prefect, prefect, consul, executor and attendant.

Lastly, the lowest and largest of the Castes were the workers.
They were made up of Shamed ones, boots and slaves.
Even children of the shamed ones were forced into slavery from the beginning and until the end.



# Section 14
An important part of the Yuuzhan Vong - their Gods.
The religion itself was referred to as the ‘True Way’ and it’s speculated that if this religion had never materialised, the Yuuzhan Vong would never have become the race of war-mongering demons that they did.

Firstly, Yun-Yuuzhan was at the top of the God hierarchy and was the God who supposedly split his body into pieces which created the other Gods, and the galaxies.
His will was communicated through the Supreme Overlord.

Secondly, Yun-Harla was essentially the devil.
She was a Goddess of trickery, deception and cunning.
She was the symbol of politics and thus many Yuuzhan Vong politicians sought her for guidance in times of strife.
An interesting strategy that the New Republic applied against the Yuuzhan Vong was naming Jaina Solo, a great pilot, the ‘Trickster’ in Order to manipulate the Yuuzhan Vong she fought against.
They would naturally believe they were fighting against their own God.

Thirdly, Yun-Yammka.
The pinnacle of war, and praised relentlessly by the warrior caste.
Not surprisingly, the priest caste actually made this God up in an attempt to improve the morale and further indoctrinate the forces of the Yuuzhan Vong before entering into war.



# Section 15
Fourthly, Yun-Ne’Shel was the Gaia of the Yuuzhan Vong overseeing the natural cycle of life and death across the Yuuzhan Vong worlds.
She inspired the hatred that the Yuuzhan had towards the immortality of machinery.

Fifthly, Yun-Txiin and Yun-Q’aah were twins who manifested the cultural concept of only loving within one's own caste.
This ensured that the Yuuzhan Vong would remain within their caste and domain, fearing the wrath of these lover Gods if they disobeyed.

Lastly, and at the bottom of the hierarchy was Yun-Shuno.
The Shamed Ones were only allowed to look for guidance from this deity, and she acted as the forgiver.
Physically, she had (1000) eyes and acted to keep the Shamed Ones in check as she saw all the sins they committed.



# Section 16
Despite being as powerful as they are, the Yuuzhan Vong were originally just the product of a war between (2) droid civilizations called the Silentium and the Abominor.
It’s speculated that the collateral damage of these battles tore apart a once peaceful Yuuzhan Vong civilization.
In an attempt to survive, and an overcompensation of violence, a horrible concoction of the Yuuzhan Vong that the Republic sees today was created.

Their original homeworld, the Yuuzhan-tar was left in the dust and out of the ashes arose violent brutes who absolutely hated technology and droids.
Their conquest of the (2) droid civilizations did not end there however, as once they had tasted revenge, they moved onto the Chazrach and countless other species.

Throughout this conquest, their unified forces were often divided internally through Domain conflicts which led to abhorrent civil wars.
One of the biggest was the Cremlevian War which vaporized much of the Yuuzhan Vong’s own territory.

The Yuuzhan’tar, before it’s death, biologically implacted a seed into another world leading to the creation of the sentient planet known as Zonama Sekot.
These tribulations created a Yuuzhan Vong civilization forged in pain, which overtime severed them from the connection of the Force.



# Section 17
A power struggle which moulded the Yuuzhan Vong forever, formed within a civil war between a Yuuzhan Vong named Yo’gand and Steng.
The two battled for supremacy, and Yo-Gand succeeded, later becoming the Supreme Overlord.

Their decimated galaxy left in thousands of shards of debri forced them to construct world ships and move as refugees throughout the vast vacuum of space.
They travelled in the millions and eventually entered into our known galaxy.
Due to their religious tendencies and already aggressive nature bottling up in these ships, the outcome was the invasions of the Yuuzhan Vong that decimated trillions upon entry.
