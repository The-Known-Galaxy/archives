# Introduction
The wasilsi are an extinct species that most notably inhabited the planet of Joralla.
The humanoid species would experience many years of war and conflict with their neighbouring species, the tikarri.
Unfortunately, little is known about the Wasilsi species, but what we do know is quite interesting and is a good insight within the culture and events that are lesser known throughout galactic history.

# Section 1
Not enough is known about the biology of the wasilsi species to come up with a real idea of what they looked like.
It is known that they were humanoid and due to the predominantly jungle nature of their planet and the fact they made use of various tools, we can theorize that they had opposable fingers and thumbs and walked on two legs.


The species was quite intelligent and was not believed to be native to the planet of Joralla.
This suggests that at some point, the wasilsi had mastered space travel or were forcefully relocated to the planet by another species.



# Section 2
Upon carrying out a research expedition to the planet of Joralla, numerous University departments had discovered temples, tombs, villages, and small cities belonging to the extinct species.
Unfortunately, due to the savage nature of the tikiari, most research endeavours were deemed too dangerous to continue.


Despite this, it is clear that the wasilsi were interested in art.
They had memorialized many of their greatest achievements and battles with the tikiari on murals and paintings that were commonplace within their ruined villages and tombs.

Scientific research proves that the wasilsi were far more sophisticated and intelligent than the tikiari, but the extent of their intelligence, their usage of tools, and developments in science are unknown.



# Section 3
All knowledge that exists regarding the history and eventual extinction of the wasilsi stems only from scientific speculation.
It was theorised that due to the nature of the planet Joralla and the fact that the wasilsi are not native to the planet, the Joralla ended up dying out from plague and disease.

It is known that they waged war for many centuries with the tikiari species up until their extinction, but it is not clear if the war had a hand in causing the species’ downfall.
Due to the knowledge that the wasilsi were more intellectually competent than their tikiari neighbours, it is believed that the tikiari did not play a part in the extinction of the wasilsi.
