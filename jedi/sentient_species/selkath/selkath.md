# Introduction
The Selkath were a sentient, aquatic species.
They reside on the planet Manaan within the Inner Rim.
Selkath were most commonly found underwater; however, they were also seen outside of water, where they would wear vents on their skin.
These vents would keep their skin moist, so they could remain comfortable while outside of their natural habitat.

# Section 1
Throughout the Galactic Republic era, the Selkath preferred to stay neutral, favoring neither the Galactic Republic nor the Seperatists.
However, they would often export a healing fluid to both parties.
This fluid known as Kolto can only be found on Manaan.
Due to this, Selkath had a large business in the medical field.


This business would run perfectly with trades coming and going consistently until the discovery of Bacta.
Bacta, similar to Kolto, was a much thicker fluid with stronger healing properties.
This substance, available in the Hetzal system, was preferred by many of Selkath's previous traders.
It was because of this competition between the two that the Selkath were often seen as responsible for the Great Hyperspace Disaster.


The Great Hyperspace Disaster was a catastrophic event resulting in the destruction of many moons within the Hetzal System.
This suspicion turned out to be correct, as one Selkath by the name of Marchion Ro, had caused the disaster.



# Section 2
After the fall of the Galactic Republic and the spontaneous rise of the Galactic Empire, Selkath’s home planet of Manaan was one of the first to be targeted.
The planet suffered a lot of damage from the Empire’s immense force.


The immediate threat forced the Selkath to take refuge in their cities underwater.
The Selkath’s reputation had been greatly diminished after this.
The species became disconnected from the rest of the galaxy, and those that had been off-planet during the attack had been left stranded, away from their kin.


Chata Hyoki was among one of these Selkath; however, unlike his peaceful kind, Hyoki had become a Bounty Hunter.
Hired by Count Dooku, Hyoki was tasked with forcing Senators to change their votes on the Senate bill.
This bill would see an extra 5 million Clone Troopers added to the ongoing war effort.

Dooku had also tasked Hyoki and other Bounty Hunters with the assassination of Naboo Senator Padme Amidala as well as Bail Organa.
Having been unsuccessful at both of these assassination attempts, Hyoki and the other Bounty Hunters were arrested.
