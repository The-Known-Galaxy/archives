# Introduction

Givins are a sentient species from the planet Yag’Dhul, located in the Inner Rim of the galaxy.
The species are known for their excellence in Mathematics.
Due to their home planet's atmosphere being a vacuum, their organs are sealed from breathing, therefore can survive with no oxygen.

# Section 1

The Givins are a species of white-skinned hairless humanoids and as tall as an average human.
Their eyes are shaped as large triangles, with brows sloped up to the center, making them look as if they were devoured with eternal despair.

# Section 2

Many of the Givins are experts in Mathematics and scientific fields, due to it being the center of the specie’s culture.
Addressing and greeting a Givin using an equation is considered to be polite, this is a tradition known as “greeting maths.” Then the Givin will reply with an equation as well.
But when they are dealing with those who have less talent in Math, they would ask an equation with an answer already given.

# Section 3

The Givin’s are able to be employed in scientific fields due to their intellect.
But before the Battle of Yavin, the species were among the customers in the Cantina of Mos Eisley, located in Tatooine, when Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker met the duo Han Solo and Chewbacca.
Shortly, in Skywalker’s mission to rescue a Givin cryptographer, Drusil Bephorin, was recruited to the Rebel Alliance.
