# Introduction
The Ongree were a sentient amphibious species hailing from the planet Skustell.
Their skin colour was a yellowish orange colour.
They had two eyestalks on either side of the lower part of their head, with a lipless mouth in the center of the upper area of their tapering heads.
They had tentacles on the bottom of their heads, in a beard-like shape.
They had four nostrils below their mouth, giving their head an inverted look.
Their hands had two thick fingers and a thumb on each hand, with the surprising ability to hold small things with such large fingers.
They were extremely agile, even with their humpback appearance.
Many notable Ongree were diplomats and Jedi.

# Section 1
The species was seen to have a unique mindset, possibly originating from their eyestalks allowing them to see lots of different parts of a situation.
Because of this, the Ongree were seen as exceptional diplomats.
During the cold war, an Ongree cult was known to worship Darth Revan.
