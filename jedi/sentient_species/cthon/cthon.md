# Introduction
The Cthon were a sentient humanoid troglodytic species that inhabited the lowermost levels of the Coruscant underworld.
They resembled dead bodies with white/grey-blue skin, loose flesh and dirty, stringy hair.
Their mouths were lipless and contained sharp teeth.
The egg-shaped eyes were covered by skin growths, visibly moving within the pouch-like growth.
The only clothing seen worn on them, if at all, were ragged loincloths covering their lower abdomens.
Their diets consisted of only rotten flesh, and they had no language.

# Section 1
The Cthon were descendants of humans who were banished from the Coruscant surface for criminal acts.
They lived in the undercity for thousands of years, the darkness genetically morphing them into frightening creatures.
They were known to use electroshock nets to catch their food, and were thought to have possibly been related to the Corridor ghouls of the undercity.
Cthon were also used as slaves of the Flesh Raiders from Tython.
The slaves would burrow into the ground and burst out, attacking hostiles for their owners.
How they got on Tython is unknown.
