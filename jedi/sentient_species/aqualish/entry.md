# Introduction

Aqualish are sentient humanoids originating from Ando, a water planet in the mid-rim of the galaxy.
They could be identified by black round eyes and covered in fur.
An interesting development with this race is that some of them possessed four eyes instead of the normal two.
Another is that different members of their race had different hand types.
Examples are Ponda Baba, who had hairy hands sporting five digits.

# Section 1

During the time of the Republic, Aqaulish didn't agree with their direction, as did many others.
When the time of the Clone Wars broke out, they had joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
A noteworthy person during this time was Pune Zignat, an Aqualish who worked with General Lok Durd.
Both Pune and Durd were captured by the Republic on the Planet of Maridun.
When Darth Vader went to Mustafar to eliminate the Confederacy leaders there.
Two Aqualish had been among the leaders there.
Them along with the rest of the Confederacy’s leadership there had been murdered by Vader.

# Section 2

Aqualish weren’t an uncommon sight in the galaxy proper.
There were several senators and officers in the Galactic Republic that were Aqualish, as well.
Amda Wabo, an arms dealer, worked during the time of the Galactic Empire selling T-7 disruptor rifles to the Empire, despite the disruptors being officially illegal.
However, the arms deal was halted by the crew of the Ghost on the planet of Lothal.
Some of these weapons ended up in the hands of Cikatro Vizago.
Around 9ABY, a group of Aqualish had used the Mandalorians on Nevarro hideout, when they were killed by Carasynthia “Cara” Dune, the Marshal of Nevarro.
