# Introduction
The Gen’Dai were a humanoid species that seemed to almost be immortal.
They lived for millennia and their origins are unknown.
However, it is known that they were deprived of all bones in their bodies so they wore heavy armor.
It is also known that they were rarely seen in the galaxy and never participated in any big events such as wars.
This was due to their lack of numbers and desire to remain alone.

# Section 1
The Gen’Dai were supposedly a peaceful species and were heavily involved with a certain philosophy by the name of “perfection of permanence” which stated that change was merely an illusion.
Due to this philosophy, the Gen’Dai wouldn’t take roles in anything.
After the destruction of their unknown homeworld by the Sith Empire, the Gen’Dai were stripped of any governmental party, therefore they roamed the galaxy in utter isolation.
Their numbers began to depopulate due to their independence and lack of reproduction.
Before all this, the Gen’Dai were brutal and often became mercenaries or Bounty Hunters.
Proceeding the Great Hyperspace War, the Sith Empire soon located and destroyed the Gen’Dai homeworld, which was why they began to depopulate and roam the galaxy in solitude.
The Gen’Dai who were much older than others would often face mental issues and succumb to violence, taking roles as a Bounty Hunter or Syndicate leader.


The Gen’Dai never had a working heart system, so they relied on their circulatory system to provide blood through a series of capillaries and muscular contractions.
When Gen’Dai received cuts in that area, they would regenerate instead of dying from loss of blood.
However, if they took too many dangerous injuries, they would be forced into hibernation.
During their hibernation, the Gen’Dai’s body mass that was lost would be replaced with regenerative abilities.
Gen’Dai could only be killed via incineration or the physical destruction of their brain.
The brain was the only part of their bodies that could not regenerate and over time it would break-down and could send some Gen’Dai into mental break because of their old age.
