# Introduction
Zhell were speculated to be the ancestors of the humans in the galaxy, residing on Coruscant.
They were divided into thirteen groups known as the Nations of Zhell.
The Zhell also had a standing military that combined each of the nations into one unified force called the Battalions of Zhell.

# Section 1
The Zhell had waged a war upon the planet’s other native sentient species, the Taungs for centuries trying to achieve Coruscant, which was named Notron at the time.
They nearly went extinct when a volcano erupted near the main city of the Zhell.
Ash blanketed the skies of Coruscant for two years.
The Taungs would call themselves Dha Werda Verda or in Galactic Basic, The Warriors of Shadow, after this event.
The battle that took place after the eruption would eventually become a poem of the same name.
Once the Zhell recovered from the volcanic eruption, they fought off the Taungs and rooted out the Taung for good.
The Taungs then fled to Roon, later becoming the founders of Mandalore and Mandalorian culture.
