# Introduction
Dradan, a peaceful sentient species from the Drada system within the Outer Rim.
Due to an illusion by Dark Jedi Halagad Ventor, the Dradan was presented as tall thin-framed humanoids with normal five finger hands.
The illusions had large red glowing eyes, wide mouth, a flat broad nose, two human-like ears and long hair.
When the illusions could be focused on the Dradan has calm and peaceful expressions, however, when they couldn’t be the Dradan had a more menacing look complete with sharp teeth and long claws.
They dressed in plain white robes and would carry simple wooden tools.
Their diet was cooked meat with a side of fruit and vegetables.
They had a simple language but often used mime and gesture to communicate with those that did not understand them.
After the Galactic Empire was formed in 19 BBY, the real Dradan offered their world as a refuge for the Jedi refugees trying to escape the Empire.
In 1 BBY the Empire would find out and would respond with a mass genocide of the species on top of stripping and plundering their homeworld.
