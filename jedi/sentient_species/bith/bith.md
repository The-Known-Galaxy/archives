# Introduction

The Bith were a species that resided on the planet of Bith.
They are a sentient, humanoid species.
These creatures were pacifists and displayed an extreme amount of intelligence.
The Bith were bald and their heads were in the shape of a dome.
Their black eyes had a lack of eyelids and were not able to shed tears.
These creatures used special skin flaps to smell since they did not have a nose.
They had an incredible sense of hearing, however, the downside of that was they were extremely sensitive to loud sounds.
The Bith also had very good eyesight.

# Section 1

After the Nozho-Weogar War, the Bith that were on their home planet were forced to remain on the planet.
Other Bith that were in the Outer Rim were shunned completely and barred from returning to the planet of Bith.
This forced them to assimilate to the populations and cultures around them.
Many Bith found jobs as musicians throughout the various planets that they resided.
Even though they were no more musically-inclined than any other species, they flourished as musicians throughout the various planets in which they resided.

# Section 2

After the war, the Bith that remained on their home-world resided in cities that were sheltered by dome structures.
This closed them off from an evolving biosphere with new flora and fauna emerging in the harsh conditions of their war-stricken planet.
Outsiders and Bith from other planets were heartbroken to see the extremely brutal conditions of the planet.
The numerical attribute of the Bith language eventually died off.
All Bith began to learn Galactic Basic Standard in order to better communicate with their Outer Rim trading allies.
However, some older Bith used and taught their language in order to communicate in secrecy.
