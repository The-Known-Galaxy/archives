# Introduction
The Zeltrons, native to the planet Zeltros, are a humanoid species being almost considered a subspecies of humans though different enough to be considered their own with distinctive differences from humans being their pink to deep red skin and red or blue hair.
Almost all Zeltrons are considered highly attractive by other humanoids and even some non-humanoid species.
Other than their distinctive physical appearances, Zeltrons are considered to be very gullible.

# Section 1
Zeltrons have few notable biological differences from humans.
Firstly, like the Falleen species, the Zeltrons produce pheromones that make them more attractive and likeable to those around them.
Secondly, the Zeltrons possess a telepathic ability to project their emotions into those they wish to and are able to feel the emotions of others as well.
This ability is especially marketable for Zeltrons.
Due to their ability to feel and project emotions, positive emotions are treasured to them while negative emotions are shut out.
The third notable difference between the Zeltrons and humans are their biological makeup including a second liver, allowing them to drink more than others.
Their fourth distinction is an extremely fast metabolism allowing for the Zeltrons to all be in near-perfect physical shape while being able to indulge themselves with the most rich foods of the galaxy.



# Section 2
In Zeltrons society, due to their abilities in affecting the emotions of those around them positively, their planet, Zeltros, is in a seemingly-endless party.
Zeltrons are seen as thrill-seeking and hedonistic.
If anyone isn’t having the best possible time on Zeltros, the Zeltrons would feel it and help them in any way possible.



# Section 3
During the last years of the Galactic Republic and the Clone War, a Zeltron boy served in the Jedi Order as a youngling.
His name is unknown.
