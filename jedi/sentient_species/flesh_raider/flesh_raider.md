# Introduction
Branching off of the Rakata, who headed the Infinite Empire, the Flesh Raiders were considered a very savage species.
They were large humanoids with honed teeth, utilized for emptying the bones of prey.
They possessed eight tiny nasal slits above their mouth, along with two squat eye stalks jutting out of the sides of their head.
The species, bearing an uncanny resemblance to their relatives, were only known to be found on Tython following the fall of the Infinite Empire.

# Section 1
Having been forsaken by the Infinite Empire after the Force Wars on the planet Tython, not much was known or recorded about the past of the Flesh Raiders.
However, there were two prevailing theories that the Jedi Order came up with during the Cold War.
One was that they had once been cultured, though met their downfall as other settlers disappeared.
The other was that Sith alchemy brought upon their primitive state.



# Section 2
The Flesh Raiders were in control of Tythos Ridge just as the Jedi Order made their arrival following the Great Galactic War.
Their oafish nature led to the land being tarnished; with a prolific amount of bones covering the little pathways in the area.
This prevented a Jedi meditative retreat from being built in Tythos Ridge.
By the year 3643 BBY, the Flesh Raiders had established outposts in the area.
These consisted of crude structures where they would carry out a form of religious worship.
They had also developed a higher level of intellect, being able to use weapons such as vibroblades.
Moreover, they would use fire as a form of long-distance communication.
At this point, they had begun to be dangerous to outsiders, as they held the path connecting the ruins of Kaleth to the west.



# Section 3
Despite being meager in number, the Flesh Raiders were treated as a threat to the Jedi on Tython throughout the Cold War.
During this period, a Flesh Raider known as Fashk would gain the concern of the Jedi, due to Fashk's unusual Force-sensitivity, along with their unexpected sentience.
