# Introduction
The desire to obtain a new Kyber Crystal is one that many can identify with; obtaining one’s first crystal can both be an intimidating notion and an exhilarating thrill.
Naturally, the chance to obtain another crystal in a Group-Wide Crystal Gathering means it is a highly demanded and anticipated event.
However, it is tightly regulated by the Jedi High Council to ensure a proper sense of importance that ties the event to any major milestone.

A Group-Wide Crystal Gathering is a traditional Crystal Gathering expanded to those who have already obtained a first crystal.
The event is facilitated by the Jedi High Council, with the approval of the Jedi Grandmaster.

# Section 1
The Group-Wide Crystal Gathering is a rare occasion, usually only hosted at milestones or special events, and is largely the only way for many to obtain a new Kyber Crystal, outside of competitions, such as Wright of the Order, Duelist of the Order, Scholar of the Order, or Artificer of the Order.

The first Group-Wide Crystal Gathering was held on the 10th of January, 2021, and since, numerous Crystal Gatherings have been held.

As time has gone on, the scarcity of Group-Wide Crystal Gatherings has grown fairly high, as the current observed time gap between Group-Wide Crystal Gatherings is nine months.
However, this gap can change since these events are held at the discretion of the Jedi High Council.



# Section 2
Due to the GC-22 law, also known as the Information Integrity and Confidentiality, there is only so much that can be said about the process of the actual Group-Wide Crystal Gathering.

An announcement is made regarding the event in the main announcements channel, and when the time comes, the Group-Wide Crystal Gathering is hosted by multiple Jedi Artisans at once per server to ensure the event goes smoothly.
The Group-Wide Crystal Gathering experience is standard for a Crystal Gathering.
However, due to the natural expansion of Jedi on the server, Kyber Crystals might become increasingly difficult as the finding phase progresses.
