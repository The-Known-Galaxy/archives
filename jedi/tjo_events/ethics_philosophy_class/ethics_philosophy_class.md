# Introduction

The Ethics & Philosophy Class, also known as E&P, is a class hosted by Jedi Mystics and participated by Initiate IIs, Padawans, and higher.
To do the Knight Trials, a requirement for aspiring Knights must pass this class.
Passing the Ethics & Philosophy class is done by attending the class and finishing the assignment given by the host with a passing score of 42/60.

# Section 1

The Ethics & Philosophy Class is unlike any other training where attendees are forced to learn something in one way, like the Foundations of Combat training, where Younglings are taught basic mechanics that cannot change.
This class is meant to teach Jedi-in-training how to treat one another and as a guide toward personal betterment.
With Ethics & Philosophy Classes Knights-in-training are given a set of ideas of what a Jedi should be and the freedom to explore it without assistance, helping someone become more of an ideal Jedi.

# Section 2

Ethics & Philosophy Classes are not only just the basic principles of decency, but a manifestation of the Jedi Code put into action.
The Jedi Code is a guideline a true Jedi follows with the Ethics & Philosophy Class study and learning.
Jedi enhance the understanding of the Code and build excellent knowledge.
The philosophy section of the class teaches more about how the Jedi actually are as an order.
This is why Jedi Mystics convey monastic messages in class.
The main difference between a Youngling training and Ethics & Philosophy Class is that the classâ€™ main principle is to keep the quality of the community.
