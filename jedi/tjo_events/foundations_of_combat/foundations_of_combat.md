# Introduction
The Foundations of Combat training is the second training of the three younglings training hosted by the Jedi Academy.
In this training, younglings learn critical fundamentals of lightsaber combat.
Using their vibrosabers that were issued to them after their Basic Newcomer Training, younglings go through a series of activities with the host to familiarize themselves with the combat system.
The Foundations of Combat training consists of six total sections.
Throughout the training, the younglings will learn about the controls and interface of the game, mechanics, combat etiquette, and forbidden moves.
Toward the end of the training, participating younglings will duel each other.
Then, they will be taken on a tour going over the different lightsaber-form statues that are situated around the combat quarters.
