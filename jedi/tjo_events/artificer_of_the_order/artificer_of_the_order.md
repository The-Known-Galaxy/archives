# Introduction
The creation and maintenance of one's Lightsaber have expanded throughout the millennia, ranging in shapes, sizes, and usages.
Defense, offense, everything, and everything in-between can and will be created by Jedi, Sith, and other Force users as they progress the utilization of their Lightsaber, with their Kyber Crystal at the heart of it all.

The Artificer of the Order was introduced within the Jedi Order on July 19th of 2022, and with it was born a roughly monthly tradition of all Jedi across the Order to take their Lightsabers and fabricate the most intricate and unique design they can with all of the inner machinations provided to them.
Ranging from event to event, this monthly categorization of all the fantastic designs Jedi could come up with had varying themes, from steampunk to nature, complex to simple, or any genre one could imagine.

# Section 1
Each Jedi is granted the ability to title their fabrication and provide said fabrication with a story if they deem it necessary.
Once submissions close for the event, the top five Lightsaber creations are posted to the announcements channel and voted on as a whole within the Order or privately by Jedi Masters.
This is subjective to each Artificer of the Order event as of January 5, 2023.

The boons for achieving the top three of the Artificer of the Order event are as follows:
- First place is granted the title “Artificer of the Order” along with a large sum of Credits or a Kyber Crystal.
- Second place is granted a moderate sum of Credits.
- Third place is granted a small sum of Credits.



# Section 2
The Jedi Order has had a handful of Artificers.
Located below are the Artificers and their Lightsaber titles as of January 5, 2023:
July 22nd of 2022 - Anthony_Lon: Hubris of Atlantis
August 25th of 2022 - abc_5329: Sauron’s Heir
November 5th of 2022 - LunarArcadia: Nightfall

The procession of carefully manipulating one’s Lightsaber to be an extension of themself is something that will continue throughout the ages, and these exemplary Jedi have created Lightsabers that will shine through history as something to fabricate true inspiration and prowess with their beautiful craftsmanship.
