# Introduction
This is where you prove yourself worthy of Knighthood.
It is where you show the Jedi of the Order why you belong here and why you should progress.
Unlike the others, this event takes place on the Crystal caves of Ilum.
Upon passing this, you will be granted the rank of Initiate and your very own Lightsaber.
To pass a Crystal Gathering, you must leave the temple once the host opens the blast doors and gather a Kyber crystal and return before the door shuts.
This will be the Lightsaber color you use as a Jedi here.
If you die or get trapped, you fail.

# Section 1
The currently available colors within a Crystal Gathering are: Blue, Green, Cyan, Yellow, Orange, Purple and White.
