# Introduction

The Basic Newcomer Training, otherwise known as BNT, is a training for Force Sensitives within the Jedi Order.
The Jedi Academy manages the training, which consists of three sections.
The training instructs new Force Sensitives about the rank structure, whilst having a tour starting in the spawn room.
After the spawn room, they move to the archives, where the Jedi Code is explained.
Once finished explaining the Jedi Code, the class moves to the big holocron, where the first laws are being explained.
After the first laws, the class will go through the rest of the laws while moving from the holocron to the Jail and Meditation Chamber, to the Quarters of Authority, to the Combat Quarters, and back to the Lecture Room.
Where the host can decide to either let the attendees write a Law Summary or do a Law Questionnaire.

# Section 1

The Basic Newcomer Training is expected to be around 30 to 40 minutes long.
However, they can be either longer or shorter depending on the circumstances.
Basic Newcomer Trainings are widely considered the most crucial Youngling training in the Jedi Order because of its educational value to new group members.
