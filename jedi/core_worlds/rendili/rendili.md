# Introduction
Rendili was a Core World planet that was known for being one of the key founders for the Galactic Republic.
Being ruled by an Arch-Provost, it was the headquarters of the Rendili StarDrive which was founded in 20,000 BBY.
In 25,000 BBY, it would quickly be known for founding the Galactic Republic and would have a military stronghold on the surface.
A few years before in 27,500 BBY, the planet was colonized by sleeper ships, an interstar vessel.
With the start of the Clone Wars at the First Battle of Geonosis, the Arch-Provost called Bengila Urlan had ordered many industrial spies and designers so they could create and plan starships, which could eventually best those of the Kuat.
This would give Rendili and its StarDrive the ability to gain temporary ascendancy.
However, they would later become less aggressive towards each other and work on a project known as the “Victor Initiative Project”.
At the end of the project, they would produce the start of the Victory I-class Star Destroyers.
In 20 BBY, Rendili would be taken control over by the Independent Provisional Government, a group under the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
The Republic did not like this and would send a task force that would capture and secure the world’s Defense Fleet.
They would also retake the whole of Rendili later in the war.
At the time of 18 BBY, the Rendili StarDrive would sign something called the Corporate Sector Authority's Imperial charter within the Dragonbird Gardens.
The StarDrive would accept more of the contracts until 10 BBY, when they joined the New Republic.
