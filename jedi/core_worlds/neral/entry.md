# Introduction

Neral was a Core World planet that was located in the Corellian sector.
It has one known moon and it is just simply known as “Neral’s moon”.
Not much is known about it but it was described as a rich planet that had many resources for the people of the planet.
On the planet were volcanoes and these would be the cause of Neral’s destruction.
They would erupt and destabilize the planet itself, leaving its core to explode.
The only things that remain are the moon and an asteroid field that used to be Neral.
