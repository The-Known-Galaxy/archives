# Introduction
This was an agricultural planet located within the Core Worlds.
It housed the Salliche Agricultural Corporation and was one of eighteen planets on the Agricultural Circuit.

Section One: 
Salliche was been a part of the Galactic Republic since 300 BBY.
The people of Salliche have remained loyal throughout the Clone Wars.
Their loyalty gained them new agricultural contracts following the secession of the Abrion Sector.
Palpatine announced his New Order and immediately sent troops to Salliche to ensure that the crops were in abundance to support his endeavors.
The planet’s proximity to other Core Worlds, access to easy space travel, and a working population prone to discontent makes it a good place for potential activities that went against the new galactic government.

Section Two: 
The Salliche Agricultural Corporation was fully compliant with the Empire, by sending out their own forces at the disposal of the Imperial Military and Imperial Security Bureau officers.
Imperials established a base within the capital of Netassa.
This base had fortified outposts at all major points of the exterior.
The ISB conducted undercover purges to prevent possible trouble makers or traitors within the population, which spiked a recruitment campaign to bring in other workers from other systems to join their operation.
During that time, Moff Gegren Throsen manipulated the planet’s corporate bodies to impose his own will and that of the Emperor.
However, the people of the planet remained loyal to House Harbright.


Section Three:
The parliament of Salliche elected Selnia Harbright to the Imperial Senate, which placed her in a reasonably ineffective position within galactic politics.
This was done mostly to remove her presence from the inner workings of the planet’s hierarchy.
Little did they know that she used her aristocratic influence in secret to sabotage the Imperial Military’s power on her homeworld.
By doing this she aided the Rebel Alliance with their plans to halt the Imperial Military’s efforts on Salliche.
