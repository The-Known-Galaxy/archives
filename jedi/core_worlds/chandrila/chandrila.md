# Introduction
Chandrila was a Core World planet that lurked within the Bormea sector.
It was Ben Solo’s homeworld and birthplace.
The planet was small but very vivid with calming seas and smooth hills.
Chandrila’s capital was Hanna City which held one of the most important buildings, the Chandrila Senate House.
In ancient times, the world was settled by those who built the Old Gather House.
The early rebellion of the newly founded Galactic Empire would list Chandrila as an Alliance planet.
It was one of the planets chosen to be destroyed by Palpatine.
His plan was to use his superweapon and shatter the planet, like he did with Alderaan; to end the Rebellion through fear.
After the events of the Battle of Endor in 4 BBY, Chandrila would serve as the capital of the New Republic and hold the seat for the new Galactic Senate.
This was a tribute back to the days before Vader and Order 66 had occurred.
However, it was not permanent as the capitals would be switched based on elections from the Senate.
Luke Skywalker would have a dream about this planet on Ahch-To, the founding planet of the Jedi Order, which he saw what life would be like if he didn’t help the galaxy and just stayed on Tatooine with his uncle and aunt.
In the dream, the Empire would use the Death Star to destroy Alderaan, Mon Cala and Chandrila; marrying Camie Marstrap as well.
