# Introduction
Balmorra is a factory world located between the Colonies and the Core Worlds.
The planet is known for being one of the most important foundry worlds within the Republic’s space.
Balmorra quickly established itself as a haven for weapon and battle droid manufacturers.
The people of the planet wanted to stay independent of the Republic, so they became good allies with them and supplied the Republic with any droids and/or weapons they may need.

# Section 1
A few years later, Balmorra became a battleground during the Hundred Year Darkness.
During the conflict, there were leviathans being bred by the Dark Jedi.
They later went to go and wreak havoc upon the barricades across the planet.
Around the time of the Great Galactic War, the Sith Empire wanted to take over Balmorra due to their successful manufacturing plants and close location to the Core Worlds.
As the war continued, the Sith Empire grew and so did its control.
This caused the Republic to start removing forces from Balmorra and redeployed them to other problem areas.
Troops kept being removed until the Treaty of Coruscant was signed.



# Section 2
The Republic established 11A on Balmorra assuming that the planet was still under their control since the treaty was signed.
The commander, General Buryn, was ordered to leave and take his troops per the treaty.
Buryn was reluctant and wanted to fulfill his duties, but he was stopped by the Jedi Fortris Gall.
Fortris insisted that they rescue the Republic team that had been captured and held captive by the Sith.
The Jedi traveled to the Troida Military Workshop, where the team was being held.
While Buryn chose to stay on the planet and wait for Fortris, Master Orgus Din would soon arrive and ask him if they would leave the planet to try and prevent any further confrontations with the Sith, to not disobey the terms of the treaty.



# Section 3
Some time passed and the beginning of a new confrontation known as the Cold War was underway.
This caused the Republic to end its support for Balmorra.
However, there was a small group of Republic members that were left on the planet to help with the resistance against the Sith Empire.
A few years after the treaty was signed, the peace with the Sith Empire held true.
Convincing the Republic to redeploy forces to Balmorra.
The Sith Empire attempted to make its presence known to hasten their attempt to retrieve the planet’s weaponry and droids.
Years passed and the time of the Sith had moved on and the Eternal Empire began to take over the galaxy.
Princes Arcann and Thexan led the assault on Balmorra that knocked out the planet’s defense system.
Then they placed a Star Fortress around the planet, who later got kidnapped by a spy known by the name of the Shroud.
He then went to destroy the Star Fortress which left the planet free from the Eternal Empire’s control temporarily.



# Section 4
By 4 ABY, the planet became an Imperial Fortress and remained under Imperial control until 6 ABY.
A few years later, the planet was freed by the New Republic after the Battle of Endor.
Although, Balmorra was brought back under Imperial control during the Emperor’s reappearance.
Not long after, the Balmorrans started providing weapons for the New Republic.
In response, the planet was attacked under the command of Military Executor Sedriss QL.
The army that attacked the planet was made up of Shadow Droids and SD-9-series battle droids.
After a long and hard-fought battle, Sedriss decided to retreat and called off his attack in exchange for a shipment of the droids that the Balmorrans possessed.
