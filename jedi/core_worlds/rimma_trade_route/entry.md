# Introduction

Rimma Trade Route was one of the most important hyperspace lanes in the south of the known galaxy.
It began in the Core Worlds, crossed the Inner and Mid Rim, and would end in the Outer Rim territory, on the very bottom of the official map of the galaxy.
Because of its length, it was one of the most popular travelling choices for merchants, engineers, and warriors who needed a legitimate path throughout the countless planetary systems.

The Rimma Trade Route started in the Core Worlds on the planet Abregado-rae near the Fondor system, known for its chain of vicious space battles during the Great Galactic War, during which the fleets of the Republic and the Sith would continuously launch attacks on important enemy shuttles.
The Route would then direct towards the Mid Rim and meet the Hydian Way and the Corellian Trade Spine in the Western Reaches, containing many Imperial planets often classified as the Imperial Space.
In the Mid Rim, Rimma Trade Route would become crucial for many developed species, such as the Sullustan, who were able to expand their technical skill and establish many beneficial trade connections with various planets.
It was one of the main factors that conditioned the Sullustâ€™s importance in that region.
After exiting the Mid Rim, the Rimma Trade Route would continue to lead towards the Outer Rim.
The hyperspace route would meet its end in the world of Karideph, nearby planets Utapau and Dagobah known for their appearance in the history of the Clone Wars.

As one of the major travel paths in the galaxy, the Rimma Trade Route often played a great role in many wars that took place in its neighbourhood.
The longest and the most impactable of those, the Great Galactic War, began around 3681 BBY when the Sith Empire blocked the Rimma Trade Route to sabotage the Republic worlds after the Sacking of Coruscant.
The Route was also utilised during the Stark Hyperspace War, a mediocre conflict that escalated around 40 years before the Battle of Yavin.
At this time, the Rimma Trade Route was used as a transportation method by the fighters.
10 years later, the same hyperspace lane was used to cut off Naboo from supplies during the Invasion of Naboo- another notable event in galactic history.
