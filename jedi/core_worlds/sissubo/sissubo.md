# Introduction

Sissubo was known as the seventh planet of the Chandrila System, Bormela Sector.
Together with the six other planets Sissubo was a part of the core worlds, however not much is known about this planet compared to its neighbours.
Sissubo along with the other six planets orbit one sun, Chandrilla.
The nearby planets were called Expora, Chandrila, Lorora, Quenus, Asimuse and Dolucar, with a total of twenty six moons orbiting them.
Sissubo meanwhile has only one unnamed moon orbiting it on top of a debris field from the remains of the Empireâ€™s starships of Project Starhawk.
This debris field provided a first line of defence of the New Republic capital on its nearby planet of Chandrila.
