Tepasi was a Core World planet that is close to Alderaan and Chandrila on the space maps.
Most information about Tepsi is unknown; however, its native species is humans and is the homeworld to Cassio Tagge, a General of the Galactic Empire.
The planet shares its name with Tepsi taffy.
When a smuggler called Maz Kanata shouted Hondo Ohnaka on the planet, he would compare the pronunciation to “Tepsi taffy”.
