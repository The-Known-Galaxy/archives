# Introduction
Within the Dolomar sector of the Core Worlds lies the Panto system and its most notable planet, Pantolomin (also dubbed Panto Prime).
Pantolomin is an ocean planet, with as big as 80% of the planet’s surface being water, and although that may seem a hindrance for some - Plantolomin has capitalized on its aquatic scenery without fail.
Its diverse and lively sea creatures are pleasant to the eye and near its northern continent can be seen beautiful and intricate coral reefs that can easily draw in a crowd.
From this, you can probably guess their most profitable business, toursim.
The system as a whole acts  as a resort for travellers, but all of it combined could not compare to Pantolomin.
Every building, transport or scenery is meant to please the eye - even the very water started to exist for this very purpose, with luxury casinos operating in submarines to take full advantage of the stunning underwater sights.
All of this worked and tourists couldn't help but gravitate to it - whether that be due to its beauty or the fact that the Namadii Corridor is so close by.
Such business would be hard to maintain if the two species, the Lomin and Tolo, native to the system did not work together to keep the resorts in check.
At this point, the very planet starts to seemingly exist for the sole purpose to entertain.
Though, sadly, with their success came misfortune and misfortune is unavoidable with fame such as this.

# Section 1
In 9 ABY, Grand Admiral Thrawn was looking for Hoffner, a smuggler who had information on the Katana Fleet (what the Admiral was seeking), and Thrawn believed him to be on board a famous submarine, the Coral Vanda, on the very planet we just discussed.
Relentless in the pursuit of his desires, the Admiral bombed the many serene oceans of the planet to “persuade” the Coral Vanda to surface.
As a consequence, many habitats and reefs were destroyed in the process, even the Grand Admiral lamented this loss.
We know this because of what he said to Captain Pellaeon as the bombardment began : "A pity, though, to have to damage any of these reefs.
They're genuine works of art.
Unique, perhaps, in that they were created by living yet non-sentient beings.
I should have liked to have studied them more closely”.
