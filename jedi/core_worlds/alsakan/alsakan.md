# Introduction

Alsakan was a Core World planet in the Alsakan System that was described as “ecumenopolis”.
It was one of the founders of the Perlemian Trade Route, due to how old and wealthy the planet was.
They had been a political world for centuries and were held responsible for the Alsakan Conflicts over Coruscant.
Considered a part of the Arrowhead, they would decide to grow out of the Tetrahedron within the Galactic Republic’s early days.
Their culture was quite unique and would quickly begin to dominate among the human-filled planets.
In 26,000 BBY, the planet was colonized by many of the human species from the Jedi hub world, Coruscant, in the ship known as the Kuan Explorer.
Alsakan would later be decided best if split into individual kingdoms run by different people.
This would run for years until one of the King of Archais united all the kingdoms as one during the end of the Battle of the Ten Valleys.
In 1000 BBY, the “Alsakan Tessent” would be carved, while including a commemorative piece to the Battle of the Ten Valleys.
However, Jilst Bindalin, a Dark Jedi, would secretly steal the Tessent and would take it to the tomb of Killik on Sarafur.
Alsakan would later become a member of the Galactic Empire when its reign began to grasp hold of most of the galaxy but was one of the first Imperial worlds to finally surrender to Ackbar’s fleet in 6 ABY.
After the Imperial forces collapsed, the rival factions would begin to fight one-another again and would result
in the Star Dreadnoughts ‘Whelm’ and ‘Panthac’s’ destruction.
