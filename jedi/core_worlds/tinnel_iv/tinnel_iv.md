# Introduction

Tinnel IV was one of four planets located in the Tinnel system, which resided along the Corellian Run.
As well as being a generally prospering planet, it was also the sector capital of the sector it resided in, the Quanta Sector.
It was a notable point in the Galaxy and, as a consequence, saw the rise and fall of many organizations that ruled it.
Moreover, it was home to a family who had served both sides of Galactic Wars - with Tiaan Jerjerrod who held the rank of Imperial Moff during the Galactic Civil War and his son Jax Jerjerrod who served the First Order.
However, unexpectedly, the son of Jax Jerjerrod, Jothan Tiaan Jerjerrod, would not follow the same path and chose to fight against the First Order and his father.
But this family was not the only ones to fight in Galactic Wars and many others from this planet joined the fight on either end.
