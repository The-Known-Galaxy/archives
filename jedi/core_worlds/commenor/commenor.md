# Introduction
The planet Commenor was a planet located in the Colonies region which was just outside of the Core Worlds.
It was regarded to be as prestigious as the Core Worlds themselves.
Commenor was colonized by Humbarine.
Humbarine was an ecumenopolis and heavily industrialized.
Despite the heavy industrialization, Commenor was able to declare independence alongside the other several colonies due to the slow interstellar travel and communications.
After its independence, the planet decided to join the Galactic Republic sometime between 25,000 BBY and 22,000 BBY.

# Section 1
The planet itself was a common trading outpost and popular spaceport, known for its exports of chrysopaz gemstones and local brandy.
During the Mandalorian Wars, Commenor was attacked by Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders in an attempt to continue their campaign.
In 44 BBY, Commenor was used to contribute ships to Senator Ranulph Tarkin’s security force.
The planet was already a prominent spaceport, so being able to assist the Senator’s security force provided a great deal of protection to the planet.



# Section 2
Later in history, Commenor eventually joined the New Republic.
The Vong War erupted and it resulted in Yuuzhan Vong conquering the world.
Commenor was liberated from Vong by Boba Fett’s Mandalorian Supercommandos around the end of the Vong War.
