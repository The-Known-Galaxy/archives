# Introduction

Coruscant is the homeworld to billions of different people.
The planet is home to several billion jobs, whether it be on the upper levels or even the lower levels.
Coruscant is filled with diversity, with not one dominant species, instead it housed varieties of different species.
Coruscant would become the hub for the Galactic Republic.
More importantly, however, Coruscant was home to the Jedi Temple.
Along with the Temple was also the Senate Building, which played a very important role during several different galactic wars.

# Section 1

Coruscant has served as the capital planet of the Republic, and of the entirety of the galaxy, since the old Galactic Republic.
At one point during Coruscant’s time, it was renowned by the Sith Empire, but would later be taken back by the Republic and the Jedi Order.
Coruscant played an important role for the Galactic Republic.
Not only did it house their politics, but it also housed the Jedi Temple, which were both important branches to the Republic, especially during several different critical wars.
A lot of the Republic’s important assets belonged on the planet.

# Section 2

One of the more important stations in Coruscant was the Republic Center.
This space housed some of the Republic’s military during the Clone Wars.
The Center consisted of a large jail space and several other security measures.
The base also would contain different machines, such as the HAVw A6 Juggernaut and LAAT ships.
The military base consisted of mostly Shock Troopers, also known as the Coruscant Guards.
Security measures such as key cards, computer scanners, and more were used to ensure security inside of the base.

# Section 3

The underworld was a low-lit, low atmosphere area.
The underworld was where those with little to no money would live on Coruscant.
A majority of Coruscant’s population lived in the underworld.
This area was crime-riddled, as most of the lower levels consisted of smugglers, criminals, and was even home to several different criminal empires.
The only light that these lowly areas would get was from street lights.
While there was security, it was limited.
The Coruscant Security Force, were in-charge of patrolling the lower levels.
However, this security force was not enough to prevent major amounts of crime.

# Section 4

Coruscant was a planet that, although looked like a progressive city from the top, there is a darker side the further down you go.
However, Coruscant housed several important buildings for the Republic.
Coruscant served as the capital of the Republic for a reason.
It’s power and influence also made it a dominant planet.
