# Section 2
By 18 ABY Sacorria would influence a series of events that would transpire to be called the Correllian Crisis.
Once the New Republic became the dominant government in the galaxy, the Sacorrian Triad and Corellia would find it more incisive to seek independence from The New Republic.
This crisis would culminate in the Triad holding Centerpoint Station, a devastating superweapon.
However, the New Republic would eventually resolve the crisis through their victory in the Battle of Centerpoint Station.
