# Introduction
Anaxes was a terrestrial world that was the base of the Republic Navy, and the Anaxes War College.
Anaxes had a population of 512 million, with 94% of those being human.
The planet was part of the Anaxes system, having 8 neighboring planets.
One of those planets, Axum, was very similar to Anaxes, but with higher industrial power and speed.
The planet consisted mainly of plains and forests, as well as mountains.
Anaxes also had a Citadel and contained many necessities.

Early humans first colonized Anaxes and Axum around 27,500 BBY.
These two planets were both some of the earliest planets to contribute towards the Republic.
By 25,000 BBY, the Azure Imperium was created, and Anaxes became the location of the main fleet for the Republic.
Soon, the Anaxes War College would be established, which prepared Naval students after their arrival from Prefsbelt IV.
Anaxes was in the Perlemian Trade Route, placing it in the route towards Coruscant.
This became an efficient strategy for defense, as in the Great Hyperspace War, the fleet defended Coruscant and prevented most of the Sith from arriving there.
Anaxes formed many naval Admirals that would prove to be competent, thus gaining the name “The Defender of the Core”.

Later in the Clone Wars, Anaxes was the base of the Azure Hammer Command.
The fleet would come out victorious in many battles with the CIS, with the CIS commander being executed in the Battle of Anaxes.
After 19 BBY, Anaxes remained the center of the Imperial Navy throughout the Galactic Civil War until the Battle of Endor.
After that, many attempted to take control of Anaxes, but by 9 BBY, Admiral Osted Wermis decided to create a treaty with the New Republic.
