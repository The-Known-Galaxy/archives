# Introduction
Vulpter,  a planet in the Deep Core region, was part of the Vulpter System.
Once, the planet was home to a variety of animals and plant life, yet this all changed over a millennium as it transformed into a polluted world filled with waste and factories.
The planet is also home to the sentient Vulpteeren species.
While being quite near the centre of the galaxy, it was often disregarded by organisations across the galaxy as insignificant, even excluding the planet from their maps.
Vulpter does possess a breathable atmosphere by most species, however, it is polluted due to the planet's conditions, and with a range of temperatures from very cold to temperate.

# Section 1
The planet Vulpter was once covered by large wildlife, grassy plains, and great forests yet this changed over millennia due to the harsh industrialisation of the planet, almost eradicating all life on the planet.
This resulted in Vulpter becoming a wasteland, dominated by factories and machines.
A thick smog would wrap itself around the planet as a result of the air pollution being so bad that it is visible.
Agriculture on this planet was unsustainable and encouraged farmers to migrate off-world further isolating the planet.
This situation would only get worse as the Vulpteeren species would play a part in founding the Trade Federation which would seize control of the planet.
This resulted in the planet’s conditions progressing into something even worse.
The planet was converted into a dumping ground further intoxicating the planet.
The Trade Federation would begin to use driller machines to dig underground caverns causing the water supply and the air to become toxic.



# Section 2
Following the rise of the New Empire, under the leadership of Emperor Palpatine, this resulted in the deterioration of the Trade Federation’s rulership over the planet.
The planet was then ruled by a locally formed government that possessed limited resources such as a police force and navy.
The Empire established strict rules about hyperspace usage into the Deep Core region by ships unless authorised only.
The planet was also disregarded by the Empire due to its lack of resources as “usage” to the Empire.
Many Vulpteeren individuals were enslaved by the Empire and forced into labour.
However, the lack of attention the planet received from the Empire allowed the Rebellion Alliance to utilise the planet as one of its secret operative bases.
After the destruction of the Galactic Empire, the New Republic was established and Vulpter was once restored as a planet of the Galactic community.
As the Vulpteerens regained control of their planet, they would strive to transform it back to its former beauty.
A team of scientists was also dispatched by the republic to analyse the ecosystem and begin purification of the planet to mend its broken ecology.
The planet has ever since been in a continuous process of recovering after a long time of pollution.
