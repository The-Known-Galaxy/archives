# Introduction
Atrisia was a Core World planet that was described as “terrestrial” and had the nickname of Kitel Phard.
It would be located near the Giju Run hyperlane and the Atrisi system.
In their mythology, a creature known as Wapoe was the demi-god of disguise.
The planet was mostly known as the homeworld for the Shredder Bat.
This creature was non-sentient and had highly sensitive hearing, meaning it could occasionally be hunted.
Shredder Bats had no eyes so they would focus on their ears and hearing for survival.
At the end of their head, were their fangs which could extend.
A variation of the bat would be the Snow Shredder Bat.
Apart from that species, the planet was inhabited by humans.
The inhabitants of the system numbered to a hundred million to five-hundred million in 25 BBY.
This would help lead Atrisia to form seven nations in its ancient history.
An example of one of the nations would be the Atrisian Empire, one of the first well-known factions that would actively engage into many worthy but bloody conquests.
It would be led by Uuch Tching, the fifty-fourth Emperor, who would unify the planet.
Tching was the kind of man who enjoyed his victories and discovered more continents on his homeworld.
As he tried to gain success from all continents, he expanded the Atrisian Empire for one purpose, which was to rule the whole of Atrisia.
He didn’t care if it was directly or indirectly, he only wanted to lead.
One of the reasons he became so popular is due to how he ruled, it was tyrannical and full of suffering.

However, his strategy with the near opposite, his insight was very smart and would usually focus on spies or diplomacy.
Tching was able to subvert more than around thirty different rebellions against his Empire.
Another reason would be because he was also an author to many parables and analogies, which were to be known as the Sayings.
With time and success, this Emperor was one of the most legendary rules in the galaxy and in his time.
To remember him, people would nickname the planet, “Kitel Phard”.
Eventually, one of the Emperors of the new time would order a couple of prints of the Emperor Uueg Tching’s Sayings due to how limited they were in 539 BBY.
The Parliment of the planet who argued for the power that the throne has, would make “Sayings” available in two different copies.
One that was specially printed and the other in a database form.
By the time of 24,500 BBY, the Yovshin Swordsmen of the planet would develop a pair of swords for duelling in Atrisia’s main city.

They would decide to name the weapons after their settlement, which was Jar’Kai.
Along with it, they would craft a style for it to match which was a dual technique that relied much on speed and agility.
In the same year, the leader of the Legions of Lettow, Xendor, would come by to discover mysteries related to the hyperlane between Atrisia and a few other planets.
Near the aftermath of the First Great Schism, several legionnaires of the legion would flee to the borders of the Galactic Republic and soon leave them.
Though Arden Lyn, a member of the Legions of Lettow and former lover of Xendor, would travel beyond the world instead in a chance to flee the Jedi Order.
But in this attempt, would fail and be caught by the Jedi on the planet Irkalla.



# Section 3
The Atrisians would eventually overtime decide to leave their homeworld and would become a part of something known as the Atrisan Commonwealth.
During this, the places that surrounded Atrisia would be explored by the Galactic Republic between 5000 and 3996 BBY.
The Republic would call this “the civilised galaxy”.
Sometime in 3638 BBY, the Jar’Kai swords were claimed to be discovered by an unnamed treasure hunter, who said they belonged to one of the Yovshin swordsmen.
An interested organization wanted to see if it was true or false so they would send a companion over to them and with the results, it was confirmed genuine.
Eight years later from the finding, Atrisia weapon masters would test their students by having them fight strong opponents, who were skilled in this technique.
The Eternal Alliance commander would usually dispatch a companion to the world for one purpose, this purpose was to recruit skilled warriors, ready to be challenged.
While doing so, they would find a group of warriors, who were captured by the Morgukai Order, and bring them to the Sith-filled world of Korriban.
500 years after Parliment making “Sayings” into two different copies, the Empire would mark its history in studies within the University of Coruscant.



# Section 4
By 1000 BBY, Atrisia had fallen into the grasp of the Galactic Republic during the active days of the Clone Wars.
One of the Republic’s first campaigns was to send its twentieth army of the Republic military to protect the world’s vicinity from the rival Confederacy of Independent Systems.
As the Republic fell and the Galactic Empire rose, The Kitel Phard Dynasty of Atrisia decided to serve as an “inspiration” for the new Empire.
Darth Sidious, also known as Emperor Palpatine, would promise to bring them a golden age akin due to the achievements of their ancient ancestors, but it would not happen due to him being a trickster and liar.
In 17 BBY, the whole planet lay in the hands of the Galactic Empire and most parts of the Imperial Military would be named after the ancient rulers of Atrisia, such as the Atrisian corps and the highest military title, “Warlord of the Empire”.
After the death of Palpatine, a Rebel Alliance historian would note the history of Atrisia along with some Imperial documents.
The planet would also finally decide to declare its independence from the Empire and instead, ally with the New Republic.



# Section 5
Seven years later, the xenoarchaeologist Doctor Corellia Antilles would discuss Atrisia at the Galaxy Museum in a lecture on the planet Coruscant.
By 137 BBY, the ancient and now well-known planet would incorporate into the Core Worlds Security Zone.
