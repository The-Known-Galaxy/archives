The planet had constructed the Leadership School, which came to be one of the most important aspects of Andara’s history.
It was the host to many students who were mostly a part of the galaxy’s elite, training to have power and some form of influence in the future.
During the year 26 BBY Senator Berm Tarturi strove to uphold power on the planet, however, the people of the planet Ieria, a planet located in the Andarian system, claimed to have suffered during Senator Berm's reign.
The conflict between the two escalated when the son of the Senator, Gillam, was thought to have been kidnapped from the Leadership School.
Desperate to get his son back, Senator Berm turned to the Jedi High Council to retrieve his son, however, the Jedi High Council was suspicious by this claim and thought that the students themselves were behind this kidnapping since they advertised themselves as mercenaries.

# Section 2

The Council sent Padawan Anakin Skywalker and Padawan Ferus Olin, alongside their masters, Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and Knight Siri Tachi.
The four disguised as students and eventually found out that the senator's son himself was behind the organization which ultimately claimed to “kidnap” Gillam.
Upon going to a mission in Ieria, the students, including Gillan attempted to murder Skywalker.
Skywalker managed to defeat the group and he sent them to Coruscant to be questioned.
The other three Jedi calmed the rising tensions that were in the senate due to this event.
