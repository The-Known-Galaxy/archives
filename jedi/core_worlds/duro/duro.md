# Introduction
Duro, also called Duros, was a Core World planet located in the Duro system.
It was known for being one of the most polluted and depopulated worlds.
Being the homeworld to the Duros species, the planet itself was mostly empty or just abandoned due to most of the population living in one of the twenty cities orbiting.
Under the rule of the Infinite Empire, it would become a slave world, where inhabitants were forced to help create the Star Forge in 30,000 BBY.
The Rakata would be striked with a plague later on, allowing the Duros species to fight back against them.
The Duros would try to colonize Neimoidia, though they were already considered on their own and separated by culture around 15,000 BBY.
They would hunt down more cultures until coming across the Sneeve, Adner and Koboth in 5000 BBY.
For the next few years, the species would leave their homeworld of Duro in-search of space cities.
This would cause pollution and near-total waste with mass extinctions of some of the other creatures.
More waste and suffering to Duro would be caused during the Mandalorian Wars as they would invade unexpectedly using their Basilisk war droids.
When the Duros species returned, they realized it would take years of rebuilding and tragedy for themselves and the planet.
The Duros colony would be wiped out on Harpori in 1002 BBY, during the New Sith Wars.
