# Introduction

Kuat is a planet made infamous for its shipyards and is located in the Core Worlds.
The shipyards orbit the planet along its equator, creating a ring around the planet.
The Kuat Drive Yards had built ships for the Galactic Republic and later the Galactic Empire alike, creating ships such as the Venator class Star Destroyer and the Imperial-class Star Destroyer lines.
As being located in the Core Worlds, Kuat was one of the earliest members of the fledgling Galactic Republic.

# Section 1

As the fourth planet located in the Kuat system, the planet was a lush planet filled with lush forests and plains alike, with three main continents.
As well as scattered islands in the planet’s oceans.
With relatively mild wet winters and warm summers, the planet was relatively calm.
Hostile fauna was nonexistent, as the planet was terraformed with animals that were not hostile and herbivores.
The planet also hosted beautiful and carefully-groomed gardens, thanks to drebin, a herbivore that provided the compost for these gardens.
It had two orbiting moons, Bador and Ronay, with an orbital period around its home star of 322 days.
As well as the artificially made Kuat Drive Yards, the orbital shipyards that encircled the planet.

# Section 2

Kuat was a planet chosen by a consortium of the wealthiest merchant families who are simply known as The Ten to be terraformed into the lush paradise that it is today.
The Ten hired the best ecologists, terraformers, and animal breeders to terraform, which lasted for 20 years.
Then, Coruscanti Humans settled Kuat by sleeper ship in 27,500 which had formed an aristocratic society in the world, with the wealthiest families taking claim to the starship industry above.
In 26,000 BBY, Kuat had repeated the process of Coruscant and built its own colony ships, having colonized Axum, Tepasi, and Humbarine.
A thousand years later in 25,000 BBY, Kuat had gained political power within the greater galaxy and had become a founding member of the then-fledgling Galactic Republic.

# Section 3

During the planet’s time within the Republic, Kuat sent its representatives for the Galactic Republic on the behalf of Kuat.
However, they were selected with the greater reason of benefiting the Kuat Drive Yards interests rather than the planet itself.
This continued up to the end of the Clone Wars.
As Kuat was an important planet strategically, the Kuat was well protected by the Republic during the Clone Wars and even by the Empire when the regime change occurred.
Protected by three Star Dreadnaughts during the Clone Wars, as well as the Fourth Outer Rim Army during the early years of the war.
Kuat remained loyal to the Republic during this time, rather than turning to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, as many members of Kuat’s upper aristocracy had gained favor with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.
Kuat had taken many steps to help the war effort outside of producing war materials.
One such example was an attempt to infiltrate Neimoidia with modified worker droids.
These droids had been equipped with spyware.
Another example is refusing to continue production of its heavy vehicles and walkers on the Separatist-controlled world of Balmorra when the planet seceded.

# Section 4

After the fall of the Galactic Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Kuat was a very valuable world for the Empire.
Being one of the first worlds under Imperial administration, allowing for a smooth transition to the new galactic power.
Kuat’s power structure also changed, with Moff Thichis Kuras, who was native to Kuat and a member of its nobility, taking power of the entire system, with Senator Giddean Danu serving as Kuat’s delegation to the newly formed Imperial Senate.
With Captain Anton Kale lobbying his way to be assigned control of Imperial forces on the planet.
The Bureau of Ships and Services restricted much of the orbital shipyards as well as the planet itself, with most of the shipyards falling under military supervision.
However, even with the military oversight, the shipyards were still considered civilian-operated by 4 ABY.
The Imperial Navy and Army’s demand for military hardware was always in high demand, from AT-ST walkers to Super Star Destroyers alike.
Even designing the foreboding Eclipse-class Super Star Destroyer as well as the building of it.
Kuat had been attacked several times throughout the Galactic Civil War, however with the planetary defense force being equivalent to that over Coruscant itself, it took until 8 ABY, after the fall of the Empire for the planet to be taken by the New Republic.

# Section 5

After the New Republic had captured Kuat through a wistful play conceived by Wedge Antilles, Airen Cracken, and Ral’Rai Muvunic to have Kuat surrender to the New Republic, the shipyards were still put in use and the planet was still considered a fortress world, especially during Thrawn’s campaign to reunite the Galaxy under a new Empire in 9 ABY.
It was also a target during Operation Shadow Hand by Executor Sedriss QL.
During the Yuuzhan Vong War, the New Republic Defense Force’s commanders had been hosted by Kuat during briefings, as well as continued supplying the New Republic with new ships, which were under the design of the New Class program.
After the fall of Fondor to the Yuuzhan Vong, the importance of Kuat was catapulted, with additional warships dispatched to safeguard the planet as well as the shipyards above.
However, even with the additional forces the planet was lost to the Yuuzhan Vong but was eventually returned to the Kuati after the Battle of Yuuzhan’tar.
The planet and system were still significant afterward.
Within the early stages of the Second Galactic Civil War negotiated peace between Prime Minister Aidel Saxan and Supreme Commander Gilad Palleon.
Later during the war, a large battle took place above the planet’s atmosphere, a battle between Alliance and Confederation forces that took over a week to conclude, with massive casualties on both sides of the battle.
The fighting eventually came to a draw.
In the years of the Galactic Empire ruled by Darth Krayt, over a hundred years after the Battle of Endor, the planet still continued being a strategic point of warship production.
