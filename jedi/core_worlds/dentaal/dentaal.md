# Introduction
Dentaal was a planet in the core worlds, whose population was wiped out by the Candorian plague at the time of the Galactic civil war.
The planet's capital was Calif city and the planet itself was ruled by the House of Dentaal, who was suppressed and disbanded by the Empire.
The house would have none of this as they formed Dentaal Independence party which they used to assassinate the Imperial Governor Taliff.
Crix Madine's storm commandos wanted to come up with a quick and easy tactic to destroy the Dentaal people, so they implemented the Candonian plague which first started to spread itself in Calif city before eventually passing over the Kindelian continent where it eradicated 10 billion people and left no survivors on the planet.
The Empire later passed the blame for the Candorian Plague over to the Rebel Alliance, ultimately claiming that they were responsible for the genocide that happened on planet Dentaal.
