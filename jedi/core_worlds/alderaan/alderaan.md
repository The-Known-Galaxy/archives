# Introduction

Alderaan, located in the Core Worlds, was the second planet in the Alderaan system and the home of many famous heroes, including Leia Organa Solo, Bail Organa, and Ulic Qel-Droma.
Renowned galaxy-wide for their planet's unspoiled beauty, refined culture, and commitment to peace, Alderaanians worked with and around the land to preserve as much of the natural surroundings as they could

# Section 1

Alderaan was a founder of the Galactic Republic in 25,053 BBY and one of the anchor-points for early hyperspace exploration.
Alderaan was headquarters of Alderaan Royal Engineers, an early Republic shipwright; with these ships Alderaanian colonists settled Nim Drovis.
During the Mandalorian Wars, the planet was threatened with invasion by the forces of Cassus Fett, but the entire invasion force was prematurely obliterated, due to misuse of an ancient Sith artifact.

# Section 2

During the peak of the Great Galactic War, the planet's peace and tranquility was shattered by a full-scale Sith Empire invasion.
The Sith quickly overwhelmed the local defense forces and took the entire royal family hostage.
In response, a Republic and Jedi task force launched a swift counter-offensive against the Sith; recapturing the planet and inflicting a heavy defeat on the Sith.

# Section 3

As a whole, Alderaan strongly opposed the Military Creation Act; they had their own security forces, but remained loyal to the Republic during the Clone Wars.
Alderaan allowed Refugee Relief Movement settlement by displaced exiles from Ando and other Separatist worlds who wished to remain Republic citizens.
Due to the assistance of these exiles, Alderaan was attacked personally by General Grievous.
