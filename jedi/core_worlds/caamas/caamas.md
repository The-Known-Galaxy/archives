# Introduction
Caamas was a planet located in the Core Worlds in the Cirius System, with the only sun being Cirius.
The native species of Caamas were the Caamasi.
Its coordinates were “M-9” on the Galactic Grid Map.
It had one notable trade route, which was the Commenor Run.
The diameters of Caamas measured 15,540 kilometers.
It had a breathable atmosphere with jungles, hills, and steppes.
The water on Caamas was quite marshy and had numerous swamps.
Caamas Flora and fauna were the Thornsniper plants and the Behemoth.
Caamas was ruled by a democratic government and was loyal to the Galactic Republic and Corellian Empire and one of the first planets to be under Imperial rule, remaining loyal to the Empire.

# Section 1
After the Battle of Endor, Caamas joined the New Republic and served them as a loyal ally for decades.
Caamas was a Core Founder of the Galactic Republic in 25,053 BBY.
In 19 BBY, the new Galactic Empire, Sheev Palpatine, ordered Caamas to suffer planetary bombardment as they still followed the Old  Republic’s principles.
The Empire fired violently down upon the planet, destroying the Jedi Temple on the planet and killing millions of citizens.
Those lucky 250 citizens who survived fled to other planets as the atmosphere had become toxic and the once lush forests had become a bare, barren, and desolate rocky wasteland where nothing could thrive and prosper.
All former cities became refugee settlements, in which the people living there only sought a ship off the now barren rock that is Caamas.
After the destruction of Caamas, the planet was hit by a meteor, creating a massive divot on the planet’s surface.
In the years between 2 BBY and 0 BBY, Princess Leia led numerous missions named “mercy missions” to Caamas, assisting the refugees in need.
The New Republic generously built a city in Caamas named the “Refuge City,” assisted by the Ithorians.
The Bothans kindly offered to the divot caused by the meteor as a dumping ground, offering 50,00 credits per year, which went to decontaminating the toxic atmosphere.
From then on, Caamas slowly began to be restored into the once prospering planet it once was, thriving under The New Republic’s rule.
