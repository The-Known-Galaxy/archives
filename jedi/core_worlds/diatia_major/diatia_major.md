# Introduction

There is nothing particularly notable about this planet, and therefore there is little to uncover or document about it, however there is some.

This was a star positioned within the Southern Core “Diatia Major”.
It had no neighboring planets and thus was isolated altogether.
The star was surrounded by Diatian Clockwork.
This was essentially massive rings that remained unscorched by the star's heat for millennia.

It is believed to have been constructed by the Celestials, as they are the only species to be as old as the rings.
The celestials disappeared in 30,000 BBY but the rings remained, and have not been studied further.

They are currently used as a tourist site of sorts due to their scale and size, and their general amazing sight.
