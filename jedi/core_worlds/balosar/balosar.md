# Introduction

Balosar was a Core World planet in the Balosar system.
Being the homeworld of the Balosar species, it was polluted like Duro and home to many grimy factories and oppressed people.
This environment would lead most species that lived there to turn into criminals and smugglers.
Most of Balosar was industrialized meaning that the buildings would go so far into the sky, the sun could not penetrate it enough to reach the full surface.
The air was barely breathable and could even suffocate some to death so it would force the Balosar species to adapt to more poisonous gas than before.
When the Clone Wars erupted into battle, the planet would remain with the Republic and the 20th Sector Army within the Grand Army of the Republic would guard it from any harm for it was their duty.
When the Republic fell and the new Galactic Empire rose to power, they would have no other option but to declare loyalty to the Emperor, who is also known as Darth Sidious.
Belosar would try their best to avoid any contact with the Galactic Civil War so no attention would be brought to themselves.
Around the time of the New Republic, it would suffer major issues such as air pollution and crop poisoning.
They would join Twiâ€™lek dealers as their economy fell for support.
With their help, Belosar would avoid the war that was coming by Yuuzhan Vong.
This is due to the fact that the organization wanted to defend themselves from the new Alliance before attacking a planet to keep out of sight.
