# Introduction
Humbarine was a Core World planet located within the Humbarine system and sector, described as “ecumenopolis”.
It was well-known for being a hub of commerce around 25,000 BBY and for the next decades.
Around this time, they would also become one of the founding members of the Galactic Republic.
The Humbarine capital was heavily focused on industrial life and would serve as the whole capital for the rest of the sector.
The use of it was mostly for the Trellen Trade Route.
This trade route would link this planet to the east of the galaxy and also the Commenor.
Inhabitants were known as Humbariners and the Senator at the time of the Clone Wars was Bana Breenu.
Barrow Oicunn, a Lieutenant from the world, would serve for the Clone Wars defense fleet and was transferred later in his work to the Coruscant Home Fleet.
This was due to the downfall of the planet and the loss of his family.
Oicunn served as an Admiral in his life and was titled as the “Hero of Humbarine”.
As he got older, he would be targeted by bounty hunters.
By 26,000 BBY, the crew of the ship known as the Human sleeper, people who originated from Kuat, had discovered the planet and later colonized it but would be resolved.
Near this time, Humbarine would be titled “The capital of manufacturing” and “The Humbarian Rule” with starting to become a hub like mentioned before.
As it became one of the founders of the Republic, itself and the other Core Worlds would work together and send colony ships of every individual region, which would be called The Slice.
However, there would be slow travel and communication due to most natives either being Balmorran and Commenorian.
These planets would later move and claim independence for their own, instead of providing the resources of the planet.
At the time of the Tionese War, the planet would develop warships to assist the Republic’s counterattack against a rival, the Union of Desevro and Tion.
During the Great Sith War, their Swift Fleet which belonged to the Republic would launch near Humbarine and would travel throughout the system before arriving at the location of the Brotherhood of the Sith, dealing mighty blows.
The world would soon be protected by large warships that they had control over so they could not get involved in any galactic wars.
They would do this until the arrival of the Clone Wars.
When the Clone Wars did break out, the whole sector would lose its local defense fleet as it went under the grasp of the Republic War Council.
The Council would make the decision of making it a part of the Republic military.
As the war went on and on, several attacks by the Confederacy of Independent System were made.
The Senator of the sector, Bana Breemu, would lose her view of politics and tell the Republic how it was a lost cause.
This was due to Grievous’ bombardment with his ship the Invisible Hand that would make everyone decide to leave the planet uninhabited.
Though as the Galactic Empire began its new reign, Humbarine was classed as resettled and most would come back.
By around 25 BBY, it would have nearly a hundred million sentients.
In 4 BBY, it would become an Imperial Fortress for officers and people of the Empire.
Some years after the end of the Empire, the Yuuzhan Vong War would occur as New Republic fleets passed by the planet but they would decide not to ever be involved with any battles or wars again.
