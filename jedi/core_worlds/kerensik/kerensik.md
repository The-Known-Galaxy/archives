# Introduction
Located in the Kerensik system around the Southern Core portion of the Core Worlds, Kerensik is a terrestrial world with a frozen climate.
Trees on the planet are unique to any others due to the “spines” that have replaced the leaves.
During the Galactic Civil War, the system and other systems would form their own enclave within the galaxy called the Botor Enclave.
