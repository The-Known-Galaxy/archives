# Introduction

The Corellian Trade Spine was one of the five super-hyperroutes, which served as a major trade route throughout galactic history.
It began at the planet Corellia, located in the Core Worlds, and approached towards the edge of the galaxy in the direction of Duro.
The hyperlane began construction in 25,000 BBY and was incrementally built until its completion in 5,500 BBY.
Similar to its cousin, the Corellian Run, the Corellian Trade Spine ran through every region of the galaxy.
It intersected the Rimma Trade Route at Yag’Dhul, before passing the Greater Javin region and intersecting the Hydian Way near Terminus.
The Anoat sector, located in the Outer Rim territories, was home to the desert planet Mataou, which acted as the primary gateway for starships transferring from the Corellian Trade Spine to the Ison Trade Corridor.
During the Clone Wars, the super-hyperroute was prone to seperatist attacks from Devaron, and was raided again by Nym’s pirates over the course of the Galactic Civil War.
