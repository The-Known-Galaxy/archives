# Introduction

Selonia was an oceanic planet within the Corellian system.
Selonia was also a part of the Five Brothers, a group of five planets within the Corellian system.
This planet housed the Selonian race.
Selonians stood at 2 meters tall and were sentient carnivorous mammals.
The world itself was a very industrial world surrounded by a colossal ocean.
To counter the size of the ocean, Selonians created tunnels under the surface to allow communication with their people.
The planet’s oceans were rumored to house many sea monsters since Selonia’s ocean was the only ocean large enough to compensate for these monsters.

# Section 1

Selonians had created a system of tunnels to allow communication and housing.
They were called “dens” and were located under much of the planet’s crust and mantle.
Orbital shipyards operated above the surface and produced many vessels for use within the Corellian system.
The Selonians species lived within these dens and created hives revolving around a fertile female for breeding.

# Section 2

The history of Selonia was believed to be the work of Celestials.
Believed that they moved Selonia into the Corell orbit along with the other four planets who formed the Five Brothers.
It’s unknown whether or not Selonians were indigenous to the planet or moved there by Celestials.
All that is known about their history is their annexation by the Infinite Empire in 30,000 BBY.
