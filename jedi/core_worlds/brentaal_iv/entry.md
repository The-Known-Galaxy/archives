# Introduction

Brentaal IV, also known as just Brentaal, was a Core World planet in the Brentaal System and Bormea sector.
It was said that it occupies the most valuable spot in the entire galaxy due to it being close to the most major hyperlanes, the Hydian Way and Perlemian Trade Route.
This would make it serve as a checkpoint for trafficking and a major commerce hub as it entered the Republic around 22,000 BBY.
Around 24,500 BBY, it was used as a site for a war between the Legions of Lettow and the Jedi Order during the First Great Schism.
For years, it would serve as a target point for ships with most of the cargo from the Outer Rim passing through the planet.
In 3705 BBY, Freia Kallea, a native of Brentaal and daughter of House Kallea, began to work as a hyperspace scout even though her parents would disagree with her apprenticeship.
Kallea would link together existing hyperlinks one-by-one in the galaxy, especially the north.
Examples could be the Corsin Run, Mandalorian Run and the Morellian Trail.
She had extended the whole Brentaal-Denon Route to the southern side of the galaxy.
As the Clone Wars came to an end, Bail Organa would flee to one of the stations, Sel Zonn Station.
This was one of the XQ2 platforms that orbited the world with some Imperial Agents trying to reach Organa but would fail.
Platt Okeefe would be born some years later to House Okeefe but would leave Brentaal in her teenage years to become a pilot.
