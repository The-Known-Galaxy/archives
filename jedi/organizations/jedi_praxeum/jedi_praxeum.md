# Introduction
During the Thrawn campaign, Obi-Wan Kenobi appeared to Luke in a vision.
He would no longer appear in Luke's visions, so he charged Luke with the mission of restoring the Jedi.
Luke was deeply distressed at being the last of the old Jedi, but Obi-Wan's last thought came with a chuckle and a sense of calm: ''Not the last of the old Jedi, Luke.
The first of the new.'' With this encouragement, and after the cloned Emperor's defeat, Luke approached the New Republic for permission to establish a Jedi academy.
During his travels, he had discovered a number of Force-sensitives and finally felt ready to begin to train new Jedi.
Permission was granted and a site on the historic moon Yavin 4 was selected.
This first-class consisted of twelve pupils with Luke as their teacher.
Some of those twelve were Kam and Tionne Solusar, Kirana Ti, Dorsk 81, Streen, Gantoris, Madurrin, Kyle Katarn, Brakiss, and Corran Horn.
Other Jedi to join soon after were Kyp Durron, Cilghal, Mara Jade, and Dal Konur.
It was not long before it became apparent that not all was well at the Academy.

# Section 1
The spirit of Exar Kun, an ancient Sith Lord, haunted some of the temples on the moon and began to influence Luke’s students towards the dark side.
Kun attacked Luke, forcing him into a coma, and Kyp Durron, one of the most promising students, fled the Academy in Sun Crusher, wreaking havoc on the galaxy and destroying the world of Carida.
Eventually Luke was awoken and the Sith spirit was defeated by a joint Jedi offensive.
This would be but one of many trials ahead of the fledgling Order though, with subsequent attacks directed against it by Admiral Daala, the Empire Reborn, and the Second Imperium.
