# Introduction
The Order of the Terrible Glare, led by High Shaman Rur, was a group that split off from the Jedi Order around the time of the Pius Dea crusades.
It consisted of rebel Jedi Knights who rallied to the cause of Pius Dea.
They abandoned the great temple on Ossus in favor of Garn.
Here, they became a very violent cult, forcing the Order to wage war on the deserters.
They were destroyed eventually, leaving only Rur as the sole survivor.
He infused himself into a computer, and baited many Jedi to Garn to their death as his revenge.
He was only destroyed by Luke Skywalker after thousands of years of exacting revenge on easily tempted Jedi.

# Section 1
The Order of the Terrible Glare was considered by many a precursor to the Sith, as they were great enemies of the Order.
They wreaked havoc against the Order much like the Pius Dea crusades did to the Galactic Republic.
They also were very inhumane in their methods, capturing souls and holding them for eternities or longer.
They tricked many Jedi using fake emergency beacons, and forcing them to fight their greatest fears.
They also allied with the Rozzum at some point during the crusades.



# Section 2
The shamans were very proficient in the ways of the force, creating soul snares to capture souls and hold them for eternity.
They were also master illusionists, establishing a large base on Garn, housing many things for their Order.
They established large computers to hold their knowledge, and to house sensors that could detect lightsabers on the galactic scale.
These sensors are the same sensors the sole survivor used during his thousands of years inside a computer to bait Jedi.
