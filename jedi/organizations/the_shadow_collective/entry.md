# Introduction

A large alliance made of mostly criminal factions, the Shadow Collective was founded by Darth Maul, the former apprentice of Darth Sidious, the rival of his former master.
Maul’s plans were to compete with Sidious to gain power across the galaxy.
With ambitious goals to defeat both of Sidious’ puppets during the Clone Wars, The Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems.
Rallying under his banner, Maul had significant forces under his control.
Forces of the Death Watch, Black Sun, Pike Syndicate, Hutt Clans, and the Nightbrothers formed the majority of power within the Collective.

# Section 1

Darth Maul and his brother Savage Opress had been stranded in space after a skirmish on Florrum, where they were later found by Pre Vizsla, the leader of Death Watch.
This would later lead to the mutual relationship between Maul and Vizsla, where Maul could help Pre Vizsla in exchange for getting revenge on Obi-Wan Kenobi.
This later led to Maul explaining the ambitions to Vizsla, where they ended up gathering allies to help them achieve their plan, with the first step recruiting the Black Sun criminal organization.
Which the Black Sun agreed to by its de-facto leader, only after all of its leaders were killed by Opress.
The next organization led by Lom Pyke shortly joined after, after stating that he didn’t wish to oppose the organization.
Maul, Vizsla, and Opress traveled to Nal Hutta to meet with the Grand Hutt Council to bring them into the alliance’s fold, however, the Hutts were prepared for this and hired a team of bounty hunters to eliminate them, which ended in failure.
Eventually taking over the Hutts’ resources after learning the location of other council members on Tatooine, specifically within Jabba’s Palace.

# Section 2

After the Collective’s alliance was fully formed with the entire criminal underworld firmly within Maul’s control, he went to Vizsla’s side of the deal.
After picking out targets and making the Death Watch look like heroes of Mandalore instead of terrorists.
The Shadow Collective as a whole led an attack on the city of Sundari, the capital of Mandalore.
Vizsla and Death Watch saved the capital from the Shadow Collective, which was all a ruse for Satine to be captured and with the full support of the population, declared himself to be Mand’alor.
Vizsla betrayed Maul and Opress, by throwing them in prison publically.
However, they were freed and with the guidance of Satine, they learned the locations of the remaining political leaders; they approached former Prime Minister Almec.
He was the only politician left outside of Satine herself that did not side with Vizsla.
Maul used Almec as a puppet leader of Mandalore, as he challenged Pre Vizsla to a duel for the leadership of Mandalore.
Which Maul had won with relative ease, being a Sith Lord.
Executing Pre Vizsla, the coup was successful, but Bo-Katan and the Nite Owls fled and started a resistance against Maul.

# Section 3

However, these acts didn’t go completely off the radar for some.
While the Republic’s attention was drawn to the Clone Wars, Darth Sidious saw that his former pupil was a threat.
Traveling to Mandalore to confront Maul himself.
Darth Maul, with Savage Opress, began to duel against Sidious, who was much more skilled with the blade as well as the Force than the two brothers.
This lead to Opress’s death and the capture of Maul.
The Hutts abandoned the Collective altogether after this event, however, both the Pykes and Black Sun remained loyal while Darth Sidious tortured Maul in a prison called the Spire on the planet Stygeon Prime; he was also tortured by Count Dooku.
Then two Mandalorian commandos who were ordered by Almec broke into the prison and rescued Maul, returning to Zanbar.
Collective forces then were attacked by the Confederacy, specifically when General Grievous attacked Zanbarr killing many Mandalorians as Maul escaped with the few Mandalorians remaining.
The Confederacy attacked Ord Mantell City, Vizsla's Keep 09, and the Nightsisters.
They killed Mother Talzin, weakening the Shadow Collective and with the fall of the Shadow Collective, Maul also had no power backing him up.
He no longer became a threat.

# Section 4

The Shadow Collective fell apart after Darth Maul was captured by Ahsoka Tano shortly before Order 66 began.
With the Siege of Mandalore being the end to his power and reign over Mandalore.
However, Maul survived Order 66 and escaped capture by Ahsoka Tano.
He led the Crimson Dawn after the end of the war, but he didn’t reveal himself as the true leader of the criminal organization, instead, he relied on a puppet, Dryden Vos, and then later Qi’ra to lead the group.
With the Crimson Dawn being the successor to the Shadow Collective itself.
