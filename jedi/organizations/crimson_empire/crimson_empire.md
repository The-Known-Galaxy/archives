# Introduction

In contrast to the thirteen Imperial warlords in the Deep Core, the Crimson Empire was a continuation of Palpatine's Galactic Empire, which he created in 19 BBY.
The Imperial nobles had migrated to Ord Cantrell, where they governed over a thin but long strip of land stretching from the Colonies to the Outer Rim.
In 11 ABY, it lasted less than a year.
Carnor Jax, Imperial Sovereign Protector and aspiring Dark Lord of the Sith, gave the organization its name after the hue of the Emperor's Royal Guard uniform he wore.

# Section 1

The Crimson Empire arose from the Dark Empire, a second Sith regime created in 10-11 ABY by the revived Palpatine.
The poisoning of Palpatine's clone corpses was overseen by Imperial Sovereign Protector Carnor Jax, ensuring the Emperor's death.
Jax gained leadership of the Empire after Palpatine's death at Onderon, calling himself Emperor and ruling with the help of a twelve-member Imperial Interim Ruling Council.
The council included a handful of aliens, which marked the very first time when aliens were given powerful posts within an organized body.
Despite the fact that many of the Empire's military commanders in the Deep Core established themselves as independent warlords and ignored Jax and the Council, Jax's Crimson Empire was the final vestige of Palpatine's organized Imperial empire.
Kir Kanos, a rival Guardsman, assassinated Jax shortly after.
Burr Nolyds was elected Emperor, but he was slain by a plan orchestrated by Nom Anor.
Xandel Carivus eventually cleansed his rivals in the Council, disbanding it and declared himself Emperor under Anor's guidance.
His reign was short-lived, as Kanos assassinated Carivus while the New Republic seized Ord Cantrell's capital and imprisoned the remaining councilors.
The seizure of Ord Cantrell would spell the end of the Imperial state as we know it.
The ruins of the previous Crimson Empire would have little influence because the remaining Imperial warlords acknowledged no central authority.
The Imperial Remnant was established in 12 ABY after Natasi Daala's effort for Imperial Reunification resulted in the split state lasting a year.

# Section 2

The Galactic Emperor presided over the Crimson Empire, as he had presided over the Galactic Empire previous to 4 ABY and the Dark Empire before it.
It did, however, have a twelve-member executive body called the Imperial Interim Ruling Council, also known as the "Council of Blood." It allowed aliens to serve on the Council, unlike the Galactic Empire.
The Diet of Imperial Planetary Governors was a body created by the Interim Ruling Council to give the Empire the appearance of representative democracy, but in actuality it operated as a rubber-stamp legitimizer for the Council's edicts.

# Section 3

The Crimson Empire's forces were at a minimum because the Imperial commanders had become autonomous warlords in the Deep Core.
All Terrain Scout Transports, HAVw A5 Juggernauts, TIE Crawlers, Chariot LAVs, TIE/sa bombers, TIE/IN interceptors, Imperial-class Star Destroyers, and Carrack-class light cruisers were still available to it.
The Crimson Empire also included the 133rd Imperial Fighter Group.
General Redd Wessel, General Immodet, and an unidentified officer were the supreme commanders at the moment.

# Section 4

The Crimson Empire stretched from the Colonies to the Outer Rim, and it shared a border with the Pentastar Alignment.
Qiilura, the Kol Huro system, Celanon, Ord Cantrell, Phaeda, Yinchorr, and the D'Astan sector were among the worlds it ruled.
The Crimson Empire also gained isolated pockets of control outside that region thanks to the backing of its alien councilors (especially the Whiphid Ch'Unkk, Defel Za, Devaronian Manos, and Givin Kooloota-Fyf).
