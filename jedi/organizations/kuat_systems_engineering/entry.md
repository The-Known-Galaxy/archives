# Introduction

Kuat Systems Engineering was a company that would manufacture starships on the planet Kuat, like the name suggests.
Related to Kuat Drive Yards, they would make many major products for organizations such as the Galactic Republic and Galactic Empire.
Some examples of their products would be: Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter, Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor, Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor, and the Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor, Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft.
However, the engineers would also have rivals who were called Sienar Fleet Systems.
Things would quickly change though as the Galactic Empire rose to power.
Sienar required key assets which they couldn't have access to so they would be employed by Kuat.
As they worked together, they would create the first ever line of TIE starfighters.
But by 34 BBY, Kuat Systems Engineering they would dissolve for unknown reasons and went defunct.
