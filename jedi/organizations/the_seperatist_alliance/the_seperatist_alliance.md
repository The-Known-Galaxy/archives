# Introduction
The Separatist Alliance was, hence the name, an alliance.
It had multiple names, the mount famous being the CIS, Confederacy of Independent Systems.
The CIS was controlled by the Separatists Council, which was led by Count Dooku.
Seated upon this Council were General Grievous, the commander of the Droid Armies, Nute Gunray, the Viceroy of the Trade Federation which supplies the CIS with its troops, Poggle the Lesser, the Archduke of Geonosis, which was one of the main planets where the CIS created their intimidating armies, Wat Tambo, the Foreman of the Techno Union, which supplied them with even more troops, particularly, the ships.
Passel Argente, who was the Senator from Kooriva, Rune Haako, a Neimoidian, San Hill, a Muun and the chairman of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, Shu Mai, the president of the Commerce Guild, Po Nudo, head of the Hyper-Communications Cartel and Tikkes, a male Quarren and senator of Mon Calamari star system.
Each member of the Council donated something to this CIS, either troops or credits.
Their headquarters were located on three separate planets, Utapau, Geonosis, and Mustafar.
The Separatists were the wealthiest group in the entire Galaxy and were full of greedy, corrupt loyalists.
Most joined the Separatist Alliance because of either fear or greed, as the Separatist Alliance was known to enslave entire planets.

# Section 1
The CIS had numerous different battle droids for different scenarios.
Such as B1 Battledroids, which were on most battlefronts, and were made of an easily destroyed material but useful in numbers, B2 Battledroids, which were the more powerful counterpart, which had missiles attached into their arms, Spider Droids, which were agile and had a canon attached to their dome shaped head, Vulture Droids, which were the droid ships and were the equivalent to one X-Wing fighter used by the Clone Army, Hyena Bombers, which were the Vulture Droid’s counterpart, but instead they were bombers, and mostly bombed settlements and Republic bases, Commando Droids, which had a vibrosaber built into their arm, ready to use, Droidekas, which could curl up into a sphere and travel at outstanding speeds, and had a forcefield protecting them, Aqua Droid, which were used in water, such as flooded planets like Kamino or Mon Cala, Tactical Droid, which was a droid that relied on statistics to win battles, they were essentially generals commanding an army, Magna Guards, which were the personal guards of General Grievous, Droid Gunships, which is a droid itself, with its own programming algorithm, Tank Droids, which caused destructive blasts per shot, Hailfire Droids, which had a high velocity and was armed with notorious pinki missiles,

Tri Droid, which was a droid which had three legs supporting a metallic sphere, and used its legs to try and trample the opponents and finally, a Proton Cannon, which needed a droid to power it, but it could penetrate shield generators, which was needed in the Separatists’ battles, Droid Tri-Fighters, which had three arched walls surrounding a glass sphere where the controller was located, Buzz Droids which could be used to penetrate materials, it was typically used to deteriorate the ship’s hull, D-Wing Droids, which were robot pterodactyls, they hunted their prey and killed them via guns built into their arms, Demolition Droid, which exploded, causing massive amounts of damage, the Combat Droid, which wasn’t very practical and was rarely seen on the battlefield, the Homing Spider Droid which was just a droid which looked like the Spider Droid but was incredibly oversized and the Crab Droid, which was just an updated Spider Droid with a different look.
There are more counterparts to the droids I just named, but they are essentially just updated droids, like the ones prior were simply not effective.
The updated droid counterparts were the Super Tactical Droid, which used more intelligent calculations and many more tweaked versions of said models.
The Separatists’ army was successful in numbers, but nigh to the end of the Clone Wars, credits were running scarce



# Section 3
However, the Droid Army never stood any real chance at winning the war as Darth Sidious had every single droid powered up to the Droid Control Generator, and he sent his apprentice, Darth Vader, to shut said Generator off, causing all the droids to shut down, never to be activated again.
The Separatist Alliance was a force not to be reckoned with and was the biggest droid army in the entire history of the Galaxy.
