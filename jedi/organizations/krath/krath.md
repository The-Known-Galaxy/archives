# Introduction
Krath was an organization formed by corrupted offspring of the Empress Teta.


The Krath discovered Sith artifacts, such as scrolls and books that they would use to aid the group on its journey and for training purposes.
They were one of the first to carbonite freeze a person into some sort of trophy.
Eventually this method was mimicked by criminal families and bounty hunters.
At one point, the Krath launched an attack towards the Jedi Order, slaughtering thousands of Jedi.
A Jedi Knight known as Ulic Qel-Droma witnessed as his Master was killed in front of his eyes.
Later on he attempted to infiltrate the Krath, however, not being able to get over his Master’s death, Qel-Drome was also corrupted by the dark side of the Force.
He then proceeded to take over the cult along with another fallen Kedi, known as Exar Kun, attempting to form a new Sith Empire.
Some time after Qel-Droma lost his abilities as he was cut off from the Force.
This ancient group remained in control of the great carbonite mines of the Empress Teta system for many years before the Age of the Resistance.
