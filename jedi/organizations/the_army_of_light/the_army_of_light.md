# Introduction
The Army of Light was a legendary military force established near the end of the New Sith Wars by the Jedi Lord Hoth to combat the machinations of Dark Lord of the Sith Skere Kaan's Brotherhood of Darkness.

# Section 1
Establishing the Jedi Grand Council, a council of Lords working independently from the Jedi High Council on Coruscant, these Lords assumed control of the local system and sector armies, having earned the respect and fealty of those living under their rule, shortly after most of the lords were disgusted with the Jedi High Council's utter failure to control Kaan, the Jedi Temple's own battle master, Lord Hoth, left Coruscant with a band of followers and rallied the banners of all those Jedi Lords loyal to him.
Of high repute among his fellow Lords, Hoth's call to arms was answered immediately by the Lords of Corellia, Cularin, and Kamparas.



# Section 2
This series of events and calls at arms ended up reaching the Jedi Grand Council who officially declared that all the remaining lords are to pledge their loyalty to the Army of Light’s banner.
Hoth led his army directly to the Outer Rim Territories, liberating a number of Sith strongholds in a methodical attack pattern that avoided a direct conflict with Lord Kaan.
While the Army of Light was able to grow in numbers as Hoth's strategy of attacking the flanks of the Brotherhood succeeded.



# Section 3
The Army of Light was an ad-hoc military force hastily assembled and provisioned to combat the sudden unity of the Sith, The Army consisted of the baronies and warships of the multiple Jedi Lords who made up the Army, supplying both Force-sensitive and non-Force-sensitive soldiers to wage war against the Sith.
The bulk of the Army's forces was made up of the Seven Legions of Light, each of which was commanded by the greatest Lords of the Jedi Order; Each legion consisted of loyal Jedi Knights and the many esquires, warriors, and servants from the different baronies.
With them these common folk brought an array of skills and knowledge, wielding swords, clubs, morningstars, and a variety of other weapons.



# Section 4
Following the defeat of Lord Kaan and the Brotherhood of Darkness, the Galactic Senate and the Jedi High Council effectively disbanded the Army with the ratification of the Ruusan Reformation, leaving the Army of Light as an old extension of the Jedi order yet even though they were hard to control and didn’t follow the orders of the High Jedi Council most of the time, they were appreciated as one of the most skilled and strongest army’s that serve under the Order and the Republic.
