# Introduction
The Force Hounds were an organisation of force-sensitive slaves whose duty it was to seek out and scout worlds rich with force-sensitivity on behalf of their Rakatan masters.
The organisation itself was small and did not maintain a chain of command.
Instead each Force Hound would individually serve a master and operate almost entirely alone, only being granted command of other Rakatan slave forces if required for exceptionally dangerous missions.

# Section 1
While the Infinite Empire was exploring the galaxy they found many uses for force-sensitives outside of their own species.
Most commonly force-sensitives would be enslaved and used as living fuel cells for the Infinite Empire’s wide variety of machinery.
Slave children would be grouped into broods, groups of force-sensitive slave children who would live together and carry out their functions together.
Those who displayed exceptional aggression, prowess in fighting and skills in the force would often be noted by the Rakatans and may be selected to become Force Hounds.



# Section 2
Those selected would be taken to the Infinite Empire capital world; Byss.
Where they would undergo combat training and hone their force abilities, particularly in the area of sensing other force sensitives.
Force Hounds could then be selected by Rakatans, often Predors (Rakatan overlords) or sold to senior Rakatan political and military figures.



# Section 3
When it comes to their force training the Infinite Empire was not known for its affinity for the light side of the force.
Force Hounds were expected to master the dark side, as a result they would have little empathy or compassion and most were not even aware that the light side of the force existed.
They would be trained particularly as scouts and as such were excellent in stealth and reconnaissance, this would filter into their combat style as they would be expected to eliminate targets swiftly and without detection.



# Section 4
Life as a Force Hound offered more freedom than that of other slaves, with Force Hounds often spending months and potentially years away from the Infinite Empire in foreign lands.
This seclusion made them loners as they would not make contact with the foreign people they found and when they did would be expected to kill those who detected them so that the native populations would not become aware of the Infinite Empire prior to its invasion of their land.



# Section 5
Force Hounds may have developed friendships during their time as part of their broods but it is unlikely their friends would have survived into adulthood, and those that did rarely got to see each other.
Force Hounds who failed in their duties or did not live up to their master’s expectations would either be killed, sold or presented as gifts.
Those that were killed were likely eaten by their Rakatan masters and those that were sold would likely find themselves as gladiators or in another similar combat role, their training was too useful to turn them back into living fuel cells.



# Section 6
The Rakatans would find other uses for their Force Hounds, quite often pitting them against each other for amusement or to gamble.
These duels would almost always be to the death and were known to be exceptionally gruesome with the defeated usually being cut into multiple parts due to the aggressive nature of the Force Hounds.



# Section 7
There are only two known Force Hounds in galactic history.
Trill who was a humanoid female and Xesh who was a human male.
Both were friends in their brood and even later in life when becoming Force Hounds.
Xesh was considerably more skilled in combat and when the two duelled Xesh easily defeated Trill and was ordered to execute her by his Rakatan master, however as the two made a blood-oath during their time in the brood Xesh elected to spare Trill and persuaded his master to sell her as a gift and insult to his master’s superior.


Xesh would later find himself on a mission to Tython and would encounter the Je’daii Order.
It was on Tython he would discover the light side of the force but would be exiled to the moon of Bogan for his affinity with the dark side, at this point he would go by the name of Tau, a name he gave himself in secret.



# Section 8
The Force Hound could be identified by their tattoos most notably.
These tattoos would be found on the faces, arms, legs and even backs of every force-sensitive slave so that they could be identified even after a particularly bloody death.
The tattoos would bear the name of the Force Hound in Aurebesh and came in no particular colours.


Force Hounds would typically wear a black and golden set of battle armour however it is not unknown for Force Hounds to dress how they saw fit due to the nature of their missions.
They were also known for wielding the forcesaber with great skill but were trained in almost all varieties of weapons including hand-to-hand combat and ranged weaponry.



# Section 9
Their martial capabilities while excellent are not what is unique about them.
Force Hounds displayed excellent affinity with the force and could use abilities that would be considered extremely rare in future force based organisations.
Force Hound Xesh was notably skilled in telekinesis and at one point was able to squeeze the numerous hearts of a beast he was fighting when enraged with the force.
It was also not uncommon for Force Hounds to make use of force lightning, both when casting it and reflecting it without the use of a forcesaber.
