# Introduction
The Guavian Death Gang was a well-known criminal organization that were forced away from the Core Worlds because of their unrest in the underworld, after the Galactic Empire’s fall.
It would begin to operate around thirty years after the Battle of Endor.
They would wield red armour after being recruited and swearing an oath of loyalty to the gang.
Injected with a secret combination of atoms and chemicals that made them more aggressive, the death gang was equipped with something that would act like a second heart.
The Guavians were to be equipped with the best and latest weapons from the black market.
Around the time of 34 BBY, two gang members would track Speedstar, a quite-famous racer, to a station known as the Colossus station.
Due to him owing the Guavian Death Gang 20,000 credits for an unknown reason, they would make sure he would win the Platform Classic for it’s 100,000 prize credits, so they grab a percentage.
While in the race, they would take Speedstar’s mechanic hostage till he paid.
Otherwise he would be slaughtered.
Marcus Speedstar would win and give them their debt, with his mechanic Oplock alive.
In later years, the death gang would encounter both Han Solo and Chewbecca surprisingly, nearly 30 years after the Battle of Endor and the Galactic Empire’s reign.
They would threaten the duo on the Eravana and grow bored of Solo’s excuses on why the 50,000 credits he borrowed were delayed.
Baka-Tik, a member of the Guavian Death Gang, would recognise BB-8 as the droid wanted by the First Order.
This would be along with Finn and Rey, two other fugitives.
To escape, they would try to activate the blast doors but instead release the doors to three Rathtars locked up.
These creatures would eat most of the members alive, leaving a few soldiers and Bala-Tik alive.
