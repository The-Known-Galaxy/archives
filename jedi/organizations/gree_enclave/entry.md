The Gree Enclave was one of the most ancient predated civilizations known, they did not join in on the Galactic Republic.
Traveling in this region of space in the Empire, they would use a network of hypergates, allowing instant travel between two destinations with the use of hyperspace.
At one point in Gree history, they came into conflict with the Kwa.
Later in their history in 35,000 BBY, when the Rakatan Infinite Empire rose in power in circa, the Gree were defeated and pushed back to their cluster.
With the last years of the Galactic Republic, the power to travel was restricted for non-Gree.
Then during the Imperial rule, Gree had become a subsector of the Veragi sector, Consul-General Skalus of Asation officially ruled the Enclave but in practice, the Empire let the Gree rule whatever was in their region and there was a Carrack-class cruiser in the space above to have the impression that the Imperial was watching them.
