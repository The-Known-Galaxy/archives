# Introduction
The Coruscant Health Administration (CHA), which was often called Coruscant Health, or Coruscant Health Office, was a division within the Galactic Republic.
Coruscant Health Administration watched over all of the healthcare for the Coruscant Citizens.
It operated medical centers, issued health warnings, managed disease analysis, enforced quarantines, and administered vaccinations.

# Section 1
The Administration was established well before the Clone Wars.
By 22 BBY, it was led by Medxec Harribore Onuta.
During this period, it responded to the outbreak of Brainworm Rot Type A in Coruscant’s Manarai Heights district by implementing stricter quarantines and vaccinations, mostly for travelers arriving at spaceports like Eastport.



# Section 2
CHA officials were also featured in a special report that investigated the increased use of death sticks among Coruscant’s youth.
In 20 BBY, Republic Treasury agent Besany Wennen contacted the CHA’s policy planning department while investigating the funding sources for the Grand Army of the Republic.
She discovered that the CHA exclusively handled civilian cases and not those related to the GAR.



# Section 3
Wennen later initiated an armed standoff at a CHA medical center, which prevented the removal of life support from a comatose clone commando named Fi.
Coruscant Security Force Captain Jaller Obrim and his Anti-Terrorism Unit successfully rescued her.
Though she was concerned about potential repercussions from CHA administrators, Obrim assured her that her job was safe.



# Section 4
In the underground laboratory of Nuvo Vindi on Naboo, the CHA’s logo was present on the bombs used to spread a virus.
The logo was also displayed on warning signs that activated when the virus was released.
Padmé Amidala and Jar Jar Binks wore bio-suits with this symbol on their chest sections during their mission in the laboratory.
