# Introduction

The Agricultural Corps of the Jedi is one path available to failed padawans within the Jedi Order.
Headed and tasked out by the Council of Reassignment, an initiate who was not deemed worthy to continue down the path of a Jedi Knight were given the four options in the Jedi Service Corps.
Though they wouldn’t end up leading military forces or fighting galactic-scale battles, they were able to root themselves down in society to better the livelihood of those in need.
The Corps also worked hand in hand with the Republic Agricultural Administration, ensuring that those in underdeveloped systems or planets in strife and suffering from famine would not die off - offering much-needed assistance and aid.

# Section 1

Many within the junior positions of the Corps thought of this as a lower placement, a demotion and an insult to them, preferring the life of dueling and study of the saber as opposed to research and growth.
However, most were lifetime members, some subsections of the Corps giving an array of jobs and duties one could attend to, such as geology.
A multitude of facilities were constructed on a number of planets to assist in the development and logging of agricultural findings.
Those more indebted to the AgriCorps saw the opportunity to train with the Living Force, aiding directly in the increased and rapid growth of plants, one of these being consitor sato - or “plant surge”.

# Section 2

This lasted up to the years of the Great Jedi Purge in 19BBY, where the Republic fell and the Galactic Empire rose to power.
Those who did not fall during the purge were transferred and trialed into the Dark Jedi within the Empire, though still remaining within a lesser known and not well documented version of the AgriCorps.
During the fall of the Empire however, it was completely dissolved and was no longer headed by any Agricultural Jedi Masters.
The idea and philosophy of the AgriCorps was integrated into the ideals of the Order by Grand Master Luke Skywalker.
