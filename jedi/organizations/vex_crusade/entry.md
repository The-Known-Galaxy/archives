# Introduction

The Vex Crusade was an organization headed by Sandewar Mandewar, an alien personification of the infamous doctor and smuggler, Cornelius Evazan.
Cornelius had posed as a shapeshifter, Lopset, while using his shape-shifting abilities.
He used it through a Pluripleq.
It is unknown what the organizationâ€™s activities were mostly involved in.
After the aforementioned leader of the organization had met up with an Empire archeologist that had gone rogue, Chelli Lona Aphra around 0 ABY to 3 ABY he had demonstrated to her his shape-shifting prowess by transforming into his personification of Sandewar Mandewar.
The Vex Crusade and its leader did not make any notable moves, this would likely be considering Cornelius Evazan had assumed his place as leader of the organization in effort of evading his death sentence across twelve systems.
