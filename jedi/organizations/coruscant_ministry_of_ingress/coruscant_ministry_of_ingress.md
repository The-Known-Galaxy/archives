# Introduction
The Ministry of Ingress was an immigration organization founded for as long as the republic itself has existed.
The purpose of this organization was to supervise and administer all immigration and refugee services.

During the administration of First Minister Tannon Praji during the time of the Clone Wars, the organization came under a lot of criticism as due to the constant conflict, many planets escaped from the war and arrived at coruscant to find refuge, but constant changes in rules and the requirement of more documents resulted in the deportation of many species in what many people considered an unfair treatment.

Some examples of this unfair treatment consisted of the massive deportation of species that originated from separatist planets after the Clone Wars began.
This included families who had lived on Coruscant for generations and still supported the Republic even when their origin planet switched sides.

After the takeover of the New Republic (previously known as the Galactic Empire until the Rebel Alliance reformed it) this organization was deemed no longer necessary and was dissolved in the year 7 ABY with its resources put to other uses within the new government..
