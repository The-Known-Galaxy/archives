# Introduction

House Organa, known as the Royal House of Alderaan, or simply House Organa has been ruling Alderaan since its colonization.
House Organa has ruled Alderaan for many years, decades and has sired many reputable people, those being Viceroy Bail Prestor Organa and his adopted daughter Princess Leia Organa; but due to a tragedy known as the Death Star, the name Organa died out along with the destruction of the planet Alderaan.

# Section 1

A few centuries after the Infinite Empire had fallen, residents of Coruscant developed "Sleeper ships".
Then by 27,500 BBY, the colonists that boarded the ships arrived on many planets and Alderaan was one of the many planets that were founded.
Organa ancestors were one of the first to settle in that new world and were one of few families to be a big contributor to the formation of the Galactic Republic some 2,500 years later.
In the future, Founding Day would be celebrated to honor and remember the House of Organa.
With the upcoming society on the planet, the Alderaan families opted for a ruling monarch family that would be chosen among the nobles.
Organa is but one of the noble bloodlines along with House Panteer, House Ulgo, and House Alde but instead of having them on their side, they chose smaller nobles to have under their protection in exchange for support.

# Section 2

Despite the image of the Organa family being honorable, in their history, they haven’t always been honorable.
During the Jedi Civil War in 3956 BBY.
The Organas were believed to have hired an assassin to assassinate the entire House Ulgo.
House Organa also later put a price on the assassin Selven’s head to hopefully tie up loose ends.
Then during the Great Galactic War, the Organa family stayed loyal to the Republic believing in more patient negotiation than violence and aggression.
A similar situation was when Senator and Crown Prince Gaul Panteer announced the Alderaan's independence, shocking its residents.
He and his wife soon died, and with House Organa being an influential family, they were next to the throne with the support of the Galactic Republic.
With there being diplomatic problems and also prominent houses also wanting the throne, a civil war began.
House Organa was determined to restore the peace in his homeworld.

# Section 3

In 32 BBY, House Organa being a member of the Alderaan Ascendancy Contention went against the House of Antilles, which had the two families getting tied together through marriage in the end.
It was after this marriage that Bail adopted Leia, daughter of Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala.
It was common knowledge to know that she was adopted, but with her smarts, she became the rightful heir to the family.
