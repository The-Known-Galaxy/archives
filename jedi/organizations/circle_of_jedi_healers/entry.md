# Introduction

One of the lesser known organizations within the Jedi Order was the Circle of Jedi Healers.
This organization was composed of some of the Orderâ€™s best healers, whose ranks varied.
The organization was open to not just Jedi Masters, but Knights as well.
This situation in particular is unique, because most organizations in the Order contained only Jedi Masters.
The Circle of Jedi Healers would often report to the Council of Reassignment for different types of tasks and quests they may have to go on.
The Healers played an important role in the Jedi Order, convening some of the finest healers in the Order to work together in flawless motion.
The Circle would also lead to the creation of the Medical Corps, which played a vital role in healing the lives of many Jedi, soldiers, and more.
