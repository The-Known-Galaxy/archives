# Introduction
The Black Sun were a criminal group of individuals that formed between 3653 and 3644 BBY.
They held a large influence and reach around the Galaxy, including multiple galactic governments of each era.
Black Sun was very known for piracy as well as smuggling, however, was involved in every type of illegal activity known.
The information the Black Sun collected was both more accurate and had a larger scope than that of Imperial Intelligence.
On top of resources that could rival those of large planetary armies.
One known founder was Skadge, with nine leaders.
Below each of the leaders there were nine Vigos that would rule over their own territory and sector.

# Section 1
Forming at the end of the Great Galactic War, they took advantage and began to take control of the lower level neighbourhoods of Galactic City, Coruscant.
This caused the phase “better a black sun than none” giving them their name.
They would carve out a name for themselves fairly quickly before they stretched to beyond Coruscant making them galactic.
The Galactic Republic would find out about them and begin fighting back to reclaim areas once again.



# Section 2
33 BBY the Black Sun became under the control of Alexi Garyn who was killed by Darth Maul, with multiple Vigos falling to Sith Lords.
It would be around a decade before they would recover from the loss but they would exploit the Republic’s focus on war during the Clone Wars.
By doing this they would be able to expand their activities and as such expand their reach further.
A faction of the Black Sun would be take over by Darth Maul himself and moved their stuff to the camp on Zanbar.



# Section 3
The Black Sun would take on many more struggles, reorganizing in 33 BBY before dissolving in 24 ABY.
It would not be until the Sith-Imperial War and the Second Imperial Civil War that the Black Sun would come back, this time openly displaying their symbol to intimidate their rivals and victims.
They dealt in illegal weapons and extortion, on top of being active within the Outer Rim where they were responsible for the attacks on Imperial convoys.
