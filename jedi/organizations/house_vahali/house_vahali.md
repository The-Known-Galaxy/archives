# Introduction
The triad, a competitive dominion of (3) houses, namely House Vahali, House Juoni, and House Praji, held much influence on Kaikielius.
They were rivals that consistently fought for power and influence across it’s industries and sectors as they directly changed Coruscant’s events as well.


With time, House Praji left the planet, and House Juoni collapsed under various circumstances leaving House Vahali to rise to power.
Even they however, faced a multitude of challenges from criminal organisations.
They eventually drove these criminals offworld, but 1 millennium later House Praji reconquered Kaikielius during Operation Shadow Hand.

The Vahali were driven offworld, and constructed a new powerhouse on the planet of Denon.
This is all that is currently documented.

# Section 1
House Vahali is an elitist group of individuals descended from the original colonists of Kaikielius.
Despite being related to House Praji and House Juoni, who also descended from these colonists, the three rivalled for many years.
This was due to ideological disputes, though records do not specify the exact details.

These (3) families were amongst many competing for dominance, but were the most prominent and thus are the only ones mentioned in Kaikieliun history.
These families collectively absorbed lesser families to increase their respective influence and by extension compete with each other.

House Juonli fell away from the triad of (3) as it had over-involved itself in the First Alsakan conflict.
It had exhausted it’s resources, and it’s forces leaving it unable to defend itself from the other (2) families.
Following this, House Praji and House Vahali targeted each other knowing the survivor would crown the entire planet.
This conflict disallowed Kaikielius from uniting and trumping the Koros world, which they were in a war with at the time.



# Section 2
Kaikielius as a whole, benefitted though as they began heavy industrialisation and urbanisation to compete with their rival world.
This however, led to the world falling into the scope of the Hutts who rained down on the planet with criminal activities which damaged both houses.


The Praji family eventually abandoned the conflict with Vahali and were unable to compete with them and the Hutt.
This left the entire planet to Vahali who began operations to squash the criminal organisations.
This lasted over (60) years and drained the resources of the Vahali, who now sought the help of the Republic.

However, Emppu Praji-Barck who headed the Praji family, had been in Coruscant foreign affairs for many years by this point and enacted revenge by preventing reinforcements from coming to Vahali’s aid.

He further amplified the damage by purchasing supplies for Hutt organisations on Kaikielius making it very difficult for the Vahali to contain them.
The Republic, seeing this, did eventually override Emppu and begin sending reinforcements to help.
This “Kaikieli Reconquista” included Padawan Derrica Praji who led the reinforcement groups.
She unknowingly aided the defeat of the Praji-funded Hutt as she was not aware of Emppu’s plot.



# Section 3
Thousands of years later, following the growth and success of House Vahali, to the disappointment of House Praji, Operation Shadow Hand was executed.
In 10 ABY Nahdonnis Praji led an assault on the orbital skyhook (House Vahali headquarters) which consequently destroyed it.

This sent House Vahali into poverty, who had placed all their eggs in one place.
They went into hiding on planet Denon, allowing House Praji after almost a millennium the opportunity of reconquering planet Kaikielius.
