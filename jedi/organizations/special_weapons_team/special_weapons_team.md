# Introduction

Introduction

The planet Coruscant served for many millennia as the capital of the Galactic Republic and later Galactic Empire.
In a sense it also served as capital of the galaxy during many different eras of galactic history and as such served as home for over one trillion residents throughout a majority of this time.
As a result of this the Coruscant Security Force was established, though it maintained numerous different identities and underwent many changes throughout its history it always had numerous standing special units capable of undertaking tasks of a unique nature or tasks too daunting for standard CSF constables.

This was the case for the Coruscant Security Force Special Weapons Team.
Coruscant was a galactic beacon of progress and hope for many, particularly those living on the higher levels.
For others, it served as a place of organised crime, ample territory for terrorism, murder, gang activity and even invasion from the various enemies of the Republic.
As such, the Special Weapons Team was commissioned to provide a more lethal resolution to many of these problems.

Part I: Purpose

The Coruscant Security Force would often be met with threats of organised crime in many of the unruly areas of the planet.
These gangs would often be funded or sponsored by Cartels and organisations that either sought to make profit or deal damage to the Galactic Republic or Galactic Empire.
As such it was the responsibility of the Special Weapons Team when called upon to provide additional firepower and unique tactics in order to dispose of or apprehend suspects that would usually pose too much of a threat to standard officers.

The Special Weapons Team would utilize military grade weaponry and be modelled after Republic or Imperial Special Operations units in order to conduct raids, assaults, VIP protection and even counter-intelligence.
As such the nature of their operations was typically classified and they would work closely with Republic or Imperial military units such as the Special Operations Brigade of the Galactic Republic or Imperial Security Bureau and Imperial Commandos of the Galactic Empire.

Part II: Structure and uniform

The Special Weapons Team was a standalone division of the Coruscant Security Force; however, it would often be placed under the umbrella of other CSF divisions, particularly the Anti-Terrorism unit.
As its role was to offer additional firepower and tactics to the entirety of the CSF, the unit would often be spread across multiple different divisions of the CSF at a time and report to the Sector Command of CSF.

The unit maintained ranks such as Constable, Sergeant, Lieutenant and other ranks associated with the CSF; however, the rank of the unit’s commander is unknown, it could even be speculated that as a result of the unit’s consistent relocation to aid other divisions it did not need an individual commander.

The teams themselves were made up of small groups of highly trained SWAT officers that would be reinforced by specialised droids.
The size of the teams are unknown but due to the wide variety of operations conducted it is likely the teams would often change in size, usually being commanded by either a Sergeant or Lieutenant.

The Special Weapons Team would notably wear black tactical uniforms designed for camouflage in the urban and darker areas of Coruscant.
As they were trained in counter-intelligence it is also likely the unit made use of plain-clothed officers to blend in with crowds and to carry out surveillance unnoticed.

Part III: Training and selection

The unit by design was intended to serve as a mediation between the standing military of either the Republic or Empire and the Police forces.
As such the unit itself was very militarised and regimented.
Constables and Officers could apply for CSF SWAT selection but the unit would only select the brightest and most physically able of the candidates for additional training.

Not much is known about the selection process and what it entailed, but it likely included aptitude tests and physical capability tests that would recreate the environments and operations the CSF SWAT officers would find themselves in.

Training would be of a far higher standard than regular CSF training.
Each SWAT officer would undergo training in advanced hand-to-hand combat, marksmanship at a near special operations level, close protection training and hostage rescue training.

Additionally, officers could apply for roles such as explosive ordnance and disposal experts, team snipers, and counter-intelligence duties.
Each of these roles would have their own unique selection and training courses.

Part IV: Legacy

The CSF SWAT division was so successful during the reign of the Galactic Republic and Galactic Empire that the New Republic and later the Galactic Alliance recommissioned the unit with more resources and assistance.
Most notably they would work alongside the Galactic Alliance Guard and would be commanded and supported by notable Jedi Knights such as Jacen Solo.
The CSF SWAT division would continue its career with success and expand its area of operations to other worlds such as Corellia.
