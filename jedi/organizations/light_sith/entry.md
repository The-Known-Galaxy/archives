# Introduction

Light Sith are Sith who utilize the Light Side of the Force instead of the Dark while still maintaining the Sith philosophy.

# Section 1

During the Cold War, a team of Sith in the ranks of the Sith Empire were drawn towards the Light Side of the Force.
The Dark Council chose the Sith Lord Cendence to hunt down and eliminate any Sith who are not deemed pure.
Jaesa Willsaam, a Sith Apprentice, was ordered by her Master to locate the Light Sith.
The Sith Apprentice located them and killed them and was successful with her mission.

Many centuries later, Darth Gravid, a Sith Lord, concluded that pure attachment to the Dark Side would curse the Sith.
He sought a new philosophy where the Sith would lean towards the Light Side of the Force.
Sealed away in his Jaguada bastion, the Darth sought to destroy the old Sith philosophy from Master to apprentice since the time of Darth Bane, including the artifacts such as the Holocrons, Crystals, Scrolls, Tomes, and Amulets; He burned them, ensuring that the future of the Sith will commit to his philosophy.

Darth Gravid had an apprentice, Darth Gean; she opposed the teachings and visions of her Master.
She was frightened of the destruction of the old Sith teachings and proceeded to launch her Master, attacking and killing him with her bare hands–ending the plans of Gravid.
Though many of the Sith artifacts were destroyed, including the technique of essence transfer–a technique used to transfer one’s consciousness to another body–she managed to preserve some of the teachings to ensure the continuity of Darth Bane’s intentions–full allegiance to the Dark Side.

Some time later, Darth Plagueis recounted Darth Gravid’s demise into seeking out the lost method of immortality.
As usual, Darth Plagueis would do something similar to Gravid’s–an attempt to end the Rule of Two, which states that there can only be two Sith at once–a master and an apprentice, which only ended up being murdered by his own apprentice, Darth Sidious, who felt that it was against the philosophy of the Dark Side.
