# Introduction
The Circle was an organization or rather gang that was most prevalent during the Great Galactic War.
It was composed of (only) Nikto - reptilian humanoids that sometimes bore spikes and horns - however, they were not like their peers.
Most Nikto thrived through brutal combat and lived out their lives in servitude to the Hutt clan : as you may have guessed, this was not the case for the Circle and its members.
Instead of raw power, they valued technology - for they believed that it was the only power in the Galaxy to rival that of the force.
As such, they were slicers (those adept as well as skilled in computing and extracting information from the network within those systems), a profession which was often left to droids.
Despite their oddities, they were a tight-knit gang with strong leadership - that being Bolan.

Bolan was an eccentric, as was the lot of them, but that didn’t stop him from being any less intelligent.
With his guidance, the group has dealt with many customers of the highest regard - such as Darth Zash and the Force-walker Kallig.
 However, his intelligent mind could not suppress his greed for technology, which would be to his detriment when he and his gang were caught slicing into the Republic Strategic Information Service's classified records.
This incident had them cast into a secure prison on Belsavis - an icy planet with a temperature averaging far below freezing point - and they would be imprisoned for a long while.
Unexpectedly, they never served their full-sentence as the Circle’s members were rescued during the Invasion of Belsavis in 3641 BBY.
From there, they would continue their activities and attempt to expand their reach, with the help of numerous business partners and allies.
