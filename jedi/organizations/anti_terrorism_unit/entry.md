# Introduction

The Anti-terrorism unit was a special civilian unit of the Coruscant Security Force.
Providing and deploying specialised officers of the CSF who were expertly trained in conducting counter-terrorist operations such as counter-intelligence, special reconnaissance and covert surveillance.
They would work alongside the Jedi Order, Senate Guard and often special Republic military units to conduct sensitive operations across Coruscant.

# Section 1

The anti-terrorism unit was founded roughly around 22 BBY but had numerous predecessors dating as far back as the Cold war era.
Due to the large population of Coruscant and the fact it serves as the capital of the Galactic Republic and later on the First Galactic Empire as well as the New Republic, the planet is often the site of large and small scale attacks, large criminal and gang activity as well as a target for terrorism and spies.

The anti-terrorism unit was founded to conduct operations that would require specialised training and sensitivity above that of a regular CSF constable.
The organisation would eventually become competent enough to work alongside the Grand Army of the Republic’s Special Operations Brigade and throughout its history would have combat records against some of the most dangerous foes in the galaxy, including the Sith.

# Section 2

Not much is known about the recruitment and training of the anti-terrorism unit.
Due to the nature of its operations, it’s authority and from what we know of some of its members, it is safe to assume the recruitment and training of the anti-terrorism unit was highly selective.
The organisation retained ex-members of the Senate Guard and Republic military, as well as civilian informants, analysts and a wide variety of CSF constables.

The anti-terrorism unit was different from a conventional counter-terrorism unit in that it was much more of an intelligence based service.
It would conduct wire tappings, use informants, carry out interrogations and spy on the general public of Coruscant.
It would then use this information to provide briefings to units more qualified to carry out raids and arrests, such as the Special Weapons Teams and Republic Commandos.

# Section 3

The anti-terrorism unit’s predecessors would be involved in large scale operations during the Cold War era.
In which they would be involved in rooting out Imperial Intelligence and Sith operations on Coruscant.
They worked closely with Jedi Peacekeepers and Republic Special Forces elements when raiding the Headquarters of the Black Sun Gang after they had taken over multiple districts of Coruscant and were being secretly given weapons and equipment by the Sith Empire to undermine Republic progress on the planet.

Later during the Clone Wars the anti-terrorism unit would help the Null-ARC Black Operations unit as well as Omega and Delta Squad of the Republic Special Operations Brigade in unravalling a seperatist terrorist network on Coruscant.
They would be crucial in assisting the commando units in identifying targets, such as buildings and individuals who were involved in the terrorist network and were complimented on their abilities by Null-ARC Captain ‘’Ordo’’ after the operation.

# Section 4

The most notable member of the anti-terrorism unit was Jaller Obrim.
Obrim served as Captain of the anti-terrorism unit after completing his service within the Senate Guard and would remain in the anti-terrorism unit until its eventual disbandment after Order 66.
He would distinguish himself during the black operation to reveal seperatist terrorist cells on Coruscant by providing information to Kal Skirata that would allow the Null-ARC Troopers, Omega Squad and Delta Squad to conduct undercover raids and eventually bring down the terrorist cell.
After Order 66 Obrim would serve in the Imperial Security Bureau but would use his position to aid anti-Imperial rebels as well as assisting Kal Skirata and his adopted Commandos who went into hiding after the war.

# Section 5

In the final years of the Clone Wars, especially after the operation which saw the destruction of a seperatist terror cell on Coruscant, the anti-terrorism unit was given increased authority much more akin to that of a secret police force.
They would notably be granted the ability to conduct arrests, raids and searches without a warrant as well as carry out illegal wire tappings and surveillance.

This level of freedom would serve to benefit the organisation after Order 66 as they were eventually folded into the Imperial Security Bureau and would conduct their duties with a larger amount of freedom and authority than during their service to the Republic.
Ex-elements of the anti-terrorism unit would carry out investigations into anti-Imperial cells, later known as Rebel Cells on Coruscant and the core worlds.

# Section 6

Once the New Republic was established as well as the Coruscant Security Forces the need to recreate the anti-terrorism unit was clear.
With Imperial warlords rampant throughout the galaxy as well as many Imperial sympathisers remaining on Coruscant there were numerous real threats of terrorism on Coruscant and the core worlds.
The organisation would continue its service during the creation of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances.
During this time period the area of authority of the anti-terrorism unit was known to have increased, conducting operations off-world that would prevent incoming attacks on Coruscant.
The organisation was never known to be decommissioned.
