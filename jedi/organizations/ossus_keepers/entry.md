# Introduction

The Ossus Keepers were a group of Jedi that specialized in protecting the Hall of Knowledge within the Great Jedi Library in the Jedi Temple on Ossus.
These Knights were often found patrolling the halls of the Great Jedi Library, assisting any Jedi or Scholar alike with any questions or queries regarding the Order or Archives.
The Ossus Keepers wore a brown cloak with beige robes underneath, and it was said that these robes often helped the Keepers maintain a calm mindset while patrolling.

The Ossus Keepers were prevalent during the Great Sith War in 3996 BBY as the Sith rushed Ossus, destroying it and the Great Jedi Library.
The Keepers would fight until they could no more, for this was their duty until the end.
