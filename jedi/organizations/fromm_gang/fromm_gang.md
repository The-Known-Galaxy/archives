# Introduction
The Fromm Gang, also called the Fromm Family or Fromm Family of Crime, was a powerful, long-lived criminal family.
They would lurk on the planet Annoo,  and would hold control of legitimate imports and exports so that they could kidnap and smuggle weapons.
Being led by Sise Fromm with his assistant Vlix Oncard, they would rely on clone guards during the early Empire due to Sise wanting organic muscle.
Though his son Tig Fromm, would later persuade him to invest in wild power gambles for powerful weapons such as the satellite, Trigon One.
However, the satellite was soon stolen by Thall Joben, Jord Dusat and Kea Moll.
The reason being that it was on the behalf of the Resistance's foundation on their planet.
For revenge, Sise Fromm would secretly kidnap Dusat and Moll’s mother.
Joben would later find out and reveal where it had been hidden for their release.
Tig would go to retrieve the satellite but instead Joben and R2-D2 would interfere with the guidance system.
Ending up with Trigon One colliding with Sise’s stronghold, Jabba the Hutt would decide to place a money-worth credit on the leader of the Fromm Gang.
Boba Fett would turn this bounty in while Tig, Sise and Vlix Oncard tried to get revenge on Joben by competing in a Boonta Speeder Race.
Eventually, the lot was freed by Jabba’s grasp via the crime family’s bribe they offered him.
As part of the deal, the gang would agree to give away a very large percentage of their credits and make sure their Annoo-dat clones helped to defeat Death Watch that had infected the territory belonging to the Hutt himself.
