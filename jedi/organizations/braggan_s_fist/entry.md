# Introduction

Operating on a smaller scale than most archived gangs, Braggan's Fist was a criminal organisation located on the planet Corelia, in and around the City of Tyrena.
The planet had the perfect conditions for life to blossom, as such it became a hub of activity many times throughout it's life.
However, with people comes the need for order, and CorSec - Corellian Security Force - fulfilled this need.
Though, unfortunately, even the planet's peacekeepers had internal conflict.
One that was of betrayal and jealousy.

# Section 1

Kal Braggan, a Corsec officer, was framed by Wilfred Quelsh, his co-worker.
The crime he didn't commit left him devastated and jobless, leading him to darker solutions.
Betrayed and shamed, Braggan turned to a life of crime and formed his own 'fist' to fight his battles.
And that is how Braggan's Fist came to be.
A gang born out of hatred and shame.

# Section 2

But, though the gang was built with strong bonds, they just as easily broke as any other bond would.
Such is the case when Quelsh came to finish the job and murdered Kal Braggan - when he did, the strong bonds between the members quickly shattered as fast as they had began.
With no leader to direct them, the group slowly faded and was left to rot in the passage of time.
