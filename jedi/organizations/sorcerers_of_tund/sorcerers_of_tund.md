# Introduction
The Sorcerers of Tund were a secret group of Sith sorcerers from an ancient order.
They were known for their outfits that concealed the majority of their bodies.
The sorcerers were skilled in deception, illusions, and shape-shifting.
They were mainly known for being sighted on Tund and were also known to delve into Force explorations that drove them insane.

# Section 1
The secretive group was established on Tund after the Great Hyperspace War.
Originally, the group consisted of banished pure-blood Sith priests, and rumors started to spread that the descendants of the pure-blood Sith had been exiled from Korriban.
The secret pure-blood society combined science, ontology, and magic.
The Rakatan also convinced them that all sentients were Force-sensitives, thus leading them to declare that the omnipresence of the Force was what shed light on the deception of dualities and multiplicity.



# Section 2
Jedi from earlier generations viewed the sorcerers as another dark side Force group, like Jal Shey or Zeishon Sha.
However, a reign of terror led by Karnak Tetsu took place soon after the restoration.
Tetsu was the leader of the Sorcerers of Tund following the Great Sith War.
The Jedi Order attempted to convert the sorcerers by convincing them to use the Force without any of their magic and mysticism.
Their attempts were in vain, and the Jedi later tasked themselves with making sure that the sorcerers did not fall to the dark side.
The sorcerers were uncommunicative when it came to accepting outlanders and believed that only true Sith could handle the truth they knew and respected.
However, there was one occasion where they accepted the remaining Massaassi and Kissai that descended from outcasts that were like them.



# Section 3
During the fall of the Galactic Republic, several instances arose where the Jedi were forced to stop their surveillance of the sorcerers.
Darth Sidious did not see any use in recruiting the sorcerers since he believed the Imperial Navy could handle Tund independently.
In 22 BBY, a man by the name of Adler Roty claimed that he was a part of the Sorcerers of Tund.
However, the last known member of the group was Rokur Gepta, who learned the secrets of the sorcerers’ power and later created some of his own.
When he felt he had nothing left to learn, he killed the sorcerers and all remaining life on the planet using his electromagnetic torpedo.
Gepta faced repeated bouts of conflict with Lando Calrissian.
Later down the line, Calrissian managed to kill Gepta, presumably ending the group.
