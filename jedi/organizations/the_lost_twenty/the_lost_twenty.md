# Introduction

During the time of the Galactic Republic, the Jedi Order maintained a list known as the Lost Twenty.
These were Jedi Masters who left the order over ideological differences.
It was recorded that by 990BBY, twelve names were added to this illusive list.
One of the first members of the Lost was Master Phanius, an Umbaran Jedi who later became known as Darth Ruin.
Coming upon the year 32BBY, Master Dooku became the twentieth member of the Lost.

Members of the Lost Twenty were remembered by bronzium busts in the Jedi Archives, a reminder of the Jediâ€™s greatest failures.
Each bust was inscribed at the base, with the great feats and deeds of the Jedi Master it commemorated.
