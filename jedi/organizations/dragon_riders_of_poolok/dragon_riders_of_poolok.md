# Introduction

Not much is known about the Dragon Riders of Poolok, and one of the only known things about them is that they were an organization of riders who had dragons as mounts.
The only contact they have had with anyone of significance was Gonstor.
Gonstor was known for his skills in taming dangerous beasts; they had asked him to help them deal with a terrifying beast known as the Hoosha.
