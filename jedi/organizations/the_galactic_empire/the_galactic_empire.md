# Introduction
The Galactic Empire was the Empire that was formed after Order 66, and the fall of the Galactic Republic.
Supreme Chancellor Palpatine announced after the Republic had fallen, that the Jedi were traitors, and planned to overthrow the senate.
Following these events, the Supreme Chancellor deemed himself the Emperor of the Galactic Empire in 19BBY, with the newly appointed Sith Apprentice named Darth Vader by his side.
The Galactic Empire consisted of a mighty military force that included stormtroopers, spy technology, (e.g.
probe droids) etc.
The Galactic Empire ruled for years through fear, intimidation, and tyranny.
Those who did not cooperate with the Empire were labelled as Rebels and faced harsh punishment that may or may not result in their death.
Furthermore, the Emperor had replaced the senators of the Galactic Republic with Moffs as regional governors.
Palpatine had free rein to govern the galaxy as he so desired.
Unbeknownst to his subjects, Palpatine was actually the Sith Lord Darth Sidious who originally planned to take over the Republic and destroy the Jedi Order.

# Section 1
Early on in the Empire's ruling, the Empire stood virtually unchallenged until numerous insurgent cells united to initiate the Galactic Civil War, the common quote used among the titled 'Rebel Traitors' was "We are the spark that will light the fire." With the growing rebellion winning its first major victory over Mustafar in 4 BBY, these rebel cells formed the Alliance to Restore the Republic in 2 BBY.
The Rebel Alliance itself achieved its first major victory with the theft of the Death Star plans on Scarif which, in turn, led to the Death Star II being destroyed during the Battle of Yavin at 0 BBY (Before Battle of Yavin) The following years saw initial Alliance successes until a major Imperial victory on Hoth in 3 ABY, but the Empire suffered a devastating defeat in 4 ABY at the Battle of Endor.
During this battle, the Emperor Palptine, formerly known as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, was slain at the hands of his Sith apprentice, Darth Vader, who died from the aftermath of being electrocuted by the Emperor himself, as the Emperor designed his suit to absorb lightning.
With the Emperor finally dead, and the Sith extinct, for the time being, factionalism overcame the Empire as it fractured into fiefdoms led by leftover Moffs and Admirals from the Empire.
Many of which had ignored Grand Vizier Mas Amedda's claim to authority.



# Section 2
However his reign was short-lived after being killed in 4ABY.
An example of the Galactic Empire's fearsome power was the newly constructed Death Star.
It is named Death Star as the major weapon that the battle station (Approximately the size of a remote moon.) contained was powered by Kyber Crystals that the Emperor had his forces mine from ruined Jedi Temples, and the caves on Ilum.
Once the battlestation reached fully operational, this 'Weapon of mass destruction' had the fire power to blow up an entire planet, which is where it's name came from, 'Death Star'.
However, both Death Stars were destroyed by the Rebel Alliance shortly after becoming operational.
Once the Death Star was destroyed for the second time, the Empire was rendered powerless, and more people began rebelling against the one great Galactic Empire, ultimately resulting in the Empire's demise.



# Section 3
The largest Imperial remnant of the Empire was publicly led by Grand Admiral Rae Sloane, and covertly ruled by Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax and his Shadow Council.
Fast foward some time, and Rax seized control over the largest faction of the Imperial Navy, after taking away Sloane's power, he become essentially the acting-Emperor through his position as Counselor to the Empire Under his command, they made their final stand at the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY, however they lost to the New Republic.
Several holdouts continued to resist, the Empire formally capitulated to the New Republic with the signing of the Galactic Concordance.
During this new Era of prosperity and hope, war reparations and treaties reduced the Empire to mere ash, with a substantial amount of the what was left of the Empire's army forced to stay within a specific border of the Core and Inner Rim, making them unable to access the Outer Rim, agreeing to punitive stipulations, whilst the other half of their forces remained in a war state with the New Republic.
One time they used to be in control, now they're seen as the rebels, rebel cells if that.
Eventually, the New Republic established enough forces and created a massive military force.
However, most were not aware that there were Sith loyalists that secretly worshipped Emperor Palpatine within their ranks.
