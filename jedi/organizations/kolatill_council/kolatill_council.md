# Introduction
The history of the Kolatill Council is both confusing and spread across different time spans, however it’s history will be presented as clearly and concisely as possible.

The Council of Kolatill reigned supreme over the planet of Kolatill in the Kathol Sector which also belonged to the Outer Rim.
Once the Galactic Republic discovered the planet however, they subjugated the planet to their tyranny as they had done many before.

# Section 1
The Imperial Moff, Kentor Sarne upon reaching the planet with his forces, put in place a different governor which ultimately replaced the Council.
This was done against the people’s wishes, and was ultimately used to forward the Moff’s plans of turning all the local factories into war machines that produced speeders for the on-going wars.

The council was imprisoned which led to many of its members being eroded by both time and the harsh conditions.
In 8 ABY the council was freed when the people rebelled against the governor.
The (3) remaining members reestablished their positions and aligned themselves with the New Republic.

Shortly into their rebuilding of Kolatill, a large carrier ship controlled by the imperials lay waste to the inhabitants of the planet in an assault.
The Council called the New Republic for defensive assistance.



# Section 2
A grueling campaign ensued whereas Councilor Kause initiated meetings with Captain Ciro (the leader of the stationed New Republic forces).
These meetings were to be broadcast to the people of Kolatill so that it could boost the morale of those under hellfire.


However, before they could occur properly, the carrier ‘Kathol Protector’ laid down a stronger second assault.
During this Captain Ciro’s vessel was captured.
Fortunately, Kolatill forces alongside New Republic forces managed to intervene and successfully fend off the imperials.

Following this, a funeral was held for the fallen of this campaign, and the Kolatill planet was freed from Imperial influence.
