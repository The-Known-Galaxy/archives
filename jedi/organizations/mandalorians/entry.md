# Introduction

Summary

The Mandalorians were a clan based-cultural society.
Their clans revolved around species.
Although, some clans were mixed species-wise.
The Mandalorians were dependent and raised of their creed, or code.
They lived by it and made it their lives, and their creed powered them in their battles.
Originating on the planet Mandalore, they took a foothold in Galactic history when they fought against legendary warriors of the Jedi Order.
To this day, the Mandalorians still remain as the sole enemies of the Jedi.
As time went on from their humble beginning, they colonized and conquered more territory such as; Kalevala, Krownest, and Concord Dawn.

Culture and Society

Throughout Galactic history, those who learned about the Mandalorians always thought about the fear they brought to their enemies.
This is right, as though the Mandalorians were absolute warriors.
Fighting is in their blood.
In their culture, they followed combat as the ultimate goal.
And if you won, you would go down in history.
In some rare cases, they could invoke their code, or creed in order to settle disputes with one and other, which would always have the defeating opponent dying during the fight.
Another way to lead the Mandalorians, you have to claim “The Darksaber”’, (refer to the Darksaber in the weapons section) a black lightsaber crafted by the only Mandalorian Jedi, Tarre Vizsla to lead the Mandalorian clans.
