# Introduction
The Clan Cadera consisted of Mandalorians and held a prominent existence within the Great Galactic War period until the Cold War between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic.
The clan held different views with the Mand’alor at the time.
Mandalore the Vindicated, with who they were aligned their support.
The new leader chose to ally themselves with the Sith whilst Cadera Clan leader, Jicoln Cadera, protested against the decision and advocated side with the Republic instead.
 This would ignite the conflict between the Mandalorians as Jicoln Cadera would raise a legion to confront the Mand’alor.
 In the end,  Jicoln and his followers lost the fight, which led to Jicoln escaping as an exiled (being presumed dead) whilst the remaining members of Clan Cadera stayed within the Mandalorians.

# Section 1
Due to the conflict that transpired, many Mandalorians detested the clan, often referring to their members as “traitor’s blood”.
After being humiliated by his father’s actions, Torian Cadera, immediately sought to kill him after finding out that Jicoln Cadera had been alive on Taris.
Eventually, he defeated his father through a Mandalorian death game, Geroya be Haran.
Through this, Torian had finally let the Mandalorians see the Clan Cadera in a positive light by essentially removing the source of their dishonor, his own father.
