# Introduction
The Mandalorian Protectors were an organization of Mandalorians who came together to reforge the way of the Mandalorian past.
The Protectors were founded by Spar, an ARC trooper who defected to work for the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
Their ethos was based upon the Supercommando Codex, an established set of principles from the True Mandalorians [their predecessor].
Contrary to other Mandalorian groups, the Protectors were organized into a military-like structure.
However, they still answered to one call: The Mandalore.

# Section 1
The Clone Wars was a period in which the Protectors were heavily involved.
The Protectors aligned themselves with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, serving as their cavalry.
With the involvement of the Protectors, it allowed the Confederacy to maintain shock and awe when dealing with the Republic.
Success was much more rapid with the Protectors’ involvement; they took less time to complete assignments compared to droids.
However, their end soon came - an engagement left the Protectors with three members.
Their large force was gone.



# Section 2
Following the conclusion of the Clone Wars, the Galactic Empire ruled over the galaxy.
As such, they sought to gain control over the Protectors’ homeworld, Mandalore.
A contingency was necessary - the Empire was not known for leniency.
Thus, the Protectors reformed.
Small in number, they lacked resources necessary to be a full scale army.
However, through resourcefulness and ingenuity, the Protectors were able to survive.
In conflicts they entered with the Empire, they did take loss.
However, they still triumphed and progressed through - increasing their number and beginning anew.
