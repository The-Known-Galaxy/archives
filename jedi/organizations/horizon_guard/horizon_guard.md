# Introduction
Founded in 3630 BBY, the Horizon Guard, Eternal Empress Vaylin’s military contingent, was filled with force-sensitives originally from the Knights of Zakuul.
The Horizon Guard’s ranks were handpicked by the Empress, and were made after her brother, Eternal Emperor Arcann, was defeated by the Alliance Commander, the Outlander.
The Horizon Guards’ primary weapons were lightsaber pikes and lightsabers.
Their armor: black and grey; however, there was a white variation as well.
The Horizon Guard lived by their unofficial motto, "I serve for life, but I don't serve for long." Servitude in the Horizon Guard was a blessing and a curse because, while in the guard, you were subject to Vaylin’s unstable temper.

# Section 1
Seeking revenge against her mother, Eternal Empress Vaylin commanded the Horizon Guard from the Spire on Zakuul.
From the Spire, she ordered various Horizon Guards to lead the invasion of Voss by probing and torching the planet behind them.
She also requested they report any advancements of the invasion to her.
Within the invasion, sky troopers and Horizon Guards raided the Tower of Prophecy, an improvised command center, causing buildings to crumble and fires to develop throughout the capital, but later on, were defeated by the Alliance Commander and their associates.

After their defeat, Eternal Empress Vaylin and SCORPIO, an AI who believed the technology was stolen, led another fleet to invade and seize the Gravestone, one of the Alliance’s ships; however, this mission was more successful.
Empress Vaylin and SCORPIO, accompanied by a force of the Horizon Guard boarded a civilian vessel and pretended to flee from Eternal Empire ships.
During the act, SCORPIO sent an SOS, crying for help from the acting Eternal Empire ships, and was answered by the Captain, Koth Vortena.
In response, the Gravestone shot down the pursuing Empire ships and offered the disguised Horizon Guards permission to board the Gravestone, allowing the Horizon Guard to capture the captain’s crew and seize the ship.
Captain Koth Vortena alerted the Alliance about the invasion, asking for support.
After support from the Alliance had arrived, two Horizon Guards, Tragus Rova and Vella Zarkot, attempted to obstruct the Alliance Commander and his vessel from rescuing the captain and his ship but were both vanquished by the Outlander, and, after many other events unfolded, the Alliance eventually got their ship back from the Eternal Empress.

At the Grand Festival of Empress Vaylin, a luxurious party thrown by the Emperor herself to celebrate her prestige, the Horizon Guard was assigned strategic points to guard within the Palace of the Eternal Dragon.
Meanwhile, the Commander, Arcann, and his allies had a plan to invade the party to stop the Eternal Empress.
The Horizon Guard sparred against the enemies, while the Empress attempted to escape.
After some time defending the Eternal Empress, she finally was able to escape to Nathema using her flagship, in an effort to remove her mental conditioning, a condition that compelled her to her knees, making her powerless, whenever she used the Force.
On Nathema, the Horizon Guard was commanded to defend Vaylin while she tried to remove her mental conditioning; nevertheless, the Alliance Commander and Lana Beniko assassinated them, trying to stop Vaylin from getting the conditioning removed.
Vaylin, finally, successfully got the conditioning removed and initiated an assault on Odessen, the capital of the Eternal Alliance, with the Horizon Guard, including Imperator Sunfell, helping on the front lines.
In Odessen, they escorted the Empress and her prisoner to the Alliance base to face the Commander, which later led to the Guards and Vaylin’s expiration.



# Section 2
After Vaylin was executed and the Eternal Empire fell, the remaining guards immigrated throughout the galaxy.
Sterla, former Horizon Guard Scout Captain, joined Tasser, Battalion Commander, to aid in constructing a new Star Fortress on Rakata Prime, but were halted by the Eternal Alliance, as usual.
Vinn Atrius, a former Horizon Guard member began a campaign in 3629 BBY, the Order of Zildrog Campaign, a chain of attacks against the Eternal Alliance.
They attempted this with Zildrog, an early superweapon from Iokath.
These attacks were eventually stopped in 3628 BBY as Theron Shan, the Alliance’s intelligence officer, intruded on the order and allowed the Commander to track down him on Nathema and detain him.

Years after, in 3626 BBY, the Alliance Commander and several others boarded a ship with Satele Shan and several of her students, who had Tenebrae’s curse, a curse that was released into the air after the Commander released the spirit of Valkorian out of his head, a dark side entity who manipulated galactic affairs for 1500 years, which released a trap Valkorian had laid, a Sith ritual, which caused comas and nightmares.
Anyone with the curse became part of one shared mind, a hive mind.
The Alliance Commander entered Shan’s mind where Tenebrae was located.
Before Tenebrae died several spirits of all the people he had manipulated appeared before him, in this, several Horizon Guards were caught joining the Commander, the Eternal Empire’s enemy, to defeat the Sith Emperor one and for all.
