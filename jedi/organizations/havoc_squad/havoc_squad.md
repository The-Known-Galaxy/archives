# Introduction
Havoc Squad was originally known as infantry squad 326.
Havoc Squad would soon earn its reputation as well as its name while being under the command of commander Jace Malcom.
It was created during the Great Galactic War, which lasted from 3681 BBY-3653 BBY.
Havoc Squad was attached to a larger infantry division within the army, operated mostly independently, and specialized in irregular warfare.

# Section 1
In 3667 BBY, Havoc Squad was stationed in the peaceful war, the folder where they rested from their tours in the frontlines across the galaxy.
While they were there, the Sith Empire invaded.
The Sith were unaware Republic troopers were hiding in the forests of Alderaan.
While the Empire marched towards the capital, they were attacked by Havoc Squad.
The Squad considered their attack a suicide mission but fought anyway.
At first, it was successful, even against Sith warriors.
But eventually, they were overwhelmed, and in a dire situation.
If not for the Jedi Knight Satele Shan, Havoc Squad would have been completely wiped out.
The presence of the Jedi lifted their morale and eventually led them to win this battle.
The squad would eventually fall to the command of Harron Tavus while Jace rose through higher ranks of the Republic Military.



# Section 2
At one point Havoc Squad was sent to Ando Prime, where they encountered more Imperial troops than expected and were forced to retreat.
They called for extraction, which was rejected by the senate because it was an unauthorized mission formed by general Garza.
They managed to escape the planet in an Imperial Shuttle.
The incident left a dark scar on the team with many of its members believing that they were betrayed by the Republic.
This led them to plan to defect from the Republic while they were stationed on Ord Mantell around the time of the Separatist War.
 They were tasked with recovering a stolen ZR-57 orbital strike bomb.
During the mission, they were accompanied by their newest recruit, Meteor, who was unaware of their plans to defect.
He was asked to join them, but he refused.
As the others escaped with the bomb and left the Republic, Meteor became the new leader of the Havoc Squad, since he was the only member left.
He started to recruit new members for the team, starting with Aric Jorgan.



# Section 3
During the Cold War, the new Havoc Squad would hunt down the members that defected one by one.
At some point, they were assigned to stop the Imperials super weapon, called the Gauntlet, which was a modified carrier class dreadnought with a hyperspace cannon.
They were supposed to stop the weapon with the help of their newest recruit.
They were able to destroy the weapon but with heavy casualties.
Havoc Squad commander Meteor disappeared, which caused the entire squad to go their separate ways.
This left only Aric Jorgan, who was promoted to major.
He then rejuvenated the squad with new recruits during the Great Galactic War.
Havoc Squad members used one of the best armor styles in the entire Old Republic Era, the red and white Republic's Special Forces armor.
They were always heavily armed with everything they needed at any given point.
Their armor was replaced by white and orange armor during the Cold War.
