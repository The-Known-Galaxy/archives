# Introduction

The Gungan Grand Army is a military force consisting of Gungans.
When the Trade Federation invaded and enslaved Naboo, the army formed an attack on them and led them to victory.
In the Battle of Mon Calamari, the army served as reinforcements to the Republic.

# Section 1

During the Naboo Invasion, the Gungan Grand Army was requested by the Queen of Naboo, Padmé  Amidala.
In the Great Grass Plains, the Grand Army attacked the Trade Federation Droid Army just 40 kilometers outside of Theed, a strategy used to lure the droids away from the capital in order to allow the Queen and the Royal Naboo Security Forces to invade the Theed Royal Palace to capture Viceroy Nute Gunray.

The soldiers of the Gungan Army strongly believed that Jar Jar Binks was being gifted by the gods and was appointed as a Bombad General.
In the end, the army was initially in defeat, but the droids were shut down when Anakin Skywalker destroyed the Droid Control Ship, therefore became victorious.

Following their victorious end of the conflict, the Grand Army happily entered the capital and was greeted by the residents of Naboo for their part in freeing Naboo.
Boss Nass was gifted the Globe of Peace by Queen Amidala, as a symbol and the start of the friendly relationship between the Gungans and the humans of Naboo.

# Section 2

In the Clone Wars, during the Battle of Mon Calamari, Master Yoda requested aid from the Gungan Boss Lyonie.
Senator Jar Jar Binks convinced Lyonie to assist the Republic.
The Grand Army was sent to Mon Cala in a Venator-class Star Destroyer.
Many have died and been captured by the Separatist leader Riff Tamson.
They were sent to a prison camp, just among the corals of Mon Cala.

Then, Prince Lee-Char of the Mon Calamari visited the camp and informed them about the attack, telling them to wait for his signal.
But Lee-Char was captured and brought to Tamson and was scheduled to be executed.

Quarren, who was allied with the Separatists, freed the Grand Army and joined Captain Ackbar in taking down the Trident assault ship.
They were victorious, and Lee-Char was crowned king.

# Section 3

Later, rumors circulated in Naboo about the Gungan allying with the Separatists, Lyonie called the Army to march on Theed.
Senator Amidala and Anakin Skywalker returned to the planet to mediate the situation.
They met Jar Jar on Lake Paonga and took them to Otoh Gunga.

While trying to mediate the situation, Lyonie rejected their help, but Anakin noticed a necklace, gifted by Minister Rish Loo, worn by Lyonie which had some sort of mind control.
He destroyed the Necklace and freed Lyonie.
Rish Loo later confronted Lyonie, and stabbed him.
Loo then escaped and went to the surface to announce that Lyonie was dead and march on the capital.

Lyonie somehow survived the attack, but he was unconscious.
With Jar Jar resembling Lyonie, Anakin convinced him to act as Lyonie and pose as the Boss to convince the Army to retreat and cancel the attack.
Jar Jar was successful in doing so.
Rish Loo then saw that his plans had failed, he escaped into the swamps.

Three C-9979 landing crafts landed, one deployed a tactical droid with a B2-series super battle droid escort.
Jar Jar and General Tarpals managed to follow the tactical droid on the landing craft.
There, they met General Grievous.
Jar Jar told the general that he cancelled the attack on Theed.
Of course, it angered Grievous, Tarpals later ordered to prepare the troops for battle and contacted Padmé about his strategy.

Grievous was able to see through Jar Jar and attempted to kill him.
He managed to escape and was told that the Grand Army had succeeded in turning off the droids.
Tarpals and others battled Grievous.
The General managed to stab Tarpals but later realized that he was impaled with a spear.
This caused them a distraction to give the Gungans enough time to attack Grievous with boomas, which are grenade-like weapons used by the Gungans and capture him.

On the other hand, Anakin pursued Rish Loo in his secret outpost, which was used by Count Dooku.
Dooku had already killed Loo.
He also restrained and captured Anakin.
They offered Amidala that they will free Grievous in exchange for Anakin.
Padmé then agreed and the Separatist army left Naboo.
