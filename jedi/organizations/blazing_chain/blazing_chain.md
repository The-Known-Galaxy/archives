# Introduction
The Blazing Chain was a group of Force-using individuals who were not affiliated with the Jedi Order or any side of the Force.
They were raiders, taking from fearful civilians on planets in the Unknown Region.
They ran into Sith fleeing from the Great Sith War.
Many meetings ended in death, however some weaker of the Sith joined Forces with the Blazing Chain.
As such, many more Force sensitive individuals were in this organization.
They painted a red chain on the side of their ships as it struck fear into civilians.
In 33 BBY, one of the adacaps, Zonsoe, and his fleet, the Blackshackle, fell to the dark side and became conquerors.
They destroyed the fleet Arcblade, launching a 5 year civil war in the group.
Eventually, the Blackshackle fleet fell but it left the rest of the Blazing Chain very weak, until the Battle of Yavin.
They regained their former strength after this battle, and once again became a threat in the Unknown Regions.
