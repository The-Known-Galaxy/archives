# Introduction

The Rebellion against the Galactic Empire, began as a peaceful movement by the political minority during the Clone wars, within a group in the Galactic Senate known as the Delegation of 2000, this delegation, composed of senators such as Padme Amidala, Bail Organa, and Mon Mothma, were growing increasingly concerned with the constitutional amendments that weakened the senate, and empowered the Chancellor position with near dictatorial authority.
However, most of the Senate supported such alterations to the government’s overall structure due to the Separatist Crisis and subsequent Clone Wars, both which threatened to divide the galaxy into two.
However, unknown to the Delegation of 2000, Chancellor Palpatine, was a Sith Lord, who plotted to reassert dominance over the Galaxy by overthrowing and warping the Galactic Republic and making sure the Jedi Order didn't exist for future generations.
This was successfully done when after Three years of galactic warfare, Palpatine’s position as a public figure was strengthened Allowing for the passing of the Sector Governance Decree, which made entire sectors controlled by a cabal of military governors known as Moffs, and finally after Order 66 took its course, the declaration of himself as Emperor.

Movement with the rebellion got more violent as the Galactic Empire was setting its roots, with the best example being Gizor Dellso, who utilized an abandoned droid factory to create private army of battle droids to revive the Seperatist cause, or the event where Kaminoan cloners, engineered and trained an army of rebel clone troopers to openly rebel against The Empire, sadly however both of theses attempts at rebellion failed.
However, in 2 BBY, Darth Vader commanded his then apprentice Starkiller to search the galaxy for various rebels and dissidents who opposed the Galactic empire, requiring them to unite in a single rebellion that would put the empire into a state of Civil War.
Two years, later as a result of the Alliance’s victory at Yavin 4, they gained credibility as a legitimate military opponent to the Empire, bringing more confidence to other systems who joined the Alliance openly in the months following the Death Star’s destruction, however, the Alliance could afford to waste no time following its victory at Yavin, relocating to a base temporarily on Thila, whilst setting up a more established based on Hoth, the main setbacks during this time was when Garm Bel Iblis, left the Alliance following a major disagreement, however it was offset by the joining of Borsk Fey’lya and his sizable faction of Bothans.

Finally, the Alliance suffered a setback when Echo Base, the main base of Operations for Alliance High Command, was discovered by an Imperial probe droid and overrun.
In the ensuing battle however, they had to retreat from Hoth entirely, using the ground based Ion cannons to blast holes in the Imperial blockade over the planet.
Therefore, as this ends the Rebel Alliance got news that a second Death Star was nearing completion, which forced the Alliance to take their greatest risk and attack the installation before it could become operational, however this risk, was not without its downsides such as the loss of many flagships and destroyers, although in the end of the Rebel Alliance won due to the death of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader with the second Death Stars destruction, causing about a week later the creation of the New Republic.
