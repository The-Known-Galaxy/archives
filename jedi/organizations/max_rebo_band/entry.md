# Introduction

The Max Rebo Band was a band filled with at least twelve people that would usually play at Jabba the Hutt’s palace on Tatooine.
They would sing and sometimes create songs at his palace around four years before the Battle of Yavin.
When they performed the song “Jedi Rocks”, the Hutt would demand it to be played again because of how much he enjoyed it.
However, the second performance would be interrupted when he would drop one of his dancers, Oola, into the Rancor pit below, where she was slaughtered and eaten.
As they would begin to sing again, they would witness in the corner of their eye, Leia Organa, in disguise of course, claim the bounty of the famous Wookie Chewbacca.
They would also be there when she frees Han Solo from the carbonite.
After the “death” of Boba Fett, they would break up the band.
