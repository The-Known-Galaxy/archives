# Introduction
The Guardians of the Whills, also called the Guardians of the Kyber Temple, was a separate Order from the Jedi that focused much on religion.
They were created a few years before the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY.
Later down the line, a mantra about the Force and how they are one with it and fear no-one would be made in their name called The Guardian Mantra.
Their headquarters and main area would be present in Jedha City due to that being where they handcraft their lightbows.
These weapons would need to be made by a user for tradition and for them to carry on their spiritual progression.
The process of making one would be described as “requiring patience and skill”.
The Guardians of the Whills would continue to guard their pilgrims to the Kyber Temple during the Imperial Era, even though it was now harder than before.
In 0 BBY, the two rebels, Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor, would visit the city in hopes of finding an Imperial defector who had information on the Galactic Empire’s newest weapon.
Imperial stormtroopers would soon surround the pair and question them but Chirrut Îmwe, who was a Guardian of the Whills, would enter the scene secretly and distract the troopers from their purpose.
Baze Malbus, another Guardian, would enter the scene as well and assist him, taking down the troopers together.
Saving the rebels, Malbus and Îmwe would follow their journey until the sacrifices they made in the Battle of Scarif.
