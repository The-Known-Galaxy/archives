# Introduction
The Imperial Symphony Orchestra, also known as ISO, was the primary form of musical entertainment for people that live within the core worlds.
The Imperial Symphony Orchestra was the Galactic Empire’s best and most prestigious band that contained the most skilful musicians throughout the Empire.
In the early days of the Orchestra, they had built up their name by travelling throughout the galaxy and performing on countless planets and in countless regions.
A drought of performances occurred around 15 BBY and lasted until 0 ABY when the Orchestra was forced to only perform for Core worlds as other regions, imparticular the Mid Rim was either too dangerous or too poor for the Orchestra to perform in.

# Section 1
Starting in 5 BBY the Imperial Orchestra began a tour of the core worlds that spread an Imperial High culture or Human High culture sentiment, this culture supports and argues that humans are the highest and most pure life forms and are superior to other races in every aspect.
This is known as specism or xenophobia which was already endorsed by the Galactic Empire and the residents of the Core Worlds.
Shortly after the Core worlds tour, the Battle of Yavin took place which resulted in Imperial defeat which in turn removed many previous issues with the Orchestra performing in the Mid Rim.
When the opportunity arose the Orchestra announced their first tour outside the Core Worlds in 15 years, this tour took place within the Mid Rim and was a huge hit.
