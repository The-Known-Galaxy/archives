# Introduction

The Droid Army of the Trade Federation was formed during a small conflict called the Stark War.
The Federation was still subject to attacks by mercenaries and pirates on remote trade routes.
That’s why the Galactic Senate has been asked for permission to develop armed robots to defend themselves against pirates.
At first, the battle droids weren’t the best, and they didn’t differ from normal humanoids.
But as time went by, the Neimoidians became more and more afraid of their ships and new models and better weapons were added.
The Trade Federation did not have a regular droid army until it joined the Confederation of Independent Systems and cooperated with Darth Sidious.

# Section 1

Darth Sidious enabled the Trade Federation to form a regular army out of a real incident.
Federation began the production of droids.
Three large companies: Baktoid Armor Workshop, Haor Chall Engineering, and Colicoid Creation Nest, signed contracts and got to work.
A huge amount of droids were produced and hundreds more were in plans.
The most common ones were Battle Droids B1 and Super Battle Droids B2, as they were the most efficient to produce and also not that expensive.
For example, Droideka, which were also first on the production line.
However, the entire production was kept secret although the model B1 was shown during the summit of Eriad.
They were designed to resemble the skeletons of Neimoidians, making them more fearful.
The Separatist Army, however, was formed from droids of various allies of Count Dooku and members of the Confederation of Independent Systems.
The first military operation took place during the Naboo invasion, but the droids have been tested in the Kartak system before.
Most limbs were interchangeable, which allowed damaged droids to be quickly repaired and sent back to combat.
B1 Battle Droid had an energy amplifier unit on the back and an antenna for a signal support.
The high-performance motor was in the chest.
On the head were a motion processor, the main command register, optical sensors, and built-in cyclic memory.
A base team consisted of 8 droids, a platoon of 7 teams (56 droids), and the company of 2 platoons (112 droids).
The battalion consisted of 784 droids and additional logistical droids.
They were transported by Multi-Troop Transport along with tanks or other support equipment.

# Section 2

Early versions of the droids were firmly tied to the central control units, making them vulnerable to their destruction or signal disruption.
When the Trade Federation invaded Naboo, the droids conquered the planet well, but in the final battle, they suffered a defeat as the droid control ship was destroyed.
At that time, all droids were shut down.
After the experience with Naboo, an improved model with an expanded intelligence module and greater autonomy was introduced.
It was also decided to build several droid control ships so that the Naboo battle situation would never happen again.
The motor skills of the droids did not differ significantly from most humanoids, and the manipulators made it possible to operate most of the weapons designed for humans.
The biggest advantage of B1 was its quantity, with little effort you could bring countless of them into battle by flooding the enemy with them.
However, in small groups, they were easily defeated by clones and Jedi.
To increase combat ability, BX commando droids, droid tank NR-N99, spider droids OG-9, etc.
were added to the army.
The droids' greatest weakness was that they were gaining no combat experience.
All droids had the same abilities and didn’t learn more during battles.
In contrast to the clone army, which evolved and gained experience after each fight.
After the Battle of Coruscant, the Droid Army lost the majority of its forces and never regained its full numbers.

# Section 3

When it was discovered that Grievous was hiding in Utapau after the Battle of Coruscant, Master Kenobi was sent there with a clone squad.
After the battle on Mustafar which was won by Republic General Grievous was killed by Obi-Wan Kenobi.
However, the leaders of Seperatist managed to escape the planet.
In the meantime, many important things have happened on Coruscant: Palpatine revealed his dual identity to Anakin Skywalker, who informed Mace Windu about it.
The Jedi tried to arrest the long-sought Sith, but Palpatine – with the help of Anakin, whom he eventually pulled to the Dark Side – defeated them and then gave Order 66.
During these events, there were several battles, including at Mygeeto.
The clones were still fighting the droids on many fronts of the galaxy, and Sidious ordered his new student Darth Vader to go to Mustafar.
There, the Sith killed all surviving members of the Separatist Council and turned off the Separatist armies, thus ending the Clone Wars and the life of the Confederacy.
However, the droids weren't completely removed from the Army.
The new rising Empire included them as support to its living army.
