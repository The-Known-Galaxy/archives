# Introduction
Abundat in oil and lava overflowing, Sarapin was one of the biggest energy providers in galactic history.
It was located in the Sarapin system but what also made it so valuable compared to other resource deposits was not its location, but it's inhospitable nature.
This meant that, before immigration, there was little resistance from the planet’s fauna and could be easily industrialized.
The only living threat on the planet and its moons were the Vaapad, small multi-tentacled energy-draining creatures that could attack so quickly that “they were nothing but a blur to the naked eye”.
In fact, you may have noticed the similarity between their name and a Lightsaber form used within the Order - this is because Jedi Master Mace Windu developed that very form from inspecting how the vaapad use swift and deadly strikes to overwhelm their prey.
However, apart from this deadly advisory, little could stop the planet from becoming the perfect energy source for galactic governments across the ages.
As a consequence, towering laser drills were built into the planet to garner its wealth and there were many operations to utilize the constant volcanic activity on the planet, including energy collectors that would tap into and harvest the various lava flows spread across the planet for energy.
 Even Count Dooku estimated “that during the later years of the Republic, Sarapin provided 80 percent of the Core Worlds' power”.
There was much need for its resources, so much so that there was even a space station built above it to collect the resources obtained and store them until off-world shipping.
However, due to this demand, there were many attempts to control the planet and, as a consequence, it had to be shielded by a near-impenetrable defense grid.
This only faltered two times -  by a Confederacy of Independent Systems General in 22 BBY and when Rebel forces infiltrated the planet before the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY.
Both times the attacks were repelled, showing just how valuable the planet was to display such military might for it.
