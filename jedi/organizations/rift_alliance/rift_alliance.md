# Introduction
Established in 3643 BBY, the Rift Alliance was a faction of different powerful planets wishing to secede from the Republic.
The Rift Alliance was held by similar ideals that the Republic was incompetent.
This was the original intent for the faction, but when Jedi Master who was the Barsen’thor of the Jedi Order went to bring the Rift Alliance back into the folds of the Republic instead, the Barsen’thor rallied the Rift Alliance against the Sith Empire’s Children of the Empire.

# Section 1
The Rift Alliance had an odd formation, with half of the planets in the Alliance being non-separationists, an example is the planet of Sarkhai joining out of curiosity.
However, many planets were wishing to secede fully from the Republic, if they did, it would have spelled an end for the Republic as a whole.
One planet such as Saleucami, which is a major trading hub in the Outer Rim.
Another, Aeten II, had mining operations that brought vital ores and crystals that would have halted fleet construction for the Republic.
Some members of the Rift Alliance weren’t a part of the Republic as well, seeking aid from a larger galactic body.
They were neutral planets, those like Balmorra and Manaan.



# Section 2
The Rift Alliance operated by a mutual agreement between the different worlds and had no real form of a governing body.
The planets' economic and military resources were a source of protection against the pirates for the Alliance.
Especially the pirates of the White Maw harassing them, they pooled up a lot of resources from within the Alliance to protect themselves.
To have easier access, they hid resources on a research facility on the planet Quesh.
Although the Rift Alliance employed the facility, it was run by Selkath personnel.



# Section 3
The Barsen’thor was requested by Supreme Chancellor Dorian Janarus at the Council’s discretion to bring the Rift Alliance back into the Republic’s sphere of influence.
Losing any number of the planets in the Rift Alliance would be devastating to the Republic and Chancellor Janarus knew this, so he had recruited the Jedi Master.
However, the Barsen'thor didn't just bring the Rift Alliance back to the Republic.
They had rallied the Alliance into a formidable military force to face off the Children of the Emperor in the Battle of Corellia.
The Chancellor Dorian Janarus was assassinated before he could see the end of the reintegration by unknown assassins.
It was his successor, Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh who not only saw the reintegration, but authorized reparations for the Rift Alliance’s contributions for their feats done to save the Republic.
As well as to respond to their initial succession of the Republic.
