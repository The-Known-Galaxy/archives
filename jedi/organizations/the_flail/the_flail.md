# Introduction
The Flail was a terrorist faction that would intimidate Coruscant during the decades until the Battle of Naboo.
They would accuse the former Coruscant politicians for “its” corruption and benefiting large companies without a care for individual citizens.
The organization was mostly filled with humans, though they would also accept aliens and other species unlike some such as Dar’manda which was filled with only humans.
One of their goals was to persuade everyone that the galaxy’s government was corrupt.
In 33 BBY, the Flail would accuse the Supreme Chancellor, Finis Volorum, of this act.
This would end with his reputation lowering and getting worse.
Valorum would decide to fight the organization himself because he would fear the thought of being thrown out of office.
The Chancellor’s Judicial forces would capture then slaughter as many members of the Flail they possibly could including the leadership.
Later down the line, he would imprison the rest and announce this at the following Senate hearing.
However, in response, he would get death threats and an unsuccessful attack against his aide, Sei Taria.
With all this havoc on-going, Mace Windu and himself would create a strike team of strong agents to make sure the attempt on the Chancellor’s life will be foiled.
The Flail would send down Sen Riip Domeet to hide a thermal bomb close by to where the Chancellor would have his conference that very day.
Though, the expert in explosives would quickly escape due to how he thought his disguise had been found out.
The determined organization would immediately enact their next plan which was to enter the Traffic Control Center to control a ship then hurl it into an important building which would host Valorum’s meetings.
As expected, his agents would find them out and foil their plan before the attempt.
In later history, the Flail was present on the planet Talus, during the Galactic Civil War.
The Corellian Security Force were to discover their “secret” hideout, leading into a battle between their troopers and Flail supporters.
