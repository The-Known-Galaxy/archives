# Introduction
The systems army was a tactic used by the likes of the Grand Army of the Republic and the Galactic empire; these armies had many formations that were used.
The meaning of the Systems Army has changed overtime since the Clone Wars to the Galactic Civil War.

# Section 1
During the Clone Wars, the Grand Army of the Republic had ten Systems Armies that were a major part in combat.
These armies consisted of two sector armies commanded by a Jedi High General, who was usually a member of the Jedi High Council.
Out of the ten: Systems Army Alpha, Systems Army Delta, Systems Army Epsilon, and Systems Army Zelta were the most prominent.
Each of these armies had 294,912 clone troopers to fight with.



# Section 2
Under the Galactic Empire, Systems Armies had increased massively.
During the Galactic Civil War, formations like Systems Armies were confounded with a Surface Marshall in charge and leading a single sector.
These System Armies would be extremely unrecognizable to those in the Clone Wars.
Systems Armies were still commanded by a High General, however, these were now Line Officers rather than Jedi Knights.
These Generals were tasked with the job of keeping track of units and resources within the sector.
These individuals also conveyed messages to front-line Generals.
These new armies were organized separately from Surface Armies and Corps HQs which had oversight.
The armies had fighting troops of 193.644 combatants and a strong garrison with several battalions.
The garrison force was directly attached to the High General’s command and attached to a headquarters unit.
This garrison was just built up of 1,885 men and identical to those in the Surface Armies, who had 784 support personnel, 200 ISB agents, three COMPNOR supporters, and one security company supported by six perimeter patrol platoons, being the last in the High General’s direct command.



# Section 3
Systems Armies went from powerful armies used in the Clone Wars to their only use becoming supporting the front lines and the Navy.
It went from once being the beginning attacking fleet of the Grand Army of the Republic, to almost entirely ceasing to exist.
