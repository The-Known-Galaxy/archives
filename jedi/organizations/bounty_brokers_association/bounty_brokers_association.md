# Introduction
The Bounty Brokers Association was an organization that handled bounty contracts for bounty hunters during the Cold War and Galactic War.
When it was deemed necessary, they would assign contracts to other capable individuals.
The BBA maintained its presence at Carrick Station and Vaiken Spacedock by providing those interested with the names and locations of clients.

# Section 1
Contractors were expected to handle anything that the job entailed.
Which included contacting the client for additional information, gathering clues about the bounty’s location, tracking, engaging, and killing or apprehending the target.
The BBA then handed them the rewards once they received proof of the job having been completed.
Newcomers were only allowed to take on the less difficult bounties and because of this, they received smaller rewards.
The ability to take on higher difficulty jobs was given to those that had proven themselves to the BBA their capability of handling this kind of bounty.
