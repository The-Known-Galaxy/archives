# Introduction
Dar’manda was a group of ex-Mandalorian smugglers who were quite skilled with guns.
They were one of the only ruling organizations left on Mek-Sha after the event known as Huttbreaker’s rebellions.
Before, Dar'manda was usually a title which was forced upon Mandalorians who no longer followed the resol'nare and had essentially forsaken their duties as a Mandalorian.
The words ''Dar'' translates to ''no longer'', ''manda'' translates to ''soul'', together, dar'manda describes a Mandalorian without a soul and one that will not enter the Mandalorian afterlife.
The band was created near 3627 BBY and led by Indigo, a strong male Mandalorian.
During the war between the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire, the Commander who led the Eternal Alliance thought that the gang could be a possible ally that could make others fear them.
However, Dar’manda would refuse to take anyone's side in this conflict but would offer to cut a deal with them.
They would later find out that the Eternal Alliance had a long rivalry with another gang that lurked on the planet, the Harido Wald.
This faction was the largest smuggling ring the galaxy had ever seen and was led by Veek the Sneak.
Dar’manda believed this was a risky move as they were basically squeezing all the profits they had.
Some time later, most members of the organization would join up with Heta Kol also known as the Hidden Chain which was another faction and be led in this event by Bask Sunn.
Dar’manda would help aid them with their starship in an attack to bring down the Spirit of Vengeance II.
In the aftermath, they would flee with a banner of Clan Cadera luckily.
Later on though, a member of the Vizla household (Shae Vizla) would land on their homeworld and slaughter half of the Dar’manda members.
This is because they wouldn’t tell him the whereabouts of his rivals Heta Kol and in the end, wouldn’t.
Hylo Visz would later say in a conversation with the Eternal Alliance Commander about how Indigo didn’t know that his people were involved with the Spirit of Vengeance II fight, because he was never in-full control.
