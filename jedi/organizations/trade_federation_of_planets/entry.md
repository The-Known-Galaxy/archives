# Introduction

The Trade Federation of Planets was an organisation that formed into a shipping corporation, it was founded in 350 BBY.
Its main goal at the beginning was to solve any arguments or issues between other shipping companies.
As time went by, the Trade Federation of Planets, or more commonly known as the Trade Federation, had grown immensely into a powerful and popular trading corporation.
This allowed the Trade Federation to form its own Trade Federation Merchant Fleet.
While the Trade Federation continued to take over the major trade routes and worlds, it also had made a deal with the Techno Union for a private droid army in order to defend its properties and to maintain power over certain star systems.

# Section 1

At one point species known as Nemoidians began quickly increasing in numbers in the Trade Federation.
Sometime after, the Federation began targeting their own worlds and clients out of dissatisfaction.
However, they did not know that the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, had manipulated the leader of the Federation, Viceroy Nute Gunray.
All of this was part of the Sith Lord’s plan to start a war between the Galactic Republic and the Separatist Alliance.
Eventually many major corporations and organisations joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems, including the Trade Federation.

# Section 2

Although the Federation kept claiming to the Galactic Senate that they had always been neutral and still were.
However, they were secretly working for the Separatist Alliance.
The Federation’s forces were used in various missions to weaken the Republic by taking part in kidnappings, infiltrations, and military-tech deliveries.
At the end of the war, the leader of the Federation, Nute Gunray met his end along with the other Separatist leaders on Mustafar after being betrayed by Darth Sidious.
Even though it was claimed that the Trade Federation was disbanded after the war, it was not officially done until the Imperial Senate was shut down.
