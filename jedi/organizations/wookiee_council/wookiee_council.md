# Introduction
The Wookiee Council was the council that led the Wookiees, who were native to Kashyyyk.
This council consisted of multiple elders, or Chieftains, and was headed by the King.
Later, a Senator became the head of the Wookiee Council.
The Wookiees were developing into a more advanced society.
However, this was suddenly halted by the arrival of the Czerka Corporation, an arms dealer who commonly dealt with Sith, but had a history of selling to both sides.
Due to a prior falling out between the two sons of the chieftain Freyyr, the lack of opposition allowed Czerka to take over the Wookiee capital and began to make use of the servants that had been given to them from another deal, with one son of Freyyr, Chuundar.
The other son, Zaalbar had been exiled for breaking part of the Wookiee code.
Kashyyyk’s state changed when a Jedi named Revan, an amnesiac who had been changed into a Jedi, came looking for a Star Map, which would lead him to the Star Forge, the source of the Sith’s massive fleet.
After Chuundar was killed by Freyyr, a mass revolt was incited and Wookiees successfully drove off the Czerka Corporation.

# Section 1
After the Rebellion against the Czerka Corporation, the Wookiee Council became a member of the Galactic Republic.
The senator representing the Wookiees, Yarua, refused an offer to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
Despite invasions by the Separatists on the Wookiee moon of Alaris Prime, the senator did not allow military bases on Kashyyyk.
Years after the war, Han Solo and Chewbacca rebuilt the Government Tree, located on Kashyyyk.
