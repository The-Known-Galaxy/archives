# Introduction
The Sadow’een are a secret group of assassins under the Sith Lord Naga Sadow.
They are responsible for the execution of Sadow’s rival Horak-mul.

# Section 1
During the reign of the Sith Empire, the Sadow’een established a temple located in the Glacial Fissure area of the planet Hoth.
They were responsible for the death of Sadow’s rival, Horak-mul–a Sith Lord who lived until the Great Hyperspace War.
After their mission to execute the Sith Lord, the assassins were entombed in their temple.

During the Cold War, the temple of the Sadow’een was destroyed, with only the catacombs left.
The Sith Imperial Reclamation Service–a division responsible for the recovery of Sith artifacts–did not consider the planet Hoth as the temple’s location, not until Darth Zash’s apprentice, Kallig, arrived.
Kallig, together with Lieutenant Talos Drellik of the Service, searched the temple to look for Horak-mul’s sarcophagus–a stone coffin used to bury dead leaders.
The dead Sith Lord managed to contact them to offer his power to Kallig, but only on one condition, to desecrate the tomb of the Sadow’een to avenge Horak-mul’s death.
