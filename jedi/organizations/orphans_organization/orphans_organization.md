# Introduction
The Orphans, also known as Chanath Cha, was an organization filled with many orphans whose leader is the bounty hunter Chanath Cha.
Throughout the reign of the Galactic Empire, the Orphans allied with the criminal organization, Crimson Dawn, and were present on Dawn’s flagship, the Vermillion.
They were among other groups and individuals who were present when Lady Qi’ra revealed the true state of the galaxy to them.
A while later, the Orphans were ordered by Qi’ra to carry out an attack on the Black Sun smash-processing lab located on Dantooine.
