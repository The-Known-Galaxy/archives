# Introduction

ISPCA is an organization that has very little known about it, even including the full name.
Only mentioned briefly in a conversation between Lando Calrissian and a Sharu High Singer named Mohs.

# Section 1

Before this conversation even took place, Calrissian, along with Mohs and his droid Vuffi Raa landed the Millennium Falcon on Rafa V, near the base of a Sharu pyramid.
Having been ambushed by a tribe of Toka, who were a primitive people of the Sharu.
They took Calrissian prisoner and tied him to a life-crystal tree that’d slowly remove his intelligence and eventually kill him.

# Section 2

When the ISPCA is mentioned, it’s mentioned when Calrissian finds Mohns cooking a reptilian-like creature that was impaled by a branch.
It was here where Calrissian made the threat that he’d trade Mohs’ place with the reptilian and turn in Mohs to the ISPCA.
Because of this interaction, it’s thought to believe that the ISCPA is a group that stands against animal cruelty.
It could mean, in full, “Imperial Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals”.
However, due to the lack of knowledge or data on this, it is considered speculation.
