# Introduction

The Order of Dai Bendu were a group of Force Sensitive Monks who originated from the planet of Thape, and went on to thrive in the Andobi Mountains of the Planet of Ando Prime; Where they discovered a Force Nexus.
The Order was often referred to as the “Bendu Tribe” and the species inhabiting Ando Prime were often called the Dai Bendu themselves.
They were legendary and ancient, being one of the first organisations to ever study the Force and the Midi-Chlorians.
They predated the Galactic Republic by thousands of years, their origins dating back further than 37,453 years BBY.
The Dai Bendu were originally a peaceful group, dedicating themselves to their studies.
They held principles of non-confrontation and meditation.
The few other groups to discover the Force and the Midi-Chlorians, such as the Shamans residing on Dathomir and the Selkath Scholars of Manaan, were isolated and unable to share their discoveries with each  other.

# Section 1

In the Andonian Mountains, the Dai Bendu discovered an enormous pyramid-like structure.
It had a certain tie with the Force, and called to them specifically.
They had no idea where it came from or what it was, but they referred to it as “Tho Yor”.
While they had the understanding that this structure was otherworldly, they could not pin-point its function.
They prayed to Tho Yor, and hoped to one day listen to it’s voice through meditation.
In 36,453 BBY, a group of Bendu monks found themselves to fulfill the prophecy and heard the call of Tho Yor, allowing them to enter Tho Yor leading them to discover it was in fact a starship.
The Bendu Monks were transported to Tython, where they found seven more starships of the same make as Tho Yor.
They brought other sentient groups to Tython, and thus they all came together to be the first Tythans.
The Dai Bendu played a major role in the formation of the Je'daii Order amongst the Tythans.
Various practices, symbols and beliefs of the Je’daii came from the Dai Bendu.
Lha-Mi, a Bendu Monk, was one of the first Temple Masters of the Je’daii Order.
She was assigned to the Temple of Martial Arts, Stav Kesh.
The very name “Je’daii” comes from two words of the Dai Bendu.
The first word, “Je”, meaning mystic, and the second, “Dai”, meaning centre.

The Order existed well into the time of the Republic, but their beliefs and practices were poorly understood leading to their presence and involvement with the formation of the Je’daii to be forgotten.
Although rarely known, few historians speculated the Dai Bendu to be the original Jedi; however they all lacked any legitimate proof.
An extremely small number of people possessed the texts that mentioned the Dai Bendu, one of those people being the Sith Lord Darth Plagueis.
After the fall of Aurum, and the destruction of Tython’s biosphere, the Dai Bendu had remained on Ando Prime even after the departure of Tho Yor.
Between the years 3,643 and 3,640 BBY, Bendu Monks travelled the Galaxy’s Core Worlds and brought a Meditation Master.
Many residents of these worlds sought out the teaching of the Bendu, as their presence was rare.
They would often teach their non-confrontational beliefs, and occasionally their commercialism.

The Dai Bendu also found themselves deep in numerology, the study of numbers and their significance to occult purposes.
They had a strong tie to the number 9, believing it represented the presence of the Unifying Force.
They portrayed this with an eight spoked circle all connecting into one central disc, similar to the symbol engraved on the faces of Tho Yor.
This emblem was stolen by a Sith Emperor, who used it to signify his Sith Empire.
A millenia was required for the symbol to be reclaimed once again, renamed as the “Galactic Roundel” and adorned to Jedi Starfighters, and was used collectively by the Galactic Republic.
After the fall of the Republic, the Sith Emperor Sheev Palpatine edited the symbol by removing 2 spokes and used it to signify his Galactic Empire.

# Section 4

Dai Bendu Monks revered large cities and bustling communities, and set themselves to reside in tribal communities.
The wisest of all Bendu Monks was referred to as the High Priest.
They nestled themselves amongst tents and a pure water system, which they pumped through the Andobi Mountains.
This pure water was sacred to them, and was sometimes sold to visitors.
Those who had left for Tython built their temples with the symbols, decorations and architecture of their Tribal Monk brethren.
Their temples contained arts and monuments depicting their religious beliefs and tales from their history.
Their attire was that of long, flowing robes of simple design and the occasional walking stick to assist in the navigation of snowy terrain.
The High Priest would adone an elegant, orange or red robe with a high and pointed hood.
The Bendu Monks practiced a variety of chantings, some being eerie and haunting, others requiring deep, growling vocations.
Those who found themselves listening to these chants would be entranced and sway slowly with the rhythm of their voices.
