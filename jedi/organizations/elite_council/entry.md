# Introduction

The Elite Council was the ruling body that oversaw the Chirq Council.
Which was a criminal organization that was active on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War.
The Elite Council was made up of nine members, Markus Glider, Zuld Mar-Shayal, Braganti Hooge, Koran Lassk, Janos Zarbo, Mathazar Zayet, Rallyn Secura, Crale Forte, and Atlan Dubreas.
It was based in two bunkers that were located near the city of Doaba Guerfel.

Around 1 ABY, the Corellian Security Force began an investigation that involved the Chirq Council.
Captain Vitala Baize was able to successfully get a CorSec agent into the organization.
She assumed that the identity of the Council member was Trins Evnar.
Once the CorSec agent made it into the Doaba Guerfel, he was able to gain the identities of the nine elite councilors as well as the location of their secret headquarters.
He later attacked the First and Second Elite Council Bunkers and eliminated all nine of the councilors.
After the death of the elite councilors, the Chirq Council disbanded.
