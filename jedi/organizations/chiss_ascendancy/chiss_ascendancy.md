# Introduction
The Chiss Ascendancy is a libertarian and isolationist nation of the near-human Chiss species, located in the Unknown Regions.
It was composed of interconnected supremacists and was overseen by a hierarchy of Chiss families.
The Nine Ruling Families held the highest command, followed by the Forty Great Houses and other families with less prestige.
The history of the Ascendancy dated back thousands of years, but due to its noninterference policy, it seldom involved itself in external crises.
The Ascendancy strictly forbids preemptive strikes and mainly focuses on research and exploration.
It discovered an obscure threat in the Unknown Regions, and saw the Galactic Empire as a potential ally or target for the threat instead of itself.

# Section 1
The Chiss Ascendancy was led by the Nine Ruling Families, with the mid-level members known as the Aristocra.
These members formed the governmental ranking and bureaucracy of the Chiss, known as the Chiss Syndicure.
They held parliamentary power and jurisdiction within the Ascendancy, with their parliament derived from the ruling families.
The capital city of the Chiss Ascendancy was Csaplar, where the Assembly Cupola and Convocate Hall were located.



# Section 2
The Chiss Ascendancy’s military consisted of the Chiss Defense Force and the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet.
The Defense Force held responsibility for the defense of Chiss territory.
The Expansionary Defense Fleet was tasked with patrolling the Chaos and assessing potential threats.
Family fleets operated as planetary defense forces in regions where specific Chiss families held influence.
The Defense Hierarchy Council managed all operations of the Defense Fleet and had the authority to exile traitors.
The fleet used various starships, including shuttles and warships.
The Chiss also had Force-sensitive navigators called Ozyly-esehembo, or “sky-walkers.” They were part of a special corps that was responsible for the navigation of difficult regions in the Unknown Regions.
Sky-walkers were usually young Chiss girls with Force abilities.



# Section 3
The Chiss Ascendancy adopted an orderly approach to galactic affairs, emphasizing non-intervention, peaceful diplomacy, and strict adherence to laws prohibiting preemptive strikes.
Conquest and aggressive imperialism were disregarded, and military policy focused on defense against external threats instead of initiating conflict.
The Ascendancy maintained a rigid stance and almost never involved itself in external affairs.
When engaging with other factions, the Chiss displayed a benign approach, but exercised caution to protect the secrets of Chiss Space.
Relations with other nations in the Unknown regions were very limited.
However, the Ascendancy sometimes sent emissaries to observe large-scale wars and assess galactic geologies.
While the Chiss aided refugees, they declined requests for settlement.
The Ascendancy pursued exploration and research beyond their borders, discovering threats to the Chiss species.



# Section 4
The Chiss Ascendancy embraced a philosophy of experimentation and strict non-intervention, as they considered themselves a beacon of security, culture, and order in comparison to the chaotic Unknown Regions.
The Chiss placed a high value on education and employed a “wandering year” tradition for young individuals to explore their goals and talents.
The Chiss displayed haughtiness towards other species in the region and considered themselves superior.
Their language was Cheunh, written in Cheunh script, and they used trade languages like Minnisiat, Taarja, and Sy Bisti to communicate with outsiders.
Political and social structures revolved around family structures, with Ruling Families, Great Families and lesser families vying for influence.
Loyalty within families often impacted military decisions, regardless of protocol.
Chiss names were composed of three parts, with the core name being a combination of these parts.
The secrets of Second and Third Sights, Chiss navigators known as ozyly-esehembo, were closely monitored.
The Ascendancy did not trust humans, but did recognize their value.
While the Chiss did not maintain major relations with nearby nations, they did not view them as either allies or equals.



# Section 5
In 5100 BBY, the Chiss Great Families were united under the Stybla family.
The Ascendancy gained strength and became legendary within the Unknown Regions.
In 5019 BBY, the Chiss started exploring outside their territory and discovered an ancient superweapon by the name of Starflash.
In 4300 BBY, a war forced the Chiss to use Starflash, which inadvertently affected Csilla’s sun and made the planet uninhabitable.
This led to a secret migration of Chiss to colony planets, while Csilla’s population went underground.
Later, the Chiss participated in the Sith Wars but retreated to their borders, as they considered their investments in the wider galaxy misguided.
The Stybla family discovered a second Starflash weapon, which was kept hidden on Sposia.
The Chiss kept records of battles against the Grysk Hegemony, including some observations.
Over time, the number of ruling families decreased, and by the time of the Clone Wars, there were just Nine Ruling Families in the Ascendancy.



# Section 6
Before the Nikardun conquests, the Chiss Defense Force focused on the defense of their territory within the Ascendancy.
However, they wanted a larger mandate and stronger capabilities.
To grant their wishes, the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet was created to protect Chiss interests beyond their borders.
This led to the recruitment of a young Chiss named Kivu'raw'nuru.
The Ascendancy was initially disinterested in friendly diplomatic relations with other nations in the Chaos.
Junior Commander Thrawn proposed a movement against Lioaoin pirates, but was instructed to differentiate between “hostiles and neutrals'' instead of “hostiles and friendlies.” Later, the Ascendancy launched operations against Vagaari pirates, which were successful militarily.
However, they caused political turmoil due to the death of Syndic Mitth'ras'safis.
This displeased the Aristocra and Supreme Admiral Ja’fosk.



# Section 7
During the Nikardun conquests, the Chiss Ascendancy’s capital, Csilla, was attacked by the Paataatus.
This was orchestrated by General Yiv of the Nikardun Destiny.
However, Admiral Ar’alani launched a counterattack on the homeworld of the Paataatus.
The involvement of Senior Captain Thrawn stopped Yiv’s plans.
Thrawn sought assistance from Jedi General Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars, however, found the Republic unsuited for an alliance.
Thrawn and the other Chiss were able to outsmart the Nikardun forces and capture Yiv.
The Chiss Defense Force then started movements to eradicate the remaining Nikardun remnants.



# Section 8
After the Nikardun conquests, the Grysk, a mysterious enemy, started manipulating the internal conflicts between the Chiss families in an attempt to start a civil war within the Ascendancy.
The Grysk operative Jixtus and his agent Haplif set up plots on diverse Chiss planets, manipulating the Pommrio, Xodlax, and Erighal families into conflicts over a suspected nyix mine.
However, Senior Captains Thrawn and Lakinda stepped in, preventing all-out war and destroying the nyix mine.



# Section 9
Thrawn was tasked by the Ascendancy to explore the Outer Rim Territories and evaluate a potential alliance with the Galactic Empire against the Grysk Hegemony.
He faked exile on a planet in Wild Space to gain the Empire’s attention.
Thrawn was taken into custody and brought before Emperor Palpatine on Coruscant.
Thrawn became the Emperor’s advisor on threats in the Unknown Regions but kept Chiss territory a secret.
He was later promoted to Grand Admiral and, together with the Empire, engaged in conflicts against the Crysk Forces.
The Ascendancy and the Empire formed an uneasy alliance to fight the Grysk.
Thrawn and other Chiss helped rescue Chiss children from the Grysk and warned the Empire of the impending threat.
However, Thrawn and Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger were taken away during a rebellion on the planet of Lothal by Purrgil creatures.
