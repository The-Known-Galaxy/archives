# Introduction
The Hutt Cartel was a crime syndicate owned by a species known as the Hutt Families or Hutt Clans.
They made money by smuggling goods and by having a myriad of illegal businesses across the galaxy.
Under the era of the High Republic, the Hutt saw the dangers of peace and prosperity growing everywhere.
While during the Clone Wars they became one of the biggest and one of the most powerful crime families having a large influence in the Outer Rim territories.
Although Hutt territories were mostly in the separatist space, they sided with the Galactic Republic due to them having reign over hyperspace lanes.

# Section 1
The Hutt clan’s highest authority is the Grand Hutt Council, located on Nal Hutta.
Hutts in the Council included Jabba the Hutt and leaders of other Hutt clans.
As the Hutt Council ruled Nal Hutta, lesser-ranking Hutts who ruled the outer territories were titled “Master of the Hutt Clan”.



# Section 2
During the High Republic era, the Hutt plotted with Lord Isamer, leader of the Directorate, to reduce the influence of the Galactic Republic.
However instead of reducing the Galactic Republic’s influence, what happened instead was the Eiram–E'ronoh crisis, which brought down the Directorate.
Leaving the Hutts to be the only powerful and influential criminal family.
Years later, during the Republic era, Jabba and his fellow Hutts held presence over the podraces on Tatooine.
Then when the Separatist crisis came, the Hutts became so powerful, the Galactic Senate was warranted to check the Hutt expansion, crimes, and more.



# Section 3
During the Clone Wars, Hutt's hold over the Outer rims caused the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems to fight over it.
As the fight raged on, Hutt space was expanded towards the mid rims.
However, as the Republic forces were busy against the Separatists, the local governments in the mid rim were left unprotected against the oppression of the Hutt.
With the battle raging about, the Hutt’s gained enemies like the Black Sun and Pyke Syndicate, both considered rivals to the Hutts.
Before all of this, near the start of the war, Jabba the Hutt’s son was kidnapped by the Separatists, orchestrated by Sith Lord Dooku.
This plot was meant to be the start of the hate between the Jedi Order and the Hutt; however, Dooku’s nemesis, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano successfully returned Jabba the Hutt’s son to him.



# Section 4
At the end of the Clone Wars, the Shadow Collective’s leader Darth Maul went to Nal Hutta to convince the Grand Hutt Council to side with him.
The Council laughed at them, telling their bounty hunters to stop Maul and his company.
However, Darth Maul and his company fought back, sparking a battle, with Maul being pushed out, however, they began pushing back in after the opposing started retreating.
The Huttese speaking species would eventually lose the battle and submit to the Shadow Collective, using their income for the Collectives’ purpose; but eventually, also draw away from the Collective due to the infighting.

The Hutt clan preserved on the planet Tatooine, after the end of the Clone Wars.
The Hutt Jabba had control over the moisture farmers.
During his reign on Tatooine, he had encountered little Luke Skywalker and Jedi Master Obi-Wan or known then Ben Kenobi.
As his illicit criminal happenings continued, he entered trade wars against the InterGalactic Banking Clan.
He also hired a smuggler named Captain Han Solo who lost his cargo during a mission and was being hunted by Jabba.
However, on 0 ABY following the Battle of Yavin, the Galactic Empire began cutting into the Hutt trade.



# Section 6
In the new era, the era of the Galactic Empire, Darth Vader was sent to speak with Jabba the Hutt and was given Boba Fett to hunt down the specific Rebel pilot who destroyed the Death Star.
After this small personal mission, he began to talk to Jabba about a proposal from the Galactic Emperor, being a part of the Galactic Empire as its provider while being protected.
Jabba the Hutt accepted.
However, Jabba the Hutt would team up with the Rebels until the conflict between each other erupted once again.
Jabba the Hutt would die from the strangling of Princess Leia before the execution of Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Luke Skywalker.
With his death, the space erupted with many small battle warfares.
