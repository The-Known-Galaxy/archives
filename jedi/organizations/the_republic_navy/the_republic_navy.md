# Introduction

While it had been virtually nonexistent for the past millennium, the Republic Navy was steeped in tradition, which had carried on through the Planetary Security Forces and was preserved in the Imperial Navy.
The start of the Clone Wars not only saw these traditions brought to the forefront but also codified, and the Republic Navy grew in a matter of weeks to be as proud and strong as it had been during the wars of old.
When the Grand Army of the Republic was designed on Kamino, the Navy was generally considered a lesser concern, but nonetheless received an assortment of assault ships custom-produced for the GAR, chiefly the Acclamator-class Assault Ship.
But when the Clone Wars began the Navy quickly became vastly more important to combat the warships deployed by the Separatists.
Officers were recruited or funneled in from the PSFs, and clone gunners and naval officers eventually were supplemented by eager recruits.

On a larger scale, the Republic also received a wide variety of new ship designs.
Kuat Drive Yards’ new Star Destroyers, the first of which was named Venator-class, became the backbone of the Republic Navy, especially when new models entered production in the war’s final year.
While the Republic did not share its successor’s taste for massive dreadnaughts, it did also develop the Praetor-class Battleship and the Mandator II-class Star Dreadnought in the war’s second half, though both designs saw limited action.
The Republic Navy was organized as follows.

# Section 2

Element - A single warship, commanded by a captain - or, rarely, a Jedi Commander.

Section - Groups of warships under the command either of the most experienced captain or a Jedi Commander.
Sections had two variants: lines of three or four vessels for larger warships, like Star Destroyers, and flotillas of 6-12 vessels for frigates.
Squadron - Four sections (16-36 warships), commanded by a Commodore or Jedi General.
The component sections of a squadron were arranged in a manner so as to serve distinct roles, such as escort or carrier roles.
Battle Group - Battle groups had two variants: one with two squadrons for single engagements, and one with four for larger-scale engagements, totalling 48-72 warships.
Battle groups were commanded by Admirals or Jedi Generals.
Fleet - The largest practical unit, fleets were led by Fleet Admirals and consisted of three to six battle groups, to a total of one to three hundred warships.
Fleets were usually assigned to campaigns, and would split into smaller units for individual objectives.
Armada - Theater units similar to smaller-scale Systems Armies, Armadas contained anywhere between ten and fifty fleets depending on the key theater to which they were assigned, and numbered one to five thousand warships.
There were ten Armadas total, each assigned to a High Jedi General, though not all fleets were part of an armada.

# Section 3

Republic Navy - The Republic Navy was under the overall command of the Commander in Chief, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, and consisted of one hundred thousand total warships on average, divided into untold numbers of fleets and armadas.

       Separate from but closely affiliated with the Republic Navy was the Republic Starfighter Corps, which was equipped with all manner of starfighters for a variety of missions.

Mostly consisting of clone pilots, the starfighter corps was a powerful resource at the Republic’s disposal, though in the first months of the war it was badly underdeveloped.
The Starfighter Corps was organized as follows.
Section - The smallest unit in the RSC, the Section was commanded by a Lieutenant, and consisted of either two heavier starfighters (like the BTL-B Y-Wing or the ARC-170) or four lighter starfighters (like the V-19 Torrent or the Z-95 Headhunter).

Flight - Composed of two sections, flights were often deployed as scouting units, and were commanded by captains.
Squadron - The most common starfighter unit, squadrons consisted of three heavy flights or four light flights for a total of twelve or thirty-six starfighters.
Squadrons were led either by Majors or by Jedi Commanders; in the latter case, the commander often had a captain as second-in-command.

# Section 4

Wing - Comprised of from three to ten squadrons depending on starfighter type and mission profile, wings were led either by commanders or Jedi Generals, and represented the average warship complement per starfighter type.
Group - Consisting of two wings, groups were deployed in full only in major battles, and contained anywhere between 72 and 640 starfighters.
There were hundreds upon hundreds of groups in the RSC, and when deployed they were led either by a Senior Jedi General, an experienced commander, or an experienced Jedi General.
