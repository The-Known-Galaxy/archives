# Introduction
The Jedi Order was founded before the Republic, but since the Republic’s inception it had dedicated itself to protecting it.
When the Clone Wars broke out, then, the Order was called to serve alongside the GAR, chiefly due to the fact that the Confederacy appeared to be led by a Sith Lord.
By doing this they fell right into the trap set by the Sith, but they would not discover this until it was far too late.
           A week into the war, the Supreme Chancellor made official the Order’s involvement, giving Jedi ranks within the GAR.
Padawans would now be Jedi Commanders, Knights would be Generals, Masters would be Senior Generals, and members of the Jedi Council received the title of High General.
Some Jedi refused the call to return to Coruscant to receive a rank, and either attempted to stay out of the war or became Dark Jedi and joined the Confederacy’s Dark Acolytes.
           Those that did fight for the Republic provided a boon for the GAR, and many victories throughout the war.
Their skill with the Force, not to mention with their lightsabers, made them deadly in combat and a psychological menace to enemy commanders.
Nonetheless, many Jedi died or lost their way in battle - especially at the hands of General Grievous.
Notable Jedi who fought in the war include the following.

# Section 1
Yoda - The Grand Master of the Jedi Order, Yoda was quite possibly the most famous Jedi to ever have lived.
Nearing nine hundred years of age by the outset of the war, the old sage was generally kept far from the front lines, but Yoda still saw combat to great effect at Geonosis, Rugosa, Vjun, and Kashyyyk.
He had no GAR unit attached to him (though he did have the rank of High General), and generally operated with the Coruscant Guard in combat operations.
Yoda mostly managed Jedi affairs during the war.
He survived the conflict, and went into exile on Dagobah.
Mace Windu - Formerly the head of the Jedi Council, Mace Windu passed the title off to Yoda when the Clone Wars started to direct Jedi involvement in the conflict.
Seen as the most skilled fighter in the entire Republic, Windu took charge of Republic Systems Army Alpha and saw combat on a number of worlds, from Dantooine and Ryloth to Anaxes and Coruscant.
The 187th Legion was Windu’s personal unit, selected by him as one of the best of the best.
Windu was killed by Darth Sidious on Coruscant, shortly before the beginning of the Jedi Purge.



# Section 2
Obi-Wan Kenobi - Nicknamed “The Negotiator” by the media, Obi-Wan Kenobi was in charge of Systems Army Gamma, and with his apprentice (later comrade) Anakin Skywalker saw some of the hottest fighting of the war.
Alongside Skywalker and Clone Commander Cody he fought in hundreds of battles, chiefly with the 212th Attack Battalion, a famed division of the 7th Sky Corps.
Kenobi survived the war, and went into exile on Tatooine.
Anakin Skywalker - Considered the Chosen One of Jedi legend and championed as the Hero With No Fear by the HoloNet and Supreme Chancellor alike, Anakin Skywalker was one of the most powerful Jedi in galactic history.
Originally apprenticed to Obi-Wan Kenobi, Skywalker was made a Jedi Knight in the war’s seventh month for his actions on Praesitlyn and Vjun.
Skywalker commanded the famed 501st Legion alongside Clone Captain Rex, and fought on innumerable worlds.
He fell to the Dark Side at the end of the war, and became Darth Vader.



# Section 3
Ki-Adi-Mundi - Quiet but brilliant, Ki-Adi-Mundi was a Cerean Jedi Master who was put in charge of Systems Army Delta.
Fighting with the Galactic Marines, Ki-Adi-Mundi won the Republic several extremely bloody battles, and fought on worlds ranging from Hypori and Geonosis to Mygeeto and New Bornalex alongside Commander Bacara.
He was killed by his troops on Mygeeto.
Plo Koon - A Kel Dor Council member and expert starfighter pilot, Plo Koon led Systems Army Beta alongside Commander Wolffe.
His personal unit was nicknamed the Wolfpack, and suffered an extremely high casualty rate, with only three of its original members surviving the war.
Koon was shot down by his starfighter escort on Cato Neimoidia.
Agen Kolar - In charge of Systems Army Epsilon, Agen Kolar was an expert swordsman and stalwart commander.
Operating from Taris and fighting heavily in the Mirgoshir Campaign early in the war, Kolar was slain by Darth Sidious on Coruscant.
Kit Fisto - An eternally cheerful Nautolan, Kit Fisto led Systems Army Zeta to many victories beyond hope, and was known to his men as compassionate but deadly.
Alongside Commander Monnk he fought in and won several battles, including two on Mon Calamari.
Fisto, too, was killed by Darth Sidious on Coruscant.



# Section 4
Shaak Ti - One of the Jedi Order’s most skillful, Shaak Ti was a strong leader and veteran of many battles.
Put in charge of Systems Army Eta, Ti spent much of the war on Kamino, and participated in all three defenses of the cloning world.
Other worlds she fought on included Hypori, Brentaal IV, and Dagu.
She was a veteran of several duels with General Grievous, and survived the war.
Saesee Tiin - Considered second only to Anakin Skywalker in a starfighter cockpit, Saesee Tiin led Systems Army Theta, and maintained some of the best starfighter groups in the Republic, as well as a healthy legion of clone marines.
Tiin was cut down by Darth Sidious on Coruscant.
Even Piell - Small but deadly, Even Piell was another Jedi Council member who saw action on the front lines.
The leader of Systems Army Iota, Piell operated chiefly from Eriadu, and fought to many victories alongside native Eriaduan Captain Tarkin.
Piell was killed by Separatist-released hounds on Lola Sayu during an escape from the Citadel prison in the war’s sixteenth month.
Oppo Rancisis - Famed as a Jedi battlemaster and brilliant tactician, Rancisis was one of the Jedi Order’s best generals, and devised winning strategies for countless battles.
His skill in battle meditation allowed his clone units to follow his plan with surgical precision.
Rancisis was assassinated by Dark Acolyte Sora Bulq during the Siege of Saleucami, in the war’s final month.



# Section 5
Luminara Unduli - A narrow-minded but strong Jedi Master, Luminara Unduli and her Padawan, Barriss Offee, fought on battlefields from Geonosis to Kashyyyk over the course of the war.
Unduli’s clone counterpart was Commander Gree, an expert in the Republic’s militia model.
She was executed by clone troopers on Kashyyyk.
