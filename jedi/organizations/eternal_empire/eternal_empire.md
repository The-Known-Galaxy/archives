# Introduction

The Eternal Empire was the sovereign authority of Zakuul under the autocratic rule of its founder, Emperor Valkorion.
Formed centuries prior to the Galactic War, Valkorion united the ancient tribes of Zakuul and ushered in an era of prosperity for his subjects.
The people of Zakuul displayed steadfast loyalty to their so-called benevolent Immortal Emperor.
Ruling from the Eternal Throne, he commanded the vast Eternal Fleet which rivalled the other naval forces of the time.
Following Valkorion’s death, his children Arcann and Vaylin waged war against the Core Worlds, and later, the Alliance against Zakuul.

# Section 1

The Wild Space planet, Zakuul, was the provenance and capital of the Eternal Empire.
The capital city, called the Spire, was a sprawling metropolis with skyscrapers that peaked in atmosphere.
A symbol of splendour and Zakuul’s golden age - the city was one of Valkorion’s grand achievements.
It was home to an aristocratic society, whose inhabitants were wealthy in comparison to the rest of the galaxy.
Each citizen pursued advanced careers as well as receiving a monthly stipend of credits and resources.
The city was separated into 52 districts, each with identical living conditions.
The citizens viewed the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire as barbaric warmongers; justifying the Eternal Empire’s rapid expansion as a means to bring enlightenment to the rest of the galaxy.
The government of the Eternal Empire was headed by the High Justice, who also presided over the military.

# Section 2

The Eternal Empire was enforced by the Eternal Fleet, an autonomous armada of warships that were technologically superior to other navies of the era.
At the forefront of the fleet was the Eternal Flagship, commandeered by the most skilled crewmen of the empire.
The ground force heavily relied upon droid Skytroopers, each armed with built-in jump packs and varying weapons.
Human troops were present in smaller numbers, including an order of Force-wielders named the Knights of Zakuul.
Their philosophy dictated that no area of the Force was too weak or dangerous to be explored, and that it was only a tool to be used in the pursuit of justice.
While publicly known as the protectors of the people, the Knights existed to fanatically impose Valkorion’s will.
During the reign of Empress Vaylin, members of the Knights of Zakuul were handpicked to serve in her Horizon Guard.

# Section 3

In 3636 BBY, the twin princes Arcann and Thexan led a series of skirmishes against the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire, primarily to test the strength of their future adversaries.
Following Thexan’s death and Valkorion’s assassination in the same year, Arcann took upon the title of Eternal Emperor and appointed his sister Vaylin as the High Justice.
The new Emperor of Zakuul launched an open war against the wider galaxy, using the full might of the Eternal Fleet.
Within a year, Zakuul emerged victorious, imposing heavy sanctions and ordering its adversaries to pay tribute.
Star Fortresses were positioned over numerous worlds to quell rebellions and ensure tribute was paid.
At some point during Arcann’s reign, a number of Zakuulans spoke against his cruel means and were consequently exiled to the Endless Swamp.

# Section 4

Five years into Arcann’s rule, an imprisoned individual known as the Outlander had escaped from Zakuul with the help of other dissidents.
Arcann’s pursuit led him to the Asylum shadowport and the outcome of the ensuing battle proved that the Eternal Empire was not invincible.
In the aftermath, the Alliance against Zakuul was formed on Odessen and sought to free the galaxy from the Eternal Empire’s oppression.
Numerous operations were carried out, including the destruction of the Star Fortresses.
With the expanding roster of Alliance members, the Outlander challenged Zakuulan sovereignty in the galaxy and this enraged both Arcann and Vaylin.
Upon discovering the location of the Alliance base, Arcann ordered his detachment of the Eternal Fleet to attack Odessen.
Following his defeat in a space battle, Vaylin succeeded him to the Eternal Throne.
Her ruthless nature far surpassed the cruelty shown by both her predecessors, leading to growing discontent among the Zakuulan people.
Eventually, Vaylin led her own assault on Odessen and managed to land a ground force numbering in the thousands.
The battle was far more catastrophic to the Alliance than the first, however Vaylin’s invasion force surrendered after her death in a confrontation with the Outlander.
Without an heir to the Eternal Throne, the Outlander gained control of the Eternal Empire and had merged it with their resistance organisation to create the Eternal Alliance.
