# Introduction

Scions of Zakuul were a subdivision of the Knights of Zakuul- an elite, military force of the Eternal Empire focused on law enforcement and protection of the Zakuulan citizens.
In contrast to other divisions of the Knights, the Horizon Guard, and the Exarchs, the Scions’ main attribute was their unique talent to channel the Force power into powerful visions, which allowed them to view and potentially predict the future.

# Section 1

The Scions of Zakuul lived their most promising period during Emperor Valkorion’s reign.
The ruler was highly interested in their ability to see the future.
He would often assign his Scions to work along with the Eternal Fleet to coordinate its movements and protect it against attacks before they would take place.
After the assassination of Valkorion, which began the great war between Zakuul and the Eternal Alliance, the Scions have been persecuted and actively hunted down by Valkorion’s son- Arcann- who assumed the role of a new Emperor after his father’s death.
Arcann feared the Scions and attempted to destroy them before the Outlander, the leader of the rebellion against Zakuul, could find and recruit them to his side.
Heskal, the leading Scion at that time, revealed that the spirit of Valkorion was alive inside the Outlander’s body and helped him destroy Arcann.
After the war, the Scions’ fanatic remains joined the Emperor’s Hand in their quest to resurrect the Emperor and supported their search for Tenebrae’s physical body.

# Section 2

The Scions were fanatically devoted to the idea of destiny, believing that everybody had a detailed purpose to fulfill in their life; one that could be uncovered thanks to the Scions’ unique Force techniques.
This fanaticism was shown quite well during the meeting between the mentioned Outlander and Heskal, who had summoned Arcann, despite his known hatred for the Scions, to the meeting’s location to assure his visions’ accuracy.
Similarly to the Knights of Zakuul, Scions did not distinguish the Dark and Light sides of the Force and rather drew their power from the presence of the Emperor himself.
This allowed them to become a threat to the Jedi and the Sith, even though most Scions would rarely engage in physical combat, observing the battle from a safe distance instead.
