# Introduction
The Antarian Rangers were made up of just over a thousand members of various species who volunteered to join the organization.
It wasn't uncommon for people who had failed to become Jedi to join the Rangers.
They completed a full ranger "scout" training and were then assigned to a specific sector or Jedi.
Some Jedi choose to work with Rangers, where the Jedi are assigned an individual or an entire team of Rangers with whom they were generally familiar.
A Jedi ran the same rangers or inquiries repeatedly.
Despite their sometimes heavy armament, the public had a positive image of the Rangers, if they were even noticed.
They were as committed to peace as the Jedi, with the difference that they had no "secrets".
They were powers and operated independently.
There was no uniform for the Rangers.
Instead, they often wore the typical brown leather jacket of the sector's Defense Forces, which they wore off duty.
There were five different ranks in this organization, which were; Explorer, people who are in the training phase.
Lieutenant, which is an honorary title but without any other benefits.
Ranger, individuals who have completed their training and are now a full member.
Ranger Captain, Rangers who are ready to be leaders of a troop.
Ranger-General, were the leaders of the entire organization.

# Section 1
About 600 years before the Clone Wars, the Rangers were founded by Coruscanti Jedi Knight Marus Timpel and the former student and businessman Gotal Kaskutal.
Timpel told his friend Gotal that he was frustrated with the Jedi Order's lack of resources, and Kaskutal offered to use funds and his own resources to create an organization to help the Jedi.
From this idea, the Antarian Rangers were born.
Under Kaskutal's supervision, the Rangers spread to other parts of the galaxy for the next 50 years, establishing divisions for Corellia, Brentaal, the Ruan Star Systems, and Coruscant.
The organization soon consisted mostly of people because many core worlds supported it, but non-people in leadership positions were not uncommon.
Financially, the Rangers flourished and were almost successful.
In wars, the Rangers were less in demand than before or after, leaving many of their divisions inactive, mercenaries or sector defense forces.
At the beginning of 22nd VSY, a separatist group called Roshu Sune massacred the Antarian Rangers on Antar IV.
The group had infiltrated the organization and was waiting for an attack.
After Roshu Sune declared independence from the moon, rangers from across the galaxy, with the help of the Jedi, returned to their headquarters to seek revenge for the attack.
When the Clone Wars began abruptly, the Jedi Order, as an Order itself, enlisted the help of the Antarctic Rangers.
They weren't prepared for war.
At the time, teams of Jedi and Rangers were seen together more often.
Several rangers operated alongside Jedi General Rahm Kota and his militia to carry out major attacks.
Seven and a half months after the war, Dooku captured Antar IV for the Confederation of Independent Systems, bombed the moon from orbit to decimate the Rangers, and established a base there himself.
After the establishment of the Galactic Empire and the execution of Order 66, the Antarian Rangers were on the wanted list of the Empire.
Almost all of the Rangers went into hiding.
From then on, they held back or organized underground resistance groups.
That way, they also made sure that the surviving Jedi were brought to safety.
Squad 40, a unit of Imperial commandos within the 501st Stormtrooper Legion, was targeted by Jilam Kester, which Celen intelligence agencies reported.
The brigade and police surrounded the house where he was supposed to be hiding.
IC-1309 and IC-1136 blew the front door off its hinges, while Ennen and Bry entered from behind.
They secured the attic and also the rooms in the basement until there was only one room left.
Jedi General Iri Camas.
The Jedi confronted the commandos and killed Bry with his lightsaber.
IC-1136 then detonated a gas line and burned the Jedi.
Around 19 VSY, a group of rangers hid in Toprawa, from where they reorganized and supported the Whip resistance group and the Jedi Jax Pavan, which were later allegedly destroyed by the Empire.
New Jedi Order, some experienced rangers tried to revive their organization.
However, this only with moderate success.
The group only had between 50 and 60 members and fought against the Yuuzhan Vong, among others.
