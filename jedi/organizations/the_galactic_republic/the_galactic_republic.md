# Introduction
The Galactic Republic, also known as the Republic, the High Republic, and the Old Republic, was a democratic union comprising thousands of worlds spread across the galaxy.
The Galactic Constitution was the supreme law of the Republic, which was governed by a legislative body of senators, and the Main head of state The Chancellor

It was the Senate's prerogative to elect a Supreme Chancellor from among their ranks to serve as the government's leader.
Coruscant, an ecumenopolis referred to as Galactic City, was the capital world of the Republic, and therefore, the seat of the Senate.

the Republic governed the galaxy from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim Territories, uniting various sentient species, human and alien alike, under one banner.
As its power grew, the Republic engaged in various wars with the Mandalorians, the Zygerrian Slave Empire, and several Sith Empires.
The Jedi Order, a religious order adhering to the light side of the Force, supported the Republic against its enemies.


The original Galactic Republic was formed in approximately 25,000 BBY and rose to power by expanding across the galaxy, with several of its founding members being the planets Alderaan and Chandrila.
Around 20,000 years prior to the Imperial Era, the Thisspiasian Blood Court joined the Galactic Republic in its early founding.

# Section 1
Multiple versions of the Republic existed throughout its extensive history; historians referred to this pre-modern period as the "Old Republic," although the government's official name was the Galactic Republic.


Towards the start of the Separatist Crisis, the Galactic Senate passed the Military Creation, which led to the creation of the Grand Army of the Republic and the Republic Navy.
Outfitted with armor weapons and gear,[ clone troopers were the backbone of the Republic Military.
Bred for loyalty and combat, clones symbolized the future of galactic warfare at the time of the Clone Wars, the conflict that derived its name from their ranks.
The training that they experienced molded the clone troopers into a highly efficient army, and because they retained the ability to think creatively despite their stunted independence, they were considered far superior to their droid counterparts.
In their first battle against the Separatist Droid Army, the Grand Army displayed a level of military strength unseen in the history of the galaxy.
