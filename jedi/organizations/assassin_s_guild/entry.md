# Introduction

The assassinâ€™s guild was a group of paid bounty hunters, assassins, and anything relating to a payment.
The galaxy knew about the Elite Circle, the higher-ups of the Guild, and was voted in by their peers.
It is seen that imperials have teamed up with the Guild for mutual benefits as seen in the Battle of Archais fighting 3 rebel units.
The guild had 4 ranks Journeyman, Apprentice, Elite Circle, And Doyen.
