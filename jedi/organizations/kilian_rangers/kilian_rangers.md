# Introduction
The Kilian Rangers are an assembly of Force Adepts residing in the planet Kilia IV within the Unknown Regions.
It’s known that they are descendants of colonists that had settled on the planet before 1000 BY.
For a long period of time, the Kilian Rangers would be isolated from the rest of the galaxy, keeping to themselves within Kilia IV until the Galactic Empire era.
The organization mostly lived a life of servitude, mainly acting as attendants of the higher-class people of the planet as well as serving the general public as protectors.

They took in Force-sensitive children to train them to integrate into the organization as Squires once they reached puberty.
These Squires would later on become disciples of Kilian Rangers.
The highest rank of the Kilian Rangers would be the Kilian Lords- who have power parallel to Jedi Masters.
 Among the Kilian Lords was their leader, Lord Gajakur Biul.
The Kilian Rangers would undergo a smooth procession of lawful and noble members- until a rift happened within the Kilian Rangers.
This would lead to the rise of Renegades, Kilian Rangers that had become aligned with the dark side of the Force.



# Section 2
The Kilian Rangers made use of ancient weaponry such as shield gauntlets and Siang lances during their training.
The Kilian Rangers made use of these weapons in combat by applying the Force within their fighting styles.
An example of this would be how they permeate their Siang lances with the Force.
Their shield gauntlet was also used as a defense mechanism by deflecting and redirecting energy attacks, similar to a lightsaber.
