# Introduction

During the Galactic Civil War, a foundation was created to teach different species critical survival skills.
The Galactic Outdoor Survival School, otherwise known as GOSS was founded on Thrantin.
Throntin was a planet in the Colonies region of space that was terraformed to fit the school’s needs of having different types of environments for different survival situations.

# Section 1

The Galactic Outdoor Survival School is a school dedicated to the cause of survival, whilst not having any official backing from the Galactic Empire or Rebel Alliance.
This didn’t have any impact on the quality of the school.
GOSS has trained some of the best survivalists outside of military institutions, even surpassing those with different cases.
One class, Summit Class, had surpassed every other class GOSS had, breaking many records.
A class even broke Summit’s own records, the Twilight Class.
One of these students was offered a position by GOSS as an instructor, who refused to follow his fellow classmates and joined the Rebellion.
Many students had become scouts for both sides of the conflict during the Galactic Civil War, with few cases going into the private sector and ignoring the war, despite the dislike of the Rebellion from the school's dean and headmaster.

# Section 2

Survival skills that students trained depended on the person’s origin.
Especially when it came to physiology of different species, such as Devaronians who’s home world is the temperate planet of Devaron.
GOSS may train a Devaronian in a more extreme climate such as a dry desert or frozen tundras.
Another example is a Mon Calamari would learn to survive in more arid areas, as they are from an ocean planet.
