# Introduction

When the Clone Wars broke out, Jedi Master Rahm Kota refused to have anything to do with the Grand Army of the Republic because he did not trust the Clone Wars and formed his own combat unit, which he recruited from the planetary militias, mercenaries and abandoned separatists.
So when Order 66 was given there were no clones on him to kill him.
After the republic was transformed into an empire, Kota and his militia repeatedly attacked imperial targets.
Their last known confrontation took place at the TIE fighter aircraft manufacturing facility in Nar Shaddaa.

# Section 1

The militia saboteurs formed the backbone of the Kota militia.
His equipment consisted of a blaster rifle and frag grenades.
They were moderately trained and used in small groups to attack quickly and then disappear.
The militia forces were some of Kota's most loyal soldiers, trained by him in the use of stun batons.
It was too dangerous to fire blaster weapons at enemies in their area of ??operation.
They usually overran their opponents, but often suffered heavy losses in the process.
The elite of the militia were selected from among the most capable soldiers, armed with a heavy, repetitive blaster, providing cover fire to their comrades or securing important key positions.
The heavy militia troops were armed with rocket launchers and were often there to "open" doors but carried no other weapons, which made them relatively inefficient.
