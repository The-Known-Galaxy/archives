# Introduction

Car’das is a smuggling organization lead by the one and only, Jorj Car’das.
They were a small band of criminals comparable to Black Sun, however, their impact became big upon the galaxy.
They were working in small cells that operated in particular sectors and places throughout planets and planets leading to major control over smuggling in the galaxy.
Every cell was operating individually and from time to time, they will report to Jorj the results of the crimes made.
Car’das used freighters, M3-Scyk, and G1-M4-C Dunelizard fighters.
With these ships, they carried the goods and transported them to their hideouts.
The members of this organization contained high-skilled mechanics and pilots, although slicers and hired blasters, even if the band wasn’t aiming to be violent.
Sometimes, members got kicked for non-intelligent actions.
For example, killing a civilian for no reason and draw all the attention to this murder.

Before the Clone Wars, Jorj Car’das had full control over a smuggling ring, which gained him later on more reputation through the Outer Rim.
And all of a sudden, Jorj disappeared before the war ended.
After several months, he returned as a changed man.
Surprisingly he obtained useful abilities, such as his new insights and intuition.
With his new skills and reputation, he started expanding his empire into the Outer Rim.
Car’das became a big smuggling organization since then.
They had access to private shadow spaceports, which made their “legal” side of the business flow, till the authorities changed their targets.
As their organization kept getting bigger and gained more profitable merchandise, they became a threat to the Black Sun and Hutt clans.
They ended up harming Jorj’s group of smugglers.
Around 0 ABY, Car’das disappeared again and the organization was taken over by Talon Karrde.
Car’das started serving Tansarii Point Station as law enforcers around ABY 1.
In the end, they managed to defeat Black Sun with the help of Star-hoppers at the Battle of Tansarii Point Station.
