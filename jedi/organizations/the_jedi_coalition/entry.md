# Introduction

The Jedi Coalition was a loosely organized group of various factions brought together after the rise of Darth Caedus and his assumption of the role of Chief of State of the Galactic Alliance.
Luke Skywalker firmly believed that the rise of a new Sith to power would only serve to recreate the events of the Galactic Empire that he and many of his closest allies had fought to overthrow.
As such, Luke Skywalker along with his Jedi Order would declare independence from the Galactic Alliance and as a result would be declared traitors and much like during the reign of Darth Sidious, would find themselves in hiding once more.

# Section 1

When Darth Caedus had arisen to power and gained control over the Galactic Alliance it was clear to much of the galaxy that history was about to repeat itself.
Luke Skywalker and the New Jedi Order declared independence and rallied numerous factions and planets to their cause, most notably the Alliance-in-Exile who were mostly driven by the veterans who had fought in the first Galactic Civil War and the Mandalorians under the command of Boba Fett, who had all fought alongside Luke Skywalker and his Jedi in the Yuuzhan Vong war.
The Jedi Coalition would establish their capital on Fondor, an important industrial world that had supplied large amounts of weapons and ships to the Republic, Galactic Empire, New Republic and later the Galactic Alliance.
This would grant the Jedi Coalition access to many resources deemed critical to the war effort.
United, these various factions were strong enough to create one of the largest galaxy-spanning governments of the era, though despite this it would still prove to be a daunting task to remove Darth Caedus from power and insure that the Galactic Alliance could be restored.
Officially established in 40 ABY, Darth Caedus immediately entered a state of war with the faction and declared the Jedi Coalition a united front of terrorists, traitors and renegades.

# Section 2

Luke Skywalker and the New Jedi Order did not initially declare independence upon Darth Caedus’ rise to power, the reasoning behind this being rather controversial.
Darth Caedus assumed power legally with the backing of the Galactic Alliance’s government and military and sought to continue the war against the Confederation, which the Jedi themselves agreed was necessary.
This would change after further reflection by the Jedi Order who believed having a Sith Lord back in power would prove to be a huge threat to galactic stability.

# Section 3

The Battle of Kuat would be one of the most strategically important battles between the Galactic Alliance and Confederation for control of the Kuat Shipyards which would provide whoever was victorious the means to create large warships as well as provide numerous hyperspace routes to various core worlds, including Coruscant.
During the early days of the war Darth Caedus believed he had the support of the Jedi Order and was awaiting the arrival of Jedi Naval assets and the Hapan Home Fleet so that he could win the battle.
The battle would turn against Darth Caedus after Luke Skywalker would confront Caedus over the death of his wife, Mara Jade Skywalker and the military occupation of Ossus, which served as a great Jedi Library and Academy for Luke’s Jedi Order.
Furious at Darth Caedus, Luke Skywalker would order the Jedi Order to cease all support to the Galactic Alliance and retire from the conflict over Kuat in order to establish the Jedi Coalition.
The Battle of Kuat would come to an end when Darth Caedus was informed that both the Confederation and Jedi Coalition would seek the aid of the Wookiee Navy and were both intending on pleading their case for aid to the Rook Council on Kashyyyk, Darth Caedus, despite suffering heavy losses, would relocate much of his Naval assets to Kashyyyk in order to attack the Jedi forces and Confederation, with the purpose of forcing the Confederation to retreat from Kuat, this strategy worked and the battle would be won by the Galactic Alliance.

# Section 4

By the time Luke Skywalker and his Jedi Council had arrived on Kashyyyk, Darth Caedus was already mobilizing his Fifth Fleet to relocate to the planet.
Darth Caedus did give the Rook Council the opportunity to hand over the Jedi Council as by this stage they were declared traitors and criminals, but Darth Caedus knew they would not do this as a result of Kashyyyk’s great respect for the Jedi Order and Luke Skywalker.
Lowbacca, head of state for the Wookiee government would lie to Darth Caedus in an effort to hide the Jedi Council’s presence on Kashyyyk, Darth Caedus would see this as political justification to attack the planet and in typical Sith fashion, commenced an orbital bombardment of Kashyyyk’s civilian population centres and critical military garrisons.
The Wookiee fleet, while massive and something to be feared, was not yet mobilized or prepared for the invasion carried out by Darth Caedus’ Fifth Fleet.
This left the Wookiees vulnerable and forced the Confederation to abandon their campaign against the Core Worlds in order to aid the Wookiees.
The Jedi present on Kashyyyk would rush to their own fighters and along with as many Wookiee squadrons that could be mobilized, they would launch an attack against Darth Caedus’ Fifth Fleet.
Upon commencement of the bombardment of Kashyyyk, Ben Skywalker, who was still on Darth Caedus’ flagship after the Battle of Kuat would attack Darth Caedus but would swiftly be subdued and placed inside a Yuuzhan Vong torture device known as the ‘Embrace of Pain’.
Luke Skywalker, while leading the defence of Kashyyyk would be shot down and forcibly crashland into Darth Caedus’ Flagship, the ‘Anakin Solo’ in an effort to confront Darth Caedus directly.
Luke Skywalker would sabotage various weapon systems on the ‘Anakin Solo’ and be successful in confronting Darth Caedus.
During their duel Ben Skywalker would free himself and stab Darth Caedus, however Luke Skywalker believed allowing his son Ben to kill Caedus would potentially push him towards the Dark Side, and instead the pair would flee.

# Section 5

Unbeknownst to Darth Caedus, during his assault on Kashyyyk, Han and Leia Organa Solo were on the planet and escaped in order to open negotiations with Tenel Ka Djo, the secret lover of Darth Caedus, Jedi Knight and leader of the Hapes Consortium, who had provided a sizable fleet to Darth Caedus.
Han and Leia were able to convince the Hapes Consortium along with the Rook Council to side with the Jedi Order in the effort to remove Darth Caedus from power.
They agreed that they will form somewhat of a truce with the Confederation, agreeing to allow them to continue their own plans to remove Darth Caedus from power and to wage war against him, seeing it as strategically beneficial.

# Section 6

In an effort to end what had now become known as the Second Galactic Civil War, Luke Skywalker and his allies put together a plan to capture or if necessary kill Darth Caedus.
The plan would entail a strike team commanded by Kyle Katarn being deployed to Coruscant, tracking Darth Caedus down and capturing him outside of Coruscant’s Senate building.
Luke Skywalker elected not to go personally as he feared his anger towards Darth Caedus may jeopardize the mission or result in him falling to the dark side.
There was a secondary objective for the ambush which ended up being the only objective that the strike team were able to achieve; plant a tracking device on Darth Caedus’ cloak in an effort to track his personal movements.
This part was a success, but the strike team were not aware that Darth Caedus had since become the Dark Lord of the Sith which had increased his personal power greatly, he was able to cut the head off of Mithric, a member of the strike team and stab Kyle Katarn through the chest, wounding him greatly.
The team were forced to retreat and had to escape Coruscant.

# Section 7

After the failed attempt to kill or capture Darth Caedus, it came to light that the daughter of Tenel Ka Djo, Allana, was being kept prisoner by Darth Caedus as a hostage to ensure that the Hapes Consortium remained in the conflict, Luke Skywalker believed that freeing this girl would allow Tenel Ka Djo to provide larger forces to the Jedi Coalition and focus their efforts without the risk of losing Allana.
It was also deemed crucial that the ancient superweapon known as Centerpoint station be destroyed, as in the hands of Darth Caedus the risks this weapon posed would be too great.
The Jedi Coalition sought out to conduct two strikes, one would be an infiltration into ‘Anakin Solo’ to free Allana.
The other would be a sabotage mission into Centerpoint station to sabotage and destroy it.
Fortunately this time around the Jedi Coalition was successful.
Under the guise of Doctor Seyah, Centerpoint station would be destroyed, eliminating perhaps the strongest weapon Darth Caedus possessed.
And under the guise of Luke Skywalker, Allana would be freed from Darth Caedus, allowing the Hapans to dedicate larger amounts of resources to the war effort.
Despite these victories the Galactic Alliance under Darth Caedus was still the largest fighting force in the galaxy.
As a result of their infiltration onto ‘Anakin Solo’, Darth Caedus would grow infuriated and kill a Naval Officer, this sparked much controversy and discussion amongst the Galactic Alliance Navy that would result in many individuals defecting to the Jedi Coalition.
As well as this, some notable Galactic Alliance Naval Officers began leaking Darth Caedus’ war strategies to Luke Skywalker and it became apparent that Darth Caedus was planning to invade Fondor, an independent industrial world that was notable for its ability to provide large amounts of resources to various historical factions during wartime.

# Section 8

Luke Skywalker on behalf of the Jedi Coalition would warn Fonder about the coming invasion and provide some strategic advice on how to prepare.
The Jedi did not directly take part in the conflict however, instead opting to provide defense to civilians on the various orbital mining platforms and mining barracks while the Fondorian Navy would carry out the battle.
Darth Caedus, now reinforced with the might of the Imperial Remnant would begin the Naval battle but to his surprise his fleets would be ambushed by the Fondorian Navy.
Despite the well conducted ambush Fondor was not ready to take on the Galactic Alliance and Imperial Navy and swiftly surrendered.
Darth Caedus’ next action would be the turning point in the war and mark the swift victory for the Jedi Coalition.
He would proceed to conduct an orbital bombardment of Fondor’s surface despite surrendering, this encouraged over two thirds of the Galactic Alliance Navy to defect to the Jedi Coalition and turn on Darth Caedus, dubbing themselves the Alliance-In-Exile.
Darth Caedus would be forced to retreat and the Jedi Coalition would then utilize Fondor as its capital.
While using Fondor the Jedi Coalition would gain the support of the Maw Irregular Fleet, the Mandalorian armada under the command of Mand’alor Boba Fett and numerous fleets from the Galactic Alliance Navy.
Despite this large amassing of forces, the war would be cut short when Jaina Solo, having been personally trained to kill Jedi by Boba Fett for this particular purpose, would set out to kill Darth Caedus.
She would prove successful in doing so and as a result, the Second Galactic Civil War would come to an end.
All factions involved would return to their original state, the Jedi Coalition would be disbanded as the New Jedi Order returned to the Galactic Alliance and a state of relative peace would return to the galaxy once more.

# Section 9

The structure of the Jedi Coalition loosely mimicked that of the Galactic Alliance but the organisation itself was not designed to be permanent and as such did not spend much time establishing dedicated government and military roles, as it was a rough band of various factions that only existed for a year.
