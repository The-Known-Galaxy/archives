# Introduction
The Service-Corps of the Republic was a division within the Jedi Order that had several branches within it.
It was an organisation keen on helping the Republic and its citizens.
The Council of Reassignment sent all the willing Initiates who never passed their Initiation Trials.
This consisted of growing and tending to crops, as well as protecting settlements from danger, starvation, and disease.
They manipulated the Force to increase the speed of the crop’s growth, and they also used the Force to heal injured and sick citizens.
It was usually overseen by a Jedi Master, and they were the overseers of the project.
It was extremely popular during the Clone Wars.
As the Jedi were rushed to do their Knight Trials as they needed more Jedi on the battlefield, making slower-paced learners incredibly vulnerable for being picked.
They needed as many Initiates as possible during the Clone Wars, due to the worlds being invaded and plundered by Separatist forces.

Some of these Jedi were incredibly unsatisfied with their rank, as they were all inspired to become the Jedi Knight of their dreams.
This made them feel unheard and made them feel they had little importance, which made them try their best to impress the overseer in trying to get a ship back to Coruscant for further training.
However, they were a vital part of the Republic and were needed, which made some carry on with a happy heart.
They knew they were being the needed members of the Jedi Order that were sought out and appreciated.
Some of them got a second chance at becoming a Knight due to developing skills that they trained rigorously as their last chance to be accepted back into the Jedi Order.
The Service-Corps was a respected organisation, caring for the citizens of the Republic, and not devoted to fighting.
