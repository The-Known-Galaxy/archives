# Introduction
The Lok Revenants was an organization led by Nym and was filled with pirates throughout the galaxy.
They would operate mostly in the Karthakk System or Lok, a planet within the same system.
Mostly being active before, during and after the Clone Wars, they would get the name “Lok Revenants' ' for their exile from the planet and their deeds while there.
The Revenants’ loyalty to their leader was so large, they would aid him on all his raids against his rivals, the Trade Federation.
The gang would defend Nym’s stronghold on Lok from a powerful invasion but still regrouped and continued their fight when overwhelmed with so much power getting pushed upon them.
For the next 10 years afterwards, the Lok Revenants would start a war against the Federation for their doings and the “corruption” they had spread.
It was so bad, Jedi Master Adi Gallia would need to interfere for their side to begin to turn.
The faction had also been joined by others such as Sol Sixxa and the Mere Resistance.
Together, they would decide to launch an assault upon Nod Kartha’s most defended factory to make them fear them.
In more events, they would attend the battle that took place above Geonosis.
Their objective was to defeat Cavik Toth and his fleet, being successful.
The Revenants would later regain their base back on Lok and Nym would stay in contact with the Jedi Master for if any of them needed assistance.
