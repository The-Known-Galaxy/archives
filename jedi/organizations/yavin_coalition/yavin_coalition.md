# Introduction

The Yavin Coalition was a joint task force of Republic and Imperial forces during the Battle of Rishi in 3637 BBY.
Founded by Jedi Grandmaster Satele Shan and Sith Dark Council member Darth Marr, its purpose was to stop Revan and his plans to bring back Sith Emperor Vitiate.

# Section 1

Although Revan aimed to bring Vitiate into a physical form on Yavin 4 so that he could be killed, there was a risk that he would end up consuming all life in the galaxy.
To ensure his success, a trap was set for the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.
The Revanites had hired the Nova Blades pirates to attack shipping lanes, rerouting hyperspace routes, resulting in the Republic and Imperial fleets meeting above Rishi, where they engaged in battle.
A signal jammer was placed on the planet’s surface, preventing contact between the fleets, and saboteurs were placed on the ships to disable the systems.
Once the two fleets had destroyed each other, Revan’s ships would finish off any survivors.
Before the trap had succeeded, the jamming device was disabled, and the two fleets were informed of the plot and given the list of saboteurs.
The two leaders ordered a ceasefire, and met in the neutral location of Raiders’ Cove on the surface below.

# Section 2

Darth Marr and Grandmaster Shan used their remaining forces to form the Coalition, and travelled to Yavin 4 to halt Revan’s plans.
They set up a Command Post near to the Revanites’ position, and set up a series of sensor beacons around the perimeter so that they could monitor their movements.
The Republic and Imperial forces had trouble trusting each other, and were reluctant to work together.
The Coalition learned that the Revanites had taken over an Imperial Guard Academy.
After a short battle, Coalition forces recovered Imperial Guard Commandant Iven, who revealed to them that Revan was using the Temple of Sacrifice as a base, and was going to use an artefact to bring Vitiate back from the dead, the cost of which being the killing of all life on the moon, except those inside the Temple.
Satele Shan and Darth Marr detected a light side presence on the moon, this turned out to be the Force ghost of Revan.
After the Battle of the Foundry, Revan was split into two halves, his light side (which became a Force ghost), and his dark side (which became his physical form).
His light side was capable of becoming one with the Force, but only when joined with its dark side counterpart.
A strike team of eight of the best from across the Republic and the Empire attacked the Revanites and the Temple.
Revan, his ritual halted and the artefact destroyed, fled to a nearby sanctuary.
Coalition leadership engaged in combat with him.
Defeated, his light side convinced him to merge with his dark half  and become one with the Force.
However, all the death caused by the fighting was enough to bring Vitiate back to life, and his disembodied spirit left the moon.

# Section 3

Despite their victory, Vitiate posed a threat to the galaxy.
Despite the ongoing conflict between the Republic and the Empire, concluded that they would dissolve the Coalition, but renew it at the next sight of Vitiate.
When he reemerged on the Sith world of Ziost, performing his ritual killing all life on the planet, in 3636 BBY, Darth Marr led a strike team to pursue him into Wild Space, joined by many veterans of the Coalition.
They came across the Eternal Empire of Zakuul, and were destroyed with few survivors.
Marr was taken captive and executed by his former Emperor.
Later, in 3631 BBY, the Eternal Alliance, based off of the Coalition and founded by former members, would be created to fight against the Eternal Empire.
