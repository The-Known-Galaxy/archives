# Introduction

The Baran Do was an ancient Force organization that resided on the planet, Dorin.
Most Kel Dors would say it was a tradition instead, as it was developed more than a thousand years ago before they joined the Republic.
Their recruitment was often provided by Kel Dor families, who would send their children to train with them.
Members that were part of this sect were usually referred to as sages, often acting as advisors and seers to the leaders of the planet's society.

The Sages were renowned for their precognition skills, allowing them to launch early evacuation in the case of natural disasters on their planet.
Often, Baran Do sages would take up government positions due to it.

# Section 1

The philosophy of the Baran Do sages was centered around finding peace and calm, and they should grow closer to the Force by heeding it.
While they would often spend a great deal of time in meditation due to it, many people saw this as a reluctance to act instead.
However, in truth, they were waiting for the precise and perfect moment to strike and act in accordance with the Force, as they were against rash actions.

Unlike the Jedi Order, the Baran Do were not that militant at all.
They did not wield lightsabers and such, nor were they required to be trained as they were skilled in the Force.
But they did have an option of training with a simple wooden staff if they were to deem it necessary.
