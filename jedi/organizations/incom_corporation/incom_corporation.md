# Introduction
Incom Corporation was an organization known for manufacturing starships for the galaxy.
Their designs would include starfighters and transports.
Within the High Republic Era, they would begin to gain more influence and interest as they created ships such as the Z-24 Buzzbug and Z-28 Skywing.
Incom would grow prominence more and more until the end years of the Galactic Republic due to their creation of the Z-95 Headhunter, a starfighter which was very durable and had multiple purposes.
As the Clone Wars became more of a danger, it would produce many varieties and styles of the Headhunter so it could provide use for the Republic Navy and many other divisions.
During the time of the Galactic Empire, the corporation would develop snowspeeders for the Rebel Alliance so travel and battles would be easier on Hoth.
An example of one of these ships was the T-47 airspeeder.
However, Incom had a better notable product called the T-65B X-wing starfighter and was used at the service of the Rebel Alliance.
They would create it based on the Clone Wars era ships.
The T-65B was for the Rebel Alliance organization only and was fielded by them also throughout the Galactic Civil War against the Empire.
As the Galactic Empire would lose its power and the First Order would later rise, Incom Corporation would decide to reform into Incom-FreiTek Corporation, which would produce more starships such as the T-85 X-wing fighters.
