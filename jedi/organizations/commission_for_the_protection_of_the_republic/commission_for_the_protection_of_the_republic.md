# Introduction
The Commission for the Protection of the Republic, was a major player in the last days of the Galactic Republic.
These people were huge supporters of Chancellor Palpatine and acted as his cheerleaders.
They'd hold these massive rallies chanting Palpatine's name and have protests backing all his political moves.

# Section 1
This group did everything It could to get the public on Palpatine's side.
They produced propaganda films and commercials pumping up the Chancellor as some kind of savior.
Anytime senators questioned Palpatine's policies, COMPOR would organize counter-protests and smear these politicians as enemies of the Republic.
They got pretty nasty too, harassing and threatening anyone who didn't fully support the Chancellor.
Since COMPOR acted as Palpatine's attack dogs, many saw them as the public face of the rising Galactic Empire.
They were his fanatical followers devoted to centralising power under Palpatine's rule.
