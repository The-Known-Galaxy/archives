# Introduction

The GenoHaradans were a union of bounty hunters.
In 25,130 BBY Xim the despot created this Union for his own protection.
The GenoHaradans were Ximâ€™s personal agents, but in reality, Xim used them to eliminate his enemies and rivals.
During the Xim wars, Xim was defeated at the Third Battle of Vontor, which was when everyone thought that the GenoHardans died with him.
In reality, they just disappeared from the public eye once their leader had died.
They became autonomous without no one governing them.
They were slowly becoming the most powerful and deadly assasination tool.

# Section 1

After the death of Xim, the Genohardans created a new method and divined leadership to four overseers instead of a guildmaster.
The Geohardans had their own way of assasination, basically in such a way that they could eliminate their target that no one could ever supect them of having any sort of ties with this murder.
They were very skilled and talented, and their methods of assassination proved to be of a higher skill than most assassins.
