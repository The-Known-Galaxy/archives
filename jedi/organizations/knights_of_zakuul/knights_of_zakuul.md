# Introduction
The Knights of Zakuul, colloquially known as Zakuul Knights, were an order of force sensitive warriors who served in the Eternal Empire.
They were considered as the protectors of the people, entrusted with hunting down corruption and dissidence throughout the Empire.
The Knights believed their Force ability was only a tool to maintain justice, and that the Emperor Valkorion served as a conduit for the Force.
They were commanded by the High Justice, who served as the head of government and commander in chief of the military.
The Knights of Zakuul fanatically imposed the Emperor’s will, demonstrating a deep adoration for Valkorion and his family.

# Section 1
The Knights of Zakuul sought to defend the Emperor and his sovereignty, enforcing justice across the Eternal Empire.
The Knights aspired to honor the Immortal Emperor through their actions and viewed sacrifice as the ultimate sign of commitment to their leader.
They were encouraged to explore both sides of the Force and share their findings with the rest of their order.
Their philosophy lacked the strict codes used by the Jedi and Sith, emphasising their personal relationships with the Force.
The Knights of Zakuul were highly militarized and were trained to utilize group tactics, allowing them to coordinate between other Knights, droid Skytroopers and walkers.
The Knights originated from the Force-sensitive leaders of the early Zakuulan tribes; following their unification, Valkorion assigned the tribal leaders as the first Knights of Zakuul.



# Section 2
Knights of Zakuul wielded lightsaber pikes bearing blue kyber crystals and a handheld shield for deflecting blaster fire.
They were also known to brandish standard lightsabers and double-bladed lightsabers.
The standard uniform of the Knights of Zakuul was a set of gold-coloured armour which they were trained to forge by themselves.



# Section 3
There were varying offsets of the Knights of Zakuul, each with their own specialization.
A subgroup known as the Exarchs of Zakuul were the survivors of Project Exarch’s enhancement process.
Each Exarch was faced with biological and cybernetic augmentation which was often fatal.
The Exarchs ruled a conquered planet from an orbital battle station known as a Star Fortress.
As well as being governors of a planet, the Exarchs were quasi-religious leaders who appropriated the icons of the Old Gods of Zakuul.
Another sect of Knights called the Scions of Zakuul had the ability to view the future through the Force, believing in their visions to the point of zealotry.
Emperor Arcann despised the Scions and ordered their eradication after assuming the Eternal Throne, resulting in a schism that nearly wiped them out.
The last main offset of Knights were known as the Honor Guard, who were designated as the primary guardians of the Emperor and Eternal Throne.
By the reign of Empress Vaylin, these Knights were purged and reorganized into the Horizon Guard.
