# Introduction
Besalisk's homeworld was the frozen ocean planet Ojom, which was located deep within the Deep Core.
Despite being relatively inhospitable, several space stations hung in orbit to accommodate species less accustomed to the cold.
After the Imperial Reunification in 12 ABY, the Imperial Remnant abandoned the Ojom system along with the other Deep Core systems.

# Section 1
Ojom was a frozen ocean world in the Deep Core, home to the Besalisk, a species of four-armed creatures.
As a result of the oceanic character of the planet, Besalisks created a commune upon glaciers adrift in the oceans.
 In spite of the many different communities on the planet, it had a sparse population.
In fact, there were many orbiting space stations, and their populations exceeded those of planetside communities.



# Section 2
On Ojom, the stations functioned as starports and accommodations were much more basic than on the planets.
 Ojom was discovered by the galactic community after the Ruusan Reformation of the Galactic Republic, but it did not have a standing government outside of the communal arbiters who governed each community.
Ojom was therefore unable to petition for representation in the Senate of the Galactic Republic
