# Introduction
Tython was a planet located in the galaxy's Deep Core and shrouded in myth.
Some Jedi scholars made a case for Tython as the location of the Jedi Order's first temple alongside other candidate worlds, such as Ahch-To, Coruscant, Jedha, and Ossus.
During the Galactic Civil War, Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra led Darth Vader to Tython's Meridional Ice Cap to mislead him as to the location of the Rebel Alliance's main base, which was actually on the Outer Rim planet Hoth.

# Section 1
Tython's history was shrouded in myth.
It was home to a Jedi Temple, and along with other Jedi temples on Ahch-To, Coruscant, Jedha and Ossus, the Tython Jedi temple was one of the candidates for the Jedi Order's very first temple.
During the Galactic Civil War, Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra, after discovering that the Rebel Alliance's current headquarters was located on Hoth in the Outer Rim, instead led Darth Vader to the Martyrium of Frozen Tears in the Meridional Ice Cap.



# Section 2
Tython contained an ancient Jedi temple, which may have been the Order's very first.
The Meridional Ice Cap contained the underground Martyrium of Frozen Tears, which had a Force-sensitive confessional made of solid kyberite.
The ice cap was also dotted with ancient statues of robed figures near the Martyrium's entrance.
