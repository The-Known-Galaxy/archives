# Introduction
Khomm is a place that is comfortable, peaceful, and mundane within everyday life.
Khomm is located in the Deep Core region of the Khomm system.
Khomm’s terrestrial environment is suitable for many of the galaxy's inhabitants, having a type-one in breathing with oxygen also consisting of lush plains and hills hosting the native fauna of Khommite strider.
Speaking of natives on this planet native species are called Khommites, who have their language, and population of around 500 million people, and their major cities such as Heh’l City.
The world has been a place of close perfect society for nearly a millennium.

# Section 1
During the time of 990 BBY, the Khommites had stated to the galaxy that they had created the perfect civilization.
While that statement could be said to be correct, the method in which they achieved it was seen as a bit unorthodox.
The Khomm had opted out of the usual process of creating children, deciding that the process of cloning generations to continue on was the better option.
They called the method Khomm Central Population Planning, with this not being the only thing they calculated for their future.
Everything from the infrastructure of the buildings to the animal population was either mathematically perfect or stable.
The lack of oddness resulted in everything being perfect but mundane, this symmetry and dullness of the planet were said to even make people mad from it.



# Section 2
The attack on Khomm in 12 ABY is where we would see the planet and its habitants take a hard blow.
The event would initiate due to Imperial Admiral Natasi Daala, after her discovering two Jedi had made contact with the planet, ordering for it to burn.
The Jedi were Khommite Dorsk 81 and Kyp Durron.
Dorsk 81 had caught word of what was to happen to his homeworld and tried to give warning to his people of the imminent attack, this plea was met with disregard for what was to come.
Daala had ordered Colonel Ivan Cronus and some Crimson Command ships to destroy the passive planet.
Cronus and his might of ships laid waste to the unprepared Khommites.
This blow to their society forced the species to adapt to the new environment that faces them.



# Section 3
As of now, there is no clear record of what became of the Khommites.
All there is to know is that another clone of Dorsk 81 called Dorsk 82 had come to join the Jedi Praxeum.
Leaving the future of the planet's people unwritten for now.
