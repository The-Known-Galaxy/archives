# Introduction
The Goluud system is most famous for Primis Goluud, a red supergiant that killed all life in the system due to a  supernova.
Primis Goluud was rotated by 3 planets, which each had been inhabited by life.
Now, all life itself is gone in the Goluud System, including Primis Goluud itself.
The destroyed system  was also located on the Carbonite Run, a smuggling hyperspace route set up in the deep core.It was also covered by the Deep Core Security Zone, which was established by the Imperials, following the end of the Clone Wars circa 19 BBY.

# Section 1
The Primis Goluud supernova occurred circa 5000 BBY.
This supernova occurred during the Hyperspace Wars, and was used as a weapon of mass destruction.
Primis Goluud was used during a battle between Teta, who was the Empress of the Koros System, and the Sith Lord of the Empire Naga Sadow.
During this battle, Naga Sadow used an undisclosed weapon to ignite Primis Goluud’s solar flares, which caused the star to erupt into a supernova.
This supernova caused all life in the immediate area to perish,  including all three of the inhabited planets nearby.
It is undisclosed how many lifeforms died during this tragedy, but it is most likely in the millions.
