# Introduction

The Wellspring of Life, also known as the Force planet, was one of the many light side Force power nexuses in the galaxy.
It was believed by many to be the origin of all life and was hidden from star maps.
The planet was surrounded by a shining nebula and seemed lifeless on the surface, apart from the radiant geysers that emitted internal energy.
But beneath the surface were floating islands full of plant life, and deep connections to the Force.

Being a legendary entity in the galaxy, Jedi Order members had limited knowledge of its existence during the Clone Wars.
Master Qui-Gon Jinn learned of the legend shortly before his death and began research on it.
He had identified possible locations but was killed before he was able to explore them.
However, Jinn’s spirit kept communicating through dreams to Grand Master Yoda, persuading him to continue his quest.
During the Clone Wars, Yoda went on a journey to the planet where he met the Force Priestesses.

Yoda discovered the Wellspring of Life within the heart of the galaxy, surrounded by a golden gas nebula.
Even though the planet appeared to only consist of cracked rocks, the planet’s surface was immaculate and habitable for all species.
Light geysers filled with life energy burst through the planet’s surface.

Inside the planet, a hollow expanse held floating islands that were suspended within amber clouds.
These islands were covered in distinct flora and were home to all sorts of creatures.
The creatures posed no threat to visitors, and basic needs like hunger and thirst were absent to those within the planet.
The beings were manifestations of the Living Force, inseparable from the Wellspring.
The planet was the birthplace of midi-chlorians.
The Wellspring also held the obscure secrets to immortality, which were connected to the Force Priestesses who wandered the land.
