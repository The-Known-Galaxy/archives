# Introduction
Ska Gora was a planet found within the Tython System in the Deep Core region on the Galactic Map.
Its Grid coordinates were “L-10” on the Galactic Grid Map.
It had one sun named Tythos as well as an unnamed moon.
In 36,000 BBY, Force Sensitives from the planet Tython settled in Ska Gora, constructing a Temple there.
Most inhabitants that lived on Ska Gora resided in city-ships, hovering above the landscape.
The native species, consisting of tens of thousands, were not very friendly to illegal settlers, as seen when Gharcanna, a  Wookie warlord, settled there with his tribe illegally, resulting in a battle and the native Apex trees set ablaze.
Ska Gora was a planet that was a part of the Infinite Empire, which did not affect it too much.
The planet’s terrain was that of swampy, low-lying wetlands.
Strong gusts of wind would occasionally be created, stirring the jungles.
The Je’daii Daegen Lok had a Force vision in which a Darkside army, wielding Forcesabers marched across the burning terrain of Ska Gora, and the city-ships fell from the sky.
Luckily, that Force vision never materialized, and Ska Gora continued to prosper for centuries.
