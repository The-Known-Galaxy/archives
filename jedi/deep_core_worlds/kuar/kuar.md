# Introduction

Kuar was a planet that orbited one single star and was the fifth planet that was located inside of the Kuar system.
This significant planet was very rocky but in some locations flat and had some dusty plains.
The Kuarans, who were the native of the planet, built villages, towns, and other habitable locations throughout the planet, however, the twist was it was mostly located underground.
The Koros Trunk Line that was located between Empress Teta and the Foerost is what it was laid on.
The Native faunas include being six-legged, very good at combat, and were yellow reptiles.

During 4002BBY the Mandalorians had captured the planet of Kuar and destroyed the native species known as Kuarans.
They used the bases built by the Kuarans as places to hide out before they attacked the Empress Teta Systems.
Lots of people wanted all of the conflict to be resolved, so Ulic Qel-Droma decided to challenge the significant Mandalorian leader to a duel.
Ulic Qel-Droma and the Mandalorian leader had this long-awaited duel, however, it did not go well for the Mandalorian leader because he lost, making the planet free again.
