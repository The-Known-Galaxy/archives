# Introduction
An ecumenopolis, Empress Teta is a planet located in the Koros sector of the Deep Core part of the galaxy.
The planet was a major hub of the Mining Guild, which had control over the planetary government.
After the Galactic Empire came to be, the planet was alternatively named Cinnagar, which’s namesake was the capital city of the very same planet.
Its place in the Deep Core also allowed for restrictions on hyperlanes, which would allow for military testing by the Galactic Empire, for technologies such as the Inderdictors.

# Section 1
Empress Teta, while being a hub for the Mining Guild, was a major supplier for Carbonite and Andris Spice for the majority of known galactic history, this is why it was controlled by the Mining Guild.
Although by the time of the Galactic Empire, the planet which was rich in these resources had shifted its production of Andris Spice off-world, however the planet continued to run the administration.



# Section 2
Empress Teta is believed to be one of the oldest human civilizations in the entirety of the galaxy, with buildings dating back to 27,000 BBY.
With much of the history of the planet being recited in poems or epics, such as the Qel-Droma Epics during the Great Hyperspace War.
The planet had sided with the Confederacy of Independent Systems in the Clone Wars due to its control under the Mining Guild, while Galactic Republic loyalists fled to Coruscant.
.
After the Clone Wars those loyalists were granted places of power.
The loyalties cemented through that allowed Empress Teta to become a major war supplier to the Empire during the times of the Galactic Civil War.
