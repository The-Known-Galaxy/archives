# Introduction

Hakassi was a planet located in the Deep Core area.
In the times of the Galactic Empire the planet was under imperial control in High Admiral Treuten Teradocâ€™s post campaign: he fled to the planet Hakassi and made the planet his main capital.
After a short period Hakassi was most likely abandoned by imperial control in 12 ABY.
In the times of 16 ABY the planet belonged to the New Republic.
The planet was a major shipyard for the New Republic, producing new ships for the fleet to use.
During the era of the Yuuzhan Vong War in 29 ABY the Yuuzhan launched an offensive assault on the shipyards and all other shipyards belonging to the New Republic.
Hakassi was one of the first shipyards targeted.
