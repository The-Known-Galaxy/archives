# Introduction
Byss was a planet, which was located in the Deep Core, a region near the center of the galaxy.
It was discovered near 45 BBY.
The planet seemed like a myth since it appeared like the perfect place to live.
However, this was just a belief because the planet was mostly influenced by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious.
His dark side energies affected the entire planet and its inhabitants.
It was also the throne world of Sidious and housed the Imperial citadel.
The reason why it housed such important buildings for the Galactic Empire was that it was nearly impossible to reach.
It was located at the end of the Byss run, which was heavily guarded and connected Byss to the Core Worlds.

# Section 1
Originally, Byss was a fertile world that also acted as a natural conduit for the Force.
However, it was flooded with the energy of the dark side of the Force when Emperor Palpatine decided to make Byss his retreat.
Palpatine also leeched off the Force energy from the inhabitants and the immigrants who went there; Byss eventually became one of the strongest nexuses of dark energy in the entire galaxy.



# Section 2
Byss was originally ruled by the Rakata.
It was during the expansion phase of the Galactic Empire when Palpatine made Byss his retreat and a powerful nexus of the dark side.
Even after Palpatine died in the Battle of Endor, the people of Byss remained extremely loyal to him.
Eventually, Byss was destroyed in a battle with the New Republic when R2-D2 rammed the Eclipse 2 into the Galaxy Gun.
This collision caused the last projectile of the gun to aim toward Byss, destroying it.
