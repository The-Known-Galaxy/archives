# Introduction
During the last years of the Rakatan Empire, in hopes to save themselves and restore their fading connection to the Force, the Rakata built the Mother Machine.
The Rakata had retreated to Belsavis to try and find means of artificially reconnecting to the Force through a multitude of experiments and scientific projects, but many of which ended in failure.
One project that proved to have some levels of success was the Mother Machine.
The Mother Machine; later calling itself Ashaa, was built with the purpose of creating new Force Sensitive species with the idea of retraining Rakata’s Force sensitivity and if all else failed, to rebuild it.

# Section 1
The Mother Machine, or Ashaa, had a surprisingly organic view of its creations; viewing them as children, some creations it has claimed to make are the Twi’lek and Zabrak species, to which they became furious with the Rakatans when they enslaved them.
The Rakatans would soon place heavy restraining measures on Ashaa to ensure the AI couldn’t retaliate against them.
Despite all this, the Rakata simply passed off Ashaa's behavior as mimicking motherly behavior and didn’t pose any capability of having or otherwise showing real emotions.



# Section 2
It was when a worldwide prison break on the planet of Belsavis during the re-ignited Great Galactic War that would see the Mother Machines used once again.
A Sith Lord by the name of Kallig had gone to Belsavis to heal their body.
Ashaa promised to rebuild the Sith Lord if they removed its restraints.
Kallig, seeing an opportunity to cause future chaos, agreed and removed all of Ashaa’s safeguard measures.
What happened afterward, is still unknown.
