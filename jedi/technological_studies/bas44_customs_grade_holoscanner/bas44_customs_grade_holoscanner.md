# Introduction

The BAS44 Customs-Grade Holoscanner was one configuration of many thousands of holoscanners utilized throughout the galaxy.
This particular holoscanner was created and favoured by the Bank of Aargau Security for use in the defense of the planet Aargau and for the protection of its banks.

# Section 1

The BAS44 Customs-Grade Holoscanner was a large stationary scanner designed to provide high detail molecular scanning capabilities.
This device could show the insides of a creature and do so in great detail, allowing the Bank of Aargau Security to see everything on and inside a person.

# Section 2

The BAS44 Customs-Grade Holoscanner was designed largely in part due to the consistent efforts made to steal the valuable metals that are mined on Aargau’s surface.
Eventually it would come into planetary law that anybody entering and leaving the planet would become subject to this Holoscanner’s assessment.

The device was so unique to Aargau that it would become practically impossible to buy anywhere else unless through the black market, of course the price did not help as it was a particularly expensive holoscanner, being priced at 300,000 credits.

Aargau’s official press would release a statement that local smuggling had gone down on Aargau by fourteen percent during the period leading up to the device’s release simply through the discouragement of smuggling.
