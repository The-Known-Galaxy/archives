# Introduction
The Hyperspace Tracker was invented by the First Order engineers.
The tracker had the ability to sense out starships that were actively travelling through hyperspace.
No one knew this was even possible and everyone was utterly shocked when they found this out.
The resistance nearly lost the war against the First Order due to this overpowered ability.
This tech was first used in the year 34 ABY.

However, the First Order weren’t the first people to think of this idea.
This tracker idea was originally researched by the Galactic Republic, and first discovered by Jyn Erso during her final battle on Scarif.
No one really knew about this idea since the base of scarif was destroyed, until General Hux and his first order scientists and engineers perfected the ability.
A key part of the hyperspace tracker is the hyperspace field generator, which made it so that they could accelerate their hyperspace calculation rates at an unthinkable speed.
