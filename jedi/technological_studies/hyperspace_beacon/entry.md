# Introduction

Hyperspace beacons, also known as 'jump beacons', were used as fixed navigational points for hyperspace.
Several different beacons were used; such as the Stenness Hyperspace Terminal, Darknon Station, and Belgoth’s Beacon.
There’s a probability that Terman Station was used as a hyperspace beacon as well.
Different criminal factions, most notably the Hutts, resulting in stealing their cargo with little to no fear of any interference from the Republic.

Hyperspace Beacons have been around as early as 25,100 BBY within the Tion Cluster.
The Tionesse developed this technology as well as hyperdrive technology from the Rakata.
Beacons recorded hyperspace data in the local vicinity, which was uploaded by starships in the area.
Every hyperspace beacon is a considerably large supercomputer in space to make sure that routes are up-to-date and accurate.
However, this put limitations on hyperspace travel as each jump had a limited distance that only one could travel to, including each direction.
These beacons were maintained by the Republic Spacelane Bureau, with data being reliability available at around 80%.

# Section 2

When the Mandalorian Wars started, hyperspace beacons lost their need.
The introduction of navicomputers proved to be way more effective than hyperspace beacons mainly due to its capability of being able to store millions of hyperspace routes as well as restricted navigational data.
However, this didn’t make hyperspace travel much easier in some cases with there being very difficult routes to travel.
An example being the Tapani Sector, which because of its difficulty to travel to and from, continued to use hyperspace beacons until the rise of the Galactic Empire and even afterwards.
