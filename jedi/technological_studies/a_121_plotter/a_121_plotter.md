# Introduction
The A-121 Plotter was a model of the astrogion plotter, and was designed and manufactured by Republic Reinar Systems.
By the time of the Galactic Civil War, the A-121 Plotter was rendered useless and was overcome by newer designs.
If an A-121 Plotter had to be used in an emergency hyperspace jump, it would take five times as long to reach the destination.
This required a jury-rigged personal computer or datapad to download the jump coordinates in the hyperspace motor.
