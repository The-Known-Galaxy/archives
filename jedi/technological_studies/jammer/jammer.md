# Introduction
Jammers are devices used to scramble communications.
There are several variations of what  a jammer can be, ranging from several different forms or sizes, it can also be installed on starships or crafts.
An example of this would be the Millennium Falcon.
Jammers had a varied range, could be for a small area to entire planets.
Such as the Trade Federation using a jammer to limit communication on the planet of Naboo during their blockade of the planet in 33BBY, which proved to be effective.
However, jammers could not only cut off major communication abilities, but they could cut off even minor communications of the system they were installed on, such as the ship that the jammer was on.
It jammed not only the comlinks inside of ships, but it could also jam scanners that the ship used.
There was only one way to really counter a jammer and that was to disable the device, by turning it off or destroying it.
