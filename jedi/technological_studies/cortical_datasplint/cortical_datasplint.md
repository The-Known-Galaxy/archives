# Introduction
The cortical datasplint was a biomechanical implant that was designed to be placed inside the brain.
It served as a high capacity data storage device and could be used to retrieve information without the need of any other pieces of technology.
Users of the implant did not have to remember the information that they carried and could bring it back to their own attention upon retrieval from the device.
The datasplint was outfitted with sensors that recognised physical stress, automatically encrypting the information upon any signs of torture to prevent interrogators from accessing the contained data.
