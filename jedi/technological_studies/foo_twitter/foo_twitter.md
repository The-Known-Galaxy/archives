# Introduction
The Foo-twitter was a floating device, which was used to distract territorial creatures, usually ones which were hostile.
The device was used as a humane protection device, not injuring any beings and creatures.
The device uses noises and sounds to distract these creatures away from the user, usually by scaring them.

# Section 1
Callista Ming and her family are the only known users of the Foo-twitter.
They used this device to distract Wystohs on the planet Chad while working in the Sea of Chadra.
Although they are the only ones thought to use the Foo-twitter, Callista Ming did help Luke Skywalker make one on the Eye of Palpatine.
Luke used this device to distract a group of Gamorreans, who were located on a ship.
The noises the device made scared off the creatures, granting Luke safety from them.
