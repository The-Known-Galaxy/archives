# Introduction
Data goggles are a cybernetic interface accessory that links the user's mind to a central control computer, allowing the user to control shipboard systems on thoughts alone.
The device was created by the Neimoidians and was used aboard starships or for the use of the Trade Federation.
While the price for data goggles range around 2000 credits, the Neimoidian designers never shared their schematics for non-neimoidian people.
This made the use of data goggles outside the race very low.

# Section 1
Data goggles had a very simple design.
The top part of the goggles included a pair of bulb-like eye wear, connecting to a disk shaped comlink the user equipped in their mouths.
Both the eye wear and the comlink were connected by metal tubes that ran down and around the left side of the user's head.
The inside of the goggles featured real-time holographic displays for the user to navigate through a starship's systems.



# Section 2
The Data goggles were given their time of use on a few ships.
On one occasion, the goggles were used by a navigator aboard the Revenue.
Another time was during the Battle of Naboo.
Tey How and Sil Unch used the data goggles on the Saa’ak battleship and Vuutun Palaa control ship.
