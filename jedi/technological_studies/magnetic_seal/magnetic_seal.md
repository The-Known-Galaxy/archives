# Introduction
The magnetic seal, or alternatively known as a magseal or vacuum seal was a technology that was used to secure certain objects and areas.
The device was most commonly used on doors inside highly secured areas such as prisons.
The seal was also perfectly capable of securing containers, boxes and hazardous materials.
One could not simply blast their way through this locking mechanism as it was designed to resist any forced entry, making common weapons useless against it.
However, it was possible to bypass this security system by cutting off the source that provided power for the lock.
One had to be very precise and careful while attempting to slice the lock, since they were often equipped with an alarm that detected any tampering, therefore the task was mostly only given to advanced droids.
