# Introduction

Technology has helped in several problems in the galaxy’s way, the respirator or known by the common name breath mask, is no different.
A breath mask is an apparatus that is carried on the wearer and adjusted to their mouths, attached to it will be a hose or another system for whatever is in the canisters to carry to the user's lungs.
While the main thing carried in canisters across the galaxy is oxygen, this can be switched for other gases such as ammonia, or helium or even Dorin gas.
The breath mask's other feature is its ability to help the user adjust to the slight atmospheric pressure difference of another planet.

While the general idea of a breath mask was widespread, there were many forms of the device for different users’ needs.
Take for example the Kel Dor and Gand species, the Gand species used respirators since some of their population can only take ammonia to breathe.
The Kel Dor species, however, used antiox breath masks because of their need for helium and their home planet’s gas.
The price for both varied as well, since the standard breath mask was about 200 credits and 25 credits per canister, an antiox mask would run as high as 2000 credits.
The design of breath masks could even be installed as a cybernetic device for those in need of an apparatus to run oxygen or other gases through their body.
An excellent example would be the Sith Lord Darth Vader’s armor.
