# Introduction

The “Tracker” GPS Module was an automap produced and manufactured by the SoroSuub Corporation.
The device was made for droids as well as handheld units.
Handheld commercial units usually sold for 2,000 credits.
The device operated by allowing individuals or driods to locate their exact location on the planet's surfaces.
The locations are calculated and measured by either an orbiting satellite(s) or starship sensors or a combination of both.
Along with informing the user of their exact location, it would also inform the user of local weather information and navigational hazards in their area and along their route.
On the user’s end, the information could be displayed either with a holoprojector or a datapad.
