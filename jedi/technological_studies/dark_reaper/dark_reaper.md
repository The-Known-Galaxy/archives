# Introduction
The Dark Reaper was a device used for harvesting the Force that would use the Force Harvester; the device would kill anything in range by harvesting their Force relations directly to the Force Harvester.
However, if a being was wounded in the Force the Harvester would have no effect.
The device was powered by dark side turbo lasers the only possible way to not contain any of the Harvesters effects would have to be taught in the teachings by a Jedi Knight by the name of Ulic Qel-Droma taught the Jedi at the time to withstand the effects of the Dark Reaper.

# Section 1
The Dark Reaper was made by the Sith in an armory on Thule;, it was manufactured in the era of the Great Hyperspace War.
The device was used against the Galactic Republic in order for the Sith to have the upper hand.
During the era of the Great Sith War, Exar Kun was the first person to rediscover Yavin 4.
In order to activate the device, the Sith would need a source of mass amounts of energy to power it.
The Krath would have it target the living Force in order for the device to contain power.
The Jedi found out how to defeat this device from fallen Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma returned from the Krath.
The final battle that was used with this device in the Great Sith War was fought on Thule, deep in the old territory of the Sith Empire.
The Jedi would have an ambush by a Jedi task force, the task force staged an attack on the Reaper with Ulic’s information they could disarm the weapon.
Breaking the device apart to be never seen again till the Clone Wars.



# Section 2
It was said that approximately 4000 years later in time.
Count Dooku and his personal mercenary, Cydon Prax searched for the Harvester to rebuild the Dark Reaper in order to destroy the Galactic Republic.
Eventually the pair found it and Dooku ordered Prax to activate the device, hence destroying a forest on a Kashyyyk moon to test the device's power.
To further test its power he planned to use the device on captured wookies, Bera Kazan, and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker.
Whom he had captured on the planet Raxus Prime.
When Dooku activated the device once more, the blast killed off half of the forest on the moon with Anakin and his padawan Ashoka barely escaping after their escape.
Anakin and Ashoka warned the Republic of what was to come.
After these events, Dooku kept his search, attempting to find pieces of the Dark Reaper across the galaxy.
Once Dooku had enough pieces, he activated the device on the planet Thule of the once home of the Dark Reaper.
