# Introduction
The Mass Shadow Generator was the cause of the obliteration of Malachor V.
The Mass Shadow generator was constructed by Bao-Dur, a male Iridonian Zabrak in 3960 BBY.
The Jedi Knight Revan ordered its construction to be a helpful asset in the Mandalorian War.
During the war on Malachor V, Revan lured the Mandalorians to Malachor V.
The General, Jedi Meetra Surik commanded the Mass Shadow Generator to be activated, eliminating all life on the planet.
Once initiated, the Mass Shadow Generator took the lives of thousands of Sith, Jedi, and Republic Forces.
Additionally, it completely ruined the surface, cracking the entire planet and causing it to be inhospitable.
The incident destroyed the planet to its very core, and Malachor V will never be the same again.
The entire landscape was reduced to ash, and all that remains are the frozen statues of the Sith and Jedi, screaming in agony.
The Mass Shadow generator was one of the single most dangerous events to ever be experienced in the entire history of the Galaxy, it’s like will seldom be seen again.
