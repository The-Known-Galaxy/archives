# Introduction

Power adaptors themselves were used specifically to plug devices, as well as appliances, into many different designs of power access that were used across the galaxy.
Constructed by Udrane Galactic Electronics, the Universal Power Adaptor allowed individuals to use interfaces from across the galaxy that were power accessed.
It used a variable number of input adaptors to match the power couplings or ratings that individuals had on their supply.
