# Introduction

This was a tray, as the name suggests, to help in the growth of a kyber crystal.
It consisted of a central bronze dish with three small grey stabilizers with the end consisting of heat shields.
It was kept by Rey Skywalker on the planet Ajan Kloss.
It became useful in mending the Kyber Crystal of the saber originally owned by Anakin Skywalker and was then used later on in the battle between Rey and Ben against Darth Sidious.
During 35 ABY, this tray could be seen with blue crystal seeds growing.
When Rey later came back, it was found to be in that exact same place.
