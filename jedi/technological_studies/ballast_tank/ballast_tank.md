# Introduction

The Ballast tank was an intricately designed machine that could keep underwater cities and vehicles afloat.
The creator of the Ballast tank was unknown, and how it kept large objects buoyant was shrouded in mystery.

# Section 1

The Ballast tank was used in multiple well-known structures across the whole galaxy; some included the city of Orotoru G'am and Tibannopolis.
Tibannopolis was one of the largest and most developed cities in Bespin.
This was only due to the Ballast tank being able to keep the city floating whilst the residents could mine Tibbana gas.
This shows the extent to which the Ballast was useful to all people of the galaxy.
