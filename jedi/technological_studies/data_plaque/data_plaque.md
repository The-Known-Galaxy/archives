# Introduction
The Data Plaque was a hand held device used to store data that required a reader to view their contents.
Han Solo once found a Data Plaque owned by the slaver Zlarb, which led Han to break the slaver ring causing Zlarb to lose 10,000 credits.
A Data Plaque was also central in negotiation between the Rebel Alliance and the Aquaris Freeholders.
This is where Kraaken tried to steal the Data for the Galactic Empire.
Leia Organo modified the Data Plaque with a micro-proton charge, so if Kraaken escaped with the Data Plaque, Leia could still destroy it before it got into the hands of the Galactic Empire.
