# Introduction

A vocal emulator is a device used to alter the voice of an individual who uses it, usually to imitate the voice of another person.
These devices were only produced for missions that require vigilant actions.

# Section 1

This device is a sphere-shaped device made from a material that prevents scanners from detecting the emulator.
The emulator records the voice of the target individual.
It analyzes the pitch, frequency, intonation, and inflection for a much authentic vocal pattern.
After the analysis finishes, the limbs of the device will withdraw and enter the user’s throat; through the larynx.
Electromyostimulation — the use of electric impulses that elicits muscle contraction — is transmitted through the device and adjusts the larynx to imitate the vocal pattern recorded by the emulator.
