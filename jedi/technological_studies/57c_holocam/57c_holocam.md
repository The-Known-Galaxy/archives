# Introduction
The 57C holocam was an automatic camera made by weapons manufacturer Merr-sonn Munitions and utilised by the Galactic Empire onboard DS-1 Orbital Battle Station, commonly known as the Death Star I.
Containing several units such as a motion sensor and visual/audio pickup, it came of use for surveillance purposes such as in detention facilities within the Death Star.
This security scanner was able to record 3D holographic visuals while covering all directions.
Despite its excellent range and quality of images, it was highly vulnerable to blaster fire, combusting upon being shot at, as discovered by Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca when they shot them.
