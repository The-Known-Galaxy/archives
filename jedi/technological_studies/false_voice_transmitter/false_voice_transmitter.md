# Introduction
The False Voice Transmitter was a device that allows the user to imitate the voice of anything that has a voice.
Associates of the Rebel Alliance Intelligence would build devices like this by using a computer, a brain of a dead protocol droid and its vox-synth box.

# Section 1
To use the False Voice Transmitter, the user was required to jack a computer into the brain of a droid where the data port was left.
After that, the user would type in their instructions on the keyboard of the computer.
If the instructions were only a few sentences then it was easy to pair the voice with the voice the user wants to impersonate.


But was the instruction more than just a few sentences the user was required to go through an active process of recreating the voice taking their whole day occupied.
In the process the user had to try one voice after the other to see which one fits the voice he or she wants to impersonate.
That process included trying out one voice after the other until the user was satisfied with the results.
