# Introduction

Ranrt crystals were a crystal used specifically by the Wookiees of Kashyyyk for medical purposes.
In 1 ABY, Chief Kerritamba outside of Kerritamba Village ordered an individual to find a crystal as an ingredient to cure the Great Tree within the Kkowri Forest.
The only ones who were known to carry these crystals were a sayormi witch.
