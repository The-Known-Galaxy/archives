# Introduction

The SureSnoop device was widely used across the galaxy.
This tracker was produced by the Rhinsome Corporation.
The device was categorized as quite a powerful surveillance gadget available on any public market.
However, at some point in time its use was prohibited on many systems due to privacy reasons.
The mechanism was made up of two designs, a miniscule object which was used to rest on a target as well as a tracker.
The two parts were placed on a mutual frequency and pulse signal to accurately communicate.
The tracker was only three centimeters in diameter, thus proving its efficiency in following a target, as it can be hidden anywhere.
The device could be attached to almost any object of relevant size, for example cuff links.
