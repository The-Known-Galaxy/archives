# Introduction
The Gatekeeper was the artificial personality that served as an interface for Jedi and Sith holocrons.
Constructed with advanced hologram technology, they resembled the being they were based upon, with neural scans being used to create a baseline personality that reflected its model, and in certain cases allowing the gatekeeper some semblance of sentience.
The Chamber of Speech, an ancient temple located within the Ruins of Kaleth on Tython relied on a Gatekeeper to preserve historical items, and when the terminal began to break, the Gatekeeper worked with a Jedi to preserve some of the knowledge it had recorded.
The Noetikons, treasured holocrons within the Jedi Order, had some of the most advanced Gatekeepers of any holocron, with three Gatekeepers within the three holocrons.
Masters Arca Jeth, Vandar Tokare and Tharis Orne served as the Gatekeepers of the Noetikon of Science, with Jeth and Tokare arguing to such a degree that the holocron was deactivated to end the argument.
