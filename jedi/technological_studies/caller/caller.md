# Introduction
Many droids in the galaxy were fitted with restraining bolts to ensure their obedience.
There was however, a device used to activate said bolts, this device was known as the caller.
The caller had many names around the galaxy, such as droid caller, control box, control device, and even owner.
The caller device main use was either the summoning of the droid, or the activation of the droid’s restraining bolt.

# Section 1
A caller was usually designed with three simple commands in its system.
They would be either “COME,” “STOP,” or “ORDERS.” “COME” and “STOP” would be simple to know, come to summon the droid to the master of the droid, and stop to make it halt in its tracks.
“ORDERS,” however, made the droid act out any commands within the droid's operating systems.
All of these commands could be activated verbally.
