# Introduction

The Holotransceiver was a vital piece of communication in the galaxy, it was used to not only communicate to other people through a holographic message but to also send out distress beacons and many more, people used these transceivers mainly through the wars that went on as a communicator for the missions and assignments that were initiated through the battles ahead.
It was also used in many other situations, some retail, some political but most often was used in war.

The Holotransceiver was a small wired device that would scan your body and project a wireless connection throughout all other transceivers, on the projected message on other devices they would cast a blue transparent hologram of the message you would have created and it would play on the other transceivers however it was also effortless to intercept these holographic messages, as well as the message, would be hacked into by many people with computer skills, but this was also mostly a problem through wars but sometimes criminal situations would use this trick as well.
