# Introduction

The Scorpio Droid was an advanced artificial intelligence designed by Vel Jyc Boer on Lokath.
She was made for self-improvement before being sent into Wild Space among other creations like the Eternal Fleet and the Gemini Droids, with their memory cores locked.
This prevented Scorpio from returning to Lokath, hopefully saving the creators.
However, this solution only proved to be temporary due to the Old Gods unleashing on the planet leading to the death of all organic life there.
Scorpio would drift in space for centuries before being found and used as a weapon in conflicts.
After serving as a mindless droid for one and a half centuries, she would gain self-consciousness, seeking rapid experiences to allow her to evolve even further.
Sometime after 4500 BBY, she would join with the Star Cabal, a secret society that formed after the great Hyperspace war.
She would become a Guardian for Ward 23 on Belsavis, gaining access to the systems of the ward, rare technology for her improvement, and a new body.
Once Belsavis became a prison planet, she was still able to continue her work, gaining access to parts of the Prison systems.
Scorpio would meet and fight Agent Cipher Nine before accompanying the agent, openly stating her intent to one day kill the Cipher.

# Section 1

During her travels with Cipher Nine, she would dissect droids and cyborgs that Nine destroyed, using them as base resources for her chassis and power supply.
Over time she would upgrade, continuing to travel with Cipher Nine as it allowed her to witness a lot more than the Imperial Intelligence’s data banks.
Through their journeys together, she would change her opinion on the group and their species, even having a desire to observe any offspring they may have.
In 3637 BBY, Cipher Nine would go missing early on in the Eternal Empire conquest.
After this loss, Scorpio made her way to Zakuul and became the Lady of Sorrows as an information broker.
Here, she would keep improving and would learn of the Gemini Droids that commanded the fleets and the fact they resembled her technology.
She deemed them inferior copies of herself and began to look for a way to free them from Arcann.
This led to her joining up with the Outlander in 3632 BBY, where she helped to enhance parts of the Gravestone.
During her time with the Alliance, her suspicions on the Gemini Droids would be confirmed and concluded that the droids were made from one template, Gemini Prime.
Scorpio would get the chance to slice through the Gemini Prime and found the droid was not a duplicate of her own code.

# Section 2

Scorpio would take control of the Fleet, leaving a small section under Arcaan’s control, before manipulating her enemies into destroying one another.
She attempted to take over the gravestone but was stopped by Koth Vortena.
Scorpio attempted to rid both Arcann and the Commander in one go, however, the Commander would defeat Arcann in time and escape the ship’s destruction with Arcann being taken by his mother.
With Arcann gone, Scorpio granted all the Gemini free will, some staying with Scorpio and others heading off to explore.
Scorpio, with her goal completed she would give the throne over to Vaylin and advise her for months while searching for her own origins.
Together, they would take control of the Gravestone before allowing the Commander and the Alliance to gain control of it again, wanting to save the vessel at any cost.
This would allow her to get full access to the Gravestone, finding old files, and sending the ship and the Gemini droids to their homeworld, Lokath.
Here, she would help the Alliance defeat ARIES, the only self-aware droid left on the planet and upload herself into the planet’s network.
