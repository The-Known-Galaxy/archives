# Introduction
The facial transformation program was a program used to mimic a certain individual's appearance.
This would change the user’s facial structure to look identically to the person that one wanted to resemble.
The procedure itself could be painful and agoning.
Depending on the matter, both the user's hair and facial hair had to be removed before usage.
Such advanced technology wasn’t available for simply anyone to get their hands on and was kept as classified information.
Most of the time the program was only used by militaries for infiltration or intelligence missions.
