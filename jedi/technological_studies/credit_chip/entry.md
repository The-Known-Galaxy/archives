# Introduction

Credit Chips, also known as credit sticks, were small, flat chips or cards.
They were distributed to civilians by the planetary government, and their values ranged from one to over a billion.
However, there was a limit that was set by the government that authorized the use of the chips.
Credit chip technology was created centuries before 32 BBY to protect users from theft and easier access to funds.

# Section 1

Currency was transferred to and from the chips by visiting a bank and withdrawing or depositing from an account.
These accounts were more often used on most Core and Colony worlds.
Because of the widespread use of credit chips, very few people ever saw actual cash as a source of income.
The Republic, Empire, and Corporate Sector Authority relied heavily on credit chips.
Credit chips had security codes and credit algorithm memory stripes that were built into them.
Modifying one of these chips was possible but extremely difficult.
Even though you could change the code to access a different account, it was still practically impossible.
Because of this, safety measures were put in place that would destroy the chip if somebody failed to correctly modify the chip.
