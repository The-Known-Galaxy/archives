# Introduction
Hypergates were a network of devices that created hyperspace wormholes.
They used an unknown technology that allowed them to bypass mass shadows and make instantaneous travel through space and to other hypergates.
Hypergates had various forms such as entrances, gates, or archways.
Transportation occurred as soon as one stepped through the threshold and arrived at another terminus.
Receiving hypergates were capable of being located on origin planets and other worlds.
Gate-like hypergates were rumored to be capable of transporting entire starships across the galaxy.
They were considered Gree-technology and were therefore revered by the Gree as sacred relics.
The Gree long claimed that only Gatemasters were able to activate a hypergate, but this was probably just a cultural bias.
A special variant was the Grand Hypergate.

# Section 1
The hypergates were created a very long time ago by a Sentient species known as the Gree.
These gates were constructed all across the space of the Gree Enclave, many of them connecting the myriad of Gree worlds, but only the Gree masters know how these gates were created.
A famous planet located in the Outer Rim Territories that had many hypergates was named Asation.
A famous battle happened on the planet Asation during the Galactic War, at the Hypergate Hub, where the Galactic Republic had to face the Sith Empire.
During this battle, a team of mariners traveled to Asation and successfully erased Kephess, a servant of the Sith Empire,  but sadly an opened hypergate brought an enormous creature named Lotek’k.
However, the spacers managed to defeat it successfully.
