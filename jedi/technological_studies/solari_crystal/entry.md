# Introduction

The Solari Crystal is an incredibly interesting phenomenon and could be described as the “most perfect and most pristine” kyber crystal one could ever hope to have within their lightsaber.
It’s colour was a light orange, or yam.

It was extremely rare and difficult to achieve since the only wielders who would have this colour revealed are Jedi pure in heart.
Furthermore, over many years it would be a gradual process whereas they proved they religiously embodied the light side of the Force.

The crystal would only function as a lightsaber if the wielder remained pure of heart throughout their entire career.
This made even the greatest individuals such as Mace Windu and Yoda void from ever obtaining this crystal.

This crystal spans millennia in age, and is considered the most powerful of them all.
There are only (2) recorded Jedi to have ever had it, and wielded it.
It was strange and abnormal in shape, having (3) top talons like a crown, and on the other side it ended in a thinner and sharper edge.

Jedi Master Ood Bnar had achieved it after serving the Order diligently for over (1000) years, and later gifted it to his most championed student, Shaela Nuur.
Unfortunately, the prodigy vanished during “The Great Hunt” and with her, the crystal.
Revan, being involved in most matters, found this crystal in the tomb of Naga Shadow on Korriban later on.

The crystal’s “internal” rules could be bypassed by using the Heart of the Guardian or Mantle of the Force crystals which would enable users who didn’t fit the requirements to wield it.
This crystal was inherently powerful as it made the blade thicker which would make the user more deadly in combat, and enable them to block blaster bolts without difficulty.

# Section 2

Solari Crystals that were lesser known such as the Kaiburr crystal also existed, but were much less powerful, and easier to acquire.
The Solari Crystal was originally found on Sacorria.
This well-hidden planet had evenings that would illuminate the location of the crystal.
Other locations included the Rhen Var frozen world, but little is known about this place.
