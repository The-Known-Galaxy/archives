# Introduction
The Force mask was an intricately engineered device that achieved the purpose of blocking mental force abilities from taking effect on the wearer.
This made it so it was a high-level threat to Jedi and Sith alike.

# Section 1
The Force mask had a slim design covering the whole wearer’s face.
The main plate of the mask is silver in colour and has two slightly yellow rigid lines across the faceplate.
In the middle of the mask is a bright yellow T-shaped glass part that is used for vision.
The eyepiece is similar to a traditional Mandalorian’s mask however it is slimmer.
The eyepiece goes from eye level to the bottom of the mask at the chin.



# Section 2
The history of the Force mask is shrouded in mystery and there is not any record of when it was created or who created it.
However, it is known that a handful of these masks were discovered by bounty hunters and mercenaries who were tasked with killing Jedi or Sith.



# Section 3
The Force masks abilities are quite simple, they would nullify force sensitives’ mental tricks on the wearer of the mask.
Another fact is that if a Jedi or Sith were to wear the mask, their link with the force would be severely affected and they will not be able to use force powers to do with their mind.
