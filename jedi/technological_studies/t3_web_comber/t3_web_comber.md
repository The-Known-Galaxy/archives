# Introduction

The T3 web comber was a device silver in color and a tube coming out of the top that was rather long.
Anakin Skywalker was a young boy on the planet of Tatooine in the city of Mos Espa.
He had a T3 web comber on top of his workbench when he was building his protocol droid C-3Po.
When the young boy was showing off his droid to Queen Padme Amidala of Naboo, the comber was located next to the Droid.
