# Introduction
Star Maps are artifacts that were left behind by the Rakatan Empire.
They were constructed from a self-preserving technology that was mixed with the dark side of the Force.
These maps were fabricated to show off the monuments of the Rakatan Empire.
Originally, each map had indicated the location of the Star Forge, but most of the information was lost with the fall of the Rakatan Empire.
Over time the information was recovered as the maps were repaired.
Allowing anyone who held the maps to put the pieces of the map together like a puzzle.
The best-known example of a complete one of these maps was of the Mandalorian Wars and was located on Dantooine.
Housed by an ancient temple containing Rakatan slaves and droids that protected the temple.

# Section 1
By around 4000 BBY, the Rakata and their Empire had been forgotten and planets such as their homeworld Lehon faded from memory.
There were ruins scattered across the galaxy that was the only remaining legacy of the Infinite Empire.
Not long after the end of the Mandalorian Wars, Revan sought out the remaining star maps.
He traveled to five or more planets to uncover the secrets of these maps.
Finally, after piecing together all the information he and his apprentice Malak took control of the Star Forge.
They then created a large fleet with intentions to conquer the Galactic Republic.
During the Jedi Civil War, Revan was captured and just barely escaped death.
He was retrained at the enclave on Dantooine and given the task of refinding all of the star map pieces to combat the expansion of the Sith Empire.
After doing so, he and his companions left for the Lehon system and destroyed the Star Forge.



# Section 2
One of the first star maps was located within the ruins on Dantooine not too far from the Jedi Enclave.
Darth Revan and his apprentice Malak revisited the planet to track down the Star Map.
Before they even arrived, Malak questioned if Revan was sure that this path was the right one to take.
Several years later, Revan revisited the ruins once again with Bastila.
They were guided by an information droid on how to get to the Star Map.
Access to the area was only granted after completing puzzles that were found to the right and left of the chamber.
The two rooms contained computer terminals that were protected by security droids.
Despite the challenge, they were able to complete the puzzles and obtain the Star Map.



# Section 3
Another Star Map was located on Kashyyyk within an ancient computer terminal.
Due to a malfunction in the computer’s system, the native trees grew to an unnatural size, causing the surface of the planet to become a giant wilderness.
Later on, a Jedi known as Jolee Bindo encountered the Star Map on the planet, but he was unable to gain access to it.
After traveling deep into the wilderness of the planet, Revan learned of the map’s existence.
Since he had found the device earlier with his apprentice, he was able to access the map in 3956 BBY.
During the process, Jolee Bindo ran into Revan and commended him for being able to access this amazing technology.



# Section 4
Located on Korriban, was another Star Map that sat within the tomb that had been constructed for the Dark Lord Naga Sadow.
The map was located within the burial and surrounded by a pool of acid.
Revan and Malak had visited Korriban twice, but nobody knew if the map had been accessed either time.
After acquiring the star map and the Star Forge was under their control, this became an important part of the initiations for the students of the Sith Academy.
To re-access the map Revan had to temporarily join the Academy and perform various tasks that gained him praise under the wing of Sith Master Uthar Wynn.
After some time, Wynn believed that Revan was ready for further Dark Jedi training.
He was then given access to the tomb but first needed to overcome the obstacles that lay within, alongside the creatures that had inhabited the area.
Revan used special grenades to negate the effects of the acid pool and then successfully acquired the map.



# Section 5
Lastly, was the map located on Tatooine.
Which had been placed inside of the ruins of an ancient Rakatan temple located within the Eastern Dune Sea.
By the time of Revan’s visit in 3956 BBY, a Krayt Dragon had made its home within the ruins.
The dragon seemed to be attracted to the dark side energy that was radiating from the map, which made attaining the map much more difficult.
Eventually, the dragon was killed at the hands of Revan with the assistance of Komad Fortuna.
They claimed the map only to realize that it had not been connected to any computer systems or security droids.
