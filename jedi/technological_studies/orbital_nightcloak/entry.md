The orbital nightcloak was developed before 0 BBY, and covered in the official field manual for the Imperial Military.
It was used by Warlord Zsinj to escape undetected from the Battle of Selaggis.
Zsinj also used it to hold the planet Dathomir hostage until the inhabitants turned over the general, Hand Solo.
When Solo managed to escape, he interrupted the Nightcloak satellite to save the planet from freezing.
One of the Nightcloaks was reportedly destroyed by Rogue Squadron with only a single X-Wing launching a proton torpedo.
Wedge Antilles later wrote this as a note in the Imperial Handbook, which destroyed any hope that destroying a satellite would take him out.
General Crix Madine, reading the manual, discovered that not even a starfighter attack was needed to destroy an orbital Nightcloak, as it could be destroyed by a simple homing missile.
