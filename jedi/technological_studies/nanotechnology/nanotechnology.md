# Introduction
A type of technology called Nanotechnology was created by Wat Tambor which allowed him to combine computer intelligence into his fungus fortress located on Xagobah.
Nanotechnology was controlled on a nano scale, ordinarily molecular in size and nature, therefore, nanotechnology held a great deal of technology along with nanogene droids, nano-droids, and nanoviruses.
Microscopic machines were said to be tremendously expensive to produce and often had a singular function.
Consequently, nanotechnology and nanities, in general, were limited to huge groups as well as medical firms in order to change molecular constructions in both biological and non-biological similar.
