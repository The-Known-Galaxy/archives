# Introduction

The Republic General, Var Suthra, had authorised the creation of several super-weapons during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire.
The Power Guard Enhancement System was one such project, located on the Hutt controlled world of Nar Shaddaa that through the use of cybernetic augmentation and various chemical components would alter a regular soldier into a lethal weapon.
Designed to be able to counter a Sith Lord on the battlefield, the variations of the Power Guards were incredibly powerful.
Many of the test subjects were Republic soldiers and refugees, all eager to dedicate their lives to destroying the Sith Empire by any means possible.

Following the betrayal of the Republic Scientist Eli Tarnis, who was revealed to be Lord Tarnis, son of Darth Angral, the Sith Empire under the direction of Lord Sadic took over the project, capturing Strategic Information Service Agent Galen and forcefully converting him into a Power Guard.
By installing various mechanisms that inflicted extreme amounts of pain upon the Power Guards, the Sith were able to control these elite soldiers.
However, Var Suthra became aware of the projectâ€™s loss, and dispatched the Hero of Tython, who saved Agent Galen and shut the program down.
