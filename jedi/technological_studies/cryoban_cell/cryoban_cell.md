# Introduction
CryoBan cells were produced by the manufacture of CryoBan technology.
These groups of cells were smuggled onto the planet Alderaan.
Via smuggling rings during the era of the Cold War.
On the planet, Alderaan cells were strictly not allowed anywhere on the planet.
However, they were used by the House of Thul troops.
The House of Thul used these cells against the famous House of Organa.
The House of Organa also had the Republic backing the House of Organa in the war between the two.
Soon after, a private belonging to the Republic Army by the name of Aza Gundo became aware of the smuggling of the Cells into Alderaan.
The CryoBan cells were mainly used for criminal resources being used in different types of weapons and rifles.
