# Introduction

Lignan Crystals were known to surround the dark side of the Force, making Lignan Crystals more powerful than an original lightsaber crystal.
Lignan crystals enabled the blade to last far longer than a regular lightsaber crystal, with the blade much hotter.
It was found that Lignan-enhanced lightsabers could cut through objects much faster.
When a Sith strike team located Luke Skywalker, together with his son Ben, they sliced through the thick metal doors to catch Skywalker.
Skywalker went to the viewport of the room and attempted to create an escape hole.
However, before Skywalker managed to escape, the Sith had Lignan-enhanced lightsabers that cut through the doors much quicker.
This led them to catch up and engage in combat before Skywalker could escape.

# Section 1

On Phaegon III’s largest moon, Lignan crystals were being mined in 5000 BBY by the Sith starships, Omen and Harbinger, during the Great Hyperspace War.
During that time, Jedi Master Relin Druur and his Padawan, Drev Hassin, ambushed them.
The Omen attempted to escape; however, the Omen’s escape was a failure as they tried to jump to hyperspace.
They were knocked off course by smashing in with the Harbinger.
Because of this, the Captain, Saes Rrogon, was able to use Lignan Crystal’s to endure the Harbinger together when the hyperdrive was sabotaged by the Jedi, using their Infiltrator starfighter.

As the Harbinger traveled, it found its way traveling millennia in the future to 41 ABY.
The ship was overpowered by Lignan crystals and was destroyed, alongside its Captain.
After the Omen crash-landed on the planet of Kesh, they were stranded with no way to contact anyone or rebuild their ship.
With much cargo, including the Lignan ore, it was recovered from the crash site, and with that, the crystals became valued as a symbol of the survivors.
Later, the Omen developed the Lost Tribe of the Sith.
The remaining crystals were used by the tribe, but only the most powerful members were entitled to them.

In the year 41 ABY, a Sith apprentice by the name of Vestara Khai was given a lightsaber with a Lignan crystal.
Vestara Khai used a Sith Meditation Sphere and was able to discover the Tribe of Kesh.
