# Introduction

The At-Cyb Husher Mike was a version of the comlink manufactured by a company by the name of Crozo Industrial Products.
The comlink had a cost of 3,000 credits.
The comlink was manufactured to be implanted into the userâ€™s skull.
The comlink was put in by surgical procedures of the skull; it was put near the larynx of the user.
The mouth was also equipped with microsensors.
The comlink would be used by jaw, tongue, and vocal movements.
However, it would make no sound and not much movement.
Once the movements were made, the comlink translated the movements into transmissions as if the user was actually speaking.
These signals could be heard from over three kilometers away.
The comlink could also be upgraded for additional credits such as an encryption module under the skin.
