# Introduction
The molecular furnace was a system that extracted materials and broke them down into the simplest molecules to be used for the synthesis of new substances.
For many centuries before the Battle of Yavin, molecular furnaces were predominantly used in mining droids.
The furnaces were also used in Corusanti construction droids The EVS Droids were constructed under the approval and reign of Emperor Palpatine.
This particular droid featured a massive body, measuring 200 meters in height.
It was a prime example of how molecular furnaces were used.
In a system of extraction and recycling, the droid would process debris, which was carried by conveyor belts into the furnaces within the droid.
The droids themselves were essentially massive walking factories that tore down entire city blocks to be rebuilt.
However, it wasn't just for industrial usage.
Imperial engineer Umak Leth based a superweapon, the World Devastators, on the usage of molecular furnaces, showing the destructive power of the furnaces.
This system would use powerful tractor beams to suck anything below, including cities, and the furnace to break the objects down into materials, ultimately benefiting the First Galactic Empire.
The weapon is greater than the Death Star.
