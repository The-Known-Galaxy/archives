# Introduction

Memory wipes were mostly used to completely clear a droid’s memory.
Following advancements in technology, wipes for sentient individuals and starship computers became readily available.
These wipes, if done incorrectly, could leave behind small traces of the target’s memory.
If this happens, it’s possible for them to regain their memories which defeats the purpose of the procedure.
Obi-Wan Kenobi is the only being to have successfully done this.

The more real-world experience that droids gained, the more they learned about their Master and the world around them.
Some droids would often develop their own personalities.
This was an undesirable trait to most droid owners, so they would have their memory wiped on a regular basis.
If a droid’s memory was not wiped, such as in the case of R2-D2, then it could often prove helpful.
When performing routine maintenance on Luke Skywalker’s X-wing, technicians found that they needed complex diagnostics to be deciphered.
R2-D2 was able to complete these diagnostics and assist the technicians.
Some droids would gain the ability to anticipate their Master’s orders and become more quick and efficient operating systems.

# Section 2

A crime group called “The Syndicat” eventually engineered a device that was able to successfully perform memory wipes on sentient species.
The device was first used against the natives of Phindar and then Obi-Wan Kenobi.
However, through the Force, Kenobi was able to regain his memories.
This device was later destroyed by the natives.
