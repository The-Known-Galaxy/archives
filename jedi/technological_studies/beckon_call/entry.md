# Introduction

Beckon call was also known as a remote activation controller.
It was a communication device that would allow the user to remotely access a system and have control of thrall-rigged vehicles.
The quality of the Beckon call was not always the best which was why the usefulness of it was considerable.

Some beckon calls were low-end where the range was only limited on one planet or the beckon call would only work with good weather.
There were also high-end beckon calls which were capable of transmitting signals across hyperspaces; those beckon calls were extremely modified though.
