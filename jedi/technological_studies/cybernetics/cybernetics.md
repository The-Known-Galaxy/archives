# Introduction

Cybernetics were any replacement part from internal organs, to limbs.
These were usually lost due to disease or dismemberment.
These parts were connected to the organic tissue through the synth-net neural interface.
This provided the patient with control over the new part.
External replacements such as arms or legs were usually covered in synthflesh to resemble what was lost.
These individuals who received cybernetics are known as cyborgs.
There were two main types of cybernetics, replacements and enhancements.
Replacements were artificial units intended to replace a lost limb or organ.
Enhancements granted the user new abilities or improved them in one way or another.

Cybernetics throughout the galaxy weren’t uncommon.
Notable cyborgs within the galaxy were Anakin Skywalker, Luke Skywalker, and even the infamous General Grievous.
Anakin Skywalker lost his hand during the first battle of Geonosis.
During the battle, he and Obi-Wan-Kenobi dueled Darth Tyranus.
Darth Tyranus ended up making easy work of the two, cutting off Anakin’s hand in the process.
Luke Skywalker coincidentally lost his hand to Darth Vader during the Bespin duel.
General Grievous finally was made into a  cyborg by none other than Darth Tyranus.
He was transformed into a cyborg following a gruesome shuttle crash.
These cybernetics weren’t only replacements but also enhancements as his combat skills were greatly enhanced after the surgery.
