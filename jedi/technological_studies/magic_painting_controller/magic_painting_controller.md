# Introduction
A creation made by the magician Wim Magwit, the device was a magic painting controller that’s use was to decorate interiors.
It was a black, small hemispherical controller that could simply be put onto a flat surface such as a wall.
Then, create a legitimate painting on the surface below the controller.
Which were changed out in random intervals.
In short, the controller was able to paint random paintings.
