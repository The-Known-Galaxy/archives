# Introduction

The Asteroid orbital drift charts are a computer-based simulation of everything in the asteroid fields.
They used an advanced mechanism to keep watch and attempt to predict what happens in the asteroid field.
These charts allowed space crafts to make their way through the asteroid field safely.
All of the charts were kept in the navigation computer of the starships for quick access and were a part of the ships space navigation mechanisms.

In these asteroid fields came asteroid mining facilities, The Peragus Mining Facility command console used the asteroid drift charts and they were constantly updated and as they did, they sent out transmission to incoming space crafts to keep them from getting destroyed in the dangerous asteroid field.
Before these charts were invented, The Peragus Mining Facility would halt the space crafts, and warn them of the star dust and also give them docking instructions.
