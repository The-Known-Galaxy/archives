# Introduction

The Behavioral Modification Biochip were also known as the inhibitor chips, which were used on the Clone Army to help cope with battle, but also to activate the dormant order 66 command when the order was given but also conditioning them to respond to orders without any questions.
The Biochip was made out of organic material, hence the name biochip.
The chips had a microscopic size, meaning they were undetectable to medical equipment.
It would require a level 5 atomic brain scan to detect an inhibitor chip.
If an inhibitor chip suffered malfunctions, the host would complain about headaches and would soon the chip itself would start to rot and cause severe deterioration on a hostâ€™s health.
The Behavioral Modification Biochip was implanted into clone troopers at the third embryonic stage of their development.
The Behavioral Modification Biochip was quite durable and malfunctions with the chip were a very rare spectacle.
The Behavioral Modification Biochip was also used to suppress the raw aggressiveness in them, which was a feature of the clone template, Mandalorian bounty hunter, Jango Fett, who was aggressive in nature.
