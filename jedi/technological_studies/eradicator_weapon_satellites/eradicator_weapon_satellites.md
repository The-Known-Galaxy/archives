# Introduction
The Eradicator Weapon Satellites, more commonly known as the Eradicators, were super weapons capable of destroying entire cities created partly by the Imperial Science Bureau of the Sith Empire during the Cold War classified as Special Project 62991A.
The Eradicators were biomechanical hybrid satellites made up of an organic battery and mechanical shell.
When being built, the organic portion of the satellites were grown rather than constructed.
The satellites were to play a key role in Darth Jadus' plan to strike fear into the Sith Empire which encompassed destroying Kaas City and the Dark Council with it.
Special codes were used to control the Eradicators though if left alone the satellites would target locations on the planet of which they orbited at random.

# Section 1
To successfully utilize the Eradicators against the Dark Council, Darth Jadus faked his death and manipulated the completion of the Eradicators under an Anti-Imperial terrorist organization called the Eagle’s Network.
The members of this organization were not aware they were doing the bidding of Darth Jadus.
After the capital city of the Sith Empire and Dark Council would have been destroyed, Darth Jadus was to emerge as the savior and leader of the Sith Empire had his plan not been uncovered by Imperial Intelligence and the devices found and deactivated by the Imperial intelligence operative codenamed Cipher Nine.
