# Introduction
One of the most recognisable technologies in our universe, holograms are three-dimensional data projections used to display or transmit data.
Hologram technology consisted of two parts, a holocamera that would capture the image and a holoprojector to display the data.
Alternatively, standard data could be projected using only a holoprojector with the inclusion of a holodisk, for example during the Death Star briefing where a structural schematic of the Death Star was displayed.

Up to the fall of the Republic, the vast majority of holograms consisted of a single, blue, monochromatic image.
However, this would change during the time of the empire when hologram technology advanced enough to allow for the projection of coloured images.
Holograms could also be used for entertainment or public addresses if they were large enough, as seen in the muster hall on Kamino.
Finally, some holograms gave a projection of a physical body, allowing for a wide range of threats to be simulated.
Here in the Jedi Order, these are sometimes used to create projections of Sith Lords’ for duelling practice.
