# Introduction

Deuterium, also known as heavy hydrogen, is one of two stable hydrogen isotopes.
The molecular difference between a hydrogen atom and a deuterium atom (deuteron) is the existence of a singular neutron in the nucleus of the deuteron, whereas a hydrogen atom nucleus contains a proton and no neutron.
Both atoms have an atomic number (number of protons) Z=1.
It has no special physical characteristics.
After the discovery of deuterium, it was used in the production of “heavy water”, also known as deuterium oxide (2H2O, D2O) essentially being water containing deuterium instead of the standard hydrogen-1 isotope that makes up most of the hydrogen in water.
Deuterium oxide is commonly used in nuclear reactors and can affect the circadian oscillations of multiple species.

# Section 1

Deuterium possesses explosive properties, most commonly used as fuel stored in special canisters for safe and compact transport.
It is also used in the production of volatile ammunition causing large amounts of damage to both biological and mechanical/artificial targets.
Deuterium was also apparently used in an alcoholic drink called Deuterium-Pyro.
Sources state that deuterium was definitely used as fuel for speeders and potentially small spacecraft, though it’s use as fuel for spacecraft has neither been confirmed nor denied.
