# Introduction

The Rancor’s Fist was the uniquely designed flagship of Graballa the Hutt, who was Jabba the Hutt’s lesser-known cousin.
During Grabba the Hutt’s early years of overseeing mining operations in the Belgaroth asteroid field, Grabba the Hutt would acquire the starship and utilize it as his base of operations and mobile headquarters.

The Rancor’s Fist was of a unique design, being the only known starship of its kind.
However, the similarities in its design to that of other Hutt vehicles are apparent.
The starship offered Grabba the Hutt a throne room, hangar bay, and enough facilities to house many of his associates.
However, it did have a notable weakness to water.
