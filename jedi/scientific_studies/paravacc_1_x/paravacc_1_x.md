# Introduction

Paravacc 1.X, developed by the Uukaablian MedCorp in 8 ABY, was developed to help fend off against parasites.
This vaccine was injected to the patient directly into the back of their neck.
If injected only once, it causes a temporary headache.
However, if used excessively within a short time frame then it could cause detrimental effects to the nervous system of the patient.
