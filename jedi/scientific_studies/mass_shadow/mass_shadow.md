# Introduction
The name of this entity is in itself self-explanatory.
Alike to one’s own shadow, large entities in space such as planets, stars and gas giants have their own shadows.
The only difference is that these “mass shadows” leave hyperspace signatures which could physically impede or damage spaceships that attempt to travel through them.

These gravity wells occurred throughout space both spontaneously and naturally.
Comets had them as well, but to a much smaller scale.

Due to their dangerous nature, astromech droids and navigation computers had the most well known of them programmed into their guidance systems.
This prevented most ships from being ripped apart by mass shadows.

# Section 1
Surprisingly, a Jedi General named Meetra Surik and Lieutenant Bao-Dur collectively made an artificial gravity well generator which was an absolute monolith of a tool in destroying millions of Mandalorian and Republic soldiers during the Mandalorian wars.

The ethicacy of this has been questioned due to the devastation that it wreaked upon thousands of cruisers that were devoured by its gravity, but according to Surik, the ends justify the means.

The incident revealed that the generator was so powerful that once a ship was encapsulated by it, there was no escape.
The only Force user who might be strong enough to break free would be Darth Nihilus, hypothetically speaking.

Meetra Surik, later an exile, used the generator to destroy Malachor V as a whole in order to defeat Darth Traya.

Other smaller generators were made on the Interdictor-class Republic cruiser, and the Immobilizer 418 Galactic cruiser.
Gravity mines and pulsemass generators also utilised the same mechanical concept on a much smaller scale in smaller battles to wreak havoc.
