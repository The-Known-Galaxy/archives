# Introduction
Terraforming is a process that transforms a planet’s biosphere from one environment to another.
This is used to allow for the majority of sentient species to have the right environmental conditions to not only survive but to thrive on a new planet that could previously have held no life or had hostile conditions.

Some examples are the following: the Solodoe terraform a planet called Plin Minor, a terrestrial planet home to the sentient species of  the Plinovians, who objected to the terraforming as it’d destroy their habitat.
Grand Moff Wihuff Tarkin also had the planet Eadu.
Another planet that had been terraformed was Lah’mu.
In the year 18 BBY, the Galactic Empire started their terraforming of the notable planet Ilum, which had ended up becoming Starkiller Base many years later.
