# Introduction

Fex-M3 is a neurotoxic that is extremely potent, as well as volatile.
The neurotoxic could be both inhaled and was absorbed through the skin, where it would target the brain stem as well as the autonomic nervous system of most species within the galaxy.
The toxin was used by bounty hunters mostly, namely Boba Fett who used darts that were laced with Fex-M3 that was from his knee pad dart launchers.
The Imperial Military also used this with the CSPL-12 Projectile Launcher.
The last recorded use of this was used for riot control by the Galactic Alliance Guard during the Second Galactic Civil War during 40 ABY.
