# Introduction

During the Great Galactic War, a rogue Sith Lord by the name of Darth Grathan had declared himself the thirteenth Dark Council member.
Being unrecognized by the members of the Darth Council as legitimate, Lord Grathan was pushed out of the Citadel on Dromund Kaas and later retreated to his private estate with a multitude of followers.
In order to ensure his power base could survive any retaliation or siege from the Empire, he and his top scientists developed many scientific advancements to bring the attrition rate of his forces down as little as possible.
One of these programs would be Project ARC.

# Section 1

Project ARC was one of the more successful scientific endeavours attempted by Lord Grathan.
Developed by Lanniter Droge, Project ARC saw the creation of cybernetic limbs and other enhancements designed to heal wounds of any type, mend bones and even act as advanced prosthetics.
While the intent was for Military use, Lanniter Droge had sought to use the technology for medical applications for war victims.
Before being mass produced, another Scientist by the name of Ismar Brengle, a captive of Lord Grathan, sought to steal the technology and buy her way to freedom, but was later convinced by Lanniter Droge to reconsider.
When the Treaty of Coruscant was broken and War resumed between the Sith Empire and Galactic Republic, the technology produced from Project ARC would see it used for both Military and Civilian purposes.
