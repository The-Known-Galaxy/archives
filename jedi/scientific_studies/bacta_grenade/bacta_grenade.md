# Introduction

The bacta grenade was a device commonly used by combat medics to heal wounded soldiers on the battlefield.
Essentially, if a soldier was too far from a medic during a firefight, the medic could throw a bacta grenade to their position.
This grenade was notably used in the hopes of not exposing combat medics whilst amid combat but was also used as another quick way of healing soldiers.

# Section 1

Upon activating a bacta grenade the two halves of the grenade separate from one another.
Below the two halves of the grenade was a synthetic healing fluid known as bacta.
After initially separating, the bacta would administer this fluid to the intended target.
However, larger, more powerful versions of the bacta grenade called bacta bombs were created and used around the same time to heal larger groups of soldiers.
Bacta grenades were most notably used by the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War (2 BBY to 5 ABY).
Although, they were sometimes used by Imperial and neutral medics after the Battle of Yavin in 0 ABY.

# Section 2

Bacta was created by the insectoid Vatrix on the tropical planet Thyferra and was first introduced to the galaxy in 4100 BBY.
Because of its great potential, there were several disputes over stores of bacta.
The organic chemicals were used to heal patients by having the bacterial particles in the fluid seek out wounds to induce rapid tissue regeneration and prevent scarring.
Used to treat all injuries and conditions across a wide range of species, it was thought of as a “miracle fluid”.
Furthermore, it was used to replace the healing fluid of kolto as it was more potent.
