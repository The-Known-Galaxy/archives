# Introduction
A carapace knitter, created by the Verpines, was a calcium-based paste that was used for medicinal purposes.
After it was removed from its tube, it would set extremely fast which would make it ideal for gluing broken bones back together.
One downside to this paste was that it was specially made for insectoid species or species with an exoskeleton.
The use of this product was extremely painful for the patient as it had to be injected directly into the site as opposed to being applied on top of it.
Another risk of this paste was an overdose.
If too much was injected into a broken site, the originally broken limb would die.
