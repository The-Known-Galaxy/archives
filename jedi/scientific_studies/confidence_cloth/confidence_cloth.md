# Introduction

The confidence cloth was an interesting medicinal product.
When the user had high levels of stress hormones, the Confidence Cloth would release counteractive psychoactive chemicals.
The Confidence Cloth, which was considered a “band-aid” type of product, did not just lower their stress levels but also slightly elevated their confidence as well as their aggression.
It was also said to elevate their ability to intimidate their opponents.
However, some critics denounced these claims and said the effect was purely psychological.
It soon became illegal on some Core Worlds.
