# Introduction
Geology is a field of study adopted by geologists.
These individuals take on the burden of studying planetary and continental events that involve the environment, and conflict with it in some way.

Specifically, geological catastrophes such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and geyser explosions are included in this field.

The Svivreni are a species that mastered this field, and smartly used it to their advantage when mining to more quickly burrow out large areas.

Souleth’s author note: Once again, a highly unstudied field that has been rarely documented.
The republic should consider sending some probes to analyse further functionality.
It could be strategic for underground operations with the Geonosians.
