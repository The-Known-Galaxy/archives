# Introduction

The word hydrosphere refers to the quantity of moisture and forms of water in the atmosphere of a planet.
The planet Sanctuary had a moist hydrosphere.
In contrast, the planet Lahâ€™mu had a lavish atmosphere, yet the poisoned soil made the groundwater troublesome to drink.
That is why it required the use of soil sifting and moisture vaporators productively corrected it.
