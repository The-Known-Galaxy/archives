# Introduction
Carbon-freezing is the process of encasing fragile and precious materials, including sentient beings,  in frozen carbonite in preparation for transportation.
Such a process would be used to encase highly pressurized gasses such as tibanna so that they could be safely transported from one place to the other.

Carbon-freezing has been used multiple times throughout galactic history, such as when Darth Vader used a modified carbon-freezing chamber on Han Solo as per his deal with Jabba the Hutt and later Han was freed.

Carbon-freezing causes unwanted side effects such as blindness, and the smoke that is emitted from the carbonite during freezing was considered a health risk by the Alderaanian Medical Association.
