# Introduction
Hypermatter was an exotic fuel type mainly used for Starships and large Battlestations.
The matter would be used for hyperspace jumps and other energy-consuming systems.
The fuel was able to create large amounts of energy.
The substance would be found on ships after reverting back to real space.
When the hyperdrive adjusted Hypermatter, the particles allowed the ship to jump to hyperspace without changing its complex mass and energy.
Not only did it power hyperdrives but it also helped power the Death Star’s laser beam.
The Death Star was outfitted with a hypermatter reactor that would help power itself.

# Section 1
The building blocks of hypermatter were found in the inner planets of the Redhurne system, when cracked open, you would see toxic rays of the Redhurne Star.
The main materials of hypermatter could be found when the solar radiation came into contact with the core of a planet, which was the case found in the Redhurne system.
In addition, it was also found and used for hyperspace rings during the Clone Wars era.
Hypermatter is a very sensitive material, on the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Battle Lance, there was hypermatter instability that led to the ship and crew being vaporized.
