# Introduction

During the Clone Wars, medics were a necessity for every clone squadron.
These medics were armed with several beneficial healing supplies.
One of the many tools used was the medical patch.
These medical patches were used to alleviate headaches and other sorts of pain.
These patches were round, mid-sized, mechanical patches that would attach to the wounded area.
They would also be used after surgery, healing the incisions made to carry out the operation.
It would quicken the healing process of the skin.
