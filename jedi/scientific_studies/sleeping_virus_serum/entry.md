# Introduction

This serum was made to cure the sleeping virus which would put a human, the only affected species, into a comatose state.
This serum was created by the Galactic Empire;  it had a pink needle with which you get injected and was only sold on the moon Panna Prime in Panna City.
During the Galactic Civil War between 0.5 ABY and 1 ABY, Luke Skywalker, and Han Solo were infected with the sleeping virus and were suspended upside-down to keep the blood running to their brain, while an “ally” of theirs, Boba Fett, knew where to get the serum, and went to obtain it.
However, Boba Fett did not purchase the serum directly from Darth Vader he made a deal with him instead; he returned to the ship to administer it to both Alliance heroes, but Boba Fett’s plans were foiled by the two droids R2-D2 and C-3PO.
