# Introduction

Rakghoul serum was the only cure for the rakghoul plague that had haunted the known galaxy for many years.
It was during the Jedi Civil War that Republic scientists on Taris had created samples of the serum to cure the Outcasts during the restoration of Taris.After the Sith armada took the planet, the advances in the cure were taken by the Sith.
Sith troopers used the serum during patrols of the Undercity.
They eventually ran out of it once Reven arrived due to the surplus of encounters with rakghouls.
The rakghoul plague was halted by the serum, but as the disease continued to evolve throughout the generations, they eventually developed an immunity to the serum.
With no way of stopping the plague from spreading, the Outcasts were eventually wiped out from the surface of Taris.

Roughly around 3643 BBY, pirates had rediscovered the rakghoul serum.
They found it in Zelka Fornâ€™s abandoned medical facility in the Undercity of Taris.
The pirates had given the serum to a Jedi, who had placed it in the hands of a Republic doctor.
While the serum was effective originally, three hundred years had passed and the rakghoul had already developed an immunity, so a new serum had to be developed.
using the development of the original serum was used as a blueprint.
A new person had to be infected with the plague, so new antibodies can be analyzed and synthesized.
The infected person was controlled, so antibodies were able to be collected.
From that, a new serum was created that was effective against the rakghoul plague.
It was later mass produced.
