INTRODUCTION
“Not made.
Bioengineered.
A living vonduun crab, and technology is a poor second to it.” - Boba Fett.

Also referred to as genetic engineering, this very interesting field of study focused on enhancing and upgrading physical components in an interactive manner.
Normal materials cannot achieve what bioengineering can, as many have discovered.

Biological or living materials were often altered in specific activities to create advanced armor, weapons, tools and other entities.

Groups such as GeneSculpt, TheraGene and the Arkanian Dominion all used bioengineering to a significant extent to further their influence and power.

HISTORY
Bioengineering has a dark history originating from the much hated Yuuzhan Vong on one of their sentient worlds known as Yuuzhan-tar.
The sentient planet altered it’s genetic inhabitants to fend off unwanted guests.


The Yuuzhan Vong in general often altered complicated species to complete difficult tasks that would usually require highly advanced technology.
Yuuzhan Vong feared technology, the reason is unknown, and thus favoured bioengineering.
The slaves they created were titled “Biots”.

Other than the Yuuzhan, the Langhesi had also spent much time investing in this field.
This species moved to Zonama Sekot at one point whereas they altered the inhabitants to create technology they could use.

The Qella used bioengineering to create the Teljikon Vagabond which revitalised their planet Brath Qella.
It housed dozens of greenhouse systems and self producing food farms to keep it’s thousands of Qella alive before reaching the planet.

The Hapes Consortium used bioengineering to create the brilliant Rainbow gems, a beautiful species that glowed like treasure.

The Charon, another species, created living technology and had many bioscientists capable of replicating this process as they were veterans in the study.



# Section 2
The most famous example of bioengineering is that of the Kaminoans who did it on a regular basis.
They altered the clone troopers primal instincts and characteristics to fit that of the most incredible and ideal army ever.

In general, there are many examples spread across many systems, to name even more: the Ragithian Humans, the Gra, Shistavanen, Stone mites and so forth.
It’s a field of study that is instrumental in many species cultures and has a rich history.

Souleth’s author note: Bioengineering in my opinion is an unethical process, however; not many boundaries have not been crossed by the Jedi and this would be nothing new.
Perhaps, an optional process could be used to make certain Jedi more sensitive to midichlorians at some point is a good idea that is worth looking into.
