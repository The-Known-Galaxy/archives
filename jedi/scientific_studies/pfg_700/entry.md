# Introduction

Hadrassi Emergency Medical Systems Technologies created the PFG-700 plasma/blood synthesizer.
The PFG-700 was capable of providing a universal blood substitute for emergency scenarios by using proteins taken from local organic resources to generate an artificial blood/plasma mix.
The synthesizer was commonly utilized in emergency settings for short-term treatment, even though it was not meant to be a long-term replacement for a certain blood type.
The synthesizer required a genetic component to create an artificial serum (skin, hair, or blood).
The unit was rather widespread in most hospitals, despite its high cost of 5,500 credits.
