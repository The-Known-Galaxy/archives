# Introduction
Disinfectant spray was a medical tool used by doctors.
Like bacta, its purpose is to heal injured patients.
Although created for the use of medical assistance, it had the potential of being used as a lethal weapon.
Ton Phanan, a pilot of the New Republic “Wraith Squadron,” acted as his squadron’s doctor but was also able to use medical tools such as disinfectant spray to kill.
However, the manner in which he used these supplies troubled those in New Republic Starfighter Command, including Colonel Atton Repness.
