# Introduction

Carbonite, a unique metal alloy created from carbon and tibanna gas, has a rich and varied history in the galaxy.
This versatile substance has found applications in transportation, art, preservation, and even military endeavors.
From the mining boom of Koros Major to the frozen wastelands of Polus, carbonite has played a pivotal role in the lives of many individuals and societies.

The Empress Teta system, particularly Koros Major, became a hub for carbonite mining after the discovery of its potential as a freezing agent for long space journeys.
With carbonite, the need for generation ships became obsolete, and the Mining Guild established a stronghold in this thriving industry.
The carbonite trade brought wealth and prosperity to Koros Major, transforming it into a boomworld.

The inhabitants of Polus, a planet known for its frozen wastelands, played a crucial role in the carbonite industry.
They were instrumental in perfecting the process of flash-freezing carbonite blocks for transportation and storage.
Carbonite's ability to preserve objects, from smuggled goods to the bodies of the deceased, made it invaluable in various sectors.

Throughout history, carbonite encasements have been utilized for a variety of purposes.
Moruth Doole, a former warden, froze the body of a predecessor as a trophy.
Force users imprisoned in carbonite found themselves unable to access the Force, making it a convenient method for Jedi containment.
Even Imperial Knight Antares Draco fell victim to carbonite's grasp in 138 ABY.
Carbonite encasement became a means of survival and artistry in the galaxy.
Individuals, such as I-5YQ and Lorn Pavan, encased themselves in carbonite to survive dire circumstances.
Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker utilized this method during the Clone Wars to discreetly reach distant planets.
Carbonite also played a pivotal role in the infamous freezing of Han Solo on Darth Vader's orders, leading to his enthralling display as the "Man in Carbonite" and Boba Fett's lucrative negotiation with Jabba the Hutt.
