# Introduction
The bacta tank, also known as the rejuvenation tank, was a glass vessel filled with a powerful healing agent called the bacta, created by the Vratix.
The healing agent would promote rapid healing when a body was placed inside a large cylinder tank filled to the brim with the bacta liquid.

The bacta tanks were very expensive.
Buying the tanks plus the supply of bacta would cost around 100,000 credits from 32 BBY to 8 ABY.
There were many types of medical equipment that came with the bacta tanks that were only seen in hospitals, capital ships, and major military bases.
With their large size, they weighed roughly 500 kilograms, big enough for people to be submerged into.
To be healed, they were required to be fully submerged and had to wear clothes thin enough for the liquid to touch their wounds to heal them.
The men wore white briefs while the women wore sleeveless tops with briefs, plus they wore breathing masks to not drown.
Other species, like the Rodians, had an extended time in the bacta tanks because of their metabolism.
Then in the Imperial reign, the bacta was near impossible to find, while the Rebel Alliance had obtained a bacta tank and a small supply of the liquid.
This was placed in a base named Echo.
A person who has used this bacta tank was Luke Skywalker, after spending a night in Hoth with injuries given by a wampa; he was able to survive thanks to the bacta tank.
After the Battle of Endor, the New Republic started the Bacta War to spread the bacta around the galaxy.
