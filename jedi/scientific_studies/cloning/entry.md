# Introduction

Cloning is the process of creating a genetically identical or modified copy of an original organism from a genetic template.
It was through this process that a vast clone army was created for the Republic, and in turn was a key factor in the fall of the Galactic Republic and the unfortunate dawn of the Empire.

Cloning technology was developed by a number of civilizations in the galaxy, such as the worlds of Khomm, Lur, Ithor, Columbus, Arkania and, most notably, Kamino.
Kamino was infamous for their renowned skill in cloning, later teaching their skills to the inhabitants of Polis Masa.
The Kaminoans transformed their skill toward clone production into a large-scale commercial enterprise.

The practice of cloning sentient specimens is an imperfect science and in spite of the Kaminoansâ€™ drive to perfect it, it was still possible to develop a genetic or physical defect in specimens, producing unexpected and unwanted results.
The Kaminoans were known to discard imperfect clones based off of the slightest defect, such as discolored eyes or difference in height.
Hundreds of thousands of clones could be created off of a single genetic template, but over time the quality of the template would degrade, this is why cloners needed direct access to the original organism in order to extract new samples for a new genetic template.
Otherwise, a new organism would be chosen to host.
