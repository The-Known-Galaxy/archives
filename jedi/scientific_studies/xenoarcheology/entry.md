Also some notable Xenoarchaeologists were Fasha Dansun she was a human female Xenoarcheologist.

She was also a human female who worked and supported the Galactic Republic.
She also did many treasure hunts, Angrail Ryth, a human male, who tracked the Châ€™hosk Cave Drawing on Antmuel VI.
Many Xenoarchaeologist had a difficult life because many of them had to face difficulties in their Journeys like aggressive alien tribes or aggressive alien cultures.
Their work was so important and so interesting.
