# Introduction

Bacta spray was a type of bacta that was used to treat small cuts and wounds.
They were the principal ingredient in bacta patches, and medpacs often contained little vials of them.
Bacta spray can be used to virtually any sickness, as it would reduce the symptoms until the actual medication was available.
