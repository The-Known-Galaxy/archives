# Introduction
Fondor was a planet used for manufacturing for the Galactic Empire.
The planet was in the Colonies region, and the Tapani Sector.
Fondor’s surface was primarily purple, consisting of lines and circles that were interconnected throughout the planet.
Nearing the end of the Clone Wars, Eriadu would ship lommite to Fondor as well as many other planets in the Core Worlds through the planet Malastare.
Lommite is an ore used to forge transparisteel, as the name says, is a transparent metal mainly used for metals, as well as some parts of ships and starfighters.

# Section 1
In the CIS crisis, the leader of the Confederacy of Independant Systems, otherwise known as Count Dooku, tried to persuade Eriadu into joining the CIS.
Count Dooku mentions that Fondor would be joining the CIS as well, yet the governor of Eriadu declined.
The governor thought that the CIS would take Fondor by force, therefore he sided with the Galactic Republic and soon after the Republic would win the war.



# Section 2
During the Galactic Empire era, Fondor was turned into a manufacturing planet that was used by the Empire.
Fondor had many shipyards that were comparable in size to the ones of Scarif and other planets.
In addition to this, Fondor was the home of many Imperial workers such as scientists and engineers.
Some of the Empire's projects started on Fondor, for example, the climate disruption array used on many planets such as Abednedo during Operation Cinder.
Many attacks on Fondor occurred, though the Empire’s defenses managed to push the invaders back.



# Section 3
After the Imperial defeat on Endor, Iden Versio was told to return to a shipyard near Fondor.
She received orders to protect the climate disruption arrays located on the Imperial ship Dauntless, however, there would soon be an attack on the shipyards by the Rebels.
After the Battle of Jakku and the Empire’s swift end, most of the manufacturing on Fondor would be stopped.
By the war between the First Order and Resistance, the Resistance would come to Fondor for help, but they were denied.
Soon the First Order would track down the Resistance and come to the planet Fondor in search of any Resistance operatives.
Although Fondor has stayed with the Empire and Galactic Republic throughout its history, many of the shipyards were taken by the First Order for seemingly no reason.
