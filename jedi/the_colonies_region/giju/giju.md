# Introduction

Giju was a terrestrial-like planet found in the Colonies system of the galaxy.
It had many islands and wetlands, as well as glaciers in the oceans of Giju.
Giju was also the homeland of the Herglic, a large mammal that could live in both water and land.
In addition to this, Giju had countless bases for manufacturing, as well as places for markets and trading ports.
The planet was a part of Herglic Space, and had a few trade routes, such as the Rimma Trade Route and Giju run.

# Section 1

In the year 27,500 BBY, the Herglic invented the Hyperdrive and went off to conquer its neighboring planets, hence creating Herglic Space, as well as the trade empire of the Herglic.
In the following years, Herglic would side with the Republic, and soon after the Herglic would communicate with the Tapani Sector.
During the Clone Wars, the Battle of Giju occurred, and Sha Koon was sent to defend the planet from the CIS forces.

# Section 2

Continuing into the Galactic Empire era, Giju was forced to join the Empire after the killing of many Herglic.
This made it so Herglic Space was now under control of the Empire, making it an Allied Sector.
The Herglic were viewed as semi-sentient to most Imperial forces, therefore the Empire gave them less rights than the average sentient Human.
Still, the Herglic were able to live fairly easily, and were forced to become laborers.
Soon, the Imperial forces on Giju would leave, allowing the Herglic to continue their regular lives before the Imperial invasion.
