# Introduction

The Varvenna Sector is a star sector found in the Colonies Region, containing the Bryexx system.
The most notable individual from this sector is its Moff, Yndis Mylore, who was governor of the planet of Bryexx and was affiliated with the Galactic Empire.
Porcellus, Jabba the Hutt’s chef, served Yndis Mylore prior to becoming the Hutt’s chef.

Another major part of the Varvenna Sector is its connection to the Corellian Trade Spine, a major trade junction and route.

The Corellian Trade Spine is one of the largest trade and hyperroutes throughout the galaxy, as it intersects with the Hydian Way as well as Rimma Trade Route and into inter-galactic space.
