# Introduction

The Fakir Sector was a sector of the Bachou arm of the Colonies.
It was home to hundreds of life-sustaining planets, only fifty developing sentient life and only ten of those developed hyperspace travel.
Additionally around 150 planets were settled and colonized by humans.
Some planets in this sector are Abonshee, Alabash, Iyuta, Lorimax, Mycroft, Palanhi, Vakkar, Doneer’so, Halowan, Sinkar and the actual planet called Fakir.

# Section 1

During the Clone Wars the Sector was controlled by the Corporate Alliance (A Republic trading guild), but when the Galactic Empire came to power it established its presence in the Sector and built government headquarters on Doneer’so, under Modd Lorin’s command.
Because the Sector was rather peaceful and stable, most of its fleet was taken from the Sector after the Battle of Yavin (0 ABY).
The Rebels in the Sector took the opportunity, and made moves to destabilize the Sector.
After several months the Imperial Governor-General had to request an entire battle fleet as reinforcements.
