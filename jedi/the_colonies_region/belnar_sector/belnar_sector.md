# Introduction
The Belnar sector was located in the Colonies and contained the Belnar System and within it the planet Belnar, homeworld of the Khil.
The Khil developed Hyperspace very early and became a member of the Galactic Republic and later its successor, the Galactic Empire.
It eventually engaged wth its rival the Peltsic League, with many skirmishes in Belnar space, and  won.

# Section 1
The native Khill developed Hyperspace by 25,000 BBY.
The area surrounding the Belnar system was fully explored by 20,000 BBY, although by then the planet was a member of the Galactic Republic for two millenia.
During the first campaigns of the Clone Wars (Circa 22-29 BBY), the Third Army of the Republic Military was tasked with defending the vicinity from CIS military forces.



# Section 2
By 17 BBY the system was under the control of the Galactic Republic.
Khill space was assigned Imperial Governors, but still had guidance from former leaders, and Imperial Stormtroopers grew wary of the populace due to the Khil view of the Empire as oppressive.
In 2 ABY the victory over the Peltsic League was led by Naval Commander Tarlo Ganar, and following the Empire’s destruction in 4 ABY, the system became one of the first members of the New Republic.



# Section 3
It should also be noted that the Belnar System was located on a hyperlane connecting it to the Carida and Yabol Opa systems for thousands of years, but the route ceased to exist about 4,000 years before the Battle of Yavin.
