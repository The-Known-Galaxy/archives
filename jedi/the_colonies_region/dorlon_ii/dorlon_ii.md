# Introduction
Dorlon II was a planet that lacked the weather to create vegetation.
It was a volcanic world near Cairda and was filled with ash, smoke, lava, and sulfur.
It was said to have looked pretty from outer space.
However, it had an orbital transfer station, which was used to prevent ships from entering the Haj Shipping Lines.
It was common for people on the station to board big shuttles that transported them to Carida, Kyle Katarn being one of them.
