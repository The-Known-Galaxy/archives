# Introduction

Uquine was a planet that was mainly inhabited by humans.
The planet was quite calm, being located in the Colonies system.
Tepha Leonis, a scientist, gave birth to one of her children on this planet.
The child was given the name of Zare Leonis.
The Leonis family was known for supporting the Galactic Empire during the Imperial era.
The family eventually left the world in order to live on different planets outside of the Colonies system.
The rebel pilot known as Col Takbright was also born here.
He left due to him wanting to avenge the deaths of many innocents that were killed by the Galactic Empire, and become a pilot for the rebels.
