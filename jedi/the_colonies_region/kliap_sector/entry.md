# Introduction

Bordering the Barma sector and located in the Colonies region, the Kliap sector is home to only a single known system - the Vasuuli system.
Situated near astronomical North of Coruscant, it barely saw action during the Clone Wars and was relatively uncontested during Imperial times as well.
However, the Vasuuli system housed the Vasuuli relay station, which was operated by the Rebel Alliance and relayed important messages to nearby Rebel Alliance communications stations - namely, in the Haldeen and Barma sectors.
The Rebel communications station on asteroid AX-456 within the Barma sector was assaulted by Imperial military forces in 1 BBY, and it was the Vasuuli relay station which put together a strike team to repel the attack.
Pirate presence in the sector is only notable through the Kliap Pirates - a notorious gang of pirates known for their flashy raids.
The twin Ithorian pirates known as the Venithon Twins worked for the gang somewhere around 2 ABY.
