# Introduction

The Tapani Sector is found in the Colonies Region, bearing the namesake of Shey Tapani, who united the sector a few thousand years before the Battle of Yavin, although the earliest records of colonization in the sector dates back to 12,270 BBY.
Seven major provinces are found within the Expanse: the Barnaba Province, the Cadriaan Province, the Calipsa Province, the Mecetti Province, the Melantha Province, the Pelagia Province, and the Reena Province.
Each province is ruled by a noble house, with the exception of the Freeworlds Territory which was not ruled by nobility.

Around 3 ABY, the Empire began its invasion of the Freeworlds Territory, splitting it off from the Tapani Sector to form the Shapani Sector, with the Tapani Sector being then converted into an oversector, with Tapani and Shapani sectors within it.
```

But by 40 ABY, the occupation would be effectively reversed and the sectors would be united again under the Tapani Sector.
The sector capital was Procopia, with it being the most advanced world within the sector.
Through many centuries, the Tapani Sector would make its affiliation with many governing powers such as the Galactic Republic, the Tapani Empire, the Tapani Federation, the League of Tapani Freeworlds, and the Galactic Empire being the most recent.

Major hyperspace routes also made their way through the Tapani Sector, with the Giju Run spurring from the Rimma Trade Route entering the Tapani Sector and reaching the Shapani Bypass.
```

The other major routes were the Three Elias Run, and the Procopian Shipping Lane.
Mining companies would be the most profitable in the sector, with itâ€™s industries pinpointing the mineral-rich worlds of the Freeworlds and the Tapani Sector.
