# Introduction

Talasea was a green forest covered planet found in the Colonies region of the galaxy, and more specifically the Morobe sector.
Talasea had three neighboring planets, and orbited around a large yellow star.
The planet maintained an average temperature, not being too humid or cool, and overall habitable.
Many rivers, lakes, forests and islands were spread across the island as well.
In addition, Talasea had a variety of wildlife, consisting of species such as the Rycrit and the Bantha.
The rich soil of the planet made it an ideal place for farming and small settlements.

# Section 1

In prehistoric times, the planet was thriving with small settlements, farms and wildlife.
Through many years, the residents of Talaesa started migration to other planets and during the Clone Wars, very few civilizations were left.
Those who remained on the planet were killed by Imperial forces after hiding a Jedi who was being hunted down.
On Talaesa was the Governor’s Palace, which was empty ever since the Battle of Endor.

# Section 2

The Rogue Squadron, a squadron of fighters that worked for the Rebel Alliance, had a plan to relocate their base to the Governor’s Palace, however they were found by the Imperial agent Kirtan Loor.
Kirtan exposed the Rogue Squadron’s location, and soon the Imperials had infiltrated the base, but nothing major had come out of it.
Instead, the Rogue Squadron decided to leave the palace at once and left no clues as to what had happened.
