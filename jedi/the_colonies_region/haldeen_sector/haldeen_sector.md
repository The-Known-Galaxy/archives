The Haldeen Sector, also known as the Findris Sector is found in the Colonies region, in between the Glythe Sector and the Kokash Sector, bordering the Barma Sector.
Its constituent planets within the sector are Haldeen, the sector capital, and Argai Minor.
It was a sector within the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Empire, most notedly governed by the infamous Moff Gandril, who ordered the execution of Justice Action Network founder Earnst Kamiel, with each 54 systems where he had a death penalty on contributing a firing-squad member.

	The planet of Haldeen was also where the aforementioned Earnst Kamiel was extradited after his capture in Elrood, and where he would be executed.
