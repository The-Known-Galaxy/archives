# Introduction

Neimoidia is a habitable planet located in the Colonies region of the galaxy.
It was located inside the Trellen Trade Route, being known as the origins of the Neimoidians, and the pylat bird.
The planet was found by Duros explorers around 25,000 B.B.Y, which would soon be colonized and given the name of Neimoidia.
After the planet was founded by the Duros, the planet colony had become separated allies with Duro, and soon in 22,000 B.B.Y the Galactic Republic had become official allies with the planet, bringing the vast world to its economic peak.

# Section 2

After the founding of Neimodia a system of planets called the Purse Worlds, a group of planets consisting of Neimodian societies.
This system of planets had the names of Cato Neimoidia, Deko Neimoidia, and Koru Neimoidia.
These planets had excluded Neimoidia, as the natives of the planet considered it to be low in value, in terms of land and environment.
The big purpose of this expansion was to simply create an empire out of the planets.
The Neimoidians wanted to be able to expand greatly to make a name out of themselves.
Once the Purse Worlds were officially given their name and government type they heavily directed their efforts into the economy, gaining many profits over time.
Neimoidia had gotten the name “Pure Neimoidia”.
Over time pure Neimoidia had lost its reputation over time due to the purse worlds’ expansion and economic growth, yet it had overall made a reputation of what it was and what it turned out to be.
It is still considered a respectable world by many, knowing of what it gave origin to.
