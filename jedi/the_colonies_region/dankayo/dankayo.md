# Introduction

The planet Dankayo was used as an administrative base for the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.
The Dankayo base was used as a recording and coordination station for three sectors during its operation.
The planet can be found in the Colonies region, along the minor hyperlane called the Shwuy Exchange.

# Section 1

Dankayo Base saw its last moments during the Galactic Civil War when the Imperial Navy caught word of the base’s existence.
The Empire sent a harsh barrage of fire power from three Star Destroyers, the Avenger, Devastator, and Relentless.
However, the Rebel Alliance knew of the incoming assault, so on the order of Rebel General Carlist Rieekan, everyone evacuated and left an agent to be an observer for salvage of the base deep in a shelter.
Once the ISDs’ contacted Dankayo orbit and targeted the Rebel base, the firepower they unleashed on the base and surrounding area could have been confused for a Base Delta Zero operation to the unwise.
The surface of Dankayo was left with nothing but rubble, craters, and a dust clouded sky with the atmosphere of the planet stripped as well.
The agent who was left on the base, Agent ZNT-8, noticed two things once they surfaced; the base’s self-detonated charges did not go off, and the data packs that recorded the Rebel Alliance secret information were still in working condition.
The Imperials had a feeling that something could be scavenged from the base, so they sent scavenger teams down.
These teams collected several important data packs.
After this,they prepared for the information to be transported to an Imperial Intelligence Operations Center on Coronar.
The Rebel Alliance had managed to infiltrate the ISD Elusive that held the data packs during their delivery in a shuttle named Bonderium.
Recovering the data packs and saving several homeworld bases of the rebels from a similar fate as Base Dankayo.
