# Introduction
Ghorman was a planet found in the Colonies system, inside the Sern sector.
Ghorman was also relatively close to the planet Sern Prime.
The planet was the location of the Ghorman Massacre, which took place in 18 BBY.
Many citizens of Ghorman were doing a performance when they were crushed by the ship of Wilhuff Tarkin.
This massacre commenced shortly after the start of the Galactic Empire, which led the Delegation of 2000 to start the Rebellion as an attempt to end the Empire.

# Section 1
Not long after the massacre, Tarkin was promoted to the rank of Admiral by Emperor Palpatine.
Around the beginning of the Galactic Civil War, three Imperial BFF-1 bulk freighters along with a TIE fighter carrier set course to the newly made Imperial Base on Ghorman.
However, they were intercepted by Rebel forces, and the three freighters were lost.
This led to the Imperials not being able to fully complete their base on Ghorman.
Rebel forces would use this scenario as a way to train inexperienced pilots.
