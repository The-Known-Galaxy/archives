# Introduction
The Shelsha sector was a sector of the Colonies region which was over fifty lightyears in diameter.
It was composed of 11 planets, Shelkonwa being its capital world.
The Shelsha sector was home to only two native sentient species, including the Mungra.

During the Rebellion, the Imperial sector governor was Barshnis Choard, and the chief administrator was Vilim Disra.
The Imperial Star Destroyer Reprisal, Imperial Army garrisons on Minkring and Chaastern 4, and several patrols of Dreadnaught-class heavy cruisers were the only Imperial military units active in the sector at the time.

Pirates were a serious problem in the area, particularly the BloodScar gang.
After Vilim Disra turned her in, the Galactic Empire held Leia Organa imprisoned for a time in 0.5 ABY.
During this time, the Teardrop massacre also occurred, wherein an entire town in the sector was destroyed due to the Galactic Empire’s suspicion of planet Teardrop harboring a Rebel Alliance cell.

Shelkonwa was the Shelsha sector's capital planet.
It was located in the Shelkonwa system.
Makrin City, its capital, housed the governor's palace of Shelkonwa.
Makrin Main Spaceport and Greencliff Regional Spaceport were two of the planet's three spaceports.
Prior to the Indecta Era, Shelkonwa joined the Galactic Republic.
It backed Alsakan during the Alsakan Conflicts.

The planet Ashkas-kov was located alongside a minor trade hyperroute in the Ashkas-kov system of the Shelsha sector.
The BloodScar pirates carried out a raid on Ashkas-kov in the past.
The BloodScars attacked a convoy with 10 of their own ships, even setting fire to the four ships they were primarily after plundering of their cargo.

Briston was a planet located in the Briston star system of the Shelsha sector.

Chaastern 4 was located on the Chaastern system of the Shelsha sector.
It was home to one of the only two Imperial army garrisons in the region by 0.5 ABY, the other being on Minkring.

Chekria was a planet in the Chekria system of the Shelsha sector.
It was often the target of pirate attacks.

Drunost was in the Shelsha sector's Drunost system.
It was home to one of the busiest Consolidated Shipping hubs, as well as numerous corporate offices.
The hub, which was located near Drunost's main settlement, Conso City, made the planet a popular stopping point for fuel and supplies.
While Drunost's terrain included rivers and woods, the land was primarily used for farming and mining, though company towns were also present.

Gepparin was a planet in the Gepparin system of the Shelsha sector.
It was the base of operations for the BloodScar pirate gang, which had taken control of the planet's large mining outpost while the smaller farming outposts remained free during the Galactic Civil War.
In 0.5 ABY, the Galactic Empire attacked and completely destroyed the base.

Minkring, a planet located in the Minkring system, was home to one of the last two Imperial army garrisons in the region, the other being Chaastern 4.

Purnham was a planet situated alongside the Purnham Run in the Purnham system of the Shelsha sector.
This planet was also often targeted by the BloodScar gang.

The planet Ranklinge is located in the Shelsha sector.
At the time of the Battle of Yavin, its capital, Ranklinge City, had an Incom Corporation plant on its outskirts that produced I-7 Howlrunners.
The major cities, including the capital and Janusar, were located on the northern continent, while the southern continent had been involved in a civil war since around 10 BBY.

Teardrop was a planet in the Teardrop system.
It was close to Briston and contained Por'ste Island.
In 0.5 ABY, the Galactic Empire attempted to raid a covert Rebel Alliance listening post on the planet.
The Rebels, on the other hand, managed to flee before the raid; in response, the Imperial Security Bureau ordered the massacre of a town on that world, blaming them for harboring Alliance agents.
