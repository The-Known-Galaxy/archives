# Introduction
Hynestia was a frigid, icy planet that was the homeworld of the Hynestian.
Hynestia also had many humans, Mon Calamari and Lynna living on the planet.
The planet was so cold, that humans could only live in a certain area or they would freeze to death.
Hynestia had many hot springs underground, as well as grottos and caverns.
Master Stellan Gios upheld a Jedi Temple on the planet in the High Republic era and throughout the Great Hyperspace Disaster.
Hynestia was governed by the Hynestian Royal Family, who were all loyalists towards the Galactic Republic and afterwards the Galactic Republic.

# Section 1
In the Frozen Kova, one of the only cantinas on Hynestia, purple glandis flower juice was sold illegally.
This flower juice was smuggled by many criminals, for example, Lando Calrissian.
However, Lando was soon arrested after the bartender exposed Lando for smuggling the flower juice.
There was also a Hynestian Royal Palace, which had a royal treasury as well as a dungeon.
The treasury contained many orbs and valuables such as the Solstice Globe, which was an orb that allowed plants to grow on the planet Livno III.
Hynestia also contained a landing yard that sold gherlian furs to the Galactic Empire.
