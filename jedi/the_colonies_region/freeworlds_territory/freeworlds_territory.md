# Introduction
The Freeworlds Territory is found on the Colonies Region, bordering the Tapani Sector until it’s rampant annexation by the Galactic Empire.
In it’s close proximity within the Colonies Region, the planets and systems in this region, which would be known as the Freeworlds, were very autonomous and practically independent from the seven Expanse provinces and it’s Coreward noble houses.
To maintain their independence, the Freeworlds would band together forming the League of Tapani Freeworlds, and would consolidate their navies into the Freeworlds Common Navy.

# Section 1
Sometime in or between 3 ABY, the Galactic Empire would begin it’s invasion of the Freeworlds, with their annexation coming in swift.
The result of this annexation would split the Freeworlds from the Tapani Sector, forming the Shapani Subsector.
Eventually, the Empire would also form the Tapani Oversector, headed by a Moff overseeing this.
This partition would not last long as by 40 ABY, the Freeworlds would be once more part of the Tapani Sector.



# Section 2
The Freeworlds contained rich amounts of mineral resources making them a profitable target for many mining companies, but were otherwise considered backwater to the far side of the Colonies.
The five major worlds in the region are Tallaan, serving as the capital and shipyard of the Territory, Mrlsst housed an important university within that region, Aleron, home of the Aleron Trade Cooperative, Lamuir IV, once within the Herglic Trade Empire, and the ocean world of Neona.
Several hyperspace routes crossed the Freeworlds Territory, with the Shapani Bypass or the “Bacta Run” being the most important.
Part of the Rimma Trade Route, it connected Bacta to Thyferra, projected all the way to the Core Worlds.
