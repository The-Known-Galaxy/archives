Exodeen was affiliated with the Galactic Republic, Galactic Empire, the New Republic, and Yuuzhan Vong empire within their respective time periods of existence.
During the Galactic Civil War, Exodeen was torn with some of its populace joining the ranks and bureaucracy of the Galactic Empire, while others joined the efforts to restore the Republic.
 When the New Republic took power over the Galaxy as the Empire shattered, Exodeen was represented by senior senator M’yet Luure, an unknown secondary senator, and junior senator R’yet Coome in the New Republic Senate.
