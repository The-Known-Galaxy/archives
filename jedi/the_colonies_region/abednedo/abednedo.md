# Introduction
Abednedo was a planet located in the Colonies system of the galaxy.
Abednedo was the homeland of the species Abednedo, which had a humanoid body and a mammal-like head.
Many years before, the early Abednedo dug many tunnels underground, but due to evolution the Abednedo slowly moved upwards towards the planet.
Many immigrants on the planet viewed the cities of the planet as strange and abnormal, however, the Abednedo thought differently as it was their home.
Many immigrants were allowed into the House of Strangers, a residential area located in the main city of Abednedo, known as Neshorino.

Towards the end of the Galactic Empire era, the Galactic Empire took control of Abednedo, and harmed the planet by summoning many hurricanes and natural disasters with a climate disruption array, as a part of Operation Cinder.
Some notable people of this planet were Brasmon Kee, who was in the New Republic Senate as the representative of Abednedo.
During the New Republic era and afterwards, an Abednedo named Ello Asty flew as a pilot for the New Republic.
