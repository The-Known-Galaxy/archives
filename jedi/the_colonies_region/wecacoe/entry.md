During the Imperial era, the Galactic Empire made one of their many storage facilities on Wecacoe.
Cassian Andor was tasked to extract Imperial security protocols from Wecacoe, with the help of Rismor and Kertas, who were both rebel spies.
However, on their way there, they were intercepted by an Imperial security droid, but they were safely able to wipe the droid's memory and escape, gaining the Imperial droid as their own.
