# Introduction
The Kilbanis sector was located in the Colonies’ Slice region and housed the Manwess system.
It was also in the Kilbanis sector where the astronomical object Manwess III was discovered.
Manwess III was located at the third orbital position of the Manwess system.


It was in Manwess III where the Galactic Empire’s Moff Adrell set a bounty on Malindin Gevarak, a human counterfeiter who made forged Imperial credits for the Rebel Alliance, sometime between 0 and 4 ABY, stipulating that if Gevarak was captured, he should be turned in to any Imperial law enforcement or military office in the Kilbanis sector.
