# Introduction

The Morobe Sector was a part of the Colonies Region.
Within the Morobe Sector, a planet called Talasea was located inside the sector.

# Section 1

The Morobe Sector System was a system used within the Morobe Sector and the planet Talasea.
This system could be identified through a binary red to yellow looking star.
The Morobe Sector System was detected and found during Year 14 and is now maintained by the Galatic Empire.
This system is comprised of two suns as well as four planets.

# Section 2

The Morobe Sector System consists of four planets and two suns.
The two suns are known as Morobe Major and Morobe Minor.
The four planets include Talasea, Moroa, Mortra, and Morabora.
These planets are ruled and supervised upon by the One Nation Under Jour under sovereignty.
Talasea and Moroa are the two well-known planets that are identified as breathable planets.

# Section 3

The Morobe Sector was discovered during Year 14, any other information before Year 14 wasnâ€™t to be found or revealed.
In Year 16, it was said that the Morobe Sector was increasing its capacity and population.
This led to the system needing defence in hope of securing the system which would be the Permanent Solutions.
It was found that a merc company was found to protect the system.

# Section 4

During Year 18, a massive change had happened and the sector was undergoing possession of the Tion Hegemony.
At this time, the Tion Hegemony had adjusted the Permanent Solutions fleet and renamed it to the 3rd Fleet of the Tion Navy.
The Morobe Sector had seen massive growth in capacity and population due to the result of the planet Morabora.
At the Year 21, Tion Hegemony had halted the possession of the Morobe Sector so the One Nation Under Jour had stepped and announced sovereignty.
