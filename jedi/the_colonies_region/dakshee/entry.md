# Introduction

Dakshee was a planet in the Colonies region, being the capital of the Barma Sector.
The planet was in a stage of never-ending conflict with the Galactic Empire.
This was because the people of Dakshee believed that the rules enforced by the Imperials were unjust.
The former governor of Daksee, also known as the governor of Chandrilla, ended the Brella Temior crisis without any deaths, which gave him the attention of the Imperials, and soon after he was made the Imperial governor of Chandrilla.
Dakshee was mainly populated with Humans, as well as a variety of other species, though they were not as common as Humans.
