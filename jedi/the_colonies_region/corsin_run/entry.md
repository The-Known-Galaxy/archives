# Introduction

The Corsin Run was a trade route used during the old republic era before the year 3705 BBY.
The Corsin run was used as a safer passage from the core worlds to the expansion region.
Itâ€™s start point was the planet of Brentaal IV, located in the bormea sector of the core world region.
The endpoint is the planet of Corsin, having been found in the greater plooriod sector of the expansion region.
The planets of Uviuy Exen, Champala, Drearia, Paqualis, and Bogden were all checkpoints inside the route.
As it stands now in the current year, the Corsin run has now integrated into the Hydian Way.
