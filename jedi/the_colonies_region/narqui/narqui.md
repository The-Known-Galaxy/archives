# Introduction
Narqui was a planet in the Colonies system that was mainly covered in many fungus forests.
Narqui was also the homeland of the species Narquios, who were sentient beings with a light blue skin color.
The Narquios were also known as handy-workers and slaves to the Neimodian.
The Neimodians disregarded the sentient abilities of the Narquios and made them laborers.
The fungi on Narq were mostly blue, which also helped make the skin color of the Narquois.
