# Introduction
The planet Bethal was located in the Pelagia Province in the Tapani Sector.
Bethal was the primary planet in the Bethal Region.
The planet's terrain was mostly made up of forests.
 This planet was the home to what is called the Bethal AgriCorp, and their main export was apocia hardwood.
The planet was infested with greddleback termites, which destroyed the economy as it was based on the apocia hardwood.
An Imperial Moff named Tendd had declared the planet to be a “Disaster world” and funded the planet to restore the apocia forests.
