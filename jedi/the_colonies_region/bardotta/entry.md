# Introduction

Located within the Bardotta system of the Shasos sector lies the planet Bardotta, governed under a ruler that relied on the assistance of the Dagoyan Order.
An organisation that was well-known for their scrutiny on mystical matters.
Nonetheless, the planet was relatively peaceful under their rule.
Bardotta’s terrain consisted of an array of fascinating terrain such as abundant forests, temperate oceans and towering mountains.
Although, the absence of wildlife would be apparent due to the cold climate, considering it was quite a distance from its sun.
The gravity of the planet was also slightly lower than average.

Nevertheless, the tranquil atmosphere and scenery would attract visitors from across the galaxy to the world.
These visitors would also find themselves purchasing all kinds of artistic Bardottan pieces within the marketplaces such as tapestries and Bardottan silk.
The well-maintained peace of the planet would also be due to the stern procedures on trading and the consequences if one were to commit heinous crimes.
Smuggling was especially frowned upon and if caught, one was to be firmly dealt with and eventually exiled.

# Section 1

By 6000 BBY, Bardottan civilization began as Frangawl governed a militant society.
These people meditate and hone the dark side of the Force as they take part in ferocious battles.
The Frangrawl also constructed terrifying structures and temples as Bardotta was engulfed in war for four millenia.
Within circa 2000 BBY, the Dagoyan Order would take hold of the planning after winning several strategically planned battles.
Afterwards the Dagoyan Order would further deepen their knowledge of the Force, eventually their intellect would be of use for the government of Bardotta.
In the end, the practices of the Frangawl Cult were abolished and faded into obscurity.

With a well-established government, Bardotta would engage themselves with the galaxy, choosing to remain a neutral stance when it comes to the politics of the galaxy.
However, they had an alliance with the Jedi Order until they would take Bardottan children away to train within the Order.
The Dagoyan Masters greatly detest this, deeming it as kidnapping and cutting off ties with the Jedi Order.

# Section 2

On 19 BBY within the Clone Wars era, Queen Julia had communicated with the Galactic Senate on the disappearance of her closest spiritual advisers.
Thus requesting for the assistance of Jar Jar Binks along with Jedi Master Mace Windu to investigate the incident.
However, the distrust the Dagoyan Order held against the Jedi Order (as they had the impression of Jedi taking in Youngling Bardottans as kidnapping them) interfered with Mace Windu’s attempts to help a few times: Such as being excluded in many prominent meetings.
During one of the meetings, the queen was kidnapped, leading Jedi Master Mace Windu to conduct an investigation in search of her within the underground caves below the Royal Palace.
Fortunately, the Jedi saved the queen from being sacrificed for her life force by the Frangawl cultists.
Eventually the whole ordeal was resolved, patching up any mistrust between the Jedi Order and the Dagoyan Order.
As well as preventing a devastating power from being handed to the Clan Mother Talzin of the Nightsisters.
