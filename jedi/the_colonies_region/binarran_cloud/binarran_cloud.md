# Introduction
The Binarran Cloud is found in the Colonies sector containing the Orthellin system.
The most notable person who bore an association with the Cloud was an influential Orthellin royal mistress, who at one point owned the luxury yacht “Lady Luck’, a SoroSub Personal Yacht 3000.
Lady Luck is now owned by New Republic hero and infamous gambler Lando Calrissian.
The ship is named after Ymile, the girlfriend of Dominic Raynor, who helped Lando gain Cloud City from Dominic and hence named the ship after her.


The Binarran Cloud’s system, the Orthellin system, bears the grid-coordinates M-9 and is also part of the Colonies sector.
It is also where the ship Lady Luck was constructed and was first found of origin.
