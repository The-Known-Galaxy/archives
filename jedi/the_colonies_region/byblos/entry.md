During the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire, Sith Imperial saboteurs harassed and threatened the lives of factory workers on Byblos.
During the Clone War, Byblos stayed a part of the Republic, falling prey to battles between the armies of the Galactic Republic and Separatists Alliance.
The world became a part of the Galactic Empire with the end of the Clone War and conversion of the Republic to the Empire and by approximately 4 ABY, Byblos had been fortified by the Empire as an Imperial fortress world; worlds meant to be heavily protected and prepared for and fend off any attack by enemies of the Empire and to serve as a basis for Imperial reconquest after the Battle of Endor.
