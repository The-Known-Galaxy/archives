The planet is mostly known for an attempt on Leia Organa's life, by the Imperial Assassin X-7.
He lied to Leia, telling her that he was a warrior from Malano III to gain her trust.
He also told her that the Empire destroyed Mirabel the planet’s capital, because the population objected to the decision made by the Empire.
It is not known if the story about Mirabel’s destruction is true or just a method of trying to get Leia’s trust.
