# Introduction

Uviuy Exen was a heavily populated terrestrial planet located in the Colonies’ Shwuy sector.
It was also at the Intersection of the Hydian Way, along with the Exchange hyperlanes.
Uviuy had been incorporated into the Republic in 22,000 BBY, and remained loyal during the span of the Clone Wars from 22 BBY to 19 BBY.
In 17 BBY, during the rise of the Galactic Empire, Uviuy fell under the Empire’s control by the time of the Battle of Yavin.
This resulted in the planet becoming a fortress, and became the site of several battles between the Imperial forces on the planet and the New Republic, put together by Supreme Commander Mon Mothma.
Uviuy had a population of  500 billion and one million around 25 ABY.
