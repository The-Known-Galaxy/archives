# Introduction
Devaron was a clement and heavily forested planet located in the Colonies.
The landscape was mountainous, with many rivers and valleys dotted throughout, while the planet’s ecological balance was managed and maintained by the natives for centuries.
Moderately populated areas could thrive in their natural states without the need of urbanization or industrialization.
The Devaronians, the planet’s native inhabitants, were known as one of the earliest species to expand beyond their own world, which inevitably caused many great strides in the field of space travel and exploration.
Intertwined in the Devaronian society, the preservation of Devaron’s environment remains a phenomenon, which allows the planet to retain its natural beauty.
Devaronian females were known as the architects of the cities and societies, which were maintained to stand the test of time.

Males, however, were prone to wanderlust and explore the jungles of Devaron.
The jungles of Devaron were thick and notable for their tangles of vines and flora that spread across the landscape.
The vines vaulted over entire jungles, creating the usage of bridges and walkways, which connected hills and crossed valleys.
With the abridging vines covering the landscapes, which the wildlife valued, the biosphere of Devaron was wealthy with animals and creatures of all shapes and sizes.
When the Galactic Empire came into power, the planet’s ecosystems were threatened.
The Imperial Governor around the time of the Galactic Civil War, was notable for going on thriftless wildlife hunts and disallowing the natives to grow their own food.
