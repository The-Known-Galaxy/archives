# Introduction
Agridorn was located in the Agridorn system of the Colonies region.
During the latter days of the Galactic Republic, Agridorn was represented in the Senate by Rhya Taloon.
She had pledged her world’s support to the Republic around the beginning of the Clone Wars.
However, once the Republic was transformed into the Galactic Empire, Senator Taloon fled to Coruscant to avoid assassination.
Despite these efforts, she was later discovered by a member of the Erased and was executed by stormtroopers.
