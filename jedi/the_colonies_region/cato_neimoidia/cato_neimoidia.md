# Introduction
Cato Neimoidia, a relatively unknown planet, was of significant importance in the famed Clone Wars.
 It was the political (and overall) epicentre of the Trade Federation which became a subsidiary of the Confederacy of Independent Systems who infamously rivaled the Galactic Republic and it’s Army of Clone soldiers.
Cato Neimoidia was the home to a rich species known as the Neimoidians (who were originally from the planet of Neimoidia) who colonised the planet and laid claim to it’s various unique features, which they would later build upon.
The colonisation of the planet meant that various palaces were built upon the planet's stone structures and would later house the Trade Federations richest leaders and influencers.
It was also the home to many influential figures within the Trade Federation, namely Nute Gunray who was a High-Rank in the Confederacy and Trade Federation respectively.

Cato Neimoidia’s most distinguishing features, however, were the constructions built on the planet and the thick layer of fog which covered the planet's lower-surface.
Beneath the fog there was a vast and acidic ocean of which multiple rock pillars, arches and other such structures would arise from it.
On the surface of these spires of rock would be home to the grasslands and forests of the planet.
Hammock-like structures would be strung between these various stone platforms dotted around the planet, within such structures you would find multiple buildings forming what are known as “bridge cities” which would make up the vast majority of the Neimoidians accommodations.
