# Introduction

Native to the planet of Naboo, millaflowers are a sight for sore eyes.
The wide petals of the beautiful plant are a crimson color, laced with a vivid blue around its edges and sports a small array of tame yellow colored filaments and anthers in its center.
This flower earned a huge reputation outside of Naboo as it was shipped as an exotic plant to those in social hierarchies on other planets within the galaxy.
Though gorgeous in it’s own right, it is also very potent.

The petals, if ground up into a fine powder, can be used as a muscle relaxer and if extracted properly, can be used as a tranquilizer.
This made it popular among the pharmacist community on Naboo, who were able to sell them in capsules by the batch for medicinal use.
Regardless, the plant was powerful, too much of it having adverse effects - and could result in heart failure if too much was present in one’s system.
At some point, even the Senate Subcommittee saw cases of poisoners using this for malicious intent, and heavily used in the drug trade - but even with this, the millaflower remained legal in trade both within Naboo space, and in the rest of the Galaxy.
