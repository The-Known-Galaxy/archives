In the year 5000 BBY the Sith starship, Omen, crashed on the planet of Kesh.
A Keshriri male named Gorem came into contact with the plates of the ship that were stained with Cyanogen silicate which came from the ship’s medical bay.
However, despite his efforts to thoroughly wash his hands after the encounter, he died minutes later.
The compound was also used by Sith Quartermaster Ravilan Wroth to poison the aqueducts of Tetsubal in 4985 BBY.
This backfired when he was framed by Seelah Korsin and her assistant, who got ahold of Wroth’s supply and used it to frame him for poisonings throughout the planet of Kesh.
After Wroth was framed, Kesh was purged entirely of it’s Sith purebloods.
In 3642 BBY, a xenopathologist by the name of Archiban “Doc” Kimble included the compound in his cure of a flesh-eating disease that had infected Hutt Suudaa Nem’ro.
