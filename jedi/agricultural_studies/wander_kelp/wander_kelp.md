# Introduction

Wander-kelp are a green, animal and plant based hybrid that is placed in the plant classification.
While wander-kelp are low in intelligence, the plant could do the basics of moving on their own will.
The species is native to the planet of Chad and can be raised on Chadâ€™s sea ranches.
The ranches harvested the wander-kelp leaves several times a year, since they contained a plentiful amount of iodine within them that could be distilled for medical use.
The rest of the leaf matter was used as an animal protein feed.
The wander-kelp species during their mating season is something to observe.
Wander-kelp develop internal phosphorescence, this method of phosphorescence production would make the plant glow a magnificent color.
