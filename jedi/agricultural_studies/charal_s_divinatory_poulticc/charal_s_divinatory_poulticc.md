# Introduction
Not a whole lot is known about the Poultice.
The Nightsister known as Charal, a marooned witch on Endor, created a poultice that helped divine and bless the future.
It consisted of a variety of strange recipes, such as the spleen of a Ewok, a drop of saliva from a Ewok fang, and various herbs from plants and trees from the forests of Endor.
She enlisted the help of a passing by spacer to gather all the ingredients for her during the time of the Galactic Civil War.
