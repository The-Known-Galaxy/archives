# Introduction

Senflax was a strong neurotoxin found within the jungles of Cadannia, inside the product of a plant.
It was used essentially as a sedative, emitting a pale yellow liquid.
It allowed the individual to remain alert while all sensations were anesthetized.
No vital organs were affected from the dosage.
Senflax could also disrupt a Force Sensitive from being able to use the Force.
