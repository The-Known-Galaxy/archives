# Introduction
Senflax was an extremely powerful pale yellow liquid that was used as a sedative poison, it caused the victim to lose all physical abilities, including major muscles, while still remaining conscious.
A single dose of this poison was enough to prevent force-sensitives from using their abilities due to senflax disrupting the required concentration to use the Force.
A dangerous plant that produced this poison could be found deep inside Cadannia’s dense jungles.
An Ambrian healer known as Caleb kept a supply of this poison in his cellar among many other herbs used for curing and healing purposes.
Ten years after the healer’s death, the poison stash was taken by Caleb’s daughter, Serra.
She handed a good amount of this organic poison to an assassin she had hired to aid her in her quest to track down the known Sith Lord, Darth Bane.
