The value of Corusca gems is made up of several factors, namely: it can only be found in a few select locations across the entire galaxy making it extremely rare.
The material in which it is made of is extremely resistant and can pierce through the hardest materials known making it excellent for mining.
It’s physical appearance was described as precious and beautiful, as looking it it was the same as looking into a fire.
The light reflected and refracted through it resembling the changing flames of a furnace.

Yavin Prime was one of the main known planets where these gems could be found.
The planet attracted Corusca Gem fisherman who would veer closer to the core where the pressure was higher, the higher the pressure the bigger the gem.
Notably, Bash Fateau was one of these fishermen who made a living off of these gems.

Interestingly, the gems had shatterpoints.
These were a complex Force phenomenon whereas multiple lines intersected.
This phenomenon existed and could be applied across many different fields including saber combat, and looking into the Force.
However, in this context, it’s used to describe the gem's weak points.
If enough lines intersected it created a weak point in the gem where even a tiny tap would make the gem crumble to pieces.

The gems were used for economic, industrial and decorative purposes considering their multifaceted nature.

Palpatine once used a bag of gems to attempt to win Anakin Skywalker over, arguing that through Palpatine, Skywalker could have whatever he wanted.
Though at the time, Skywalker was more concerned with saving his wife.
