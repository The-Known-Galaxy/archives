# Introduction

A fruit known as muja grew on bushes and trees and was edible.
It could be found on a lot of the galaxy's planets.
It was roughly the size of a fist, reddish-orange.
They were particularly successful on the planets Reytha, Kashyyyk, Naboo, the moons of Endor, and Krant.
The muja fruit can be used to make muja juice, muja muffins, donuts filled with muja fruit, and muja muffins.
A lot of planets, including Coruscant, sold them as well.
Bushes that produced muja fruit were harvested by labor droids and organic workers.

Fruit from muja trees was also kept in food processing facilities.
