# Introduction
The Gimer Bush was a plant that grew on numerous different planets.
It was known for growing in the mountains of Genesia, the second planet in the Genesia system of the Brak sector.
It was also known to grow in the planets Kashyyyk and Dagobah.
It also grew on the planet Ohma-D’un and was used for its sap which natives used to make into juice and medicine.
The gimer bush was mostly a rare plant and had little known uses.
The only thing that it’s known to be used for, was Jedi Master Yoda’s cane.
Yoda would often chew on his cane to consume its healthy nutrients and to also aid him in his meditation.
