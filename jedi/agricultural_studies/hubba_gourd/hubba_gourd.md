# Introduction
The Hubba Gourd was a melon that grew atop rocks on Tatooine.
The insides of the melon were difficult for Humans to drink, leaving many to stray away from the juice altogether; instead, its popularity came from the Jawas and Tusken Raiders that lived in abundance on the desert planet.
The name itself directly translates the Jawaese term for “The Staff of Life.”

Hubba Gourds typically grew in shadowed cliff faces.
The fruit came in many shapes, ranging from small and round to long and wide.
The Hubba Gourd can easily be mistaken for a crystal or rock due to its rugged nature and shiny reflective crystals dotted around the outer shell.


Inside, the fruit contained a sour, bitter, and often disgusting liquid.
This liquid was often challenging for a Human to digest and often got tossed aside or used as a last resort.


The Hubba Gourd was a perfect snack for both Jawas and Tusken Raiders, who enjoyed the sour and bitter liquid within, unlike Humans.
The first part of its name, Hubba, was Jawaese for “The Staff of Life.” This explains how much the Jawas loved this fruit, which was essential to their everyday diet.

Many other types of culinary delights were crafted using the Hubba Gourd.
These delicacies consisted of Hubba juice, Hubba bread, and Hubba chips, all of which were often found to be disgusting in the eyes of an average Human.
