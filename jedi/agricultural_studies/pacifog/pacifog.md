# Introduction
The Pacifog is a mind altering chemical weapon produced in a laboratory orbiting the planet Kandril by Imperial technology–Macrolyzer.

# Section 1
Darth Vader oversaw the production of Pacifog after the Battle of Yavin.
They envisioned the project to bring weaker qualities in individuals so that the Imperial forces will be able to take advantage of that characteristic.
In order to avoid the effects of the Pacifog, Vader ordered many of the Kunda Stones from a Kadrillian scientist, Dal Quirz.
Kunda Stones were usually used for lightsaber construction to increase blaster bolt deflection; medicine, and communications; but it also had the ability to alter the effects of the Pacifog.
Which eventually led to the creation of filter masks for the Stormtroopers.
Unknown to the Pacifog’s creators, the Pacifog caused a vital reaction to Human biology which turns flesh into a frothy ooze.
