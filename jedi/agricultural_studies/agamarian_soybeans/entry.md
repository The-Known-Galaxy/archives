Originating from Planet Agamar, the Agamarian Soybeans were a unique type of vegetable.
Planet Agamar resided in the Outer Rim Territories and was famously known for its Agriculture.

Agamar Sliders was a dish sold for 6.7 credits and involved sliced patties with Agamarian Soybeans.
You could have bought this dish at Dex’s Diner on the Planet Coruscant.
Vegetarians and Besalisks commonly ate this dish with a special Mugruebe spit sauce covering the sliced patty.
This dish was also served with a small portion of Binka fruit, which had its sauce to go with the full meal.
The dish was a well-known meal until the unfortunate destruction of Dex’s Diner during the first two years of the Galactic Empire’s Reign.
