# Introduction

Aura Blossoms were blue bioluminescent flowers that grew mainly on the Forest Moon of Endor.
The many Ewok who lived on the Moon loved the flower in mass.
The Ewoks commonly used Aura Blossoms as decoration for events or celebrations hosted by the Ewoks.

# Section 1

Three years after the Battle of Yavin, five young Ewoks were tasked with finding Aura Blossoms so they could be used for decorating the Festival of Hoods.
These young Ewoks were Wicket Wystri Warrick, Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka, Latara, and Teebo.
After searching for what seemed like forever, Warrick tripped and began to fall down a hill landing near a large group of bioluminescent beings.
Having mistaken these creatures as Aura Blossoms, Warrick would reach to grab them.
However, the creatures, or Wisties, would soon escape Warrick's grasp and take flight, fleeing the scene.
