# Introduction

Kolto, located solely on the planet of Manaan was a medicinal supply in high demand throughout the early stages of the galaxy.
Found deep within the oceans of Manaan, primarily within Hrakert Rift, Kolto was a quick healing medical agent, as well as primarily considered to be the predecessor of Bacta.
The species known as Selkath often harvested the ingredients, and provided sales to both sides of various wars between the Sith and Jedi.

# Section 1

Kolto was typically used through large Kolto tanks in which an individual would be fully submerged until their wounds were healed.
Kolto was the primary ingredient within modern medpacs of the early republic and sith empires, where they acted as first aid supplements.
During the later wars, usage of kolto was quickly modified into various different forms of usage, including gas and dart variants.

# Section 2

Kolto was quickly replaced by Bacta after the rise of the modern galactic republic due to a dwindling supply within the Manaan oceans.
Kolto became overly expensive and was quickly determined to be less effective than bacta.
Falling to the backburner, itâ€™s lack of sales lead to a collapse of the economy on Manaan.
