# Introduction

Anoat was one of three livable planets in the Anoat system, located in the titular Anoat sector.
An Anoat Oat was a safe to eat plant species of cereal which could be consumed by members of the Besalisk species.
Anoat Oats could be eaten with two strips of Nuna bacon, like they did at the Besalisk chef Dexter Jettster’s eatery, Dex’s Diner in the CoCo Town district of Coruscant.
Anoat Oats were almost the best breakfast of the Pantoran plate special, hence why they costed 4.7 credits.
Anoat Oats were served at Dex’s until the diner’s demolition during the Galactic Empire’s rule.
