# Introduction

An irksome flora able to grow up to 1 meter tall, razor grass could be found on Corellia, Togoria, and Relkass.
Each blade of razor glass looked and felt featureless.
Despite this, they possessed minuscule barbs able to penetrate cloth and flesh effortlessly.
Due to this, razor grass was painless but lethal.
It was possible to sustain cuts from the dangerous plant without realizing the bleeding for minutes.
Razor grass bore no effect on duraplast and other reinforced construction materials.
However, they tended to leave unattractive abrasions on speeders built from low-grade metals.
