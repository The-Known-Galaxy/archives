# Section 1
In 0 ABY, at a point in time, the Ho’Din art dealer Tal Anavere began to sell herbal tea to high-placed clients of the Galactic Empire.
Unbeknownst to the clients, she used her amazing skills to cultivate addictive qualities into the tea.
She did this to get information from the Empire clients while they were under the influence and passed this information to the Rebel Alliance.
While she was doing her work, Alliance General Airen Cracken noted down Tal Anavere to an addendum detailing her actions of using the herbal tea to gather information, but eventually decided that the atrocious acts that the Imperial bureaucrats committed were more grave than Tal Anavere’s method of gathering information.
