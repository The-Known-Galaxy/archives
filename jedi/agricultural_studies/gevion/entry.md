# Introduction

The Gevion, a combination reaper, served as both the colonists' residence and means of transportation on the planet Leritor.
South of the Bleak mountain range, adjacent to Leritor's main continent's eastern shore, the Gevion cultivated plains.
The Settlement Agreement between the settlers and the local Sauvax species would be broken if the Gevion Captain did this, thus he avoided doing so.

# Section 1

A Dark Side Adept named Profex Rynalla raided a Sauvax hamlet (or kuuvan) and a combination reaper Nellist in order to torture people and ignite a conflict between the Sauvax and the settlers.
The Gevion's crew believed the Sauvax had attacked the Nellist, but they were mistaken.

# Section 2

Soon after, another Sauvax kuuvan surrounded the Gevion and established camp in a useful field since it believed Humans were behind the attack on the Sauvax.
However, they stopped the Sauvax, who was only menacing but not warlike, from harvesting a crop that the Gevion would have otherwise reaped and lost, costing the Gevion crew their combine reaper.

# Section 3

No one offered to be the ambassador that the Sauvax tevelor sought to parlay face to face because the Gevion crew was scared of the Sauvax, who reportedly assaulted the Nellist without provocation.
Accidentally insulting the Sauvax in the process, the Gevion crew tried to shout from a lower maintenance hatch.

# Section 4

Then the Gevion captain issued a distress call, to which some nearby offworlders responded.
The Gevion was able to resume her previous activities without suffering any harm, thanks to the offworlders' offer to mediate between the factions.
