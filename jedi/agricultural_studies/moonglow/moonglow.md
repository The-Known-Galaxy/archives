# Introduction

Found only in a single grove of trees on a small satellite world more than a hundred lightyears from Coruscant, Moonglow was a pear-like fruit the size of a Human fist that was highly prized for its unique taste and properties.

# Section 1

The flesh of Moonglow was crisp and delicious, but it also contained a highly toxic poison that could kill a thousand beings within a minute if consumed in its raw form.
This made the fruit highly dangerous yet also highly desirable among the wealthy and powerful who were willing to take the risk.

# Section 2

A unique and intricate process had to be followed to prepare Moonglow for consumption.
This process consisted of 97 steps, and it took a minimum of 2 years for a chef to learn from a Master Moonglow Chef before they could obtain a license to prepare it themselves.
Restaurants that chose to serve Moonglow had to display their support, which indicated to patrons that the chefs who worked there had been trained in the preparation.
This was necessary because if one step was omitted or performed in error, the entire process was forfeited, and the Moonglow would become deadly.

The rarity and difficulty in preparing Moonglow made it a highly sought-after delicacy, with each fruit costing a thousand credits.
This made it a luxury only affordable to the wealthiest and most influential individuals in the galaxy.
One such individual was the crime lord Xizor, who prided himself on having enough wealth to eat Moonglow at his leisure.
On his payroll, he had the most respected Moonglow chef in the galaxy and generally ate the fruit three or four times a month.

# Section 3

The danger associated with consuming Moonglow made it all the more desirable for some, as it added an element of excitement and risk to the experience.
But for others, the Moonglow symbolized wealth and power, a delicacy that only the elite could afford and enjoy.
It was a fruit that was both deadly and delicious, an actual test of one's wealth and power.
