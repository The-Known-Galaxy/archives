# Introduction

The Century Flower was a rare species of plant located on the farther side of the galaxy from Thustra.
King Alaric had Century Flowers in his garden on Thustra and had nurtured them for a century.
Alaric took very good care of these flowers and made sure that they were kept completely out of harm's way, he even prevented weeds from growing too close.
Alaric wanted to keep Thustra peaceful, so he explained to Yoda why he had no intentions of participating in the Clone Wars by using his garden as a metaphor.
