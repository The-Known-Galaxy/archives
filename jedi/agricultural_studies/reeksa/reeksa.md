# Introduction

The reeksa is a carnivorous plant species that grows and survives in the low-light areas of the planet Legoâ€™s canyons.
Reeksa had a very predatory style of capturing their prey and digesting them, similar to the style of snakes found on Dagobah or Rodia.
An interesting fact about these plants is their roots, the root of a reeksa was a required ingredient in the remedy for the Blue Shadow Virus.
Reeksa were always green, also being equipped with deadly thorns that sprouted along their stalk and razor-sharp spikes for teeth.
These tools in its arsenal and the advantage of the dim canyons made their presence a dangerous one to keep in mind when traversing in their area of Lego.
