# Introduction

The Jogan Fruit was a round, urn-shaped fruit with a purple outer coloring, marked with crinkled white stripes running along the surface of the fruit.
The fruit secreted orange juices and was topped with purplish leaves along the top of the fruit, opposite a conical stem.
Green leaves could also sometimes be seen along the side of the fruit.

Jogan Fruit could be found from Coruscant to Felucia, covering a large portion of the galaxy.
Alternatively, Jogan Fruit could also be found in swampland territory in Rodia.
The culinary usages of Jogan Fruit were limited, but a notable one was Jogan Fruitcake, a pastry dessert that was a multi-tiered cake with each tier topped with berries.
The final tier was then topped with a whole Jogan Fruit on the final tier.
The fruitcake was served at a banquet honoring Senator Aang, a Roonan male Senator who served during the Clone Wars.
