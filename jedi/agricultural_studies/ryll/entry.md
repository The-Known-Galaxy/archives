# Introduction

Part I
Ryll was a type of mineral that could be found on the planet of Ryloth where the Twi’lek species originated from.
At the beginning of ryll’s discovery the Hutt species enslaved the Twi’lek to mine ryll which they would then sell or turn to herbs before selling.
The ryll was usually turned to herbs which can be mixed with other herbs for the medication.
One of the most used recipe for a medication which included ryll was to mix the herb with glitterstim to make glitteryll which made people forget most of their recent memories.
It was also found in small amounts in other planets before it was found on Ryloth with an example being Naos III and Ylesia.
Most of the time it was very common to just find ryll related medications on the underground market which was a way to buy products that are usually unbuyable or illegal.
