# Introduction

BACKGROUND
Agronomy relates to the process of utilising science and technology to upgrade the functionality of plants and agriculture.
This includes recreational uses, land restoration and in this context, war.

Agronomy has only been recorded once officially in Jedi records.
The Nuiwit species of Altor 14, who are well versed in agronomy, plagued the Avogwi with a tarpaulin plant.
They made the plant excrete an enzyme that attracted Avogwi who believed it to be water.
The planet would actually lure them in, then glue them to the surrounding ground patches as the enzyme was sticky.
The planet would then devour the Avogwi with it’s victims trapped inside.

Souleth’s author note: Agronomy is a very light studied concept, but an incredibly interesting one that should be regulated further by the Jedi.
Tactically speaking, Agronomy should be taught to a specialised clone force to utilise on planets like Naboo.
