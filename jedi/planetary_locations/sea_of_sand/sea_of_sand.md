# Introduction
The Sea of Sand was located in the southern hemisphere of the desolated planet Ponemah Terminal.
The planet’s most notable feature was the Separatist cruiser Obrexta III, which was damaged by the Republic.
The ship’s crew put the ship into a blind hyperspace jump, where it would crash on the planet.

The planet itself had incredibly dangerous areas, which is why the entire region of the planet remained uninhabited.
The fifteen-meter-high sand surges that never stopped and kept moving up, down, and up made the Sand Sea dangerous because they eventually caused the lava vents under the crust to erupt.
The planet's actual oxygen was filled with a persistent iron storm, which caused many organisms that may have survived there to go extinct and leave the world deadly and uninhabited.
