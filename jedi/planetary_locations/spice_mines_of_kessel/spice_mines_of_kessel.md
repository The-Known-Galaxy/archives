# Introduction

Located on the planet Kessel, a medium-sized planet located in the Outer Rim, the Spice mines of Kessel, more commonly called The Dark by senior miners was a string of large servant-powered labor camps which produced a substance called spice.
These mines had a very high death rate, and as such the servants had a high turn-over rate, with new servants coming in regularly.

# Section 1

An average humanoid was expected to be able to survive a maximum of three years in the mines, with Wookies usually only lasting three months.
It is entirely likely that the Spice mine’s labor workers depended strongly on the state of the servant trade.
There was a notable amount of Wookiees working in the mines, which is likely due to the high amount of servant labor among Wookiees during the time of the mines.

# Section 2

Due to the profit which came from the operations, the local regent, Yaruba, refused to do anything about the illegal mining.
He worked in hand with the Pyke Syndicate, allowing them to perform many illicit activities on Kessel, reaping a portion of the profits for himself and his family.
It is not known who started the mines, or the exact methods used to maintain them; however, it is likely the mines received equipment and funding from the Yaruba family.

# Section 3

The Spice mines of Kessel were used as a sort of execution camp by the Empire during the time of Darth Vader, as seen by the subjugation of Nakari Kelen’s mother, due to her musical piece mocking Darth Vader’s prosthetics.
The entire band Hakkle Drazlip and the Tootle Froots was also sent to the mines for performing the aforementioned song.

There were multiple cases of the mines being raided.
Take for example when Han Solo and his crew assaulted the mines, in order to steal shipments of the mineral coaxium, allowing them to pay off a debt.
Another example is when a group of Wookiees was rescued by a group of rebels known as the Spectres.
