# Introduction

An entirely artificial tibanna gas mining colony called Cloud City, home to millions of employees, visitors, and support personnel, were perched over the gas giant Bespin.
The station was in Bespin's Life Zone.
There was no need for airlocks or life support equipment because the atmosphere was primarily oxygen, and the gravity and temperature were suitable.

# Section 1

The station's disk measured roughly sixteen point two kilometers in diameter and was fifty-nine thousand kilometers above the Bespin core.
Thirty-six thousand repulsor lift engines and tractor-beam generators held the massive city in the air.
Together with platforms and rooms for inhabitants and guests, it had three hundred ninety-two floors.
The city's lower levels housed laborers and provided space for the tibanna gas mining and processing.
In contrast, the upper fifty levels were used as a luxurious resort, noted for its casinos like Yarith Bespin and Pair O'Dice.
Because of the city's regulated environment, people could forget about the weather.

# Section 2

Due to the mining and tourism industries, Cloud City has a significant security demand.
Tight visa regulations were in place, and unknown vessels were found and stopped.
The city was shielded from near-space bombardment by a shield generator.
The Bespin Wing Guard patrolled the sky around the city and maintained vigilance.

# Section 3

Baron Administrator served as the mayor of Cloud City.
Lando Calrissian received the job at some point in the Age of the Empire.
The human Lobot managed the facility's daily operations.
Once Calrissian left, a council of business representatives governed the city.
