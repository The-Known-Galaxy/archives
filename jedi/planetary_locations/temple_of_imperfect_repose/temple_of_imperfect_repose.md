# Introduction
The Temple of Imperfect Repose was a sanctuary built by the members of the Jedi Order on the planet Vaklin, located in the Inner Rim.
The temple was often used as a place of offerings, and served as the main Jedi enclave on the planet, allowing the Knights to recruit countless young, Force-sensitive natives from the world, and training them into becoming the Jedi.

# Section 1
Vaklin, the planet on which the Jedi Temple was built, was a world full of cliffs and rocks.
It possessed a Type I  breathable atmosphere, a dry environment, and a wide range of desert fauna living on its surface.
Many cave systems and canyons would serve as places to hide from the sun, though the main cities and settlements of Vaklin were built on cliff sides and flat pieces of terrain.
The planet had been discovered, and colonised, by Trivak Ninegun, who also initiated the Jedi Order’s plans to populate and use Vaklin as their outpost.
Despite a rising depopulation due to the world’s harsh conditions, the Jedi successfully encouraged many races such as Togrutas, Twi’leks, Zabraks, and Rodians to create their own conclaves,  with the human race still being a majority, similarly to many other colonised planets.

The Jedi Temple on Vaklin was created on the edge of Howling Ruins, an ancient and abandoned city.
As a prime example of the Jedi architecture, the facility had a shape of a square, mostly painted light grey due to the planet’s strong solar heat.
The main hallway was supported by ancient Jedi statues.
Once inside, its visitors would find themselves lost among many tunnels and portals, lighted by the Jedi stonework lamps, mosaics, and illuminating crystals.
Because of its planetary location, the Temple of Imperfect Repose was said to be filled with tunnels and caves.



# Section 3
The temple’s history began during the age of the Old Republic when the planet was discovered by the Jedi.
After hundreds of years of cooperation, the natives grew attached to the Jedi present on the planet and never hesitated to support them in any way.
During the Great Jedi Purge, the Vaklinese successfully resisted Imperial propaganda and even initiated a small resistance movement led by Cho’na Bene- a Myneyrysh survivor of Order 66.
Shortly afterwards, the rebel cell was targeted by the Galactic Empire and Darth Vader himself was sent to defeat the rogue Jedi.
The resistance forces engaged Vader’s soldiers in a few short ambushes, but the Dark Lord soon discovered the rebels’ base and ordered an orbital bombardment of the whole planet, followed by an operation aimed to destroy all Jedi relics and mementos on Vaklin.
Bene himself fought Vader in the temple’s ruins, but he was forced to retreat.
Vader allowed the wounded enemy to escape, only to watch him seek help in a nearby city.
Even though they initially supported Bene’s movement, the Vaklinese citizens had been turned against the Jedi by Vader’s cruel and merciless campaign and did not aid him.
Instead, many of them gathered and watched the helpless, abandoned Jedi as he was publicly shot on the city square by an Imperial Security Bureau agent.
