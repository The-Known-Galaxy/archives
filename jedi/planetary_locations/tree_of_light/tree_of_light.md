# Introduction
The Tree of Light was a unique plant, native to the forest moon of the planet Endor, found mainly on the Mountain of Light.
It was a sacred place of worship to the Ewoks inhabiting the Bright Tree village located nearby.
Besides its ceremonial role, the Tree of Light also served as a destination for the ritualistic journeys of many young Ewok warriors, who were tasked with safekeeping and revitalising it.

# Section 1
Ewoks from the Bright Tree village believed that the Tree’s presence would protect them from the Night Spirit- an eternal enemy of the Ewoks.
Similarly to the Bright Tree, the Night Spirit was the prime object of the Cult of the Dulok, another native species of Endor.
Ewoks and Dulok would actively disturb each other during the Bright Tree expeditions.
 To assure the Tree’s reliability and power, the Ewok village chief would dispatch small groups of young warriors, who would fill the Tree of Light with Light Dust, prepared by the Ewok shaman, and revive its full strength.
The most famous warriors who travelled to the Tree and returned were Wicket, Teeboo, and Paploo.



# Section 2
The forest moon of Endor possessed forests, mountains, and several lakes.
The Mountain of Light itself was considered one of the tallest peaks in the area, which made it a perfect pilgrimage destination next to its location near the Bright Tree village.
The same village was known to have given the Rebel Alliance its support during the Battle of Endor.
Another important object associated with the Tree of Light was the famous Valley of Floating Trees.
This area, as the name described, was a valley full of clouds, surrounded by a mysterious fog that created an illusion of many levitating trees.
It was crossed by many Ewok warriors who travelled to the Tree.
