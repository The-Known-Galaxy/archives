# Introduction

The place named ‘Chasm’ was a large canyon located within the mountains of Tython, inside the continent of Talss.
Chasm was an unending canyon that went through the whole of the mountains on Tython.
Chasm was produced by the Force, specifically the Force Storms along with the anomalous phenomena.
The Force storms were routinely located within the depths of the canyon.
These Force Storms caused vital problems within the Chasm, such as substantial water issues around the temple and notable places being catastrophically destroyed.
