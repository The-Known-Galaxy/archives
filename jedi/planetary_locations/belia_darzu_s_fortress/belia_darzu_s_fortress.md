# Introduction
Belia Darzu’s Fortress was a military facility on the planet Tython.
The Fortress was square in shape and built from black durasteel.
The Fortress contained multiple labs where the Sith Lord would experiment with Sith alchemy.
The Fortress was also home to creatures called Technobeasts.
The Fortress also held in its depths, the personal Holocron of its creator, Belia Darzu.

# Section 1
Belia Darzu was a Dark Lord of the Sith during the New Sith Wars.
She was a female Shi’ido who frequently appeared as a Human woman.
Belia brought the Sith Order back from nothing, after studying Sith alchemy for a considerably long time, the Dark Lord created a virus that would transform people into mutations which she called Technobeasts.
Within the laboratories in her fortress, she created an army of these Technobeats.

Belia used the Fortress to train her Sith acolytes; however, this would eventually be her undoing as she would eventually be assassinated by the Mecrosa Order.
The Mecrosa Order would poison Belia after she would intrude into the Tapani sector.



# Section 2
Even with Belia gone, the Fortress would stay standing and functional for centuries after centuries, protected by the Technobeasts within, as well as by two automated ion cannons on top of two parallel pillars.
The Technobeasts within the Fortress would continue to wander the empty halls.
Other than that, no one else inhabited the Fortress; it stood, abandoned.


Over time, the energy released by Belia’s Holocron would increase eventually, drawing in the Technobeasts.
They would come to surround the Holocron.
Eventually, the Fortress would be discovered by a collector of Sith Artifacts and then by Darth Bane, a survivor of the New Sith Wars.
Bane would enter the Fortress in search of the Holocron.
However, upon entering, Bane would be swarmed with the existing Technobeasts.
These creatures stood no chance against Bane and his apprentice, as they would destroy each one.

They would, however, be forced to lock themselves in the Fortress as they had been hunted by a group of Jedi Knights and Masters.
With the only way out being through a lightsaber duel, Bane and Zannah would ignite and fight their way out, killing all the Jedi Knights and Masters that had pursued them.
