# Introduction

The Undercity was the region below the city, Sundari, in Mandalore.
The Galactic Republic launched an attack on the Undercity of Sundari, when it was discovered that Maul had not just hidden themselves there, but had also taken control of the city.
When Maul’s super commandos found a stronger resistance than they thought, Prime Minister Almec told them to meet Maul in the undercity.
Ashoka Tano and the Clone Captain CT-0292 “Vaughn '' unknowingly led Republic forces into a trap, in which Vaughn was killed and Ashoka was confronted by Maul.
