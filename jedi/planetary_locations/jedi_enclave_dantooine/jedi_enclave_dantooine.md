# Introduction
In the midst of a Jedi Knight shortage in 4017 BBY, Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas sought out a desirable planet to construct another academy alongside the main one in Coruscant which would train only the most promising Jedi of the future.
While exploring the planet of Dantooine, he came across a cave filled with naturally occurring crystals that were key in constructing one's lightsaber.
Seeing this, he would deem the planet fit to house a brand new academy only for the most promising Jedi, and would quickly construct it, giving it the name Enclave.

# Section 1
In time, there would be a Jedi Council assigned to the Enclave to oversee it and to make sure its students and teachers were upheld by the Jedi Code.
This council was a subset of the main Jedi High Council in Coruscant.
In the decades that followed the academy prospered under the leadership of the Council.
However tensions rose within the academy during the Mandalorian Wars, as the Council decided to not assist the Republic in their war efforts, and students within the academy found this unacceptable.
Jedi Revan alongside his close pupil Alek led a group of Jedi that turned to hundreds of Jedi to fight the Mandalorians, eventually leading to the defeat of the Mandalorians, and the Galaxy deemed Jedi Knights Revan and Alek as saviors of the Republic.



# Section 2
After the war, Alek and Revan disappeared, all the while the Enclave flourished as a key point in the community.
The Enclave would house landing facilities, and shops, and offer the locals a safe space from the raiders and dangerous wildlife.
However, Jedi Knight Revan and Alek would return from their absence, not as peacekeepers of the Galaxy, but as members of the Dark Order of the Sith.
Revan and Malak would then declare a civil war upon the Jedi Order, and the Jedi Council had to act quickly.
The council sent an assault upon Revan and Malak, capturing Revan in the process and manipulating his mind so that he could be trained once again under the light side of the Force, in hopes that he would defeat his former pupil Darth Malak.
After his training was complete, Revan and two other Jedi Knights departed off of Dantooine in an attempt to stop Darth Malak.



# Section 3
Soon after Revan left the Enclave, Malak would return to Dantooine in 3956 BBY and ordered the orbital bombardment of the Enclave.
In only a few minutes, the Enclave would be destroyed at the hand of Malak, killing most of its occupants in the process.
Left ruined and pillaged, the Enclave was stained with the deaths of many Jedi, turning the planet of Dantooine into a cloak for Force users.
Many years later, Jedi historian Deesra Luur Jada returned to the Enclave to see what remained, and after discovering the bodies of the Council members, she determined that the Enclave could never be rebuilt, and should be left as is.
Efforts later on in time to revitalize the academy, however, would never fall through, and the legacy of the Enclave was viewed as a scar on the Jedi Order.
