# Introduction

Beggar’s Canyon is located on the sandy planet of Tatoonie.
The canyon was formed when Tatoonie was still covered in water, where three rivers made a junction.
Creating a large amount of vegetation.
It was also home to the canyon krayt dragon, as well as womp rats.
The canyon was also once a home to hermits, however, the residents of Mos Espa rooted them out of the canyon.
A noteworthy structure within the canyon is a rock formation inside the canyon called Stone Needle, the rock formation rose to 18.2 meters and was often a route racers would use in the Boonta Eve Classic podrace.

# Section 1

The canyon has an interesting history relating to racing.
Where both podraces took place in the canyon, such as the earlier mentioned Boonta Eve Classic.
As well as racing in T-16 Skyhoppers.
During the Boonta Eve Classic podrace in 32 BBY, Anakin Skywalker raced through the canyon and was launched several hundred feet in the air from a ramp he was forced onto.
Being the first to survive the ramp and landing in first place in front of Sebulba.

# Section 2

A training center was also located here during the Galactic Civil War for Rebel pilots.
The base was named Anchorhead Base and it is where Luke Skywalker learned to fly.
It was also here where Luke raced against his peers in T-16 Skyhoppers, these peers later becoming Rogue Squadron.
Luke and Wedge Antilles both damaged their Skyhoppers, however would use these skills that they developed here to fight for the Rebellion later on in the Battle of Yavin , where the trench on the Death Star was similar to that of Beggar’s Canyon.
The base itself was destroyed by TIE fighters, while training pilots were hidden in the canyon due to their training.
The TIEs were later destroyed by the trainees.
