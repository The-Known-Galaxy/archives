# Introduction

The Foundry was a space station built into a giant asteroid in the mid rim of the highly forgotten Nanth’ri system.
The station is said to be at least anywhere between twenty and thirty thousand years old, built by the Rakata.
Its assessment matched three other space stations discovered by the Sith Empire that all had tremendous power.
One of those stations included the Star Forge, a massive automated shipyard.
The Foundry itself though was known as an engineering wonder with at least twelve different engineering levels that were all capable of producing thousands of droids.
A number of tunnels were around the asteroid suggesting the Foundry used Automated Mining Droids to excavate the inside of the asteroid for useful ores.
On top of this, it is believed there were a number of tractor beams used to both capture and break down asteroids nearby.
It was never known just what the full extent of the Foundry’s production capabilities were but despite this many believed it to be able to change the entire galaxy.
One person aware that the Foundry existed was Revan who kept the knowledge hidden from the Sith Emperor.
Once he was recused he tried to use the Foundry to unleash an extermination droid army against the Emperor, however, was stopped and defeated by a strike force.
Many Foundry capabilities after the battle were incorporated into the Emperor’s personal Space Station.
