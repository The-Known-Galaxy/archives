# Introduction

Garel City was the only major city located in the Outer Rim planet Garel.
It housed Empire-supporting families under false identities, notably the Leonis and Spanjaf families.
Additionally, Garel City housed the Phoenix cell after they fled the planet of Lothal.
However, the Phoenix cell were again driven away, due to the Empire attacking and damaging the city after learning about the Rebel forceâ€™s base there.
