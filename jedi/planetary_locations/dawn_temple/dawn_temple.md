# Introduction
The Dawn Temple was built by the Jedi Order to be a secluded haven for Jedi who were losing touch with the light side of the Force.
The temple was placed on the planet Spintir and built high on Mount Tellec.
Its name comes from the purpose it was built for, as those who visited it would find themselves back in the light.

# Section 1
The temple found its greatest use during the Clone Wars.
It was a gruelling time for the Republic and the Jedi Order.
Many Jedi found it difficult to stay within the light, and the temple began seeing more use for those wishing to stay connected to it.
Jedi who were seen to have gotten very close or possibly even stepped into the dark side would be placed in stasis fields.
This allowed their mind to stay open but their body to be stuck, leaving the Jedi to search for the path back into the light.
The temple, however, would be abandoned during the Great Jedi Purge, as all its staff would be killed during it.
Any Jedi, such as Rav Naaran who were in the stasis fields would find themselves stuck, unable to set themselves free.



# Section 2
When it came to the temple and its staff, instead of a vast staff, the temple relied on three different intelligences recorded in holocrons: the Curator, the Jailor, and the Warden.
The Curator assumed the silvery-blue shape of an old Cerean male dressed in plain Jedi robes.
He was in charge of the temple's day-to-day operations and oversaw the temple's records and archives.
The Warden took the shape of a female Zabrak and oversaw the temple's external and internal defenses, as well as combat training routines and the procedure for constructing a lightsaber.
She appeared to be formed of golden light, with a topknot emerging from a crown of horns, armoured Jedi robes, and a lightsaber in her hands.
The Jailor was created from pure white light, taking on the appearance of a short, elderly male Miraluka.
He was created to supervise the rehabilitation of the fallen Jedi and has the ability to override the directives of the other two intelligences.
They were assisted by caretakers who would mainly oversee travelling to cities, bringing supplies back to the temple for the Jedi, and generally taking care of their wellbeing.
