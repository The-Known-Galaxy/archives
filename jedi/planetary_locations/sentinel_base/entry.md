# Introduction

Located in the Outer Rim region, Sentinel Base was an Imperial Outpost comprised of multiple domes, hangars, landing fields and shield generators.
It was built to oversee all other bases guarding the Death Star during its construction and was protected by numerous capital ships.
The base was one of the most important fortresses that the Empire manned, and so for most of its history it was overseen by Grand Moff Tarkin.

# Section 1

Deployed by order of the Chancellor, Sentinel Base started as a pre-fabricated structure deployed from orbit by a Victory Class star destroyer in 21 BBY.
It was designed to oversee the planning and construction of the first Death Star near the planet of Geonosis.
It served in a highly limited capacity due to the nature of its operations, and would only be expanded later in history.

# Section 2

After the fall of the Republic, the base was taken over by the Imperial Military under the jurisdiction of Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit.
The base ran smoothly under his control, ensuring the continued development of the Death Star and connected bases.
This lasted until 17 BBY, when the Vice Admiral would be promoted to the head of Naval Intelligence with, at the time, Moff-Tarkin taking charge.
This was mainly due to the failure of Director Krennic, who had managed to lose the lead Scientist, Galen Erso.

In 14 BBY, the base was attacked by a band of rebels with low-grade separatist and makeshift starships.
This was a surprise to the operation staff, as the base was meant to be highly classified, though didnâ€™t give much concern given the ease that the rebels were defeated with.
All that would survive of the attacking rebel fleet would be a single capital ship, which managed to escape into hyperspace badly damaged.
The base would be discontinued after the fall of the Empire.
