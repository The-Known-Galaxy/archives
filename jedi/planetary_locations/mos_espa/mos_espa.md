# Introduction
Mos Espa was a port city located on Tatooine.
Located in a crater, it was a relatively large city.
It contained many houses and buildings for various needs.
Some of these buildings, such as the Mos Espa Grand Arena, were very large and were able to hold most of the city’s population.
Mos Espa was home to the Boonta Eve Classic podrace.
Mos Espa was also controlled by the Hutts, making servitude a popular practice.
One infamous business owner, Watto, was the former owner of the legendary Jedi Anakin Skywalker.

# Section 1
Before the Clone Wars started, Mos Espa was visited by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, Queen Amidala, Jar-Jar Binks, and R2-D2.
They were in need of repairs on their starship.
There, they met Anakin Skywalker, who took them back to his home due to a sandstorm.
The Jedi Master took a blood sample of Anakin, returning a midi-chlorian count higher than any other Jedi.
This made Qui-Gon believe that Anakin was the chosen one.
Qui-Gon immediately went to free Anakin, gambling on a podrace with Watto.
Anakin won the race beating the champion Sebulba.
With his freedom, he left Tatooine to train as a Jedi.
	
Years later, the young Jedi returned to the city in search of his mother.
He went to Watto, who informed him that he had sold his mother to Cliegg Lars.
He also informed him that Cliegg had freed and married his mother.
Anakin, after learning where Cliegg resided, left in search of his mother.
Long after this event, nine years after the Battle of Yavin, the mayor of Mos Espa, Mok Shaiz sent for a tribute to Boba Fett who had taken over Jabba’s criminal empire.
The bounty hunter refused, and the mayor informed him that he would send more men to collect his tribute.
