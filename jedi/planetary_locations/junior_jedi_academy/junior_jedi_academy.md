# Introduction

After his wedding, Luke Skywalker altered the instruction schedule of his Yavin training center to accommodate the training of younger students.
In doing so, he was inspired by his former Master, Yoda, who'd taught him that younger students were easier to train.
To this end, he established a Junior Jedi Academy in 22 ABY.
In that same year, Jedi trainees Anakin Solo and Tahiri Veila discovered the ancient Jedi Master Ikrit and freed the trapped Massassi souls within the Golden Globe, a dark side device created by the Dark Lord Exar Kun in 3,997 BBY to drain the souls of the trapped Massassi to fuel his powers.
These two Jedi along with Tionne Solusar, Uldir Lochett, and R2-D2 also discovered the Holocron of the ancient Jedi Asli Krimsan at Bast Castle on Vjun, and Kenobi's lightsaber and thwarted Orloc's attempts to start his own Jedi Order.
Later that year, Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker traveled to the Unknown Regions to locate the wreckage of the disastrous Old Republic Outbound Flight expeditionary fleet in an inaccessible region of space known as the Redoubt.
They were accompanied by Chiss Aristocra Formbi, Commander Chak Fel of the Empire of the Hand and New Republic envoy Dean Jinzler who wanted to honor his late Jedi sister by visiting the wreck, and several Geroons who wished to pay their respects to the Jedi who had freed them from their cruel Vagaari masters.

However, upon reaching the site of the wreckage on a planetoid within the Redoubt, they discovered that the survivors had formed a colony and that the Geroons were actually the Vagaari themselves, who had come to avenge their defeat at the Chiss decades earlier.
However, the two Jedi along with the Chiss, Empire of the Hand, and the survivors of the Outbound Flight defeated the Vagaari and drove them away.
In 23 ABY, the Jedi Order was faced with the Shadow Academy (Dark Jedi training ground founded by Brakiss) and its ally: the Second Imperium which rejected the Pellaeon?
Gavrisom Treaty signed between the Imperial Remnant and the New Republic in 19 ABY.
The Second Imperium kidnapped Jedi trainees, including Luke's niece and nephew, Jaina and Jacen Solo, and their friend Lowbacca, from Luke's Jedi Order and then went recruiting disadvantaged youth when that failed with the Solo twins and Lowie's rescue by the Solo's close friend Tenel Ka.
The Second Imperium was led by four Imperial Guards masquerading as Emperor Palpatine.

# Section 2

During an assault on the Jedi Praxeum, the Second Imperium and the Shadow Academy were defeated by Luke's Jedi trainees, thus removing an obstacle to the New Jedi Order.
In 24 ABY, the Jedi Order encountered the alien-supremacist anti-Human Diversity Alliance which sought to punish the Human species for the atrocities of the New Order.
The Diversity Alliance attempted to stockpile weapons and locate the location of the Emperor's Plague warehouse for their war against Humans.
However, they too would be defeated by the Jedi.
This was followed by Czethros's attempts to return the crime syndicate Black Sun to its former glory and dominate the galaxy.
However, he too was defeated by the Jedi.
