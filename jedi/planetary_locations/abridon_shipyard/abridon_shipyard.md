# Introduction
The Abridon Shipyard was located on the planet of Abridon.
The shipyard itself was located off the coast of the mainland, on an island that was connected to the mainland through causeways.
The shipyard notably produced A-Wing fighters, which were used by the Rebel Alliance in the war against the Galactic Empire.
The planet had plenty of history during the time of the Empire, relating to the shipment of A-Wings sent toward the Republic in return for aiding the Nationalists of Abridon in fighting back against the Empire.

# Section 1
3 years after the Battle of Yavin, Nationalists on Abridon seized control of the planet, which was previously controlled by the Galactic Empire.
As expected, the Empire responded immediately.
This drove the Nationalists into the Government Center, pushing the forces provided by the Rebel Alliance off the planet.
There were many fights between the Empire and the Nationalists, occasionally occurring in the streets.
One of the commanders who had helped reconquer the planet, joined the Rebels.
 Due to this, he captured the Government Center, rescuing the leader of the Abridon Nationalists.
The leader of the Nationalists requested the Rebel Alliance to assist in their fight to free Sayan, an industrial city on Abridon, in exchange for A-Wing fighters.
Thus, the Nationalists were able to regain control of the shipyard, delivering the A-Wing fighters to the Republic unscathed.
