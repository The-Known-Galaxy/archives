# Introduction
The Temple of the Ancients was a large temple built on the surface of Lehon.
However, many would often call it the Temple of the Elders as well.
It held many secrets on the Star Forge behind it’s doors, which was an automated shipyard owned by the Infinite Empire.
Anyone who tried to get in though, couldn’t.
This is because the doors were blocked by an eerie force field that only the builder and creator could take down using a unique ritual or tomb.
Even so, the force field wouldn’t stay down long enough for many to get in.
The structure of the Lehon temple was around twenty meters tall and the right top was known as “The Summit.” Thousands of years later, Darth Bane would arrive at the temple to seek its power and knowledge.
He would get inside with no hesitation and find the holocron of Darth Revan in the lowest sublevel.
The Darth would begin to study this holocron extensively until its power got drained and fully died.

This information inside would help him form the Order of the Sith Lords, which would eventually begin the Old Republic era.
Eventually, Bane would go to the Temple of Ancients once again and find the Sith Lord Kas’im.
This would make them engage in a duel that would protract and move them to the outside steps of the Temple.
Bane from here would be able to kill Kas’im by striking him down with a powerful blow using the energy of the force.
The entrance of the Temple would collapse behind him due to this and he would depart immediately.
Sadly, no further information is none about the Temple of Elders after this
