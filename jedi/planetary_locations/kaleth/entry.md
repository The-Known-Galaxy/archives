# Introduction

Kaleth, or the Temple of Knowledge, was one of the nine temples on Tython's lush and deadly world.
For many decades, the temple at Kaleth, a massive stone structure with four large square towers, served as a repository of knowledge and wisdom.
The Je'daii fled Tython after the terrible Force Wars, and others settled in the remains of the great fortress city.
The temple at Kaleth was in ruins by the time the Jedi Order returned to their ancient homeworld during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the rising Sith Empire.

Kaleth was situated within the heart of a gently sloping mountain range in the western Tythos Ridge.
The gigantic castle was composed of painted stone, organized to make large geodesic circles in the faces of the four square towers, and was accessible by two paths, one of which was known as the Elarian Trail.
The stone walls of Kaleth crumbled after centuries of being unoccupied, leaving just the lower levels standing.
The temple-city's entrance remained in the shape of a gigantic stone archway that opened into a spacious courtyard with a towering statue guarding the entry.
There were numerous little structures in the region, and stairs that led up to the few remaining stories.
War droids were still stationed in various halls, ready to attack any invaders.

A society of Kwa occupied Tython long before the Tho Yor arrived with the first Force-sensitives who would become the Je'daii Order.
They built temples and monuments on the forested planet.
The globe eventually became depopulated, and the Kwa temples were abandoned.
Hundreds of philosophers and academics from all throughout the galaxy arrived on Tython in 36,453 BBY aboard huge pyramidal structures known as the Tho Yor, which were carried down from the stars.
These nine gigantic ships dispersed over the earth and landed in various regions, freeing those who had been held captive to help settle the planet.
These pilgrims' new dwellings and halls of learning would be built on the foundations of the Tho Yor.
One of these Tho Yor landed in the Tythos Ridge and was given the name Kaleth, which is a Je'daii word that means "sanctum." The Je'daii Order of philosophers built a stone structure beneath the vast floating ship, encasing the ancient ruins of one of the Kwa temples within it.
Kaleth was the most important temple on the planet since it functioned as a gathering site for Je'daii leaders and a convocation temple for the entire Order.
Kaleth was the location of the Je'daii's huge library, as well as where vital situations arose, judgments were decided, and judgement was rendered on behalf of the entire Order.
As a result, when the Despot War broke out in the Tython system, the armies concentrated on Kaleth at the war's climax.

Master Kora Ryo, a Twi'lek, was the Temple's overseer in 25,793 BBY.
During his investigation, Zabrak Je'daii Master Ters Sendon came across an ancient Kwa temple down in Kaleth's lower levels, as well as an ancient holocron of Kwa philosopher A'nang.
The holocron was activated with the help of Je'daii Journeyer Tasha Ryo, and upon its activation, its gatekeeper promised to share its knowledge.
The Force Wars erupted between members of the first Jedi High Council and the heretical Master Rajivari after years of study and peace.
As their erstwhile brother and sister Jedi converged on them, Rajivari and his disciples holed up in the Temple of Knowledge.
While Rajivari fled, all of his followers died, leaving only data files documenting their final moments.
The Jedi Order abandoned Tython at the end of the war, leaving Kaleth and the other temples to decay.
Regardless, other Force-wielding civilizations from the system's adjacent worlds would try to recolonize Tython.
Kaleth became a city of sorts after taking up residence in the old Temple of Knowledge, with successive governments attempting and failing to restore Kaleth to its former glory.

# Section 3

Following Jedi Master Satele Shan's finding of Tython, the Jedi Order transferred their headquarters to Tython to substitute for the Coruscant Temple that had been devastated at the end of the Great Galactic War.
When the Jedi discovered Kaleth, they thought it would make an excellent foundation for their new Temple.
Despite this, the Jedi High Council thought that studying Kaleth from afar would be more beneficial, so they built their new Temple in a nearby valley directly north of the spot.
When the Jedi set up an archaeological site near the ruins, they were surprised to find ancient war droids attacking anybody who entered; if the droids were developed by Jedi, why were they killing people?
The droids had been constructed by an old Jedi known as the Weapon Master to protect the First Blade, the blueprint for the contemporary lightsaber, unbeknownst to Tython's new colonists.
Master Till'in headed the squad tasked with figuring out why the droids were attacking and hoped to solve the mystery surrounding the old citadel.
