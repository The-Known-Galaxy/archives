# Introduction

The Great Tree of Kachirho was a massive wroshyr tree that formed the Wookiee city of Kachiro on the planet of Kashyyyk.
The tree itself stretched to an impressive height of 300 metres.
While there were some settlements and buildings on the ground level, the majority of Kachirho's population was clustered around the 300-metre-tall huge tree trunk.

# Section 1

The Great Tree of Kachirho was part of the wroshyr tree species that were native to the planet.
These trees completely dominated the planet with over a thousand different varieties and had a life span of fifty thousand years.
These trees were significant as entire communities could build on top and within their large trunks.
However, these trees are also substantially valuable due to their resources.
Many tree parts, particularly the sap, or "tree blood," were utilised in rituals, feasts, medicines, and beverages.
It would also be broken down and used to provide fuel, oil, and other chemicals.
Additionally, the bark and leaves could also be used in the manufacturing of weapons, and furniture, among other things.

In 19 BBY, Kashyyyk was invaded by the Separatist forces during the Clone Wars.
During this battle, the Wookiees had a considerable advantage against their enemies due to the Great Tree.
As the Wookiees were able to operate on The Great Tree during the battle, they were easily able to defend the ground from high above.

Throughout the Galactic Civil War, many Wookiees who fled the planet Kashyyyk would often reflect back onto fond memories of the glorious Great Tree of Kachirho.
Many infamous Wookiees would return to Kashyyyk after the Battle of Yavin just to see their beloved tree again.
