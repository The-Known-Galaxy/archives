# Introduction
Mensix Mining Facility, also known as mining facility AG3-T, was a mining facility on Mustafar established by Mensix Corp near the Klegger Corp Mining Facility, which was destroyed at the end of the Clone Wars.
The Klegger Corporation went bankrupt after the Clone Wars ended, allowing Mensix Mining Company to take over as Mustafar's principal mining business.
The Mensix Facility was almost a carbon copy of the Klegger Corp installation, down to the technologies utilised, which dated back to the Galactic Republic.
Every day, it could process about 5,000 metric tons of raw materials gathered from the rich lava flows.
