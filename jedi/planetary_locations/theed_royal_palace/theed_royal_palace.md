# Introduction
Deep in the capital city of Theed, you will find the Royal Palace of Naboo perched atop a cliff.
The Theed Royal Palace fills the role of Naboo’s key government building housing the throne room and meeting rooms for visiting dignitaries.
It is also home to the elected ruler of the Naboo, each adding a new part to the Palace during the reign.
It has stood since 832 BBY surviving even the collapse of the Galactic Republic, the Reign of the Galactic Empire and remained standing through to the formation of the New Republic.

# Section 1
Theed Royal Palace was built in 832 BBY by the first ruler of Naboo, King Jafan.
He started a tradition that would grow the Palace.
 Each ruler adding to the Palace a new building or structure.
King Jafan built a turret tower with the addition of a small temple where the consecutive rulers could honour those who came before.
King Bon Tapalo was ruling in 65 BBY.
He had a habit of hosting massive parties in the Palace where all kinds of shady individuals would attend.
His addition to the palace structure was a tower.
King Tapalo also took part in vile business deals deep within the central building of the Palace.
One of these deals was with the Banking Clan.
This deal gave the Banking Clan the right to exploit Naboo's rich plasma deposits.
This deal got him re-elected for a 2nd term.
Continuing this trend of corruption, King Veruna welcomed highly dangerous criminals into the Palace, such as a Black Sun Underlord and even Hutts.
For his addition to the Palace, King Veruna Built a vast library in one of the rear towers in hopes of making the people happier with his time in office.
King Veruna was also responsible for the deteriorating situation with the Trade Federation.
Because of this, he was forced to abdicate, opening the way for Padme Amidala to be elected as his replacement.



# Section 2
In 32 BBY Nute Gunray, a Viceroy in the Trade Federation, occupied the Palace after he and his droid army conquered the city.
In order to retake the Palace, Queen Amidala and an escort of two Jedi Knights, along with a platoon of Naboo security officers, entered the Palace through an unknown path through the Palaces garden.
This path exited out into the Palace's Hanger.
The Queen and the Naboo Security \Officers continued up through the Palace to the grand pillared halls heading towards the central tower.
The Queen and Security Officers, after getting ambushed, used their grapple guns to scale the outside walls of the Palace to get to the throne room and confront the Viceroy.
Soon after this, the Gungan leader was invited to the Palace and was presented with the Orb Of Peace at the top of the stairs leading from the Palace Plaza up to the Palace's grand doors.



# Section 3
When the Galactic Republic became the Galactic Empire, Queen Apailana used the Palace to hide fugitives of the Galactic Empire.
When the Empire discovered this, they sent an occupation force to subjugate and put the planet under martial law.
They captured the Palace and executed the Queen for treason.
The Empire then installed a Puppet Queen so they could control the planet.
In 4 ABY, when the people learned that Emperor Palpatine had been killed, the people of Naboo rebelled and stormed the Palace Plaza defeating the Imperial Garrison in the Palace and freeing the planet from Occupation.
The Palace continued to stand well into the New Republic Era.
