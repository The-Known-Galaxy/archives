# Introduction
The planet Ilum was discovered thousands of years before the Battle of Yavin by a lone Jedi pilot who used the Force to navigate while in hyperspace.
Immediately after entering the planet’s gravitational field, they noticed that the entire planet was covered with snow and ice.
Furthermore, the planet produced a very strong resonance in the Force.
Ilum became a major point of interest to the Jedi Order after the discovery of immense amounts of Kyber crystals, used in the creation of lightsabers, inside its cave systems.

Even though it had been uncovered by the Jedi, it was the Gree who established the first civilisation on the Ilum’s surface, using it as a launch site for their “Gray Secant '' spaceship.
Despite this, they have never officially conquered the planet, leaving its secrets to be found.
In 22,800 BBY, when the Jedi became aware of the planet’s existence, the High Council members decided not to publish their new findings and keep the secret of Ilum to themselves to protect the Order’s discovery from unwanted attention.
A complicated chain of hyperspace routes was developed to offer the Jedi an easy navigation method while simultaneously keeping the final coordinates in secret.
Over the years, the icy world’s importance only grew, and the Jedi would often heavily rely on its almost infinite supplies of Force-resonant minerals.


During the Great Galactic War, one of the most feared Imperial Sith Lords, Darth Malgus, was assigned to lead the assault on the planet, with its main target being the planet’s crystals.
Malgus’ engineers planned to use them to create a new generation of stealth generators which would serve a great use as the power source of his new stealth, practically undetectable armada.
In the end, Ilum was successfully defended, and the war records have been classified or destroyed.
Another milestone in Ilum’s history took place after the Jedi Purge when the newly formed Galactic Empire began to search for various power sources.
Ilum, because of its amounts of Kyber crystals, perfectly suited the Emperor’s plans of creating an undefeatable battle station and powering it with the crystals’ cores.
After the Battle of Endor, most of the planet’s surface was devastated, but a part of the environment survived.

The Jedi Temple on Ilum lived its greatest period during the Old Republic era.
After the planet’s successful hiding by the Jedi, the Order resumed launching Crystal Gathering pilgrimages to Ilum.
A typical Crystal Gathering would be led by a Jedi Master, who travelled to Ilum with a group of worthy Younglings, and occasionally a few assistants.
After their arrival, the Younglings would be tasked with embracing the Force and finding their own Kyber crystal in the icy caves of the planet.
Many would get lost, and die from starvation or other dangers but if the Youngling successfully came back with a Kyber crystal, they would be able to proceed further with their Jedi training and potentially become a Padawan one day.
What was more interesting, the colour of the crystal found by the said Youngling was said to be determined by their character and connection to the Force, making the process of choosing a Jedi specialisation much more detailed and interesting.
