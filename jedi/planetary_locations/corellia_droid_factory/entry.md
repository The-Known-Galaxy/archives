# Introduction

During the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems created a secret droid factory on Corellia called the Corellia Droid Factory.
Some major events took place in the Corellia Droid Factory, sparking other events to occur afterwards.

# Section 1

During the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems created a secret droid factory on Corellia called the Corellia Droid Factory.
The Corellia Droid Factory was located in the Bindreg Hills, a remote and mountainous region of Corellia.
The factory was dug into the mountain and consisted of a network of passageways and rooms.
A natural cave provided the entrance to the underground facilities.
The factory, which was built to produce enormous quantities of battle droids like B1-Series battle droids, B2 super battle droids, and droidekas, was fully automated.

# Section 2

During the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems constructed the Corellia Droid Factory in preparation for a possible invasion of Corellia.
During the conflict, a Separatist squad infiltrated the planet Corellia, which was aligned with the Galactic Republic, and built the factory in complete secrecy.
The Confederacy's goal was to mass-produce and deploy combat droids to create mayhem on the ground while the Separatist troops attacked the planet's defenses from orbit.
When the CIS invaded the Core Worlds, they bypassed Corellia and went straight for Coruscant.
Corellia was never invaded, and the factory was never operational.
After the Confederacy was defeated at the end of the Clone Wars, the Corellia Droid Factory was forgotten.
The facility was finally discovered by the droid IG-88 two decades later, during the Battle of Yavin.
The assassin droid intended to exploit the factory to mass-produce combat droids for his revolutionary droid army.
As a result, IG-88 turned on the factory and began producing battle droids.

# Section 3

After receiving reports of hostile Clone Wars-era battle droids active in the Bindreg Hills in 1 ABY, the Corellian Security Force found the issue.
Lieutenant Varias led a team from Coronet to investigate, which included Officers Savas, Hirka, Kener, and Mener, as well as many Corellian Security Force troopers.
The unit discovered that the factory was fully operating and that it existed.
Even though the facility was defended by a large number of hostile battle droids, the Corellian government was hesitant to send reinforcements because it did not want to catch the attention of the Galactic Empire.
The government was concerned that it would be used by Imperial forces as an excuse to send a large number of troops.
Sergeant Hirka and her squad were told to recon the area upon their arrival at the droid factory, Sergeant Mener was tasked with fighting the droids, and technical officer Kener was tasked with shutting down the facility.
Lieutenant Varias dispatched spacers to rescue Sergeant Hirka and her unit after they were trapped by the droids.
Meanwhile, spacers collaborated with Officer Kener to infiltrate the factory's control system and establish a security breach.
Sergeant Mener was assisted by other spacers as well, who killed dozens of droids.
Lieutenant Varias eventually assigned spacers with gaining access to the facility's control override interface.
The spacer finally made it to the terminal in the facility's command center, thus shutting down the Corellia Droid Factory.
