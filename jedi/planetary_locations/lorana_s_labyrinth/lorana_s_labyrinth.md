# Introduction
Lorana’s Labyrinth was a famous cantina built in the Kelada Spaceport, on the planet carrying the same name.
It was managed by a female bartender, Lorana herself, who successfully turned her bar into a unique space by replacing all its walls with mirrors of various sizes.
Along with the Labyrinth’s size, the cantina quickly became very popular for various smugglers and scoundrels who either wanted to drink in an unusual setting or needed to lose somebody in the crowd among the mirrors.

# Section 1
Lorana’s cantina lived its best period during the rise of the New Republic after the battle of Endor.
The owner shared strong liberal beliefs, which corresponded to the ones of her clientele, and would not hesitate to give friendly smugglers a helping hand from time to time.
For this purpose, she installed a network of secret passages inside the Labyrinth, which allowed Lorana’s friends to quickly vanish from the sight of their chasers.
Even though Imperial Intelligence was aware of Lorana’s suspicious activity and raided the cantina regularly, they could not find proof of her crimes against the empire.
To make her customers’ time more enjoyable, Lorana would occasionally hire less-known local bands to play their music in her tavern.



# Section 2
The planet Kelada was located in the Mid Rim, right on the track of the Corellian Trade Spine.
Because of this, it was greatly enjoyed by many smugglers who wished to trade their goods or avoid being seen.
Kelada was also one of the production points of Imperial spaceships and soon became a house to the rebel cell in that region.
Throughout the years, the engineers of Kelada have proven very useful during Thrawn’s campaign and the war with resurrected Emperor Palpatine.
