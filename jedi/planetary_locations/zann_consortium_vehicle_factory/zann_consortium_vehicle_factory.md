# Introduction
Within Tyber Zann's underworld empire, the Zann Consortium Vehicle Factory was a modular structure.
They were designed to be easily assembled on a planet but with defenses in mind, such as built-in armor and a shield generator.
They were effectively insulated from most sorts of weaponry, akin to the Zann Consortium Droid Works.
These factories, when fully operational, are able to create a wide range of vehicles.
This includes the following: A MZ-8 Mobile Pulse Cannon, a Missile Attack Launcher, a Canderous-class assault tank, and a F9-TZ Transport.
