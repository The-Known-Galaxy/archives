# Introduction
Echo Base was a large Rebel facility constructed shortly after the battle of Yavin, (also known as the Battle of the Death Star), housed on the Outer Rim planet of Hoth.
Echo Base served as a spaceport, strategic command post, and forward operations base.
Unfortunately, less than one standard month after the construction of Echo Base, the Empire discovered the base, and launched the Invasion of Hoth.

# Section 1
Before the Rebel Alliance occupied the plot of land Echo Base was built upon, the glacial-cave system housed a clan of wampas.
It should be noted, many large plots of land on Hoth housed the dens of wampas, however few were as impactful later in history as the Echo Base caves.


Before the Rebellion took up residence inside of the caves, they first needed to make sure the ancient ice caves were large and stable enough to be lived within, an endeavor which took eighteen standard months, as well as an additional two months simply for sake of installing equipment, such as doors, generators, computers, droid-housing, and living quarters.



# Section 2
During the Rebel occupation of Hoth, Echo Base served as a large base of operations, allowing Rebel ships to come to-and-from Hoth to refuel, re-arm, hand over vital mission details, and supply black box system reports.


While building the base, an enormous shield generator was constructed, which was capable of protecting the entirety of Hoth from siege.
This is due to Hoth’s relatively small scale, and the technological prowess of the Rebel Alliance’s Engineering Corps.
Adding to the defense of Echo Base and Hoth as a whole was a V-150 Ion Cannon, which could offer covering fire for Rebels attempting to flee off-world.


Due to the rapid construction of the structure, entire sections of Echo Base could go completely without heating, however this was noted to have resulted in stronger, more disciplined troops, opposed to those not subject to such extreme climates.


Because of the size of Echo Base, and the amount of Rebel troops stationed there, multiple outposts were built on the outskirts of the base, including Echo Station 3-T-8, Echo Station 5-7, and two Perimeter Outposts, Delta and Beta respectively.


Echo Base’s location and existence were highly classified, and because of this, many Rebels on other planets were withheld information about it, causing rumors about its location to begin to spread.
Two common rumors were that Echo Base could be found on an asteroid, while another stated it was an underwater city, on an unnamed planet.
On top of this, any inbound traffic would be given randomized coordinates in hyperspace, forcing them to make multiple jumps before the final jump to Hoth, where Echo Base was located.
This secrecy was all in an attempt to prevent the Empire from locating Echo Base, however these attempts proved fruitless.



# Section 3
Echo Base, being a large base of operations for the Rebel Alliance, housed many weapons, vehicles, ammunition, and fuel.
Due to the sub-zero climate of Hoth, it became clear a different alternative method of transportation would eventually be needed, due to the cold temperatures causing malfunctions in airspeeders used by the Rebels.
This led to the adoption of tauntauns, a hardy, bipedal Hothian beast, for transportation.


Inside Echo Base, the Rebellion kept many different forms of equipment.
For example, in their medical bay, the Rebels kept a large ‘bacta tank’.
The Rebels also maintained a fleet of T-65B X-wing fighters, and BTL-A4 Y-wing bombers, thirty GR-75 transports, as well as numerous T-47 airspeeders, nicknamed ‘snowspeeders’.
Aside from vehicles, the Rebels also maintained a large armory of weaponry, such as the E-11, and the DH-17 blaster rifles.



# Section 4
Echo Base maintained a large army of Rebel fighters, including seven thousand five hundred combative units, and three hundred fifty medical units.
There was also a large command center, where Rebel leaders could communicate, and plan.
There was also a large variety of droids on-site which assisted the Rebel alliance in many ways.



# Section 5
Despite the Rebel alliance’s best efforts, eventually they were discovered by the Empire, resulting in the Battle of Hoth.
Echo Base served as the forward operations base for all Rebel forces stationed on Hoth during this battle, before it eventually fell to the fleets of Imperial walkers and infantry.


After being overrun, it is not particularly clear what happened to Echo Base, however it is a common assumption that the base was either destroyed completely, or repurposed into an Imperial field outpost.
