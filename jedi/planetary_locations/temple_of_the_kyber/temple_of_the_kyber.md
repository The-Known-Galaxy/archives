# Introduction

The Temple of the Kyber was an ancient temple that was held in the Holy City on the small moon, Jedha.
The date of construction of the temple remained unknown, due to any records related to it were too old to be found or restored.
The temple was run by the Church of the Force during the days of the High Republic.
It was also guarded and protected by the Guardians of Whills, and was eventually destroyed in 0 BBY by the Empire during the first ever Death Star superlaser testing.
The Empire had mined the city out of all its kyber crystals and dispelled any members of the Disciples of Whills, before the weapon testing.
The city offered a place for those who did not have sensitivity to the Force, but could still proceed to worship and follow the ways of it and the Jedi Order.

Its name was due to its high amount of kyber crystals that are contained within it.
There were many different tunnels below the temple, these tunnels contained many crystals all over their floors and ceilings.
Across the many tunnels there were numerous statues that had been constructed, with a recorded count of 2304 of them, these were all constructed using kyber crystals.
It was due to this massive amount of kyber that the temple was used for religion to the Force, as kyber crystals were heavily connected to the Force it was ideal for those who wished to attempt to connect with it.
Its most notable statue was that of a Jedi, facing down and battling a massive snake.
During the early Imperial Era, one of the statues was taken by Dok-Ondar, who claimed it to have connections to his parents as it was similar to one that was given to him during their death, which Chirrut ÃŽmwe, a Guardian of Whills decided to allow Ondar to extract it for his reasoning.
