# Introduction
The Abyss of Ruh was on Tython.
It was a large vergence that radiated the dark side of the Force.
Technological properties suffered from this as they were disrupted by radiation.
The rough terrain consisted of quicksand, volcanoes, and acid pits.
As a result, this made navigation through the area very difficult.

# Section 1
Rian Ruh was the original discoverer of the area.
He was a Je’daii Ranger.
Unfortunately for the man, he lost his sanity from exploring it.
This influenced the Je’daii to forbid travel to this place until they were curious enough to capture creatures inside of it.
Even though the Je’daii were cautious in exploring, they did not fear the dark side.
Sadly, foolish Je’daii, such as Dalien Brock, chose to rush into the dark region.
As a result, he became corrupted.



# Section 2
A ship from the Infinite Empire crash-landed into the Abyss of Ruh in 25,793 BBY.
The ship, the Devourer, was piloted by a Force Hound.
This alerted the Je’daii to the scene because they felt his creation of a Force storm.
The three Je’daii sent were Sek’nos Rath, Tasha Ryo, and Shae Koda.
They all experienced hallucinations as a result of the dark side present in the Abyss of Ruh.
The group overcame it together, and the Je’daii were able to defeat the Force Hound.
Je’daii Master Quan-Jang ascended into the air to terminate the Force storm.
