# Introduction
The Dawn Pyramid of Aargau was a massive building created by the Sharu species on the planet Aargau.
The pyramid, like other structures in their culture, was fashioned of unbreakable, iridescent plastic.
The Dawn Pyramid was included in Vicendi's 10,000 BBY publication, the Arturum Galactinum, when he named the Twenty Wonders of the Galaxy.
It was constructed around 100,000 BBY and is still standing in modern times.

# Section 1
The Sharu species, who had built the pyramid, had civilized many other different planets besides that of Aargau.
In fact, Aargau was indeed one of said civilized planets of the Sharu, with the Sharu’s original homeworld being that of Rafa V.
The Sharu would leave pyramids over the many different systems and planets they would visit, such as the Zug system, where Aargau is located, despite them coming from the Rafa system.
These pyramids often hosted cities underneath them, including the one on Aargau.
Eventually, however, the Sharu left the pyramid and city in order to retreat away from the Celestials and return to their home system.
As Aargau eventually developed its own civilization, the pyramid would be the main inspiration for the civilization's architecture style, becoming a point of interest on the planet.
It was clear proof of Sharu's past presence on the planet.
The pyramid and the planet itself would be discovered by the Republic between 17,000 BBY and 20,000 BBY.
