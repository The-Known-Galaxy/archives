# Introduction

The Holocron Chamber is a secured vault located within one of the five spires of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant known as the “Tower of First Knowledge.” It houses several Jedi artifacts, mainly holocrons which hold deep secrets of the Order.

# Section 1

In 4000 BBY, the Holocron Chamber had been constructed to house secrets and information about the Jedi Order.
However, this would later be destroyed by the Sith Empire on 3653 BBY.
The Jedi Order were able to raise funds for it’s reconstruction on 1000 BBY with the support of the Galactic Senate.
After nine hundred and seventy years later, a holocron that holds information on an Anzati Dark Jedi, named “Volfe Karkko” was activated after fourteen generations of it being housed in secrecy.
A Kiffar female known as Tinté Vos demanded Jedi intervention to cease this artifact and return it to safety.
Due to the danger of this artifact, Jedi Master Mace Windu originally sent Quinlan Vos to investigate but would later receive assistance after being warned by Caretaker Astaal Vilbum.

# Section 2

In 19 BBY, during the outbreak of the Clone Wars orchestrated by the Chancellor of the Republic, would order the destruction of the Jedi Order.
Though the Jedi Order had prepared a defense, the might of the 501st Legion and Lord Vader would prove to be far too difficult for the Jedi to overcome, leading the Holocron Vault and the Temple on Coruscant to fall to the hands of the Sith.
Darth Sidious would later meticulously study and pick apart the Holocron Vault, taking the most valuable information and discarding the rest.
