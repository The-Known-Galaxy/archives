# Introduction
Pau City was a city situated on the planet of Utapau.
The city itself was built inside a deep sinkhole, and buildings ranged many kilometers from the top all the way to the bottom.
Holes on the walls were often expanded and used to support large platforms for landing and other means.
Actual houses and living areas for the Pau’ans and Utai were built deeper inside the walls.
This specific city was used as Utapau’s spaceport which often attracted visitors to have a further look at the city.
The city was divided into four different sections.
The top level was known as the Civic Level, it was mostly used by the government members and officials.
Major ceremonial buildings were also built near the surface.
The second level, known as the Wealth Level, had large platforms for trading and marketing.
It also had multiple landing areas for the arriving ships.
Below the Wealth Level was located the Produce Level.
It was filled with facilities and heavy equipment.
All the city’s food supplies were also made here.
The mining and disposal level could be found all the way at the bottom of the sinkhole.
Tion Medon, the Port Administrator, oversaw the city.
