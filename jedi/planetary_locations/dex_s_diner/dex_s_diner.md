# Introduction
Dex’s Diner was a local restaurant on Coruscant in CoCo Town during the time of the Galactic Republic.
The eatery was a popular choice for locals and workers in the area.
It was owned by Dexter Jettser.
Dexter received ownership of the restaurant when Didi Oddo sold it to the Besalisk man.
Previously known as Didi’s Café, Dexter remodeled it to fit a more Med’soto style.
The Besalisk hired Hermione Bawga, FLO, and R4-A22 as waitresses.
The latter two employees were droids.

Dex’s Diner would have a variety of food and beverages for all guests.
A popular selection was Jawa Juice composed of brewed ardees.
In addition to this, another demanded drink, the Photon Fizzle, was also very refreshing.
A favored entree on the menu was the classic Shawda club sandwich that could be served on therm-zapped or toasted bread.
To finish off the meal, the mouthwatering Sic-Six-layer cake was also a delightful treat.

While the restaurant was under its previous branding, Oddo constantly was in communications with Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn in regards to criminals at his eatery.
Dex would also house the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi with similar sort of issues such as with poisonous darts and bounty hunters.
Sadly, Dex’s Diner attracted some rather unattractive characters.
The place was unfortunately destroyed by Dexter as he was being chased by the Galactic Empire.
The diner was repaired by Bagwa as he ran it through the Galactic Civil War.
