# Introduction
Olaris was a city during the Cold War.
Placed on the then-ruined planet Taris, it was the head of operations for all Republic activity on the planet.
Most Republic activity on this planet involved the restoration of the planet following the Destruction of Taris in 3956 BBY.
The reason behind the Sith bombarding and destroying Taris was to kill Jedi Knight Bastila Shan, who was a very powerful force against the Sith, being able to use Battle Meditation.

# Section 1
The Republic chose to rebuild and reclaim Taris because it would show their ability to overturn the destructive nature of the Sith.
They did this approximately 300 years after the destruction of the planet.
10 years after the reconstruction of Olaris in 3653 BBY, a Twi’lek named Leontyne Saresh became the governor of Olaris.
The planet's city featured many commodities, including a spaceport, cantina, and med-bay.
Although, it was frequently attacked by rakghouls, the planet’s native population.
Because of these attacks, the city had large walls constructed around it.
However, these walls did not hold the rakghouls back, as by the time Leontyne Saresh was governor, they had overrun the outer sections.
This forced the planetary military forces to hold strong at the city gates.
