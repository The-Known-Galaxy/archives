# Introduction

Aldera Royal Palace, a historic building, belonged to the noble House Organa.
Later, it also became one of the facilities of the Alderaanian government during the era of the Galactic Republic.
Due to both its political importance, and belonging to one of the most powerful families on Alderaan, the palace was one of the most important places on the whole planet.
The building additionally symbolized the House Organa’s power and importance, and although it was not the only court on Alderaan, the Aldera Royal Palace was commonly known for its decades of service to the royal family.

# Section 1

The history of the Aldera Royal Palace began around the year 720 BBY, when the palace was constructed presumably in the Triplehorn Mountains, near the capital city of the planet, Aldera.
It is important to mention that the famous Organa-Antilles marriage took place in this palace in 28 BBY, uniting two of the most powerful clans of Alderaan and preventing a civil war for the Alderaanian throne.
Following the planet’s famous destruction in the 0 BBY, the Aldera Royal Palace was assumed to have been shattered into small, unrecognizable pieces.
Fortunately, and opposite to most expectations, the Palace managed to survive on one of the many asteroids in the Graveyard system, the asteroid field in place of Alderaan’s former location.
The ruins of the Palace were then used as an Imperial trap to lure any Alderaanian rebels into it.
The ambush worked, but Princess Leia Organa was never captured, nor did she arrive at the Palace.

As one of the most important buildings in Aldera, the Aldera Royal Palace’s exterior joined the beautiful, golden architecture of Alderaan with many natural defenses such as water moats and the mountains.
The building was also situated near a lake for the sake of its visitors’ views of the landscape of Alderaan.
The main gate to the palace was built inside a large garden, where a solid, always open, wooden door would guard the passage inside.
Similarly to other official buildings, the Palace was equipped with everything ranging from many offices, a throne room, a garden, and several dining lounges, to luxuries such as an amphitheater, a ballroom, or even a steam bath.
