# Introduction
Deep within the planet Corellia’s government district of Coronet City was the fortified structure of the Green Jedi Enclave, an area of pacifist Jedi who worked outside the commands of the Jedi High Council of Coruscant.
The Green Jedi Council oversaw most Jedi who helped with maintaining the planet as well as the internal chambers of the Enclave.
But after news of the attack on the Jedi Temple of Coruscant, the Green Jedi Enclave sought to fortify their own structure, using shields as well as internal reactors to protect from any external attacks.

# Section 1
Not long after the Sith Empire brought down the Jedi Temple of Coruscant during the Cold War, they made their way to Corellia to eliminate the remaining Jedi as a top priority.
They were, however, met with multiple failures as the shields held up and the Jedi within managed to set up assault cannons to start a counteroffensive, leaving most of the casualties to the Sith as they continued to further their progress of penetrating the Enclave.
Even the warship used during the assault would partially crash down onto the Enclave’s defenses, but it did not budge or break through the shields, making it a nearly complete loss for the Sith.



# Section 2
A fatal error would occur in the defenses as the Jedi Battlemaster, Jun Seros, attempted to make a plan to reinforce the Enclave but was assassinated by a bounty hunter, leaving the front undefended.
The Sith, led by Darth Decimus, broke through the Enclave’s shields after gaining the access codes, rendering the structure useless to the barrage of attacks from the Sith, and the elite forces of Decimus.
This ultimately led to the demise of the Green Jedi within, and the structure being repurposed for the Sith.
Although the Republic forces attempted to reclaim the Enclave, they were met with a grinding halt as the Sith managed to hold their ground.



# Section 3
After many years and the fall of the Sith Empire, the Galactic Empire laid claim to the Enclave fortress and used it as a liaison building for the Imperial Corellian Security Force.
The history of the Enclave has been all but forgotten by the testaments of time, as it had remained under their control since.
