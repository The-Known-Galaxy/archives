# Introduction
The Death Seed is caused by drochs that can steal life energy from their host.
If left attached, they would burrow into the host and mimic their electrochemical fields and tissue composition.
Thus, allowing them to remain undetected as they have become part of the host.
Since the drochs are able to avoid detection while inside a host, the cause of the diseases usually remains unknown.
Over time they would grow and gain intelligence with each host they were able to kill.
Larger drochs could absorb the life force of a host through smaller ones, meaning they did not have to directly take a host.

# Section 1
An outbreak of the Death Seed lasted for seven centuries and was proven to be virtually unstoppable.
Details of the pandemic were still very scarce, but it was known that huge groups of populations from dozens of worlds were killed before the plague finally died out.
Supreme Chancellor Anwis Eddicus played a large role during the outbreak.
In 702 BBY, the Grissmath Dynasty opened up a penal colony on Nam Chorios in the Meridian sector.
Which was later swarmed with drochs in the hopes that an outbreak of the Death Seed would take out the prisoners.
However, the sunlight bounced off of the sentient Spook Crystals on the planet, which weakened the electrochemical bonds that the drochs relied on.
Smaller drochs were killed on the spot while the larger ones lived but were unable to harm their hosts and eventually got absorbed into the host’s blood.



# Section 2
In 13 ABY, Seti Ashgad worked with a genetically modified droch called Dzym.
They initiated a second pandemic with the hopes that they could weaken the New Republic forces.
This enabled Moff Getelles to overtake the Meridian sector.
Dzym was able to control the other drochs, giving him the ability to coordinate the plague by both infecting and curing victims.
For the plague to work they needed to expose it to living tissue, so they infected synthdroids to carry the disease off the planet of Nam Chorios.
Once they did so, they infected personnel at New Republic facilities across the sector.



# Section 3
Leia Organa was taken hostage by Ashgad when her ship’s whole crew died to the Death Seed.
While being held there she was infected with the disease, which gave Ashgad time to make her ship jump into hyperspace.
Later on, she was cured of the disease by Dzym and was known to be the first person to recover from the Death Seed.
Soon after, the plague quickly spread across New Republic bases and eventually across three-quarters of the sector.
One of the many locations that were affected was the base on Nim Drovis, the orbital base at Durren.
All efforts that the New Republic made to quell the plague seemed to be futile.
The plague eventually came to an end when Luke Skywalker persuaded the people that the Spook crystals should be taken to other worlds to help cure the infected.
