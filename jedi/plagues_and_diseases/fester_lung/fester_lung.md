# Introduction
Ascomycetous pneumoconiosis, also known as Fester Lung, was a disease caused by the inhalation of mold spores.
The disease afflicts those who inhaled spores in high concentrations and slowly kills soft tissue inside the lungs.
Many victims of the disease died from cooking in their own bodily fluids.
Fester Lung was more commonly encountered on humid, jungle-infested worlds like Drongar.
