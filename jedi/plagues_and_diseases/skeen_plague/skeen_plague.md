# Introduction
Skeen Plague, a plague that was wandering on the surface of Aantooine.
The plague was a consequence of the Serpent War between Humans and Skeen.
The plague developed after the Humans won the war and the remaining Skeen decided to not bury the dead Skeen; they thought it would dishonor the fallen ones.
The rotten bones produced an unpleasant smell that, after a few weeks, turned into a deadly fog spreading all over continents, via plague-carrying passengers to Ulaia and Wiesia.

# Section 1
Only five percent of the planet was not affected by the plague, with only a few survivors in the most isolated regions.
Stories of the Serpent War were lost only to history since most Skeen passed down.
What remained on the surface was slowly taken away as the planet entered a long ice age, leaving almost no evidence of the existence of the Skeen.
