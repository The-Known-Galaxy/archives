# Introduction

The Endregaad Plague was a viral disease that was found on the planet of Endregaad.
Symptoms of this disease included fever, loss of bodily fluids, crusting around the eyes and mouth, and lastly the swelling of the tongue and fingers.
After closely examining multiple patients with the disease, it became clear that no species was immune to the disease.
Medicinal spices were used to fight against the disease, but a lot of the treatments were ultimately required to prevent relapsing.
With further studies, people soon learned that the plague was a mutation from a virus native to the planet Varl.
