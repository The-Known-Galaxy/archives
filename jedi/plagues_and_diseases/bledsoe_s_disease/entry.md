# Introduction

Bledsoe’s Disease is a virus transmitted through the air and physical contact.
The virus was named after the doctor who found it, Doctor Bledsoe.
The carriers of these diseases were a species known as the Squills.
Many different types of strains existed, with each case being unique and different.

This disease would start with the skin starting to burn then the eyes would start to have discolouration in them.
The discolouration then moved onto a starfield, which didn't affect a person's eyesight somehow.
Sometime after the disease was caught, you would experience a sense of dizziness.

During the time of 0 ABY, Dr Kaaldar created a strain of this disease.
Dr.Kaaldar was an imperial scientist at that time and when he created it, the virus escaped and an outbreak began.
The reason behind this creation was to dissatisfy the people and find out the location of the rebel alliance
An excellent cure that was found for this disease was Squills.
They were immune to this virus and therefore everyone injected these to be able to be safe against the virus.
These squills were then placed in containers and launched into planets that were thought to contain the Rebel Alliance Base.
Planets included Tatooine, Ogem, and Tay’ah’loo.
Soon after that, the Rebel Outpost on Kholes was located and wiped all of this out.
Soon after that, Luke Skywalker was given a mission to go to Tatooine to investigate this as well.
