# Introduction

Fungi-like plants found only on the planet Drongar released dangerous spores that would float and spread far around the area.
Once one fell under the influence of these deadly spores, they had the so-called Spore Sickness.
The primary damage was mostly done to the lungs of the victim.
As the substance made its way inside, a conflict would arise between the newly arrived spores and the immune system, causing the body fluid to reach a boiling temperature, terminating the victim.
Mostly offworlders got this sickness as they unknowingly inhaled the deadly substance, though eventually, cleaning all the ventilation systems of a ship when arriving and departing from Drongar became a standard procedure when the sickness became more known.
As dangerous as the spores were, they seemed to have no effect at the surface level, leaving everything above it contaminated.
