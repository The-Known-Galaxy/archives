# Introduction

The plague bomb was a bioweapon used to destroy all life that resided on a spacecraft called “the ship.” The size of the bomb itself is unknown, although it was suspected the weapon itself was the size of a medium ball.
The bioweapon contained a highly concentrated amount of parasites in itself, which dispersed upon the bomb’s activation.
The parasite was transmitted through the nasal canals and could also be spread with other bodily fluids.
The parasite within the bomb was highly infectious and lethal, as it would always lead to the infected’s untimely death.

# Section 1

The only known record of the Plague Bomb being used was when it was activated to eliminate the population of the homeworld of the ship’s pilot.
Having just won an armed altercation with an enemy mech-organic vessel, the ship's crew were shocked to find millions of their peers exterminated.
It wouldn’t take long before the gang would find themselves succumbing to the plague.
It appeared as if the Captain of the ship was the only person to survive the plague bombing.
