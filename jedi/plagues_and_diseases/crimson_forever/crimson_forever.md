# Introduction
The Crimson Forever was a fatal disease, caused by direct contact with a singular Great Life Jewel.
These were a pair of red jewels that could preserve life when paired together, but when separated, cause the disease.
The only way to cure the disease was to reunite the crystals in the presence of the infected.
If the crystals were separated for long enough, the spread of the disease would vastly increase in proportion to the time taken.
Note that the disease did not affect droids, as seen when IG-88 reunited the crystals.

# Section 1
Victims of the Crimson Forever would become comatose, producing a reddish glaze over the eyes of the infected.
In later stages of the disease, the entirety of a victim's skin would turn red, followed by the death of the victim.
