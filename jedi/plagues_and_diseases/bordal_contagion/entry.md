# Introduction

The Bordal Contagion was a horrible plague that would begin filling the lungs of those unfortunate enough to contract it with a deadly fluid, ultimately choking them to death.
This disease once began raging on the planet Bordal, wiping out millions of people in the process, which the plague got its name from.

At the time, the Galactic Republic was willing to aid the people of Bordal, by creating a cure for the contagion.
Eventually, the Republic scientists were able to create an antidote for the people of Bordal, however, the freighters carrying the shipment were ambushed on their way to their destination by the Fujari pirates.
Around six million antidotes were left to decay as the pirates plundered the ships apart.
Knowing what had happened, a planet that was close to Bordal, Rseik began working on an antidote instead.
By the time they were ready, many more millions had already vanished.
After the events of the plague, multiple groups and systems in the sector sought help from the Trade Federation against the ruthless pirate attacks.
