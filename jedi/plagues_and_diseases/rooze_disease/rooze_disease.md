# Introduction
Many diseases have plagued the galaxy throughout its existence; the Rooze disease however, was one of the deadliest ever to be seen.
The germ agent was known to affect humans, killing them in three standard days if they were not treated for their illness.
The body of the victim would disintegrate instantly.
A cure for the disease was discovered by Doctor Nilz Yomm, a human doctor from the planet Roon.

# Section 1
Rooze disease deteriorates the patient's health over time.
It would not only give the patient symptoms such as dizziness, but could also give a painful or strange sensation that their limbs were fading away.



# Section 2
This diabolical disease was even used as a weapon in conflicts.
Two instances of Rooze as a weapon were during the Mavvan Conflict and Tawntoom.
During the Mavvan conflict, the Galactic Empire had used the disease on Rebel troops.
While it did achieve the goal they were trying to reach, it also resulted in Rooze wiping out Imperial troops in the process.
This grave error made the Empire decide to discontinue their use of Rooze disease in future conflicts.
Later in Tawntoom, Governor Koong had made the fatal decision to use the Rooze disease on the pastoral Umboo province, infecting and killing himself as well.
Judicial Officer Terrinald Screed and his stormtroopers were present during the infection’s release.
The only reason they were not wiped out as well was because of their breath mask and armor, giving them protection from the Rooze.
