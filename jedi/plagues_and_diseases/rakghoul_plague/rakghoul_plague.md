# Introduction

The Rakghoul plague was a disease created by the Sith Lord Karness Murr.
Karness Murr was a former respected Jedi Knight.
Murr’s need for power led him to sought the nature of the dark side.
Murr had become one of the Dark Jedi during the Hundred Year Darkness.
The Hundred Year Darkness was a period of time that led to the formation of the Old Sith Empire.
Notable creatures Murr created were leviathans.
The Sith Lord sought a way to escape death as well as achieve galactic conquest.
In trying to achieve this he created a Sith Amulet later known as the “Murr Talisman''.

# Section 1

The Murr Talisman had Murr’s mind, will, and Sith magic poured into it.
This device could turn nearly any nearby being into a mindless sentient Rakghoul.
Rakghouls were mutants created by Murr, who could only answer to his will.
The device had its flaws; it could not turn Force sensitive beings, or certain non-human species into Rakghouls.
Murr eventually would perfect his device so it would cover its one weakness.
The plague could be spread by even the smallest bite or scratch from a Rakghoul.
Once the victim is scratched they would suffer from six to forty eight hours while they were being transformed into a Rakghoul.

# Section 2

During and after the Mandalorian wars, the plague spread to the planet of Taris.
Taris was a polluted urban planet in the Outer Rim.
On the planet of Jebble over one million Mandalorian neo-crusaders fell victim to the plague.
Jebble was a frozen planet located in the Ojoster sector of the outer rim.
Although it was widely believed that the Rakghouls had gone extinct prior to 19 BBY.
The Rakghouls would continue to terrorize the galaxy until 137 ABY when the device was finally destroyed by the Jedi Cade Skywalker on the imperial world of Had Abbadon.
