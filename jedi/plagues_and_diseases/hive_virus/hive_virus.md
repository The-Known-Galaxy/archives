# Introduction
The Hive Virus is one of the many viruses that plague the Galaxy.
It is also one of the few weaponised by the Empire.
The Hive Virus attacks the victim's brain driving them insane.
It does this by changing the victim's perception of their surroundings into horrifying visages.
After the Clone Wars, medical sciences advanced to a point where most of the Galaxy's Viruses were ineffective.
Despite it being a naturally occurring virus, many governments and criminal organisations weaponised it into world killing weapons.

# Section 1
One strain of the Virus has a habit of sitting dormant in victims for an extended period, infecting people without showing any symptoms.
The Virus will then activate like a hive and change the perception of all the victims, driving them mad.
During the Katana Fleet's maiden voyage, a few crew members picked up the Hive Virus on one of the stops.
The Virus laid dormant, infecting the whole fleet, then activated, driving the entire crew mad.
The strain that attacked the Katana Fleet wasn't as lethal as the strain the Empire used on the planet Firrerre.
The Empire enhanced the Hive Virus into a lethal strain.
The Procurator of Justice, Hethrir.
Despite being a Firrerreo himself, Hethrir ordered the attack to prove his loyalty to the Empire despite not being Human.
The strain quickly spread across the planet, eradicating the population in less than a week.
The victims would have been in excruciating agony as the unique strain ate through their bodies while they were still alive.
To prevent it from spreading off the planet, the Empire quarantined the planet.
The Virus wiped out nearly all of the Firrerreo, leaving only a couple thousand scattered across the Galaxy.
