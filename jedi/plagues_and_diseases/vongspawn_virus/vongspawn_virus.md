# Introduction
The Vongspawn Virus was created by Zenoc Quah, Darth Maladi, and Yuuzhan Vong Shaper.
The virus caused bony growth to appear from the skin, which was very painful.
The disease did not affect the Yuuzhan Vong, or the Jedi, which made it very suspicious for them and made it seem that they might have caused the disease.

# Section 1
Due to the massively increased tension of this virus, it soon led to the Sith Imperial War, which transferred the ownership of the Galactic Society.
This was because of the fall of the Great Galactic Alliance.
