# Section 1

While the galaxy learned of the disease in 3640 BBY, Nova 13 seemed to have existed during the Cold War.
A single sample strain was located on the Sith Imperial ship, the King’s Ransom.
The treasury ship’s vault was raided by a couple thieves and a smuggler, who stole not only several valuable items, but the sample of Nova 13 as well.
