# Introduction
The Candorian plague was a very contagious disease that was caused by an airborne virus called the Blue Shadow Virus.
Which was known for triggering epidemics that wiped out multiple planets.
The plague was extremely contagious to humans and caused an agonizing death.

# Section 1
During the Draggulch Period, the plague lessened many populations of colonies within The Slice.
After some time the Republic Dark Age arose and the Old Republic was at the point of death, which caused a strain of the disease to spread across the galaxy.
It ended up wiping out two-thirds of multiple populations within major cities.
The disease seemed to be particularly present in the Grumani sector and led to the downfall of the planets Sanrafsix and Alphoresis.
Around 1060 BBY, the planet of Mandalore became the next casualty of the plague, leaving the Mandalorians in ruins.



# Section 2
In 46 BBY, the loss of the planet of Candoria and its colonies presumably led to the extinction of the disease.
However, during the Clone Wars, a Separatist scientist by the name of Nuvo Vindi was able to find a sample of the virus and attempted to use it to make a bioweapon.
The plague was later used by the Galactic Empire for use against rebellious planets.
Such as the planet of Dentaal, which they attacked in 0 ABY for expelling Governor Taliff and declaring independence from the Empire.
The entire planet was wiped out within two months and the Empire claimed that the plague was a Rebel plot.
