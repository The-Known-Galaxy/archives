# Introduction
Imperial Bioweapons Project I71A was a bioweapon created by Darth Drear using Force Alchemy, which was a Force ability that allowed Sith to use the force against its will to alter the properties of any sort of object or living being.
The virus had a zombie-like effect on infected individuals, and also had special effects on certain races.

# Section 1
The initial creator of the virus, Darth Drear, intended to create an elixir that would grant him immortality.
However, his experiments failed, and he died after becoming infected with the virus.
Over one thousand years following this initial creation, another Sith Lord, Darth Scabrous attempted to recreate the virus for immortality but failed like his predecessor, and his entire academy, once headed by Darth Drear, the Odacer-Faustin Sith academy fell to the virus, which infected all Sith acolytes and masters.


Eventually, knowledge of this virus became known to Darth Vader, a few millennia after Scabrous’ venture into the virus.
However, rather than attempting to create something that would grant him immortality, Vader commissioned a team from the Imperial Biological Weapons Division to recreate the virus and use it as a bioweapon.
This operation was furtive, and the virus was successfully recreated, this time under the codename Blackwing.
While this virus was being prepared for field use, however, an accident took place amongst the vessel it was being carried on, the Vector, and unleashed the virus once again, causing it to spread among the crew, almost all of whom became infected.
The infected took control of the Vector and forced another vessel, the Barge, this time carrying prisoners, to board the Vector and become infected.



# Section 2
The virus, which was activated by a force-sensitive black orchid, was created through Force Alchemy, as mentioned earlier.
Because of this, it still possessed some form of consciousness and manipulated the infected to do its bidding.
As mentioned earlier, individuals affected by the virus became zombie-like.
The virus took effect in 2 stages.
Firstly, the virus would kill the infected through horrible symptoms that would always kill them, and then would take control of the cadavers and use them for its bidding.
The zombie hosts would be used by the virus to spread the pathogen even further.
This virus was very hard to treat and cure, because of how quickly it transferred and how well it was able to kill affected peoples.
However, there was an anti-virus that could cure the virus and stop its spread, though as mentioned, it was extremely hard to treat.
Throughout the bodies of the infected, a liquid would also spread.
It is surmised that this liquid was related to an entity known as Mnggal-Mnggal, who was a sentient being that took the form of a gray ooze.
This connection is largely thought to be there because of similarities in the anatomy of both the liquid and Mnggal.

The main power of the virus did not come from its quick killing, but rather its transmission rate.
The transmission was extremely effective between populations, with the virus having a near 100% transmission rate within controlled testing environments.
Another characteristic of the virus was that it possessed a high potential to transmit itself between races, something that is nearly impossible for other viruses due to not being able to adapt to the varying immune systems each species had.
Thus, the virus was able to infect a large host of species, some of whom even had special interactions with the virus.

The virus followed a certain pattern for infection.
Usually, the patient 0 for the virus was the initial person who would synthesize the virus.
That is, activate the virus through the black orchid mentioned earlier.
After this, there were a number of ways the virus could transmit itself.
The bite was the most potent form of infection.
This method acted the quickest and had the most severe effects.
However, the virus could also spread through contact with bodily fluids, or the gray ooze that came out of an infected individual.
When weaponized, the virus also had a special property; It was able to transmit as an airborne virus.
This variant of the virus was far more powerful than any other variant and could bypass biohazard gear and stormtrooper armor, which showed the sheer potency and effectiveness of the pathogen.



# Section 3
Symptoms of infected persons usually took place in two stages, as mentioned earlier.

1.
The first stage of infection was when the virus actually took its toll on the infected.
However, the severity of it depended on how it was transmitted, and the species it was transmitted to.
However, symptoms usually started when the host’s skin became discolored and sullen.
After this, the virus would attack the body and impair vision and breathing.
Victims past this stage would then experience hallucinations.
Some of these were based on personal aspects of the victim’s life, while others were seemingly random visuals that usually involved some sort of symbolism.
The virus could act extremely quickly, or extremely slowly, depending on the method of transmission.
The virus also had certain interactions with species, an example of which being the wookies, who became extremely aggravated when infected with the virus.

2.
After the virus had taken its toll on the living host, the cadaver would reanimate as a result of the virus forcefully restarting muscle synapses in the brain.
The result would be a zombie-like creature that existed merely to further the virus’ control and transmit it to other individuals.
The zombies looked sullen and discolored, similar to their pre-reanimation state.
Physical abnormalities of the zombies also caused them to have a gait that was not normal, and instead of running, they staggered towards prey, which was, most of the time, humans.
Zombies had a sort of hive mind, and due to them not being alive, they could survive almost any sort of physical torture.
This also caused them to have almost no regard for their own bodies, and infected in this stage would often accidentally harm themselves in searching and consuming prey.
The undead also were able to learn, and while they started off as primitive beings, they quickly became able to handle whatever was required of them to spread the virus further.
This was largely due to the sentience of the virus and its dominant nature in an infected cadaver.

The virus was fairly easy to diagnose once symptoms emerged, through blood tests.
However, symptoms would arise fairly quickly in most cases, meaning that the virus usually did not require a diagnosis.
The virus could also be self-diagnosed if a person began experiencing the hallucinations indicative of the virus.
Once diagnosed, the virus was extremely hard to cure.
However, this was possible due to an anti-virus vaccine derived from certain people who possessed immunity to the airborne, weaponized version of the virus due to a genetic abnormality.
This vaccine still had its downsides, however, because certain species would experience different effects from it, notably the wookies, who would have symptoms emerge if injected with the anti-virus.
However, more primitive forms of cures did work, for example, the infected limb could be amputated, and wookies could remove the mucus that would build in their throats with a syringe.
These methods all only worked when the individual was still in the first stage of the virus.
As for the people in the second stage, the only option was to get rid of them completely.
This worked through various means, such as flamethrowers or being chopped up with lightsabers.
Complete vaporization also worked on victims in this stage.

However, the virus still could be used for immortality, though the method was extremely difficult to successfully complete.
The Sith pursuing immortality would have to complete a dark ritual.
The ritual required the Sith to first become infected with the virus, then take a Jedi with a high midi-chlorian count.
Following this, the Sith, who would die of the virus, would then have to cut out the Jedi’s heart with a Sith Sword.
Due to the nature of the heart of such a Jedi, once devoured, the Sith would attain ultimate immortality.
