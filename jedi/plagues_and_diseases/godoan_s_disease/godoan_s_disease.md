# Introduction
The Godoan's disease originally comes from the planet Godo.
The Godoan's disease was very easy to identify.
When the planet Godo could not manage to keep living creatures alive, there was a giant machine built for this problem, the machine was called the House of the Goddess.
Somehow there were two parts removed from the giant machine, to the point that Godoans experienced difficulties.
Outsiders who were not born on Godo and wanted to visit the planet for any reason, had to take a radioactive bath to be protected against the Godoan's disease.
If one did get affected it would cause them to die by asphyxiation.

# Section 1
Admiral Ackbar, Bey and Han Solo went to Godo for a mercy mission, all three of them were taken to the House of the Goddess, where Han Solo found out that it is actually a machine.
After R2-D2 and C-3PO investigated the machine, they found out that the House of the Goddess was missing two parts, the statues of the Dancing Goddess and the Minstrel.
The guide Fumiyo almost died, but luckily Lando Clarissian and Chewbacca returned the statue of the Dancing Goddess and cured Fumiyo by returning the statue to the House.



# Section 2
After they returned to the fleet of the Alliance they found out that Lando Clarissian was infected with the disease, because he became clammy and pale out of nowhere.
Lando also admitted that he did not take the radioactive bath to protect him from the disease when they were going to Godo.
Han Solo threatened to fire Godo if Lando was not allowed to go back to the House of the Goddess to be cured, luckily Lando was allowed to go back and receive the disease's cure.
