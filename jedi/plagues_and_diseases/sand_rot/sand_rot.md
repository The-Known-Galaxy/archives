# Introduction
Sand Rot was a disease contracted from too much exposure to the desert.
Sand Rot was common on planets like Tatooine.
Victims would have symptoms such as coughing, weakness, and loss of feeling in their hands and fingers.
In 3643 BBY, Rowan Delk contracted Sand Rot after being amongst Tatooine’s desert for too long.
Even though the disease was treatable, it was most preferred to take patients off-world.
