# Introduction

Denon was the 2nd largest ecumenpolis planet in the Inner Rim, right under Coruscant.
This planet had 2 neighboring worlds, Nubia, which was a smaller planet and much less populated planet, and Osarian.
Denon had a population of over 500 billion and came to power near the Galactic Republic era.
This planet was also at the conjunction of the Corellian Run and the Hydian Way, that was also known as the route that could pass through the entire galaxy.
Around the Pre-Republic area, Denon was mainly populated by the Rakata, however, this changed when entering the Old Republic era.
Many humans migrated to Denon and started thriving there.

# Section 1

Denon became a part of the Galactic Republic, as early as 25,000 BBY.
In the near wars that would occur, Denon took the side of Coruscant and the Galactic Republic, especially during the Great Sith War.
Most of the battles that took place on Denon were won including those in the Jedi Civil War and incoming Galactic War.
Years after, Denon was now under the control of The Eternal Empire, and many of Denonâ€™s civilians were slaughtered by Eternal Empire troopers.
After some time, Denon and Ardru started the Denon-Ardru Mutual, a mining facility and corporation.
In the near end of the Galactic Republic era, Denon was mostly a planet for investment.
