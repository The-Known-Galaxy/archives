# Introduction

Quarzite was a small planet located in the Inner Rim Territories.
This system served as a home for Kage and Belugans.
Quarzite had a high atmospheric pressure rendering its surface, nothing was capable of living there.
However, there was a huge crystallized cave system beyond the planet’s surface, capable of supporting life.
Apart from beautiful purple glowing crystals, these caverns also included its own water basins, huge lakes, fungal growth, and lichens.
Viewed from space, Quarzite appeared as a dull greyish world along with layers of clouds and violet flashes.

# Section 1

Belugans were an aquatic species, yet humanoid, and native to Quarzite.
Belugans mostly seized control over the planet with their advanced technology.
With this superior advantage, Belugans were able to construct strongholds, outposts, and subtrams.
Subtram was a vehicle similar to hovertrain and was supported by large rings that were attached to its tracks.
During the Clone Wars, Lord Otua Blank, the tyrannical leader of Belugans led both Kage and Belugans to a long-lasting conflict by using his own people to capture Pluma Sodi.
Blank had developed a craving interest for this Kage female.
Desiring her to be his bride.

This act did not go unseen and Pluma was eventually rescued with the help of Asajj Ventress.

# Section 2

Apart from Belugans, Kage were the other living species native to the planet Quarzite.
They were near-human species, despite resembling humans, their striking eyes and pale skin set them apart from humans.
Kage had to form a warrior team to fight against the tyrannical leader of Belugans.
Since a head to head on fight was not possible due to Belugans having far more superior technology compared to them, they began infiltrating subtrams for supplies and equipment.
When Pluma Sodi was captured, his brother Krismo Sodi who was also the leader of the Kage Warriors, sent their whole strike team to rescue her.
The Belugans hired Bounty Hunters to escort Pluma to Lord Otua Blank’s Stronghold in a substram.
It did not take long until the rescue arrived and caught the substram.
After Krismo’s attack failed, Pluma was able to develop an understanding with Ventress that allowed her and Krismo to escape.
