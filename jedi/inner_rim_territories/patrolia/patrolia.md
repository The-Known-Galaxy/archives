# Introduction
Patrolia was an aquatic planet located in the Inner Rim Territories.
It served as a home planet for Patrolians.
These fishy creatures are able to survive both on land and underwater due to having fins and gills.
However, Patrolians prefer living more underwater as they enjoy being surrounded by liquid.
Since Patrolia was an aquatic planet it did lack resources and opportunities for both Patrolians and anyone from outside the planet.
Because of that reason, many Patrolians left their homeworld to seek greater experiences and earn their living in other ways.

# Section 1
Many Patrolians who decided to leave their home planet Patrolia ended up becoming bounty hunters.
Since Patrolians were very intelligent, they were able to create highly electronic weapons and equipment that no one had ever seen before.
They used materials only found on their home planet, specifically under the water near the bottom of their oceans.
With these types of equipment, they were able to gain a huge advantage over their targets.
This allowed them to find and complete jobs at a rather fast pace.
