# Introduction
Tibanna gas has many uses in the galaxy.
Most often it is used as a heating fuel as a refined solid/liquid and to power blasters or other weaponry in its gaseous form.
The question arises then; how was it gathered?
Tibanna was gathered in the atmosphere of gas giants which housed the gas, with Yorn Skot and Bespin being a few examples of these gas giants.

# Section 1
Yorn Skot is a gas giant located in the Yorn Skot system, which itself is located in the Inner Rim at the galactic coordinates of N-14.
It has three moons and only has one major city; the Yorn Skot mining station, which is responsible for the extraction and selling of the planet’s tibanna gas.
The settlement itself had a wide variety of species, all under the employ of a man known as Clode Rhoden.
These species included but were not limited to the Duros, Given, and Humans.
Clode Rhoden also used his luxury cruise liner, the Aurorient Express, to attract many other and more prominent species, such as various Hutts.



# Section 2
Yorn Skot was originally governed and owned by a man known as Clode Rhoden whose wealth was attributed to the mining of tibanna gas found in the planet’s atmosphere.
Due to his lack of ecological concern, Clode Rhoden was always a target for various eco-terrorists, most notably the group known as the Green Forge.
During the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Treetower was sent to Yorn Skot to disrupt a smuggling operation being done by the Trade Federation, the goods of which were Ugnaughts.
Following the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Admiral Coy’s ship, the Mathayus, intercepted a Rebel Alliance distress call from Yorn Skot.
The Admiral decided to investigate, sending First Officer Atali and a detachment of stormtroopers to board the ship that had sent the distress call.
This, however, would turn out to be a trap set by Grand Moff Trachta, meant to kill Darth Vader, but instead only killed Atali and his men whilst leaving Darth Vader unharmed.
