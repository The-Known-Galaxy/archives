The atmosphere was type 1, which was breathable.
The two types of fauna on the planet were a spark-dragon and a static tree.

The world of Kiffu was a larger world compared to Kiffex.
When both of the worlds got near each other, large lightning storms occurred around Kiffu’s atmosphere.

The planet was required to be withdrawn by the Galactic Republic due to the Treaty of Coruscant.
Once the Cold War ended, Kiffu joined the Galactic Republic.
