# Introduction

Fennesa is a quiet, mountainous planet located within the Inner Rim in the Fennesa system at the galactic coordinates K-14.
Fennesa is widely used as a nerf herding planet, with a distinct subspecies of nerfs known as mountain nerfs.
Nerf herders lived across the planet, scattered across the various rocky overhangs and shallow caves dotting the landscape, allowing their herds to graze on the grass and thistled scrubs that grew between rocks.
Outside of this, the planet also included various fauna, such as avian and feline predators with various other scavengers.

Fennesa itself was colonised thousands of years before the Battle of Yavin, and is governed by the Fennesa Nerf Herding Council.
While some might consider nerf herding a lowly profession, the inhabitants of Fennesa would say otherwise and are quite proud of their lifestyle.
Due to the dangers of their line of work, the Fennesan nerf herders became hardy people.
The herds needed round the clock protection from the indeginous predators, unruly nerfs would kick and spit on their keepers, and when it came time to actually shear or slaughter one of the nerfs, the herder would often have to track down the beast.
Alongside this, most of the nerf herders lost their sense of smell due to years of working with the stinking creatures.
Regardless of this, most nerf herders had been in their trade for generations.
The only notable location on Fennesa is the Grand Horn Ranch Corporation, a company that owned many barns which were used by nerf herders to shear their nerfs and for routine health inspections.
