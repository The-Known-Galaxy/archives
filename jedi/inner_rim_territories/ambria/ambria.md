# Introduction
Ambria was a small desert planet located in the Stenness Node of the Inner Rim worlds.
After their defeat in the Great Hyperspace War, it was one of the Sith refuges.
It was home to Jedi Master Thon,  before the Great Sith War.
Master Thon took on Oss Wilum as his padawan in 4004 BBY, following the elimination of Ambria’s life by a sith sorceress.
Five years later, Thon took Nomi Sunrider as his padawan.

# Section 1
Ambria was discovered during the Great Manifest Period, a period of time in which the Galactic Republic had increased movement into the slice.
It had an abundance of minerals, which attracted many galactic corporations to begin mining operations on the planet.
Ambria had a rich, breathable atmosphere with lots of nourishment opportunities.
While it could support life, there were very few sentient species that lived on the desolate, dry planet.
Many chose to live on planets close by to Ambria, which boasted much milder climates.



# Section 2
Ambria was left untouched for years until a Sith sorceress whose name has been lost to history made it her home.
The unnamed sorceress used her dark side powers to enslave the species on the planet, and enslaved larger animals as war beasts.
With the enslaved, she began construction of a Sith Obelisk, which took over a century to build.
After the construction was complete, she conducted a ritual of unknown nature to the order.
However, she overestimated her power and overconfidence brought her downfall.
She called on too much power, and it was too complex for her to manage, causing large dark energy to quickly wipe across the planet, instantly killing all life except for the Hssiss, who were imbued with powerful dark energy.
Later, after the Great Hyperspace War, several sith escaped to Ambria to avoid the Order, hiding amongst the dark energy.
Eventually, they passed into the force itself.
They became one with the planet, leaving it a desolate shell without the potential for plant growth.
