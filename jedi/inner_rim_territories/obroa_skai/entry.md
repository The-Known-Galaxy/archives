# Introduction

Obroa-skai, an inner rim planet, had a mix of tundras, mountains, fields, and wastelands.
The planet’s days lasted a total of twenty-six hours, with its planet orbit taking a total of 456 Obroa-skai days.
Obroa-skai was known for having complete knowledge of the galaxy within the computers of the planet’s information repositories.
The world was commonly known for its large collection of Jedi-related antiquities which were eventually destroyed by the Imperial Security Bureau, law enforcement, and internal intelligence organization of the Galactic Empire, who ruled under Emperor Palpatine, otherwise known as Darth Sidious.
The Imperial Security Bureau was responsible for wiping out any memories of the Jedi Order, Obroa-skai’s antiquities being a part of that responsibility.

The Celebratus Archive was founded in 16,782 BBY on the planet of Obroa-skai, in order to complete data almanacs of over 300,000 species.
The Celebratus Archive provided a luxury for scholars and locked in Obroa-skai’s reputation as a library world.
In 990 BBY, a Jedi training academy was also introduced to the planet which specialized in data collection and analysis, a foundation for destined scholars.

In 4 ABY, Obroa-skai became an Imperial fortress world, a massively protected planet that served as a military and a political stronghold of the Empire.
Eventually, this stronghold was abandoned the following year along with Chazwa and Deysum III.
Two years later, it then became occupied by the New Republic and reclaimed as their stronghold.

During the Galactic War, the planet was neutral, even though the New Republic was heavily involved in the Galactic Civil War.
Obroa-skai’s expansive library and galactic knowledge, along with their numerous institutions, led Grand Admiral Thrawn to raid its central computer system, in order to receive the hidden location of Wayland, to claim the cloaking shield technology and thousands of Spaarti cloning cylinders that he would eventually use in his war against the New Republic, a galactic government established by the Alliance to Restore the Republic and replace the Galactic Empire after the Battle of Endor.
The raid also was a distraction used on the New Republic’s forces prior to the Battle of Sluis Van, the first major military conflict of the Thrawn campaign orchestrated to steal a plethora of New Republic ships.

Obroa-skai was then captured by the Yuuzhan Vong in the First Battle of Obroa-skai, during their invasion of the Galaxy, where they installed yammosk into the planet’s mantle.
Yammosk were war coordinators during battles who would transmit orders to other spacecraft to optimize their operations.
Because of the Fire Battle of Obra-skai, much was lost from the archives, luckily hardcopies were saved prior to the assault.
The Yuuzhan Vong were able to keep many of the hardcopies unsevered until they could fully translate them, along with the planet’s structures which were also kept unharmed, despite heavy Vonforming, otherwise known as terraforming, on other areas of the world.

In the Second Battle of Obroa-skai, the world was taken from the Vong by the New Republic, and the yammosk was destroyed.
In 43 ABY, Obroa-skai was finally recovered from the Yuuzhan Vong War, along with the terraforming on its surface.
Aurora Medical Facility and other Institutions were available at this time as well.
