# Introduction
Mindor, also known as Taspan I, is a terrestrial planet in the Taspan system–located in the Inner Rim–orbited by four moons.
Covered in grassy landscapes that are ideal for farming, the planet was less interesting to the galaxy as it did not have much to offer other than its agriculture.

In 3680 BBY, a colony of Chagrian species who were devoted to pacifist ideals introduced a new member: Fideltin Rusk, a Chagrian who served as a soldier of the Republic during the Great Galactic War, Cold War, and the Galactic War.



# Section 2
In 5.5 ABY, the Battle of Mindor occurred.
The Battle of Mindor was a conflict between the New Republic and the Shadowspawn to gain control of the Inner Rim.
After the death of Emperor Palpatine, Cronal–also known as Lord Shadowspawn, a former Imperial Intelligence operative–together with Palpatine’s surviving Royal Guards joined forces in conquering systems of the Inner Rim of the galaxy.
They used Mindor as a base of operations.



# Section 3
Cronal declared himself as the new Galactic Emperor.
The New Republic was alerted to this threat and sent Jedi Knight and General Luke Skywalker to planets of the Inner System that Cronal conquered and free them.
This resulted in catastrophic wars which caused many casualties of his team and the innocent.
Cronal wanted to trap Skywalker so he formulated a trap for the Jedi by sending his forces to Mindor.



# Section 4
With the assistance of the Heroes of Yavin and the pilots of the Rogue Squadron, the Jedi Knight proceeded to attack the planet.
The battle caused Cronal to kill many of the Republic and their allies, Stormtroopers proceeded to engage the ground forces of the Republic due to the ambush of the Rapid Response Task Force on the atmosphere of Mindor.
Cronal used meltmassif–a substance that possessed electrochemical property–to control the actions of his Pawns, agents that are handpicked by Cronal himself, presumably acted as Cronal’s decoys.



# Section 5
When Fenn Shysa’s Mandalorian Protectors assisted the New Republic into winning the war, the war concluded.
Cronal and his forces fought and died which resulted in the loss of many Imperial fighters.
Through using the Dark Side of the Force, Shadowspawn managed to resurrect himself and proceed on serving Darth Sidious, who was resurrected as well.
Luke Skywalker then left the New Republic Defense Force to focus on his Jedi studies.



# Section 6
Leia Organa and Han Solo were also on Mindor at the time and provided food and refreshments after the war.
