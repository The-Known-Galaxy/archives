# Introduction
Located in the inner rim, the Pyrshak system consists of a singular star and no moons.
At grid coordinates O-11, it’s roughly 16,000 light years from the core.
Performing a full rotation every 26 standard hours, it has 422 local days a year.
Within the Pyrshak system is Manaan, an aquatic planet, located deep in the Pyrshak system.
Inhabited by a species known as the Selkath, it was entirely aquatic.
The planet contained native fauna known as Firaxan Sharks, massively large sharks capable of tearing through steel.
Points of interest included Ahto City and Hrakert Rift.

# Section 1
Being the singular producer of Kolto, a medical product in high demand throughout most of the galaxy’s history, it was hotly contested during the Jedi Civil War.
Initially controlled by the Rakata species, it quickly fell to governance by the singular Selkath species shortly after the collapse of the Infinite Empire.Constantly mired by hostile tensions between the Sith Empire and Galactic Republic, it attempted to maintain a sense of neutrality throughout the war, equally providing kolto to both sides, for a period of time.
However, the sith grew greedy quickly, and attempted to overthrow the governing system of Manaan, resulting in them being banned from purchasing kolto.
Trade continued well with the Republic, up until the end of the war.
Henceforth, Manaan chose to provide aid to displaced refugees until they could settle down once more.
Manaan continued to extract kolto in the years after the Jedi Civil War, but the supply continued to decrease without any plausible explanation.The decline of Kolto sales caused a complete collapse of the Manaan economy, forcing them to restructure and attempt to gain entry to the Galactic Republic.
An entry which was quickly denied due to corruption within the senate.



# Section 2
At a later period in time, during the Great Galactic War, the Selkath of Manaan attempted to lay claim to neutrality, but the Sith refused it and bombarded their surface cities, forcing the Selkath deep into the ancestral cities under the ocean.
The Selkath quickly rebuilt a surface city, known as Mercantile Plaza and once more traded Kolto to the highest bidder.
The planet continued to trade up until shortly after the war, when the Cult of Revan captured the planet so as to perform diabolical experiments in their advanced medical labs.
A short lived occupation, due to the revanites being wiped out to a man.
The next couple centuries went quietly for Manaan, with the Selkath species slowly splitting into several tribes and becoming feral clans that warred with one another.
Such was the status of the planet of Manaan, up until the rise of the Galactic Empire.
The empire quickly conquered Manaan, enslaving the Selkath species and stripping the planet almost empty of Kolto resources.
Darth Vader manipulated an ancient force sensitive cult into overthrowing the empire, before revealing his actions and enslaving the cult under himself and Emperor Palpatine.



# Section 3
The planet of Manaan sat shrouded once more in secrecy, following the collapse of the Empire, up until the invasion of the Yuuzhan Vong.
A short but bloody war, it left Manaan once more in ruins, and forced to rebuild.Thus was told the ancient and modern history of Manaan, once a manufacturing stronghold within the galaxy, devolved to a barbaric planet of aquatic savages.
