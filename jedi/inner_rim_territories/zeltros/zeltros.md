# Introduction
Zeltros is a planet which is located in the Galaxy’s Inner Rim.
The planet is best known for its beaches and vast oceans, as well as its ostentatious and luxurious designs and art, which made Zeltros a good vacation place for the most wealthy of the galaxy.
Zeltros is also the homeworld to the Zeltron race.
The Zeltrons were the ones responsible for encouraging a hedonistic doctrine, making the planet go through what seemed to be an endless state of revelry.
It is believed that many of those who visited the planet were so taken in by the celebratory atmosphere of Zeltros and its population that they found it very difficult to leave the planet.

Section I: The Luxurious Nature of Zeltros
The Zeltron race was very appreciative of beauty and luxury, which eventually led to the creation of numerous pieces of luxurious art and architecture that covered the planet’s surface.
Living beings who visited the planet could find a large variety of entertainment sources, such as clubs, amusement parks, theaters, parties, etc.
A well known fact about Zeltros is that the inhabitants of the planet are extremely obsessed with leisure and pleasure, even leading to the point where there are almost always planetary parties happening at Zeltros, and if there aren’t any parties occurring, the Zeltrons would focus their efforts on throwing one.

Section II: Planetary Invasions
Despite their leisure, the Zeltrons managed to establish and maintain a considerable defense force, although it lacked planetary shielding and was vulnerable to orbital bombardments.
However, every invasion against the planet ended up being a failure, due to the celebratory atmosphere and the powerful pheromones of the Zeltrons.
Some of the many invaders of this planet were the Hiromi, the Nagai and the Tofs.
Impressively, Zeltros was never occupied by the Galactic Empire.
