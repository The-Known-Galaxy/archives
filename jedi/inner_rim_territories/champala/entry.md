# Introduction

Champala, home of the Chagrian species, is a terrestrial planet located in the Inner Rim, on the Hydian Way.
The planet is covered in rainforests, plateaus, and mostly oceans–ideal for aquatic species that live on the planet.

# Section 1

Since the planet is mostly covered in water, most of the Chagrians lived on the coastline, where sea levels rise with the tides.
At high tides, the buildings are submerged in water and the Chagrians swim between them.
Structures that are taller usually do not have any staircases or elevators, they simply wait for the high tide to swim between stories.

# Section 2

Around 532 BBY, Hugo Bartyn–a male human agent of the exploratory branch Outer Rim Oreworks–wanted the amphibian fishermen to settle in the planet Lamaredd, located in the Outer Rim.
He sent recruiters to the Chagrian locals.
He persuaded them that the seas in a new frontier would be untouched.
When they arrived, they became his slaves.

Mas Amedda, a male Chagrian, served the Galactic Republic during the administrations of Chancellors Finis Valorum and Palpatine as the Vice Chancellor.
He represented Champala and was eventually elected as senator during the final years of the Republic.

During the rule of the Galactic Empire, Champala became heavily polluted due to a series of mining accidents.
The Chagrians participated in freeing the Mon Calamari from the Empire since the planet was initially a member of the Alliance of Free Planets, a remaining part of the New Republic and the Galactic Alliance.
After the Galactic Civil War, the Battle of Champala occured.
