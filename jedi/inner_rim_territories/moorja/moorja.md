# Introduction

Moorja, a small Inner Rim planet located on the Corellian Trade Spine, had a rich history of agriculture, mining, and military conflicts.
Owned by the Salliche Agricultural Corporation, Moorja served as an agricultural and mining colony despite being frequently plagued by powerful ion storms capable of disrupting electronic equipment.
The planet gained prominence as a major exporter of foodstuffs, cultivating crops like fenti beans and ruva grain.
Moorja's terrain varied from fertile plains and forests to desolate badlands, including the notable Crumbling Lands, characterized by sedimentary rock strata and intricate cave systems.

Moorja, nestled within the Moorja system of the Inner Rim, boasted a diverse landscape.
It featured fertile plains and forests, nurtured by abundant rainfall resulting from frequent ion storms originating from its oceans.
These storms, while essential for sustaining the planet's agriculture, posed challenges for electronic equipment due to their interference.
However, most farming equipment was grounded to mitigate the effects.
Moorja's badlands, such as the Crumbling Lands, exhibited sandstone formations, deep sinkholes, and intricate cave networks.
The soil in the badlands was unique â€“ an electrostatic compound with photosensitive properties.
Despite the barren nature of the badlands, Moorja's surface was predominantly fertile, although poor crop management strained its productivity.
The planet relied on artificial fertilizers to sustain its agricultural output.
Notably, Moorja was devoid of native sentient species, but it was home to the bruwoses, immense lizards that inhabited the badlands.
These reptiles relied on heat, sound, and smell rather than eyesight for navigation, possessing large fore-paw talons for burrowing and capturing prey.

During the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems established a base on Moorja to gather soil from the badlands, later utilizing it during the assault on Ukio.
The planet fell under Confederate control, with organic forces deployed for defense, a rare occurrence for the battle droid-focused government.
The ensuing Battle of Moorja witnessed clashes between the Confederacy and the Galactic Republic.
With the rise of the Galactic Empire, Moorja came under Imperial control and became a hub for advanced scout training.
The planet hosted a clandestine scout trooper training facility, which also served as a political favor to an Imperial Navy officer hailing from Moorja.
However, the planet experienced a skirmish during the Galactic Civil War as Imperial forces and Moff Utoxx Prentioch vied for access to a New Republic reconnaissance report prepared by the Black Curs.
In subsequent years, the New Republic gained control of Moorja, establishing a permanent base and utilizing it as a strategic launching point against Imperial forces.
The planet remained relatively unaffected by the Yuuzhan Vong War due to its location outside the invasion vector.
Over a century later, it fell under Darth Krayt's Sith Empire.

Moorja hosted a diverse population.
The Salliche Agricultural Corporation attracted settlers from various species, including Arcona, who worked in salt mines; Ithorians, who harvested specialty fruits and crops; and Humans, who constituted the majority of the permanent population.
Key locations on Moorja included the Confederate base, situated in the mountains overlooking the badlands, which served as the operational center for the Confederacy during the Clone Wars.
Moorjay, the planet's primary spaceport and major settlement, provided a hub for trade and was surrounded by expansive farmland and smaller agrarian settlements like Avisio.
The Moorja Training Installation, located on the edge of the crumbling badlands, served as a refresher course facility for Imperial scout troopers.
