# Introduction
Situated within the Inner Rim lies the planet Vaklin.
Most of the terrain consists of extensive canyons and shriveled deserts.
Despite its barren terrain, living conditions within the planet are stable as cities with immigrants from all kinds of species choose to reside within Vaklin.
The climate is temperate, not too warm nor too cold.
A notable city within Vaklin is Vaklin Zenith, which has many interesting hotspots inside, containing mythical tales and history of the planet.
It once was a planet that was well established in its support towards the Jedi, until it inevitably caved in to the Galactic Empire after Darth Vader’s appearance.

# Section 1
The planet’s initial pro-Jedi stance was due to being colonized by Trivak Ninegun.
During this time,  its culture developed unwavering loyalty to the members of the Jedi Order.
Their support went as far as to willingly hand over their Force-sensitive newborns to the Jedi Order, as the people felt they could live a better life, away from the misfortunes of Vaklin.
Vaklin respected the Jedi Order greatly, due to their assistance in multiple crises that occurred over time.
Two examples of this occasion would be when the Confederacy of Independent Systems struck Vaklin and when Jedi Knight Cho’na Bene and her companions had set the Vaklin Insurgency in motion when the Galactic Empire had taken over Vaklin after the Clone Wars and the Great Jedi Purge.



# Section 2
Even though most of Vaklin’s history showed that they had good connections with the Jedi Order, this all would inevitably change when Darth Vader had set foot on the planet, with the primary goal of getting the people to disregard their loyalty to the Jedi.
Although the citizen’s devotion to the Order was unwavering at first, even going as far as to help the Jedi and the insurgents, it would be no use as Darth Vader had struck them down in public to serve as an example.
From then on, Darth Vader mercilessly killed any who still supported the Jedi.
It was at this point the citizens knew that in order to survive, they would have to abandon their ideologies for the Jedi.
Eventually, the planet was left in chaos and disorder, as many buildings, civilians and historical places were left in ruins from Darth Vader’s wrath.
