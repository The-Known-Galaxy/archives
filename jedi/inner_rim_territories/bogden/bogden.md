# Introduction

Bogden is a terrestrial planet–orbited by 20 moons–located in the Inner Rim, across the Hydian Way.
The world is mainly covered in swamps and is home to the renda bears.
It is also a notable system for smugglers and bounty hunters due to the spice trade.
Usually, the planet would experience intense pressure and earthquakes from gravitational tides and those who live on the planet are forced to adjust and adapt from the seismic activity.

# Section 1

Many years ago, a disastrous war occured on the planet.
The conflict destroyed the planet’s orbit and surface, with only remains of destroyed structures and buildings that were once occupied by civilization.
Now, the planet is surrounded by debris of numerous destroyed starships.

In 32 BBY, the moon of Bogden, Kohlma, was used as a base of operations by the Bando Gora–a Force-worshipping cult–led by Komari Vosa.
Count Dooku sent Jango Fett and Montross to track down the cult leader.
After Vosa was killed, Dooku recruited Jango to serve as a template for the Clone Army of the Galactic Republic.
After Jango was killed in 22 BBY, his son, Boba Fett, travelled to Bogg 4, one of Bogden's moons.

Around 19 BBY, a chapter house was built in Bogden 3–a moon of Bogden–by the Jedi Order.
It was used as a training center for the Jedi younglings.
When Order 66 was implemented, the house was destroyed.
