# Introduction
Onderon is a planet within the inner rim as part of the eight planet system Japreal.
It holds four moons within its orbit and is the second planet from it’s sun.
The moons themselves are called Dxun, Dagri, Evas and Suthre with Dxun the primary moon once being very close to Onderon.
Being that close allowed some creatures to fly between the planet and the moon.
These creatures made life hard for the native humans to the point a huge walled city was made.

# Section 1
Humans were first brought to Onderon by a colony ship sometime around 5200 to 4600 BBY.
Due to the fauna around the world the early settlements soon expanded into what became the only city of the planet, Iziz.
The early Onderonians are described as peaceful before the best and soon learned to hunt and kill them.
After some time, most of the people on Onderon were taking shelter in Iziz, making the city expand as the center of the population.
Over time as the technology grew the city would too grow in numbers, reaching millions.
The city spanned for thousands of square miles, with the great walls and defences keeping the beasts at bay.



# Section 2
4400 BBY the planet would be taken over by Freedon Nadd, with their cultists known as Naddists.
Nadd sent his opponents deemed criminals into the wilderness but they would learn to survive to become the Beast Raiders.The two parties would be hostile to one another and would be at war for many years until 4000 BBY.
Two years prior the planet first made contact with the Galactic Republic, with some Jedi tasked to watch over it.
These jedi would stop the Freedon Nadd uprising by his Naddists though after the Great Sith War the Beast Lords would prosper.



# Section 3
Four years after the war the Manlorians tried to invade the planet during their Krah Holy Crusade but would fail and settle in the primary moon.
It would be the site of two battles within the Mandalorian Wars and go almost unaffected in the Jedi Civil War.
Both wars however, did threaten the peace of the planet and as such a new hero emerged, defeating both mandalorian and sith called General Vaklu.
Following this the planet would fall into a Civil War due to different beliefs between Vaklu and Queen Talia.
With help from Meetra Surik Talia would win the war, with Valku being executed.



# Section 4
Centuries after an outbreak would cause the wildlife to decline, making things more safer on the planet.
Flat plains were than made along the walls of the city and where considered fairly safe.
During the Clones wars Onderon joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
Though that would cause some fighting on the planet and rebels to fight for the planet back.
The last known event on Onderon is during the Galactic Civil War where it was home to an important Imperial military center and would be where Emperor Palpatine met his final death.
