# Introduction

Colla IV, also referred to as Colla, was a planet located in the Inner Rim and positioned in grid square N-9 of the Standard Galactic Grid.
It was the homeworld of the insectoid Colicoid species, who displayed high intelligence but isolated themselves from the rest of the galaxy.
Throughout the Clone Wars, the planet was the base of operations for the manufacturing company known as the Colicoid Creation Nest, which designed several droids and ships for the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
It notably produced the droideka, which was engineered in the likeness of their inventors, as well as the droid tri-fighter, whose design imitated the skulls of a native predator.

The planet had become a battleground during the Clone Wars and was later transformed into an Imperial Fortress world by 4 ABY.
In 5 ABY, the New Republic celebrated its victory after liberating the planet from Imperial control.
Within 20 years, the planet’s population numbered over 100 million, with estimates reaching up to 500 million.
During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Colla IV was subjugated by the galaxy’s invaders and was later recaptured by the Galactic Alliance in the leadup to the Battle of Yuuzhan’tar.
