# Introduction
The planet Atzerri was a trade world within the inner rim.
The planet was part of the Association of Free Trade Worlds.
Due to being part of the Association, it had a government that just had the necessary power to keep from complete and utter chaos.
The planet was filled with cities and marshes where almost anything could be obtained with a certain amount of credits, whether or not it was legal.
Upon arrival on Atzerri, guests were thrown into a vast space full of stores.
These stores were all attempting to claim any unspent credits they could get from their visitors.
This area was known as Trader’s Plaza.

# Section 1
Shortly before the beginning of the Clone Wars, the planet Atzerri became home to a tragic event.
The Battle of Antar IV left the planet destroyed, forcing tens of millions of Gotals to flee and become refugees on Atzerri.
Due to this, there was a major hostage crisis the following year, 22 BBY.
During this crisis, a team of Jedi, lead by Sarrissa Jeng, who were sent to attempt and release Nathanjo Nirrelz, a Gotal emissary, who was being held by the Roshu Sune organization.
After a failed negotiation, the Jedi were attacked.
The Jedi suffered 2 deaths but managed to free the Gotal emissary.
Shortly after the fall of Duro, the Republic began to make predictions stating that Corellia and Atzerri would be the next planets to fall to the Separatists.
However, the Confederacy of Independent Systems claimed that they only wanted to be recognized by the Republic.
The CIS said they would stop if that recognition was given to them.


	In 0 BBY the Empire showed up on Atzerri looking for someone.
That, someone, was Moff Kalast.
They came to Atzerri after receiving word that Kalast had been giving top-secret Imperial information to Bothan Spies.
These spies worked for the Rebellion, and them getting information about the Death Star wasn’t good for the Empire.
The Imperials assumed Kalast would be on Atzerri due to him having an estate located on the planet.
Not long after a conflict on the planet began, and the citizens of Atzerri decided they were going to assist the Rebellion.
They did whatever they could to help defeat the Empire on their planet, even going as far as actively fighting against Imperial Garrisons.
Even though they were fighting both the locals and the Rebellion, the Empire managed to keep the planet under their control.
