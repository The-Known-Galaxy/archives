# Introduction

After the Declaration of a New Order, what used to be known as the Coruscant Oversector, was now the Imperial Center Oversector.
Among those official names, many pilots also referred to it as Sector Zero or Sector 1.
It covered every system with positive galactic coordinates which began with 0 - hence its alternate name stated previously.
On the Galactic Map, it resembled the shape of a wedge roughly a third of a circle in size to the galactic “southeast” of Coruscant.
It was named “oversector” because it also covered the Azure Sector and the planet Kiribi (5000 LY away from the Colonies Region).

In the age of the Galactic Republic, during the Clone Wars, it served as the theatre of operations for the 1st Sector Army (1 of 20).
Due to its nature, it saw very little action for most of the war when compared to the rest of the Systems armies - with the only major conflict arising in the Battle of Anaxes in 19 BBY in the Axum system.
Other smaller outposts were attacked and destroyed in 20 BBY by Dua Ningo’s Bulwark Fleet which consequently caused the deployment of the Republic’s first Victory-class Star Destroyer.
Anaxes - known as the Defender of the Core - was the oversector’s capital planet and remained as such during Imperial rule.

In the age of the Galactic Empire, the oversector remained relatively unchanged in comparison to its Republic era counterpart.
At the height of Imperial authority within the oversector, it was home to the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Whelm and 57 other Imperial capital ships.
Pilots and civilians also noticed that legal penalties were harsher than in the Inner Rim.
