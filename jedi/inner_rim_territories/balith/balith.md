# Introduction

Balith was a planet in the Balith system of the Inner Rim.
During the Clone Wars in the year 21 BBY, the system devolved into civil war, and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi ordered Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Clone Captain CT-7567 to lead the Third Legion and assist in the battle.
Due to the large-scale battle, the planet was destroyed, leading its inhabitants to seek refuge on other planets.
