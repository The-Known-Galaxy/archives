# Introduction

Cona was a low-tech planet located in the Inner Rim of the galaxy and is known for its tropical environment due to temperature-distributing air currents, keeping the air mild and hot.
During the Alaskan Conflicts, Cona’s infrastructure began to grow under the control of spin-based corporations.
At that point, Cona began to house many of the galaxy's largest mining companies, including smaller ones, and after the mining industry in Cona began to rise, the planet gained an official seat in the Galactic Senate, and even began constructing massive starports for the guests and cities around their headquarters.
This drew in many visitors from different worlds in the hopes to mine vast wealth among the planet's minerals.
Cona’s natives also harnessed starships developed by different cultures and used them to travel into the vast greater galaxy in search of non-Arcona technologies of all kinds, to bring back to Cona.

Cona is also home to the sentient species known as The Arcona, who mainly lived in family-based communities.
This species had triangular heads, along with two large eyes, and hands-only containing three, sometimes four, fingers.
Due to the high concentration of ammonia in the atmosphere, most non-acona travelers or settlers were forced to wear breathing masks while being amongst the planet of Cona, while most non-native species on the planet made their way to the most dangerous, ammonia-filled jungles on the planet, and made their homes there.
In 50 BBY, prospectors and miners began to discover that sodium chloride was a highly addictive and hallucinogenic drug to The Arcona, and due to the species being exposed to mass amounts of salt, a generation of salt addicts rose and began to cripple society on Cona, until the Republic went against the draconian laws on the planet and saved Cona from social and financial ruin, with a concerned government at their aid, of course.
After these events, salt addiction was still a problem on Cona for the following decades and even called upon The Jedi Order for assistance to halt a salt smuggling operation in 22 BBY, led by Jedi Knight Stass Allie.

# Section 2

The space around Cona was guarded and protected by the 4th Sector Army, a huge sector army within the ranks of the Grand Army of the Republic, but once the shadow of the empire rose upon the Republic, Cona willingly submitted to Imperial Rule.
Cona proceeded to join the New Republic, despite their fondness of uniformity the Empire promised and dwindled support during the Galactic Civil War.
Cona was attacked head-on by the Yuuzha Vong and the Ailon Nova Guard, during the Yuuzha Vong’s invasion of the Galaxy.
After falling to the invaders, Cona was once again liberated by the Galactic Alliance and continued to rebuild what was once a thriving, mining, society.
