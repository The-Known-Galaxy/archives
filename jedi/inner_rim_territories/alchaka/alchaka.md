# Introduction
Created during the time of the Je’daii Order at the ancient temple of Stav Kesh on Tython, the Alchaka ritual was an intensely personal meditation that combined physical prowess with that of one's force capabilities.
Consisting of numerous sets of repetitive motions, this style of meditation was done in a series of complex positions and mind disturbing movements in between the various positions.
Being used to clear the mind, and attune the body to the pull and ebb of the Force, this was considered a form of moving meditation.
