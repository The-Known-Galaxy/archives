# Introduction
The planet Kooriva (M-14 on galactic coordinates) was a terrestrial tropical planet.
The adopted homeworld of the Koorivar species (A horned humanoid species) , purchased by the Koorivar after a long legal battle with the Galactic Republic.
The planet’s economy flourished with its Koorivar population, but suffered a major economic crisis under the reign of the Humanocentric biased Galactic Empire, eventually recovering and thriving both under New Republic and Galactic Alliance rule.

# Section 1
The tropical planet was first ruled by the Rakata species of the Infinite Empire in about 30,000 BBY, eventually coming into the hands of the Koorivar.
The Koorivar would maintain hold of the planet for several millennia, but would eventually be kicked out by the native species of the planet with the help of the Galactic Republic, forced to wander in space for a few centuries.
Despite that, the Koorivar eventually managed to gain enough support to buy back the planet and settled on it once more to thrive financially.



# Section 2
The planet became involved in galactic politics, gaining a representation in the Galactic Senate, with its senator Passel Argente becoming a pawn of  Darth Sidious (AKA Sheev Palpatine).
Argente, the Magistrate of the Corporate Alliance (A trading guild of the republic that grew to be very influential on the planet) eventually led the planet away from the Republic and to a seat on the Council of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, becoming an enemy of the Republic.



# Section 3
In the Clone wars, the 20th Sector Army of the Republic was in charge of patrolling Kooriva’s general area.
The planet was eventually brought into Republic arms by the army of Marshal Commander Cody, and through the rest of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire the planet suffered an economic depression, as the Empire punished the planet for its  CIS affiliation.
Despite said setbacks they flourished under New Republic rule, but having avoided the Yuuzhan Vong War, they were grabbed by Darth Krayt’s Empire.
