# Introduction
Galactic Basic Standard has many other names like Galaxy standard or Galactic Basic, it is the most prevalent language, spoken by many in the Galaxy.

# Section 1
Following the end of the Infinite Empire, Rakatan’s overthrew their masters and used their technology to start building their empires and started colonizing planets.
Soon once the core worlds were settled, came the first Galactic Republic with the renewed communication channels and trade.
With this new government, there would be new members and so to allow easy communication, they adopted a trade language known as Old Galactic Standard.
Old Galactic Standard derived from an old language known as Old Coruscanti, the mother tongue of the Coruscant humans.
Its vocabulary consisted of other languages such as Durese and Bothese.
Then by Peshosloc, a holowright who lived between 15,762 BBY - 15,609 BBY the language evolved to be considered a historical division, the language being Mid-Galactic Standard.
The language would be furthered even more by Dromnyr after the Vultans became a part of the Republic around 14,000 BBY which resulted in the now most used modern Galactic Standard Basic language.
While under the Galactic Empire the language would be known as Imperial Basic which the Rebel Alliance used or adopted as many other Alliances or groups like the Alliance of Free Planets and the Fel or the Siths.



# Section 2
Most sentient species that had contact with the Galactic Republic were able to speak the Basic which they either used in their everyday living or just for speaking with visitors or merchants.
Some did not have the organs to help them speak Basic and these species included the Wookies, Polis Massans, Ssi-ruuk, P’w’ecks, and tons of other insectoid species.
Another dialect was High Galactic which was used for reverence and was to honor religious figures.
With many different species and languages, there are also many distinct dialects with their own set of unique pronunciations.
Examples are, the Barabel accent and the word “I” and any word associated with it like “am” were not in the language or their s would be pronounced like a /z/ or the Concord Dawn inflection which was an accent or dialect that was common among Mandalorians where they pronounce their e with an /I/ like “delta” pronounce with “dilta”.
Another is the Neimoidian accent where they emphasize certain vowels and add a deep pitch ( particularly “a”, “e”, and “o”).
Another accent is the Southeastern Naboo accent where they enunciate their consonants powerfully; while another dialect is spoken by Yoda’s species, they spoke in an object-subject-verb format.
While there are these dialects and accents, there are also some who have speech impediments like the Wookies or the Rodians who have lisps.
