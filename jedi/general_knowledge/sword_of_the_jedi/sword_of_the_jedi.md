# Introduction

The Sword of the Jedi was an honorary title denoting one’s dedication to the protection of the Jedi Order and the galaxy.
During the invasion of the Yuuzhan Vong, Jaina Solo, a young Padawan at the time would valiantly fight on the front lines and serve as the vanguard for many battles and conflicts against the rising threat.
Due to her bravery and devotion to protecting others during the conflict, Luke Skywalker saw fit to name Jaina the ‘’Sword of the Jedi’’ during her Knighting ceremony on 28 ABY.

# Section 1

At the time of her Knighting the title held very little meaning for Jaina Solo, it came with no additional responsibilities or duties and even Luke Skywalker was not entirely sure what it meant.
This would change during the rise of a new Sith threat, one that would push the young Jedi to her limits.
During the Second Galactic Civil War, Jacen Solo, now known as Darth Caedus would kill Mara Jade Skywalker, the wife of Luke Skywalker.
Because of this, Luke felt he would be unable to confront his nephew without falling to the Dark Side.
Instead he placed the burden upon Jaina Solo, sister of Darth Caedus and one of the most prominent Jedi of the Order.

# Section 2

Through her actions Jaina Solo and the rest of the Jedi Order would come to understand that the title did in fact elevate Jaina Solo above her peers.
By killing her brother and saving the galaxy from yet another Sith threat, Jaina proved that she would go to any length to protect the galaxy and as a result, brought meaning to the title.
From this point onwards the title would serve to honour the most stalwart defender of the galaxy from amongst the ranks of the Jedi Order.
