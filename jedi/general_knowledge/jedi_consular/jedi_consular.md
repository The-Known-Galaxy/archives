# Introduction

Jedi Consulars are one of the main branches within the Jedi Order, focus mainly on Jedi who rather knows more about the Force as a topic and researcher method than a weapon or power of some sort, Consulars usually focus on healers, researchers, and ambassadors of all sort including diplomats, lore keepers and even prophets/seers.
They’re the sages of all knowledge not only on the Force but history it-self this making the most needed type of Jedi.

# Section 1

The most common “Specialized Paths” within the Consulars are usually; “Jedi Researcher” which is the most common Consular, focus on the research and acknowledge all sort of information given or found through the pass of the years, they also are capable of restricting certain information if they’re given the approval of a Lore keeper or the Council of First Knowledge.
Then there are the “Lore Keepers”, they technically are divided into multiple small sub-branches, such as Librarians, Archivist, and Historians.
Most forms part of the “Librarian Assembly” all of them, are the ones to categorize and keep the collection of all sorts of subjects in date to make sure all of the information still accurate and correct.

# Section 2

The rarest type of Specialization Classes was the “Jedi Seers” this class is extremely rare since the only Jedi who are gifted with the Force pre/post-cognition were task with finding disasters or enemies events that will happen or happened already, the most recognizable prediction was the “Prophecy of the Chosen One”, and the Second rarest in terms of rank was “Jedi Sages” who were exceptionally good gifted Force members who were capable of extraordinary force skills such as Force Shield, Force wave and other force abilities.
This was only given to extremely good ambassadors, healers, seers, and Telekinetic force combatants.

# Section 3

Lastly, the Specialized paths that were considered more exotic among the Jedi Consular, such as the “Jedi Healer” who work as Jedi who focus on the research of wounds and illness along with a better “above-average” force skills of “Force healing”, dedicated to preserving life in order to save as many lives as they can.
Other class will be “Jedi Ambassadors and Jedi Diplomats”, both related to the political theme of course, but the difference between them is that the Diplomats were dedicated to the handle and defuse of external political issues or starting new relations with foreign parties/planets, and the Ambassadors were the ones who deal with the inside conflict such politics within the Republic, yet not doing any Major changes inside only keeping update the Republic Senate regarding the status of some systems.
