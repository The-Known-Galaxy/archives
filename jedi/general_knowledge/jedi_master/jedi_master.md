# Introduction

A Jedi Master was a prestigious rank given to wise and strong Jedi, many of which were important leaders within the Jedi Order.
Both Anakin Skywalker and Ki-Adi-Mundi served as Jedi Knights on the High Council, though this was very irregular as most Council members were masters.
When having this high rank, the Jedi Master was able to and expected to pursue their own studies.
Younglings would learn their knowledge in the ways of the Force from a single Jedi Master.
Once they finish their training with a Jedi Master they would receive more training by a Jedi Knight or a Jedi Master.
