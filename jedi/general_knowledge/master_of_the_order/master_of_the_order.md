# Introduction
Master of the Order was a title given to the elected leader of the Jedi High Council.
Also used by the New Jedi Order during the last decade of the Old Republic.
Although the title was separate from the title of Grand Master, the positions were often held by the same individual.
 While the Galactic Republic was in its late stages, Mace Windu and Yoda respectively led the Order.
Those who held the office of Master of the Order differed from those who held the office of Grand Master, the leader of the Jedi Order.

# Section 1
For most of the history of the Jedi Order, Master of the Order represented the elected leader of the Jedi High Council.
This position was reserved for sitting members of the High Council, with unanimous approval required to name a new leader.
The Jedi Grand Master was sometimes named leader of the High Council, although this was not always the case.
Many Jedi Masters have held the title over the years, but only a few are remembered by historians.
The first Master of the Order was Jenet Grand Master Fae Coven, who served as head of the Council for several centuries before meeting her successor, Yoda, before her death.



# Section 2
During the Republic's Golden Age, Master Mace Windu held the title until he stepped down following the Battle of Geonosis so he could become more involved in the Clone Wars.
Grand Master Yoda took up the title in Windu's absence, as he remained on Coruscant to serve as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's chief military adviser.
At the end of the war, Chancellor Palpatine revealed himself as a Dark Lord of the Sith and ordered the disbanding of the Order.
With the High Council dissolved and Master Yoda in exile, the term fell out of use for several decades.
