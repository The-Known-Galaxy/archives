# Introduction

During the Old Republic and the High Republic era, both Orders had the same recruitment methods and ideals.
Two of these, in particular, were the most recognizable with the first one being the use of a heavily unknown and restricted Holocron that was kept secret from most members of the Order; which contained a list of potential younglings and force sensitive children.
The second was the job of Jedi Seekers or Watchman who took the path of Sentinel, with the task of scout through the galaxy or mainly the inner rings in order to find potential kids with connections with the Force.

# Section 1

The kids usually have to be around a young age, no more than 15 years old although, this is a variable that has changed around time and the case of who is getting recruited.
However, the Order preferred to recruit people from a very young age.

# Section 2

Usually being recruited by the Jedi Order in the planets of the inner rings of the galaxy was an honor everyone accepted although, even when the Jedi Watchmen and Seekers wanted to get permission from the parents thereâ€™s been a few cases where the parents and even the child refused the offer.
Since the Republic during both eras granted permission to the Jedi Order to take any potential Force-Sensitive regardless of the conditions, Seekers were forced to take the children regardless of the ideals of the child and parent in order to keep themselves out of harms way from the Sith or wasting their abilities.
These cases were sadly very common around the planets of the outer rings of the galaxy
