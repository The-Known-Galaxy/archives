# Introduction
The Council of First Knowledge was one of the Jedi Order's four councils, in charge of maintaining the Jedi Archives and overseeing the Jedi academy.
Queries from all Jedi were accepted by the Council, procuring advice on topics that troubled an individual and offering a different perspective.
The Council held meetings in the Tower of First Knowledge, northwest of the Jedi Temple.
Existing for most of the Jedi Order’s history, they served until the Great Jedi Purge in which they were caught off guard by Order 66.

# Section 1
Five Jedi Masters were selected as members of the Council of First Knowledge, each sharing the task of managing the curriculum of the Jedi Temple and disseminating educational material to the rest of the Order.
Members of the Council were authorized access into the highly secured Holocron Vaults in the archives.
Entry to the Council was only granted after a passing vote that involved the current sitting Jedi Masters.
They were presided over by the Caretaker of First Knowledge, who sat for life or until they stepped down, while the other four Masters served five-year terms.
The Librarian’s Assembly was directly supervised by the Council of First Knowledge, with the Chief Librarian sometimes being a member themself.
Members of the Council of First Knowledge frequently served on another council simultaneously.



# Section 2
The first known members of the Council dated back to around the Ruusan Reformation, including the Ithorian Obba and Human Restelly Quist, the latter of whom served as Caretaker and Chief Librarian simultaneously.
Following the New Sith Wars, the Council of First Knowledge had devoted itself and its shadow agents to the eradication of Sith artifacts and teachings throughout the galaxy.
Darth Andeddu was nearly wiped from all text found in the Galactic Republic due to this directive.
Agents serving the Council spent most of their duties in the Tower of First Knowledge, studying holocrons and using specialised chambers to investigate dark side activities.
 Centuries later, during the Clone Wars, Master Even Piell resigned from the Jedi High Council and chose to sit on the Council of First Knowledge.
