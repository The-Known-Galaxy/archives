# Introduction

The Jedi Service Corps is an organization under the Council of Reassignment.
Its goal is to train Initiates who either failed their initial Knight Trial or simply chose to join the corps.
This organization is led by the Taskmaster, with the Deputy Taskmaster as the second in charge.
Service Initiates are trained by Mentors as well as Service Corps Instructors.

# Section 1

The main part of the curriculum consists of three classes, which can be done in any order.
Those are the awareness class, combat class, and expansion class.
The awareness class introduces new members to the idea of a Knight Trial and explains how to reach that point.
The combat class serves to assess and improve a Service Initiate’s skill level to prepare them for their trial.
Finally, the expansion class explains what to do after reaching Knighthood and introduces Service Initiates to specializations.
Each of these classes also has its own assignment.
For the combat class in particular, the assignment is an evaluation of one’s dueling skill.
This phase is called the ACE program.

# Section 2

Once Service Initiates pass all three classes and complete all of the assignments, they move on to the Evaluation Phase.
In this phase, their Knight Trial document is evaluated and a mock KT is hosted.
If they pass both of those tests, they are approved for their Knight Trial and a request is sent to be seen by Masters.
