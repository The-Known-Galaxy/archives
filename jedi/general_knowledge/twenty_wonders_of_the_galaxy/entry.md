# Introduction

The Twenty Wonders of the Galaxy was a catalog of remarkable places within the galaxy, examples of these places would be: Coruscant’s Imperial Palace and the Celebratus Archive; however; there are so many more.
This significant list was created in 10,000 BBY by someone with the name of ‘Vicendi’, the reason for this creation was to celebrate the commemoration of the Galactic Republic.
Some people did not like this list because it brought back some bad memories of the past.
Other species, such as the Hutts and Bothans all had their Wonders.
During the formation of the Galactic Empire, the Ministry of Education created their list which was called the Glorious Imperica.
All of the  Twenty Wonders of the Galaxy included the following: Coruscant’s Imperial Palace, Dawn Pyramid of Aargau, Brass Soldiers of Axum, Shawken Spire, Belgoth’s Beacon, Valley of Royalty, Celebratus Archive, Statue of Xim, Crevasse City, Ark of Baron Auletphant, Icy Cryps, Caliginous Automation of Tome-Reth, Tract of Makem Te, Esraza Temple, Forbidden Gardens of Nuswatta, Crystal City of Calius saj Leeloo, Halls of Knowledge, Cathedral of Winds, Alsakan Mosaics and last but not least the Space City.
