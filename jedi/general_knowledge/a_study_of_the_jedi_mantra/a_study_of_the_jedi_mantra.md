# Introduction
Emotion, yet peace.
Ignorance, yet knowledge.
Passion, yet serenity.
Chaos, yet harmony.
Death, yet the Force.

	The Mantra is used as a shorthand recitation of the Jedi Code which encapsulates the meanings and values of the Code.
The Mantra has commonly been used by the Jedi to reassure themselves during times of strife and struggle and to remind themselves of the tenets by which they are bound.
Obedience to the Code and to defending those in need can be challenging in the moment, and a need for such assurances is obvious, lest a Jedi be tempted by the Dark Side.
The Mantra is however distinct from the Jedi Code in its wording, which takes on new meanings if one examines the wording closely.
 ‘Emotion, yet peace.’
	The Mantra in this instance acknowledges that all beings have emotion, yet it is the Jedi way to not give oneself fully to their feelings, but rather become at peace with them.
Through this understanding of the self, a Jedi may find strength in their training and their obedience to the Light Side of the Force.
‘Ignorance, yet knowledge’
	The Jedi Code claims there exists ‘no ignorance,’ instead there is only the opportunity for learning.
The Mantra makes clear that ignorance is a choice, and one may choose to continue down the path of apathy towards this end, however there is always the opportunity to learn from these failings.
‘Passion, yet serenity’
	Passion is distinct from emotion in that it is an impulsiveness, a base desire which is acted upon rashly and without regard to consequence.
It is a part of chaos, yet not fully bereft of desire or direction.
During training, many young Jedi may feel confused or angry at their lack of ability to grasp situations or get along with their peers, and may lash out.
One must remember to step back and assess their passions before acting, lest something be done which cannot be taken back.
‘Chaos, yet harmony’
	Chaos is the directionless, aimless, and fueled recklessness of life and the universe itself.
To many young Jedi and even full Jedi Knights, the world and universe may seem completely out of order, events occurring with seemingly random intent and affect.
One must, however, realize in these words that chaos within the self is conquerable, and by this act harmony may be applied outward.
When Jedi understand this fact, their potential as peace bringers and guardians of order is truly unlocked.

‘Death, yet the Force’
	The Force resides in all things, giving life and flowing like a rushing river through the living universe, sweeping away some and giving nourishment to others.
Everything is connected by the Force, and death is no exception.
This line of the Mantra is intended to conquer the fear all beings have - death - and assure them that there is existence beyond this event.
Death is a cycle of the Force, and through it is replenished for new life elsewhere; death is not the end, it is simply the rotation of the wheel anew.
