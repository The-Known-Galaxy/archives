# Introduction
The Jedi Temple Guard was an elite security unit within the Jedi Order comprised of selected members with the task to guard temples, escort VIPs, co-security patrols, and contain riots.
The Jedi Temple Guard responded and took orders from Jedi Battlemaster Cin Drallig.
Cin Drallig was the head of security for the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.
The guards were believed to be Jedi Sentinels but had the possibility of being Jedi Guardians.

# Section 1
The Jedi Temple Guards are said to date back as old as the Galactic War seen in the backgrounds of many conflicts.
The guards were mostly seen guarding the Jedi Temple on Coruscant; the guards contained ancient traditions of the Jedi.
The guards were supposed to be sentinels that had chosen the path of the Temple Guard.
The Temple Guard had traditions and oaths that would refrain them from speaking or doing such actions a normal Jedi would not be able to.
The guards traditionally would be bodyguards or temple protectors when the guards were protecting VIPs.
Such VIPs would be the Grandmaster or the Head of Security like Battlemaster Cin Drallig in the clone wars.



# Section 2
The Jedi Temple Guard was noticed mostly in the Clone Wars during the bombing of the Jedi Temple.
The first major appearance the galaxy saw of the guards was when protesters surrounded the Jedi Temple in rage for answers about personal of the temple staff.
At the Jedi Temple, the guards were the first to respond to the riots during the first investigation of the bombing with Battlemaster Cin Drallig.
The next time the guards were seen was when Jedi Padawan Ashoka Tano was being escorted to the chambers of the Jedi High Council to receive trials for her accusations against the Jedi Order.
Soon after, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker found the truth about the bomber of the temple, Jedi Padawan Barriss Offee.
As Skywalker confronted Barriss, a lightsaber fight broke out between the two; the first to respond were the guards, igniting their double-bladed Pyke sabers.
As the fight continued, the guards proceeded to assist Skywalker in apprehending Barriss.
Soon after she was apprehended, she was escorted by the guards to the senate courts where Barriss confessed to her crimes against the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic.



# Section 3
The Jedi Temple Guard had various equipment from robes to the mask to the keys on their belt.
The Temple Guard used double-bladed lightsaber pikes that were uniquely designed to fit the guard’s appearance and look.
The lightsaber pike had a more thick construct than a normal pike to look more intimidating.
The guards had robes that had layers of armor but looked ceremonial, as the armor was said to stop lightsabers and blaster bolts.
The guards also had keys to give them access to different rooms and areas of the temple such as offices, combat rooms, and meditation rooms.
The guards also wore a mask to cover emotions, as the guards had to focus on the task at hand and not what they thought was right.
