# Introduction

The Jedi Sages are a specialization that serves under the Council of Reassingment.
They specialize as Force Healers, healing people in the middle of battles or during/after duels as well as helping out the Jedi Assault Team and the Temple Guards in times of need, not only healing them but also dueling alongside them.
As this specialization focuses more on knowledge and force, related aspects, it falls under the Consular path.
Other than the general duty of healing and assisting, the Jedi Sages actively participate in many different areas of the order such as the Jedi Academy, actively hosting, as well as working within the Librarians Assembly and the Jedi Assault Team.
Being a Consular, they also focus more on honing their Force, related skills and overall knowledge.

Healing is the most important job of the Jedi Sages, something which they will be found performing every game.
They also possess the ability of a duelist, holding great skill in defending themselves against Sith, and to some possibility, others as well.
Jedi Sages donâ€™t merely serve for the Council of Reassignment.
They can be found holding ranks within the Jedi Assault Team, Jedi Academy and the Librarians Assembly.
Jedi Sages are a very important specialization, providing great in-game support to the Order.

The Jedi Sages were originally a part of the Council of First Knowledge as one of their first specializations, but they now belong to the Council of Reassignment.
They officially started off with the first Sage Master being introduced on 21 May 2021.
When serving the Council of First Knowledge, they were serving it with Lore Keepers, Jedi Artisans, Jedi Seekers, and finally the Jedi Mystics.
At the time of writing this article, the current Sage Master of the Jedi Sages is SOMM1E.
