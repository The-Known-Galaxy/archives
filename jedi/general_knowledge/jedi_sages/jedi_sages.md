# Introduction
Jedi Sages were known for their vast amount of knowledge and powerful healing abilities.
With their abilities, they were able to fully heal and protect their allies in difficult situations.
Jedi Sages who were not fully convinced of Force healing could learn the ability of telekinesis to distort reality and move energy waves.
With telekinesis, they could tear their enemies apart and defeat them, and their lightsaber techniques were greatly enhanced.
Unlike sages who were dedicated to telekinesis, healers were not so focused on lightsaber combat but concentrated on improving their knowledge and use of their abilities.
Jedi Sages were also expert trackers who could find anyone in the galaxy through rest and meditation.

# Section 1
The term Jedi Sage was derived from the term Sage Master because they were once known as consuls with impressive and extraordinary abilities.
The two large bronze statues in front of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant were also called Sage Masters to commemorate the Jedi Masters who built the temple.
