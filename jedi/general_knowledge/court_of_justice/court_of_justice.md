# Introduction
The Court of Justice was also recognized as the High Court.
It was a court system within the Republic, and as the title iterates, it was the highest court in the New Republic.
The Court of Justice would replace the formerly known Supreme Court, several years after the Battle of Endor.
The Court of Justice was headquartered in the center of the Republic, Coruscant.
The Courts would be active from the Republic era all the way to the Galactic Alliance era in the “Galactic Courts of Justice” building.

# Section 1
The selection process of the courts was ultimately made by the Justice Council, which made judicial changes within the Republic.
There were a total of twelve justices in the High Court.
The head of the Court of Justice was labeled as the “First Justice,” and they would be designated into this position by other court members.
This position would replace the formerly known “Chief Justice,” that was involved with the former Supreme Court.
The First Justice had the same responsibilities that the Chief Justice had.



# Section 2
The Court primarily did not focus on regular criminal cases or civil cases, leaving those instances to the regional courts to handle.
They would primarily focus on lawbreakers of the highest of ranks, mostly government officials.
The Galactic Alliance would hand more power to the Court, expanding what they could do.
This ultimately provided complete independence from the senate.
This would be the first time that the members would be independent.
