# Introduction
Founded before 3656 BBY, the Temple Security Force or TSF for short was the policing force of the Jedi Temple and the surrounding precinct on Coruscant.
The security force had non-Force-sensitive officers and soldiers, as well as Jedi Peacekeepers and Jedi Temple Guards among their ranks.
The Peacekeepers, while outside of performing their normal duties, acted as snipers or brutes for the Temple Security Force.
The non-Force-sensitive individuals in the security force provided protection to the Jedi Temple and policing services for citizens living in the Temple Precinct.
During times of conflict, like the Great Galactic War in the Sacking of Coruscant, these non-force-sensitives and their Jedi counterparts took part in defending the Jedi temple, fighting side-by-side.
The Temple Security Force was considered a threat and was neutralized by Order 66, as they had been associated with the Jedi, being destroyed at the time of Lord Vader and the 501st Legion attacked the temple during Operation: Knightfall.
However, when the New Jedi Order was established, the tradition of the Temple Security Force was not forgotten and was too, reestablished.
