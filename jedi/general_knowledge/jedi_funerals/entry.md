# Introduction

After the passing of a Jedi, a funeral would be hosted; however, there were certain circumstances where a funeral would not be hosted.
The funeral would include the cremation of their physical body.
Sometimes the remains of the Jedi would be stranded on a planet that has almost uninhabitable conditions.
This was to be done in perilous times of war.
In these circumstances, the remains would usually be left there.
In other instances, Jedi would utilize a technique that made their body vanish after passing.
An example of this was the death of Obi-Wan Kenobi.
