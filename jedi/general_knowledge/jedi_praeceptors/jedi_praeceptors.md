# Introduction
The Jedi Praeceptors are a talented group of Jedi mentors within the Jedi Service Corps.
Praeceptors host Expansion Classes for Initiate IIs; these classes are designed to teach the Initiates about the duties of a Knight and the specialisations within the Jedi Order.

# Section 1
The Jedi Service Corps is home to three main classes, the Awareness Class, the Combat Class, and the Expansion Class.
Each of these classes helps their students with a specific part of their Knight Trials.
The Expansion Class, hosted by the Jedi Praeceptors, primarily focuses on teaching the students what specialization is and helping them find the one best suited for them.


To do this, the Praeceptors will provide a personality quiz to determine which sub-class of specialization each student is placed under.
Once the quiz has concluded and the results obtained, the Praeceptors will explain the specialisations that best match their students.



# Section 2
Each class within the Jedi Service Corps also has an assignment or evaluation that is mandatory for the students.
The Expansion Assignment directly links in with the Jedi Service Corps Associate Program.
This program is to help Initiate IIs with their mission; the program allows Initiate IIs to interview or shadow a member of a specialization that they wish to join.
They would then write a reflection on this and how their mission can help reach Knighthood.
