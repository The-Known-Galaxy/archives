# Introduction
Some useful information for those who are new to the Order or just need a refresher on some guidelines.
We ask that you do not ignite your saber outside of the Self-Discipline chamber.
We also ask that you do not go on the hostile team while there is a non-group member on it.
Non-group members are distinguished by their "Armed Hostile" rank tag.
And lastly, we ask that you respect these guidelines and respect the TG who enforce them.
We are just trying to keep things safe and moderated to make your experience as enjoyable as possible.
