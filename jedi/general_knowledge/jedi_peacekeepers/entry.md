# Introduction

The Jedi Peacekeepers play a crucial role under the Council of Reconciliation, which is to enforce the law and keep it protected from those who break it, and act as the main law enforces of the order.
Since the reform of the role, Jedi Peacekeepers have been lead by HxgoNix, who has seriously assisted in the reformation, making it into the great specialisation it is.
Peacekeepers also work extremely closely with the Temple Security Force and the Temple Guards in ensuring the temple is a safe haven.
