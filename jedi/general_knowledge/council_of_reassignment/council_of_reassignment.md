# Introduction
The Council of Reassignment is a Jedi Council–under one of the four: First Knowledge, Reconciliation, and the High Council–managed by five Jedi Masters, which are selected and voted upon by its members.
The seats of the Council are composed of two permanent members, until resignation, and three members that serve under a five-year term.
They are responsible for overseeing the teachings and missions of the Jedi Service Corps.

# Section 1
An organization under the Council called the Jedi Service Corps was formed during the Old Republic.
Those who failed the Initiate or Knight Trials, together with those who were unable to serve as an apprentice, were reassigned by the Council to the Service Corps and one of its branches–Agricultural Corps, Medical Corps, Educational Corps, and Exploration Corps.
They also assigned Jedi Masters and Knights to serve as an instructor for the Corps.



# Section 2
Many would see the Service Corps inferior to others; however, behind the curtains, those who worked under the Service Corps aided and helped most civilizations of the galaxy, just like a Knight would, through the use of other skills and abilities rather than swinging a lightsaber.



# Section 3
The Council lived ever since the beginning of the Jedi Order until the Great Jedi Purge began and the Council was destroyed, together with its members.
