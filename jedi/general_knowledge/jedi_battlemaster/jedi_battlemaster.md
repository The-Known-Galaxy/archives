# Introduction
Jedi Battlemaster was the title given to the Jedi Order's top lightsaber combat instructor by the Jedi High Council.
The Battlemaster was responsible for the selection of lightsaber instructors, as well as supervising lightsaber instruction at the Jedi Academy.

History

During the Founding of the Jedi Academy on Coruscant, the Jedi High Council appointed Battlemaster to teach lightsaber technique at the Jedi Academy.
At any given time, only a single Battlemaster was appointed by the High Council.
During the Cold War and Galactic War, the title of Battlemaster was given to Jedi who had gone beyond in combat.
After the death of Battlemaster Kao Cen Darach, Jedi Master Jun Seros took over as Jedi Battlemaster.
A Jedi Master known as The Hero of Tython was promoted to the rank of Battlemaster in recognition of his efforts in dealing with the Revanite crisis.
Things came to a halt when the New Sith Wars broke out.


Lord Hoth was the official Battlemaster of the Jedi Order, but the lords and generals of the Army of Light were declaring themselves Battlemasters as they defeated the Brotherhood of Darkness.
The Army disbanded after the war ended on Ruusan, and the war-weary Jedi returned to Coruscant.
Others were sent out to satellite training facilities to lead instruction on the Outer Rim, while others revoked their titles and took on new roles as instructors.


Master Cin Drallig oversaw the Lightsaber Instruction of the Academy and taught master swordsmen such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker during the last few days of the Republic.
There were also a select few who were either head of minor schools or served directly under the Battlemaster as lightsaber combat teachers.
During the time of Master Cin Drallig, many notable people including Wookiee Master Kirlocca, Master Dooku, Weequay Master Sora Bulq, and Twi’lek Master Anoon Bondara were serving as lightsaber instructors of the Academy.
Master Drallig was assassinated at the end of the Clone Wars by one of his most renowned students, Darth Vader.
The death of Drallig halted the succession line of Battlemaster,s as the Order was dissolved not long after.

After Jedi Master Luke Skywalker started to rebuild the Jedi Order, following the Great Jedi Purge and Galactic Civil War.
Former Dark Side Elite, Kam Solusar, was appointed as the Head Combat Instructor on the Jedi Praxeum.
In the years of Solusar's leadership, Solusar educated the initial Jedi Initiates by building the three rings of defense, the core precepts of the new order.
It was till after the Dark Jedi Desann's defeat, when Master Kyle Katarn received the rank of Battlemaster, succeeding Solusar.
Battlemaster Katarn also introduced three combat styles to the Order, the Fast, Medium, and Strong styles.
