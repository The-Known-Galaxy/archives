# Introduction
The Sentinels are one of the main branches of the Jedi Order, this Path is mainly for Jedi Knight who are combat experts and somewhat wise lore experts in the Force.
Jedi Sentinels is the branch dedicated to the research and exploration of the unknown for both terms of the Force and the overall territory of the outer rings and planets along that is the branch with the most dedicated “Special Forces” sub-categories or Specialized paths because of this many skilled Jedi even though they would it be fit for Paths such as Guardian or Consular rather join the Sentinels feeling their knowledge and skill will have better use there, for that Sentinels are known for being pretty much scouts, side-line attackers, intelligence and/or Jedi who specialize on a very specific subject/area.

# Section 1
Basic Jedi Sentinels are the focus on the safeguarding and scout of determined planets from outside threats or any in-regular activity and as well having a great connection in spirit and mind with the Force and skilled with non-related Force or Lightsaber topics, thus making them an above-average Jedi perfect for special tasks, this is were specialized paths from the Sentinels are known and fit for such Jedi.
The most common Specialized paths are; “Jedi Artisan” who are Jedi focus on a technical level for things such a Hilt crafting, Lightsaber crafting, and Holocrom creation, these Jedi were placed on small squads to help and research mainly on temples and small settlements.
The other was “Jedi Recruiter” following the same ideals of a basic Sentinel, these Jedi were tasked on finding and possibly recruiting new Force Sensitive in both inner and outer rings of the galaxy, although their task sometimes could be somewhat cruel as they if needed, could take the Force Sensitive regardless of his opinion or the opinion of the parents/guardians of the child.



# Section 2
Other more “exclusive” specializations are smaller “sub-branches” such as the Shadow Jedi which is a small pack of Jedi that work directly for stealth and intelligence missions mainly connected to the Council of First Knowledge (CoFK) they were tasked often with the destruction of all traces of “Dark Side knowledge or artifacts” to keep safe and avoid future conflicts with anyone who seeks revenge with the Jedi using the Force.
Another decently exotic role of the Sentinels was the “Jedi Watchman” been the second most rare type of Sentinel as these were task to the guarding or scout of planets in the outer rings alone, only communicating directly to the High Council when they spotted any outside threats, this role was only given to veteran sentinels through the pass of the years.



# Section 3
Lastly, there are the specializations that are rare or don’t have their own role these last ones go for  “Temple Guard” and “Technical/demolition division”.
The temple Guard recruitment even though it is known they pick from the Sentinel knight, it’s almost unknown and the divisions such as the technical who focus more on droids or general objects rather than Holocrom or hilts.
Then the Demolition division that is self-explanatory
