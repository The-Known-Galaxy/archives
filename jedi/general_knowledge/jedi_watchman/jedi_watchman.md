# Introduction
Jedi Watchmen guard planets or star systems throughout the galaxy in the capacity of Jedi Sentinels.
To maintain diplomacy, Jedi Watchmen work with a sector or system government.
If a child born within their sector is Force-sensitive, Jedi Watchman would test it and forward its results to the Acquisition Division.
Watchmen contributed to the Jedi Order through the publication of The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force (which included writings by Morrit Ch'gally).

# Section 1
It was evident that the Watchmen's influence in the galaxy fluctuated as time passed.
Arca Jeth was an Arkanian Jedi Master who had several apprentices under his guidance.
Immediately after his appointment as Watchman, he managed to bring peace to the war-torn system, but he was ultimately defeated on Deneba.



# Section 2
Jedi Watchmen who stepped down or joined one of the Jedi Councils were replaced by another Knight, such as when Master Ki-Adi-Mundi and Grand Master Yoda were replaced by Tarr Seirr and Kai Justiss respectively.



# Section 3
Since the First Jedi Purge, the Watchmen had been extinct for decades, with Meetra Surik, as the Jedi Exile, being the first to exhibit interest in the position.
Having rebuilt the Order, the Watchmen reestablished its leadership throughout the galaxy.
Jedi Watchmen were able to blend into the background, affect political events in a non-violent manner, thereby maintaining peace and prosperity.
