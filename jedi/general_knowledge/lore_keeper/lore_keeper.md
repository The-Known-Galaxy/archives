# Introduction
Lore Keeper is a specialized path of the Jedi Consulars, consisting of Historians, Archivists, and Librarians, the Lore Keepers make up the members of the Librarian’s Assembly and worked to maintain the vast knowledge in the Jedi Archives.
They were located in the different Jedi complexes on Telos IV, Obroa-skai, Kamparas, and Coruscant.
Being Jedi Consulars, they were under the supervision of the Council of First Knowledge.

# Section 1
The Leader of the Librarian’s Assembly, the Chief Librarian, was tasked to be the overseer of the Jedi Archives and to preserve the knowledge stored within.
The Chief Librarian, being a member of the Council of First Knowledge, worked closely with the Caretaker of First Knowledge in preserving the Jedi Archives.



# Section 2
Being one of the oldest specialized paths in the Order, the Lore Keepers were first founded by Jedi High Councilor Rajivari.
They were tasked to take care of the primary version of the Jedi Archives known as the Fount of Rajivari.
Due to the Jedi Order’s rapid expansion, the Lore Keepers were divided into three distinct roles, each having a specialized function within the Order.



# Section 3
During the aftermath of the Ruusan Reformation, the Chief Librarian Master Restelly Quist, also held the title of Caretaker of First Knowledge.
Gnost-Dural, a Kel Dor historian, controlled the retrieval of data within the Temple Archives of Tython following the Sacking of Coruscant before the time of Master Barra-Rona-Ban, Master Quist’s predecessor.
When Darth Vader carried out Operation: Knightfall on behalf of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the final Chief Librarian, former Jedi High Council member Jocasta Nu, died amid her treasured books.
Tionne Solusar took over as Chief Librarian after the Order was reformed under Grand Master Luke Skywalker, and she rebuilt the Stacks and added information missing from the Galactic Civil War.
Master Solusar later stepped down from this position, and Master Markre Medjev was given the title.



# Section 4
The Jedi Librarians who wandered the hallways of the library and Archives were the primary point of contact for the Temple's and satellite institutions' collection of knowledge.
By interacting with visiting Jedi and supporting them using small droids, a librarian may help identify any resource at any moment.
Some librarians, like Master Jocasta Nu, studied as historians as well.



# Section 5
The arduous task of storing all text in the Archives and library was assigned to the Jedi Archivists.
The archivists would translate the data into several common languages before storing and sorting it in one of the Archives' four halls.
They would receive and archive knowledge so that everyone else can learn, and in the meanwhile improve their own awareness of the galaxy.
They specialized in the storage, organization, and retrieval of knowledge.
They rarely saw combat and were only sent on data-retrieval expeditions or to assist diplomats in need of a continuous flow of information, searching into many fields of study and allowing the Force to guide them to their areas of specialty.



# Section 6
Jedi Historians, also known as chroniclers, were members of the Librarian's Assembly who specialized in the study into the history of the Jedi as well as the Republic's formative years.
The historians, overseen by the Caretaker of First Knowledge, the Council of First Knowledge's leader, were in charge of overseeing and analyzing the Holocrons.
During the time of the Old Republic, Jedi Historians wore specialized robes embroidered with an Antasan design, symbolizing their elevated status from the rest of their peers.
