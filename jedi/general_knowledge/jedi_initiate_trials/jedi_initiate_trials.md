# Introduction

The Initiate Trials were given to the Jedi Initiates of the Jedi Order.
Much like the Trials of Knighthood, these trials would test the initiates on their skill, patience, compassion, and knowledge of the Force.
These trials were taken into the Initiate’s teens and were required to have been done for one to become a Padawan.
These tests would later be changed into non-militaristic trials after the end of the Ruusan Reformations.
Should an Initiate fail their trials, they may be sent away from the Order or assigned by the Council of Reassignment to one of the Jedi Service Corps.

# Section 1

The Initiate Trials housed three tests that would challenge an initiate’s dedication to the Order.
The first trial would test the initiate’s knowledge of the Jedi Code, as it was the guiding force of the entire Jedi Order.
Failing to memorize the code would fail.
The second trial was rarely ever consistent within the Jedi Order’s history, ranging from lightsaber construction, and mastering self-discipline to being tested on their connections to the Force through lightsaber combat while they are blindfolded or hooded.
Finally, the third trial challenges the darkness within someone, some being tasked with confronting the darkness within themselves or other beings in the galaxy while others are to observe judicial cases.

# Section 2

Upon overcoming the challenges of the Initiate Trials, they may be selected to become a Padawan or to participate in the annual Apprentice Tournament within the Jedi Temple to gain the favor of a Jedi Knight and become their Padawan.
Those who did not find a master before reaching a certain age were sent to the Council of Reassignment to be placed in the Agricultural, Medical, Educational, or Explorational Corps.
However, some Initiates were not as fortunate and were sent away from the Order.
