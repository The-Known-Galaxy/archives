# Introduction

Jedi Instructors were the primary teachers of the Initiates and Padawans of the Jedi Order,  serving in many educational aspects from political theory to lightsaber and unarmed combat, to the vast sciences.
The Instructors were predominantly taken from the Consular and Guardian branches within the Knights of the Order, and they were put under roles applying an aptitude of skills upon their students to guide them as they progress, assessing their weaknesses and ultimately preventing their turn to the dark side.

# Section 1

These Instructors could be found in any and all Jedi Academies across the galaxy,  assigned to direct and teach the various Initiate Clans as well as certain Padawans within the Order under supervision from the Council, where their specialization could range from lightsaber instructors to political lecturers and the likes.
They were adepts in their fields, as many Jedi would look up to them as paragons of wisdom.
In this the Educational Corps would be the primary body of the Instructors, albeit not all of them were within the Corps,  as they would analyse, spearhead research, and direct information and data across the Order and ultimately the entire galaxy.

# Section 2

One of the few notable Instructor specializations would be a Lightsaber Instructor, with notable individuals such as Battlemaster Cin Drallig also serving as one.
The specialization of lightsaber instruction would be dominated by the Guardians, who would be renowned for their knowledge as well as prowess with the lightsaber.
These Instructors would pass on their teachings to the vast students everyday, from Form I to VI.
Many of the Instructor classes would also work on non-Force teachings to essential survival skills, botany, science, medicine, hyperspace theory, Mathematics, and more.
