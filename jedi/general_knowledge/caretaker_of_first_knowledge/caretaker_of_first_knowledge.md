# Introduction
The Caretaker of First Knowledge was a title bestowed upon the Jedi Master that led the Council of First Knowledge.
For over fourteen generations, Caretakers supervised the Jedi academy on Coruscant and satellite sites on several other planets.
Each Caretaker contributed their wisdom to the rest of the Order and managed the curriculum of the academy.
They were responsible for the preservation of the Jedi Archives and Holocron Vaults, protecting them should they be under threat.
The Caretakers were leading figures in the eradication of Sith teachings and artifacts after the New Sith Wars.
Following the Ruusan Reformation, the Caretaker of First Knowledge and Chief Librarian Restelly Quist encouraged a vast reformation of the Jedi Order’s teachings, leaving behind a resounding legacy on the Jedi Order.
