# Introduction

Jedi Shadow's primary purpose was to seek out and destroy Sith artifacts and teachings.
They mainly consisted of Jedi Sentinel's working directly under the Council of First Knowledge.
Shadows mostly wear white and black robes adorned with armor and wielded a double-bladed lightsaber.
Like Guardians, a Jedi Shadow was always expecting a fight.
Created at some point before, during, or after the Great Hyperspace War and existing until the Clone Wars, the Shadows performed their duties in secret.
They usually did this often.

# Section 1

The majority of the Jedi Shadows were veteran Sentinels.
To understand why the Jedi Order chose the name of Shadow to describe its members, one must realize that the Order did not desire the duties of the Shadows.
Because of this, Jedi Shadows are mainly described as the shadows of the Order.
Because of their duties, Shadows are often trained to gain knowledge and use the Dark Side of the Force.
Not being a fact the Order wanted to publicize, it is a closely guarded secret within the Order.
They are also responsible for intelligence gathering and destroying any trace of the Sith Order and Empire left in the Galaxy.
Their other Order members often classify them as "loners," with a splitting personality.
Often resulting in paranoia about other Shadows and members of the Order, they would not hesitate to betray their comrades if they believed they fell to the Dark Side.
As a result of these risks, Jedi Shadows were deployed cautiously during times of peril.
The Jedi Shadows disagreed on how to deal with the threat of the Dark Side.
Some of them opted for more radical actions against the forces of evil.
At the same time, some practiced temperness with their duties.

# Section 2

Due to the secretive nature of the Shadows, their founding date is unknown.
We are aware that they were in existence around the time of the Great Hyperspace War because they were deployed to eliminate Sith artifacts.
They continued to operate until the Great Jedi Purge at the end of the Clone Wars.
Most Jedi Shadows were Jedi Consular's during the Great Galactic War and the Cold War.
For the following millennia, the Shadows continue to execute their duties in the shadows; as a result, we may never know the details of their missions.
During the Great Jedi Purge, the last Jedi Shadows known are Jedi Master Damsin and Jedi Knight Maw.
