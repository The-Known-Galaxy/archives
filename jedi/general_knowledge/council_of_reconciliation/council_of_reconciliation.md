# Introduction
The Council of Reconciliation was made up of five Master Consulars.
These Masters were tasked with negotiating with political factions of the Galactic Senate.
Membership on the Council was granted through appointment after a vote of all members.
Two members sat on the Council for life or until they stepped down, while the other three rotated out after serving a five year term.
A variety in membership was needed so that different Masters can lend their expertise on specific situations.
	The Council of Reconciliation worked closely with the Republic Diplomatic Corps and sought peaceful solutions to political debates among the different parties and local governments.
At the Council’s disposal were Consulars that were trained as diplomats or ambassadors as well as Seers that assisted in making key decisions.
The Council would pass judgement over Jedi accused of falling to the dark side of the Force or committing a crime.
The Council’s decision was final and respected by the other three Councils.

# Section 1
Members of the Council often serve on one of the other Councils simultaneously.
The earliest recorded member of the Council was the famed Seer Sabla-Mandibu.
The Council of Reconciliation existed continuously throughout the history of the Jedi Order except during the Great Galactic War.
It was temporarily disbanded due to the militarization of the Order at the time.
The Council was completely disbanded at the end of the Clone Wars and with the rise of the Galactic Empire from the Republic’s shadow.
