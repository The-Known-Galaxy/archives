# Introduction
The Jedi robes were traditional pieces of garments and robes worn by all personnel of the Jedi order.
As soon as a Jedi reached the rank of padawan, they were allowed to choose their clothing, but most Jedi only used traditional robes.
Some Jedi like Anakin Skywalker defied the standard dress code of light- colored robes by wearing dark robes.
Several other members like Aayla Secura and Ahsoka Tano wore non-standard clothing.

# Section 1
Since the Jedi were more interested in learning the ways of the force, few Jedi paid attention to their apparel, and mostly dressed in plain clothes.
Their clothing mostly consisted of an undertunic, an overtunic and a cloak over them.
They also had utility belts tied around their waists.
Despite their constrictive appearance, these clothes were comfortable and warm to wear, and did not disrupt the operations of a Jedi.



# Section 2
During times of war, Jedi armor would be added to the robes to provide an extra layer of defence.
These armor plates helped resist blaster fire during the clone wars.



# Section 3
During the age of the New Republic, the reformed Jedi order had no set uniform and many chose to wear clothes of their choice, gradually reducing the use of traditional ceremonial robes
