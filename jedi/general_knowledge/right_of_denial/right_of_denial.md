# Introduction
The Right of Denial gave members of the order the right to protest against any conclusion the Jedi High Council came up with.
This right became especially important during war time, as there were Jedi who were against the thought of war.
However, during the Clone Wars, the High Council could take away the member’s lightsaber if they decided to invoke their right.
Their right to authority was also taken away from them, leaving them with little to nothing.
The Right of Denial was frowned upon by many Jedi, to an extent who did use these rights were thought of as traitors to the Order.
This is why the right was barely invoked by members of the Order, as the Council would strip away any rights that member had.

# Section 1
During the Clone Wars, this right was used by the Almas Academy, a training space for Jedi that was stationed on the planet of Almas.
Several different staff members of the Academy, including the headmaster at the time, would give up their lightsabers to the High Council in order to enact their right.
They would use their right because they were called into action during the war, which they refused to fight in.
The Academy was no longer counted as active.
