# Introduction
Jedi Seekers are a group of Consulars under the Council of First Knowledge, whose main duty revolves around conducting and releasing the Galactic News Network.
The Galactic News Network is a fun and engaging newsletter, covering all sorts of topics from member spotlights to event breakdowns.

# Section 1
Within Seekers, there is a strict division of labor.
Senior members of the specialization are tasked with formatting the articles for each release, as well as the issue itself.
Additionally, they are allowed to edit articles to better suit the Galactic News Network’s needs.
Though Senior Seekers retain the right to claim and write an article, this duty is mostly performed by regular Seekers.



# Section 2
Unlike other specializations, Seekers have no quota to fulfill.
Due to this, any member actively taking care of specialization duties can remain as a Seeker, without having too much pressure put on them.
This also allows members to contribute to each release in any way they can without anyone being left out.
