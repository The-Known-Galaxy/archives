# Introduction

The Trials of Knighthood are split into five parts, the Trial of Skill, the Trial of Courage, the Trial of Spirit, the Trials of Flesh, and the Trial of Insight.
However, the Trials are not the only way one can achieve Knighthood, as a Jedi could meet the criteria during war, or even during an assignment.
Originally, the Trials of Knighthood weren't formal, and were given to a Padawan directly by their Master, although these were near impossible to pass.
Later, the Trials of Knighthood became formalized to allow equity of judgement for all Padawans.

# Section 1

The Trials of Consularship test ones knowledge in lore and in the Force.
A Knight will be tested and inducted into one of the 2 Advanced Classes for Consulars.
Consularship is not for the weak minded as it emphasizes on having a strong mentality and devotion to teaching the future generations of our Order.

# Section 2

The Trials of Guardianship test one's skill in the art of combat.
Should a Knight deem themselves worthy of this path, they must hold their own in both lightsaber combat, as well as prove their knowledge in the philosophy of combat.

# Section 3

The Trials of the Sentinel are for Knights who seek a more unorthodox lifestyle within the Order.
These Trials will test one's skill in both lore and combat as well as open some opportunities as a Jedi Shadow or a Watchman.
