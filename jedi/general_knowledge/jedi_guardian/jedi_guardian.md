# Introduction
The Jedi Guardians are one of the main “branches” within the Jedi Order, this role is in short terms the Light-side mirror of a Sith Warrior, They’re mainly known for being extremely good at combat and as well been the first line of defense for any outside threats in term of the rings in the galaxy, working as peacekeepers in general even though this has their own category.

# Section 1
Just like any other branch, Jedi Guardians usually have “Specialized Paths”, from this point each Jedi Guardian starts their career as some sort of lifestyle until they, either way, retired or become an elder, some of the most common paths are; “Jedi Weapon Master/Weapon specialist”, these knights are the ones who decide to adapt with other weapon rarities beyond the common Lightsaber such as the PikeSaber/Double saber similar to the ones Temple Guard have, double handle Lightsaber, backhand users and even weapons or tools beyond the lightsaber like blasters and whips.
The second most common specialized path was “Lightsaber Instructor” been a variant from the Jedi Instructor these Guardians were mainly for wanting to give additional knowledge regarding Lightsaber forms and overall combat experience, they were usually placed as the head of indoctrination groups of initiates before taking place in the Padawan season.

Other exotic specialized paths were classes like “Jedi Ace” and “Jedi Peacekeepers”, Jedi Ace, for example, was given to Jedi Guardians who ere exceptionally good at piloting and air combat with ships, they’re mainly known for being the best side-backup for any of the Navy or Starfighter Corps who they’re allied with.
This left for the final the Jedi Peacekeepers, they’re not exactly rare although it is known as the hardest and most cruel job within the Guardian Path, as the Jedi in this category works as Law Enforcer and Diplomats of the outer rings, meaning they could take weeks or months before even giving any sort of report regarding their situation, this role is the more respected between Guardians as they could spend years without even touching the temple but making a great service to the Jedi Order.
