# Introduction
The Hall of Knighthood was a ceremonial chamber that was located in the Temple Spire of the Jedi Temple.
This chamber was a vital place within the Jedi Temple.
Many members of the Jedi Order would be bestowed a new rank upon this chamber.
Initiates, Padawans and Knights would formally be recognized for their efforts in this chamber.
It was very common for Padawans to sleep in the private meditation chamber located under the hall.
This allowed them to meditate and gather proper rest before ascending to their next rank.

The physical layout of the room was grand.
An open room that held tall windows and several pillars to accommodate the large space.
A circular pattern on the floor of the chamber resembled the same pattern in the Jedi High Council Chamber.
The hall used zero artificial lightings and required it to be filled by daylight.
Aside from the eloquent details the hall held, the actual process of Knighting was detailed.
The Masters participating in the ceremony would circle the new Jedi Knight and ignite their lightsabers.
After proceeding with this, a Master would step out of the circle and cut the Padawan braid from the new Knight’s hair.
