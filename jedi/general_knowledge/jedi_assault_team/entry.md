# Introduction

The Jedi assault team, also known as the Jedi task force, was a strike team of 212 Jedi combatants formed by Jedi Master Mace Windu in 22 BBY.
Under the order of the Jedi High Council, the task force was dispatched to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi, his Padawan Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padm√© Amidala from execution in the Petrananki arena on Geonosis.
The task force was additionally commissioned to investigate reports that the Separatists were constructing an army on the planet.
A section of the strike team, commanded by Master Adi Gallia, flew Jedi starfighters to provide air support.
The space team suffered very few casualties, while most of the ground contingent was eliminated.
Their operation was an overture to the Battle of Geonosis, marking the beginning of the Clone Wars.

Upon arriving on-world, the assault team penetrated Geonosian defenses using two TX-130s fighter tanks piloted by Mace Windu and fellow Jedi Master Luminara Unduli, carving a path for the convoy of transports that carried the rest of the task force.
After quietly infiltrating the arena, the Jedi revealed themselves to Count Dooku and his Seperatist allies.
In the ensuing battle, the droid army swarmed the arena by the hundreds while the Geonosian onlookers fled amidst the chaos.
The onslaught immediately caused the deaths of a number of inexperienced Jedi Knights and Padawans.
The Jedi Council member Coleman Trebor attempted to challenge Dooku in lightsaber combat, only to be gunned down by Jango Fett.
Subsequently, the bounty hunter entered the arena to engage Mace Windu but was instead attacked by the reek, rendering his jetpack inoperable.
Fett was swiftly beheaded by the Jedi Master after being unable to escape with his damaged jetpack.
Towards the end of the battle, the remnants of the task force formed a defensive circle as they were being surrounded by the droids.
Over a dozen Jedi were part of the ring, while the other survivors were either wounded, in hiding or outside of the arena.
Dooku ordered a ceasefire to offer Mace Windu the chance of surrender, during which Kenobi checked the pulse of a fallen Jedi.
The Geonosians brought forward the captured Masters Ki-Adi Mundi, Plo Koon and Aayla Secura.
Windu refused to surrender with the intention of fighting to the end, resulting in the battle droids threatening to execute the remaining Jedi.
Before the droids could open fire, the Jedi Grandmaster Yoda arrived with reinforcements from the newly formed Grand Army of the Republic, routing Seperatist forces.

An estimated thirty of the 212 Jedi had survived the skirmish, with at least two more perishing in the Battle of Geonosis.
Despite the successful rescue mission, the Jedi Order was considerably drained after the numerous casualties which included several Jedi Masters, most of whom left behind Padawans.
With the exception of Coleman Trebor, all of the leaders of the task force had fortunately survived.
The arena was abandoned and was only returned for clones and Jedi to collect the bodies of the dead.
The surviving members of the task force became Generals of the Grand Army of the Republic until the Great Jedi Purge.
However, the devastating losses suffered by the assault team led to several dissidents refusing to fight for the Galactic Republic in the Clone Wars.
