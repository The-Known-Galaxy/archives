# Introduction
During the time of the Jedi, there were those who assumed the positions of Librarians.
Those who held this humble title were in charge of the record-keeping of the Jedi, and its history relative to the galaxy in the forms of notes, artifacts, and holocrons.
This required vast knowledge of subjects they specialized in, knowing their libraries like the back of their hand.
Constant updates and maintaining of the archives was a job befitting of their position.

In the year 19 BBY, the rapid collapse of the Republic and the Jedi began to fall through - this included the Jedi Librarians Order.
The Chief Librarian during these perilous times was Jedi Master Jocasta Nu, one of the select few Jedi who were able to escape with their lives during the Great Jedi Purge.
Able to run off with what remained of the archives, and her own knowledge - as well as her assistant Gar, she planned to establish a school in which the histories of the Jedi and the Galaxy could be safely taught to those sensitive to the Force.
In her last moments, she met her inevitable end at the hands of Darth Vader, when caught trying to escape with a holocron listed with the names of all known force-sensitive children.
