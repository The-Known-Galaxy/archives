# Introduction
The planet Volik, belonging to the Volik system, was located in the Unknown Regions.
It had two moons that were in close orbit with it.
The system contained a breathable atmosphere for humans.
Grasslands were spread out throughout the planet, with vast mountain ranges residing between them.
The planet was known to contain one sea.
Popular areas included Mount Vorena and The Colony.
Each day was about twenty-six hours, while each year was about four hundred and ten days.

# Section 1
A popular vacation company, Vekanda Leisure Colonies, had constructed a resort on the planet.
Once the business collapsed, pirates and smugglers began to establish new hideouts for their covert operations.
The freighter class ship, Nashuaga, wrecked on the planet with the notorious mask of Darth Nihilius.
Throughout the history of Volik, multiple Force-sensitive groups have set foot on the planet.
For example, Jedi Master Dorian Se’ol housed Force-sensitives on the planet but he was ultimately found by Darth Vader.
Many years following, more Force-sensitives found the teachings of the Jedi Master.



# Section 2
Originally, the planet was found by the Czerka Mining Corporation.
The rights to colonization were then sold to the Vekanda Leisure Colonies.
They built The Colony, which was a resort that would end up being an area of interest for generations to come.
Following this construction, the company ran into financial problems.
This led to gangs and crime lords essentially running the planet.
For example, the Crimson Starks and the Ebon Strikers committed violent acts against each other.
These kinds of pirate gangs would terrorize the planet for ages.



# Section 3
Following the crash of the Nashuaga, the relic remained onboard the ship.
Eventually, Sando, a Rodian, stumbled upon a ship with his fellow smugglers.
He was the leader of his smuggling gang that went by the name of Sando’s Boys.
Sando searched the freighter and found a hint to the mask of Darth Nihilus in the cargo manifest.
The Rodian desired to find the artifact and sell it for compensation.



# Section 4
Another group of adventurers was set on a quest to find the mask.
The group scaled Mount Vorena in hopes to reignite a travel beacon to find a ship.
Unfortunately for them, they were ambushed by Collan Eislo.
He was a leader of a sith cult.
The group luckily emerged victoriously.
They would continue their journey only to find Sando’s Boys at the wreck of the Nashuaga.
Sando, and his gang, were ultimately defeated as they proved weak.
Since the group won, they were the ones to stumble upon the treasure.



# Section 5
Upon the end of the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Dorin Se’ol arrived on the planet.
He and his Force-sensitives eradicated smugglers from the planet.
The Jedi Master was recently married, and he had a child.
Upon the death of his spouse, the Jedi Master struggled with the dark side of the Force.
Through his resilience, he ultimately was made a stronger Jedi.
While living on the planet, he avoided the attention of The Galactic Empire.
Unfortunately, Darth Vader ordered an invasion, and the Jedi Master was defeated.
The Jedi he mentored managed to escape.



# Section 6
During the Yuuzhan Vong War, more Force-sensitives settled in the world.
The group preferred pacifism and wanted no part in the war.
They were able to obtain the Jedi Master’s Holocron with his teachings on it.
They resided on the planet throughout the whole conflict.
In the future, smugglers did not land on the planet because it was believed to be bad luck.
