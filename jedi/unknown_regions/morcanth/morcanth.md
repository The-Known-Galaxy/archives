# Introduction
Located within the Unknown Regions, Morcanth was a planet which was in a region that was disputed between three separate species for centuries; these three species didn’t like the idea of being neutral and therefore never accepted neutrality.
Despite the planet being located in the Unknown Regions, Morcanth did appear on some charts but only older charts had the correct name of the planet due to the fact that it was renamed during the time of the Galactic Civil War.

# Section 1
Morcanth was the location to where there was an underground base which a fallen Jedi Padawan known as Winslau Da’k resided there.
Winslau had imprisoned his own Jedi Master within this base and extorted his power to gain wealth and luxury, using the Dark side of the Force to obtain this power.
Despite having control over his Master, he was still just a Padawan because his Master used the Force to contact a group to be able to avoid capture by alien fleets.
Because of the help from the Jedi Master, the group avoided capture and came to help the Jedi Master, killing Winslau Da’k.
The Jedi Master then became a mentor to this group, aiding them on their journey and becoming an adviser for them.
