# Introduction
Iol was a planet located in the Unknown regions.
It was rich with an ore that was used to forge durasteel, a durable and strong metal that had a variety of uses.
The planet was first discovered when a pilot crashed landed on Iol, hence naming the newly found planet after a god of death.
However, once the pilot was rescued, the Tangan Industries claimed Iol for themselves and started mining the ores of Iol.

# Section 1
Soon, the three main cities of Iol were founded.
These cities being Menelath, Haven and Shirkel.
Haven was known as the capital city of Iol, as it was the first civilization made on the planet.
The government of Iol was known as the Merchants’ Consortium, which consisted of many businesses that traded and sold goods to the citizens of the planet.
The government was also under control by the Tangan Industries.
The Tangan Industries tried to gain possession of a few mining cities throughout Iol, however they were mostly unsuccessful and the city workers would often resort to combat.



# Section 2
In the Mandalorian Wars, Darth Revan encountered the planet along with the many ships he led.
Revan made a trade with the administrator, trading some very advanced technology at that time, and in return Revan gained supplies as well as fuel for his ships.
Usually this would have been illegal due to the rules and laws of the Tangan Industries.
However in this case, after gaining the advanced technology from Revan, they decided to ignore their rules.



# Section 3
After the trade with Darth Revan, many cities dropped in terms of goods and resources, hence making goods extremely high priced.
Due to this, a group of rebels known as the Miners Union revolted against the Tangan Industries, which led to the administrator negotiation with the leader of the Miners Union.
This resulted in the Tangan Industries lowering the prices of the goods.
By the Galactic Empire era, many citizens of Iol decided to revolt again, but the Tangan Industries, as well as the administrator, decided to upgrade the technology in many cities, which resulted in the colonists settling down.
