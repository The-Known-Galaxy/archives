# Introduction
Among many other planets in the Unknown Regions, Lwhekk can be found in the Ssi-ruuk Star Cluster, inside the Ssi’kaat system.
It was also part of the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium, being its capital world.
This planet’s surface mostly consisted of jungles and large oceans with also a good number of volcanoes and cities.
Lwhekk served as a homeworld for two species known as the Ssi-ruuk and P’w’eck.
The natives built their cities in the jungles since it was the only land mass available, however, nature often fought back, damaging their property.
Some of the most known locations on the planet were the caves of Ss’laath and the influential Cree’n’aak Palace.
Due to the lack of resources on Lwhekk, Ssi-ruuk began conquering other worlds which often included enslaving the locals.
