# Introduction

Koda’s World was a planet within the Unknown Regions, specifically the Tarin system.
It was also known as Krin Koda, after the founder of the planet — a scout for the Galactic Empire.
This planet contains multiple life forms.
One of these species is the primitive Tempestro.
The planet was filled with thick, tropical jungles.
Due to its vast forest-like terrain, the planet was often compared to the Endor moon, as well as the Wookiee home planet of Kashyyyk.

# Section 1

The planet's native species, the Tempestro, were sentient reptilians.
Like many other species in the galaxy, the Tempestro were Force-sensitive.
Some of their most notable features included their long heads, razor-sharp claws, beaks, and their large wings.
Despite their large mass, the Tempestro were still able to fly.

The Tempestro had quickly become a well-civilized species, masters of the Force.
Because of their physical appearance, it was common to mistake the Tempestro for an aggressive and dominant race; this, however, was not the case, as the species was often very kind and gentle.

# Section 2

Living unbothered and peaceful for thousands of years, the Tempestro species and the planet itself; had experienced a meteor strike that would devastate it.
This natural disaster would disrupt the species' society, killing most of the planet's life forms.

Having survived near extinction, the Tempestro that had not died; became primitive, devolving into tribes that would build large stone buildings to separate the clans.
After this disaster, Krin Koda, a scout from the Galactic Empire, would discover the planet and its now primitive species.

Having found out what had happened to the Tempest rock, Koda sought to help the species regain its once-advanced civilization.
Koda helped cure a viral disease that had been plaguing the Tempestro for many years.

Due to this, the Tempestro had decided to name their planet after their savior, Koda.
They had even given the man the Eye of Koda, which was an amulet holding a bright gem within it.
Koda strongly believed that the amulet contained a map leading to the Tempestro Temple on the planet.
