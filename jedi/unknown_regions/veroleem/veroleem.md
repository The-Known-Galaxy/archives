# Introduction
The desert planet Veroleem, home of the Verollian species, is located in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy.

# Section 1
The desert planet is mainly covered in canyons, rocky hills, and mountain ranges with volcanic activity.
There are some locations in the planet where water exists, its temperature was too hot to support life.


Despite the planet’s weather and environment, it managed to sustain life in its polar regions, where temperatures were cool enough to survive in.
Verollians, species home to the planet, lived within these regions.



# Section 2
Veroleem was used as a refuge by the Republic colonists–due to the planet being remote–who sought to escape the authoritarian galactic government.
The colonists named the planet after their leader.
After some time, the colonists became more dependent on forcing outsiders into joining their cult, the Cult of Veroleem, to manufacture Kryotin Powder–an old narcotic agent known to the galaxy–for money.
They sent the outsiders, who were forced to abandon their living to be more focused in the cult, to other systems to recruit others.
Although criminal organizations tried to profit by collaborating with the cult, this was abandoned because of “accidents” showing up.

During the Mandalorian Wars, the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders–an order of Mandalorians by Mandalore the Ultimate–assessed the desert planet, with others thinking of using Kryotin as a bioweapon.
The plan was declined and left Veroleem in peace.

In the Jedi Civil War, the original claim to Veroleem vanished–but an off-world mining company supported their claim on the planet only for them to mine Lommite–a type of ore that was a primary material for durasteels and starfighter canopies.
The Council of Enlightened Elders went to court in order to dispute the claim to keep their work secret from the others, the Jedi Order became aware of this and the cult, which opposed their views.

By the end of the New Sith Wars, the Cult of Veroleem returned to their old doings because they knew that the Jedi would have less time to investigate because they were more involved with the Galactic Senate.

By the time of the Clone Wars, the people in Veroleem stayed neutral, but were secretly supporting the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

When Darth Sidious became the Galactic Emperor, the dumping ground for political opponents was used on the planet.
The Rebel Alliance never discovered where the planet was located.
As the Second Galactic Empire appeared, the cult returned to their old doings of recruiting.
