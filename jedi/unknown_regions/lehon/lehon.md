# Introduction
INTRODUCTION
Lehon is known under a much more famous name, Rakata Prime.
This unknown world was once the homeworld of the infamous Rakata species.
They kept this planet hidden from their many foes, and it acted as the capital or base of operations for the duration of their existence.
This makes the planet a remarkable treasure trove of Rakatan history and ruins.

DESCRIPTION
“This planet’s a technological graveyard.” - Canderous Ordo

Between 35,000 - 25,200 BBY the Rakata used this as their homeworld.
The Rakata, a species motivated by conquest and destruction, and characterised by extremely advanced technology, had enslaved hundreds of species during this period.

They had created the sentient Star Forge which fed into their massive armies as it acted as a super production facility.

Alongside Rakata Prime, the infinite empire had over (500) planets, (11,000,000,000) Rakata and over (1,000,0000,0000,000) slaves.
These numbers are not exaggerated, and hopefully this gives one the idea of the scale of this empire.

The Rakata were not even defeated by enemies but rather their own civil wars which led to mass slave uprisings and simply an over extension of resources.
Furthermore, the Rakata were unfortunate enough to encounter a plague that rendered them non-force-sensitive.
This is something that they had used to exploit other species, and without these abilities, they no longer held an edge in combat.



# Section 2
Rampant cannibalism ensued on Rakata Prime and many of their other worlds which essentially devoured the planet.
Now, it’s nothing other than an archaeological phenomenon covered in jagged ruins and scarred remains.

The remaining Rakata fled into the underground of Rakata Prime in an attempt to preserve themselves.

JEDI CIVIL WAR
Many years later, during the Galactic Republic period, remnants of the Rakata resurfaced.
This included clans such as “The One”.
The Elders who resurfaced, who remembered their past history, constructed a guard to defend the Temple of the Ancients which held all of the Rakatan technology secrets.

Furthermore, the planet interestingly enough, had a disruptor field.
This EMP’d the ships that entered the atmosphere and sent them crashing into the surface which acted as defence.
Overtime, species like rancors and gizka began breeding on the planet since ships with them in their cargo had left them on the planet.

Revan visited the planet twice, the first time to steal technology and the second to disable the disruptor fleet and destroy the star forge.

The Republic and the Sith also engaged in large battles on the planet, and later the Jedi celebrated a victory with Revan and others being awarded the Cross of Glory.



# Section 4
POST-CIVIL WAR
The planet was now littered with even more ruins and broken spaceships following these battles and the Republic decided to make Lehon and it’s system a historical site.
This protected it from being part of civil wars ever again.

At first it was prohibited from the public to prevent Rakatan secrets from being stolen, but this hope was shattered when Revan returned for a third time in 3638 BBY.
This time, he planned on using the Temple of the Ancients to create a Sith army.
He was however defeated by Republic and Sith loyalists.

Later on, Sterla, a Horizon Guard Scout Commander, ventured to Rakata prime to create a star fortress strong enough to erode the Eternal Alliance.
However, they were defeated by the neighboring guards.

Even further on, Darth Bane in 1000 BBY visited the planet to find Darth Revan’s Sith Holocron.
He realised the planet was dripping in dark side energy, and surprisingly, even moreso than Korriban.
He was one of the first to uncover this as much of Rakata Prime had been kept secret from the public by the Jedi.
