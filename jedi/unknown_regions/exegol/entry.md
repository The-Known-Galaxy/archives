This was a warzone for the Resistance and the final order, which the Resistance won at the end, bringing an end to Sith loyalists and the final order.
Years before this war, a Jedi Elder by the name of Kli wrote that the planet was once a fertile environment, until the sith came and colonized the planet, just as they did with Korriban, Ziost, and Asog.
A Sith Citadel was created on the planet to perform rituals and meetings, Sith loyalists excavated the planet in hope to find a transportive vergance believed to lie beneath the surface.

During the age of the Empire, the two Sith lords Darth Sidious and Darth Vader possessed two wayfinders.
Wayfinders were sith holocron shaped maps that were able to locate Exegol due to Exegol not being on any other star map.
Exegols atmosphere had a combination of dust particles rubbing together, creating static charges to form what appeared to be lightning strikes hitting the ground.
The full history of this planet is unknown, but most of the information comes from Sith loyalists that documented the era of which they were colonizing the planet, or the Final orders war against the resistance.
