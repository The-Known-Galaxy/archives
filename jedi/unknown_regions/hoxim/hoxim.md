# Introduction
The planet Hoxim was situated in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy.
It was home to luscious forests and grasslands, and distinct mountains and deserts, but the soil was surprisingly acidic meaning it couldn’t support plants the Chiss could eat.
Largely free from alteration, it preserved much of its terrain, waters and fauna.

However, by 18 BBY, the peace was disrupted in a plan to collapse the Chiss Ascendancy.
The Agbui Haplif misled three Great Families of the Ascendancy into thinking the Agbui had dominion over a previously unowned nyix mining settlement and that they were dismissive of the value of this “blue spinpria”, causing a skirmish above the planet to claim it.
Nyix was a rare silver-coloured metal found in the Unknown Regions used to strengthen ships so was highly valued in the galaxy.
This is where the planet earned its name as the Agbui mining world.
Acting like he didn’t know any better, Haplif advertised Hoxim as a location filled with nyix that the Agbui could create a lot of jewellery out of, which the Ascendancy could profit from through trade.
This eventually caught the attention of Councilor Lakuviv of the Xodlak family who decided to invest in the mine.
As planned, this also attracted the Pommrio and Erighal families.
In actual fact, Jixtus, a member of the Grysk Hegemony, and Haplif plotted to start a civil war on the planet Sunrise, from which Haplif stole nyix.
Onboard the Springhawk, Senior Captain Thrawn was able to see through Haplif’s plot and destroyed the mine, portraying it as an accident and stopping the scheme.
