# Introduction
Zonama Sekot was a living and sentient world that had the ability to travel according to its own will.
Although the planet was fully mobile, it was most often found in the Unknown Regions.
Zonama Sekot was a name in Ferroan which translated to “World of Body and Mind.” The north pole of Zonama Sekot was encapsulated in ice and surrounded by tropical jungles across the entire hemisphere; meanwhile, the southern hemisphere was covered in clouds and frequent storms.
Several flowing rivers, lakes and small seas were present around the equator.

Zonama Sekot was the successor of the Yuuzhan Vong’s homeworld, which was located in a foreign galaxy.
The world was a seed produced from the living planet Yuuzhan’tar, immediately before it was destroyed in a conflict.
Zonama Sekot ended up in the known galaxy and in 89 BBY, the planet was colonized by the Ferroan and Langhesi species.
The Ferroans were adherents to a philosophy of the Force called the Potentium, viewing the Force as a whole rather than split into light and dark.
At some point before the Clone Wars, the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker visited the planet to meet a fellow Jedi named Vergere as well as to purchase one of the planet’s living ships.
Anakin Skywalker bonded with a record number of 12 seed-partners, thorn-covered organisms that evolved from a tree-like plant called a Bora.
The seed-partners were the basis for all the organic spacecraft produced on Zonama Sekot.
In 29 BBY, the then Republic security force commander Wilhuff Tarkin declared war on the sentient planet, which soon escaped into the Unknown Regions using its hyperdrive system built by the Langhesi.

The Yuuzhan Vong War saw Zonama Sekot siding with the reformed New Republic, known as the Galactic Alliance.
After the sentient world met Luke Skywalker and Jacen Solo, it offered its assistance against the galaxy’s invaders.
Nearing the end of the war, Zonama Sekot participated in the Recapture of Coruscant alongside a Galactic Alliance fleet.
 In the aftermath of the battle, the planet proposed the Sekot Accords, a peace treaty between the Galactic Alliance and the Yuuzhan Vong.
The planet was revealed to be the heir of the Yuuzhan Vong’s ancient homeworld, and as part of the terms of peace, the remaining Yuuzhan Vong went into exile on Zonama Sekot.
In 127 ABY, the Sith-Imperial war caused Zonama Sekot to withdraw further into the Unknown Regions, where it continued to be located as of 130 ABY.
