# Introduction

Ilum is a terrestrial planet, composed of 90% ice and possesses a Type I (breathable) atmosphere.
The planet would experience extremely low temperatures and significant winds, thus the outermost layer of the planet is covered mostly with snow and shallow oceans, with terrain such as icy mountains, ice flows, and caverns.
Below the surface of Ilum is a series of caves and openings, of which houses the extremely valuable Adegan crystals, used to power a Jedi’s lightsaber.

# Section 1

Discovery of the planet occurred in 22,800 BBY by a Jedi who was exploring the Unknown regions of space.
Upon uncovering Ilum’s system, the scout was directed by the Force specifically to the Fifth planet in the system - Ilum.
On first inspection the planet seemed unimpressive and barren, showing no significance or importance but the local fauna, which had adapted to the extreme climate of Ilum’s frigid temperature.

# Section 2

After the discovery of Ilum and its lightsaber crystals, the Jedi High Council decided to conceal the exact coordinates to the planet in order to keep Jedi activity undisturbed while on Ilum - contrary to the usual procedure of informing the Galactic Senate.
Scholars, artisans, and other Jedi were sent to explore the expansive caves, and in time, the Jedi began to erect their own structures and temples on the surface of the planet.
