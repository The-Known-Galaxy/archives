# Introduction

O’reen is a planet in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy originally inhabited by the near human species of the O’reenians.
The O’reenians originally developed from Humans, and spoke a language that was derived from Bocce.
The planet was colonized soon after the Great Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY as an advance warning outpost.
The outpost was a military garrison that was self-sufficient, and had its own satellite network to warn of incoming hazards.
After the O’reenian outpost and its several copies across multiple other planets failed to serve their functions, the Republic stranded the colony thus isolating it from the rest of the galaxy.

Magnus, the colony’s military chief saw that if the colony was doomed unless a strict order was established, overthrew the unpopular leader of the colony in a quick coup spilling no blood.
Within a standard year O’reen was established as a military dictatorship, and due to the planet’s resources, it was able to successfully survive and flourish.
Magnus’s surname eventually  became the title of the colony’s ruler.
After decades of O’reens colonization, its original goal was forgotten, and its society became a caste system based on maintaining the colony’s readiness to battle and martial prowess.

# Section 2

Contact with the known galaxy was renewed when several centuries before the clone wars, a corporate vessel landed on the planet.
Its captain tried to impress the natives with his superior technology, and claim the planet for corporate uses, but he was ultimately defeated by the planet’s military.
Another contact was made in the clone wars when an exploration ship of the Grand Army of the Republic investigated the area for Separatist supply depots.
The ship failed at first contact, leading to a misunderstanding that ultimately led to blood.
A rescue operation by a Jedi General succeeded and resulted in the death of the reigning Magnus.
The successor to the dead Magnus did not want to risk another violent intervention with the Republic, but the Republic senate decided to order a quarantine around the planet that would last beyond the Republic, the Empire and up to the New Republic, hiding it from the galaxy once more.
