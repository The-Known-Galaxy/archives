# Introduction

Csilla is a planet located deep in the Unknown Regions of Chiss Space, within the Csilla system.
The planet is currently experiencing an ice age that has lasted from 5000 BBY, thus the primary terrain consists of ice flows, frozen oceans and glaciers.
Due to unique minerals residing within the planet, Glaciers appear significantly more blue in colour, and are responsible for the skin colour of Csilla’s own inhabitants - the Chiss.

# Section 1

Csilla is inhabited primarily by the Chiss, a blue-to-silver-skinned humanoid race differing only from Humans with their blue skin colour and glowing red eyes.
Their eyes may appear a darker red if exposed to a significant amount of oxygen throughout their lifetime.
The Chiss share a natural height of 1.8 meters and average lifespan of 70-80 years similarly to Humans, and largely inhabit two major cities on the planet - Csaplar, the planet's capital, and Ac’siel.

# Section 2

Humans first discovered Csilla between the years 27,500 BBY and 27,500 BBY, and colonized the planet.
Upon colonization, they created a government, erected structures and began thriving as a species on this planet.
These humans would exist on this planet for thousands of years and eventually develop to be the Chiss we know present day.
Approximately 5000 BBY the planet experienced an ice age that continues to exist for a millenia and occurs to this day as well.
Locked in what seemed to be an infinite ice age accelerated and motivated the Chiss’ space program, and the change in environment would force socioeconomic and technological changes, now receiving imports from other worlds in order to maintain their population, and exporting information to other worlds and organizations.
During the Great Galactic War the Chiss’ government - the Chiss Ascendancy - negotiated terms with the Sith Empire which resulted in an agreement of resources exported from Csilla in return for the Empire’s sovereignty.
