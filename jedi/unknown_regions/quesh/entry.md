# Introduction

Quesh was a toxic atmospheric planet located in the Hutt Space region.
The planet had an era of geological instability called the quake, but Quesh would later be discovered by the Galactic Republic during the Great War.
Because of the planet's harsh conditions, the planet would be abandoned by the Galactic Republic.
Until the Cold War, where key resources can be found on Quesh to make reflex enhancement substances.

# Section 1

While Quesh was not in the interest of the Galactic Republic at first, a Republic chemist named Bardian Aelto saw the great potential the planet could offer.
As a chemist, he realized that the chemical compounds on the planet had a resemblance to a chemical called venenit shadaga or Hutt Venom when translated.
Hutt venom is the main ingredient when making adrenals which enhances the reflexes of the users.
Now that the Republic found a planet that held a substitute, they could mass produce their own adrenals and strengthen their army like never before.
Once the Republic made their way back to Quesh, mining started and so did production.
Aelto would name the adrenal venenit queshaga or Quesh Venom.

# Section 2

The Republic did face the issue of turning the chemicals into adrenals, so with not many options they turned to the Hutts for help, even though they had an alliance with the Sith Empire at the time.
With some negotiation and cut in of the profits, three Hutt cartels lent their knowledge to the Republic.
Within ten years the Republic had a full investment in the Quesh’s production of adrenals.
However, the Republic and Hutt cartels could not keep the production of adrenals a secret from the Sith Empire forever.
Eventually, the Empire discovered the deal and forced the three Hutt cartels involved to help in taking control of Quesh’s production line for themselves.
