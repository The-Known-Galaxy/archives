# Introduction

Located in the Unknown regions, not much is known about Rapacc apart from the knowledge that it was capable of supporting sentient life and its capital city was named Boropacc.
The planet was never discovered by the Republic, only being known to the Chiss and other species within the Unknown Regions.

# Section 1

The planet was blockaded during the Nikardun Conquests by the Nikardun dynasty for taking in refugees from a planet that had been razed by the Nikarduns.
The planet was later freed due to the efforts of Grand Admiral Thrawn.

# Section 2

A sentient race with pink skin and feathered heads, the Paccosh were able to speak a couple of standard trade languages.
A member of this species, Uingali foar Marocsaa, would gift Grand Admiral Thrawn a treasured heirloom, a ring with the insignia of a Chimera engraved on it.
This would then become Thrawn's personal symbol, seen in the naming of his capital ship.
