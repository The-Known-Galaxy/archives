# Introduction
Ahch-To was a planet located in the Unknown Regions, and was the beginning of the Jedi Order, where it was home to many ancient Jedi texts.
With the view from space, Ahch-To seemed to be a shallow planet, consisting of nothing but large masses of water.
But after close inspection, small rocky island archipelagos, which were covered in trees and grass, would appear on the planet's surface.
The planet also had lifeforms living in it, such as some birds like porgs, large thala-sirens, and Lanai alongside some less complex organisms such as moss, grass, and fern.
The planet held the first Jedi Temple on an island known as Temple Island which by the time of the conflict between the First Order and the Resistance was left in ruins and was unrecognizable.

Ahch-To was the foundation of the Jedi Order, that is before the Great Jedi Purge.
However, there was a debate on the true location which guesses such as Tython, Coruscant, Jedha, and Ossus being declared by Jedi scholars.
Despite the endless bickering and discussion, the location of the first Jedi Temple remained a hidden mystery up until the end of the Galactic Civil War.



# Section 2
Jedi Master Luke Skywalker inhabited this planet three centuries after the Galactic Civil War, who at the time was in exile after his temple and students were destroyed by Ben Solo, in search of the first Jedi Temple.
Luke Skywalker was able to locate the exact location of the Temple by the usage of a Jedi star compass; this compass which Luke discovered in Pillio held a plasma-encased supraluminite lodestone in the compasses center.
The reason why it managed to find the Temple was because it worked similarly to a wayfinder, which was a compass used for hyperspace travel.
By observing the compass, Luke eventually uncovered a path to the site of Temple Island and the first Jedi Temple.



# Section 3
With the fight against the Galactic Empire, General Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker's sister, tried to get Luke to help her and the Rebel Alliance.
Leia sent Commander Poe Dameron to Jakku, where he acquired the location of Luke, a map given to Skywalker's astromech droid R2-D2.
The droid was functioning in low power mode after Skywalker's exile, but was able to uncover the full map to Ahch-To.
Rey, who was a Force-sensitive scavenger at the time, took the map and found Skywalker in his exile, accompanied by Chewbacca, and R2-D2.



# Section 4
While on the planet, Skywalker trained Rey, upon finishing her training, Luke chose to remain on the planet, rather than travel to Crait to fight the First Order.
After being spoken to and visited by the spirit of master Yoda, Skywalker would project his spirit to the Crait, where he would interact with the Resistance and with his pupil Kylo Ren.
This projection took a lot of Force Energy from Luke, which led to his end.
On this planet, Luke achieved inner peace and successfully became one with the force.
