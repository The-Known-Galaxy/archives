# Introduction

I still remember the laughter I shared back in Coruscant, simpler times when my only obligations were to attend Master Yoda's training sessions to channel our force abilities.
We became accustomed to a routine; a day anew was spent in devotion to the betterment of our connection to the Force.
I stood in awe as the Masters walked past me in the halls; I could not utter a word to them.
I was too timid at the time, but I assured myself that I would one day overcome the discrepancy between our talents; I kept my head high.
Adamant about reaching my aspirations, I dreamed of graduating to escape these restraints and see the galaxy for myself.
I craved action, though it is against our teachings; I cannot contain myself these days.
Should you have asked me if I considered life in the Temple mundane, I would have thought it over; in hindsight, I would know my response, how foolish I was.
Although the Temple's walls shielded us, I was never appreciative of it, though none of us truly were.
Instead, the other Younglings were ecstatic for the day we could embark on our journeys across the galaxy, creating a name for ourselves.
Though not very social, I could barely contain myself when the thought of assembling my lightsaber and becoming a peacekeeper arose.
We lived in bliss and luxury, though we never knew any other way; I felt like I had my future sealed and was able to fulfill my responsibilities.
Throwing caution to the wind, I attended every training the Temple offered to hone my skills; I was never one for doubt or wariness, so why was I feeling this way?
Now I remember.

Admittedly, I was selfish and too focused on my ambitions that I had not considered those around me.
We sat around the Master as we listened to their stories, secluding myself from many of the other Younglings, seeing them as mere competitors.
To think we intended to live amongst each other as a family as if I needed their hand.
How foolish I was.
I exited the room leaving with only outrage; impatience consumed me.
Though as if the darkness surrounding my aura had immediately parted, the Master called for me.
His voice: profound yet, forgiving, as if I could forget it, and yet fading in my memory.
He called out to me, "Koros!" I turned down the hall to see Jedi Master Rath Lo, a hardened warrior with renowned lightsaber mastery.
I feared I would be reprimanded for my sentiments on the other Younglings, contemplating fleeing, though I was too intrigued.
I did not know much about the Master other than that they emphasized lightsaber combat; inherently, my mind was immersed with questions about improving my talents.
No longer was I an immature Youngling; I vocalized all my questions, demanding his insight, a testament to my growth.
Master Rath Lo laughed as I stood, maintaining my posture; he responded to my questions with one of his own.
Resembling one of the statues I gazed upon in the Temple halls, nothing could have prepared me for what I had heard.
The old brag of my heart, "I will leave this Temple by all means," realized itself as everything and everyone around me whom I saw as obstacles began to fade; my only focus was on the lips of Master Rath Lo, as each word emitted felt like a stepping stone to my ambitions.
Youngling dreams of hearing the words: "You are reckless, just as I was; at the moment, I do not have the time to answer all your questions.
Although I assure you that will not be an issue, how could I resist seeing my Padawan again?" How arrogant he was, from their last few words, I did not know whether to be moody by their arrogance or fall to my knees in disbelief; I did both, knowing that the Force had led me on this bittersweet path.
Pondering back on it, the Master was right; we are similar.

I reflect on the past often, not that I would like to, but it seems unavoidable.
I possessed nothing but the robes on my back and an incessant tenacity.
Obtaining my early success required a miracle; I wish I could have another.
Several years after the grandest moment of my young life, I found myself under the instruction of a Master with no comparison.
No longer was I scrambling through the Temple's halls seeking exercises, and though I am yet impatient, so was my Master.
Though odd to think of now, I can flawlessly describe each detail of my sleeping quarters.
We did not have much space in the Youngling nurseries; nevertheless, I did not think much of it and rarely spent my time in either room.
Master Rath Lo and I were regularly awake before the other Knights, meditating outside as the sun's rising glow rendered on our skin.
Coruscant's Weather Control Network regulates our climate; it does not rain until after sundown, and we never fail to witness the sunrise.
The transition from rainfall to gleaming skies acts as a daily reminder to evoke positivity, opposing all forms of malevolence to enjoy the feeling of a new day.
It no longer rains; the sun continues to taunt me.
I never presumed I would come to detest it.
Unconvinced of the Uneti trees that surrounded us, my Master told me they inhibit force sensitivity and are not much different from him and me.
The Archive contained an article claiming they enhanced our connection to the Force and retrieved a sapling; I am still unconvinced of their abilities; perhaps I  merely wanted to freshen my quarters.
Regardless of motive, my interest in that blossoming sapling was sincere; much like we Humans, left untouched, we shall grow into mighty entities.
Who is looking after it?
Although Master Rath Lo specialized in lightsaber combat, I had yet to assemble my lightsaber.
Uncertain of why his teachings have consisted merely of the philosophical aspect of the Force, I exclaimed to him, "Have I yet to reach the pinnacle of my spiritual connection to the Force?
How could you not begin my teachings on combat?" I remember the expression on his face; he rose in discontent and complied; this would be the only regret I would come to have.

Master Rath Lo explained that before I am able to hone my talents in lightsaber combat, I must, of course, assemble my lightsaber.
He understood I was not like the other Jedi; we are defiant to some aspects of our code.
He always saw right through me; those several years with him taught me more of myself than I tend to admit.
It was a rare commodity for me to engage with the others in the Temple, and before me was a man whom I considered a parental figure.
We did not leave Coruscant before this day; I was exhilarated, above all things.
I aspired to travel the galaxy and demonstrate my prowess to all agents of evil.
Like all instances, my Master came along for this mission.
We traveled to the planet Dantooine; I had read that this was considered sacred grounds, though the rest of the information was restricted to the eyes of merely Masters.
I asked, "What are we doing here, Master?" he remained silent, determined to reach somewhere.
I was riddled with anxiety; it required willpower to follow along quietly, nearly succumbing to boredom; what had shown itself before me was a wonder like no other.
Antiquated caverns glistening with dew, the stars had become visible in the sky after our prolonged expedition.
However, my eyes, affixed to the cavern's walls, would not dare to look elsewhere.
I was told that my path as a Peacekeeper began here: I must search for my kyber crystal.
I was offered only a lantern; the Force would guide me to my destination.
The cavern's walls were extended, and nightfall's arrival was to no benefit.
I grew wary; I had read of the subterranean creatures domestic to this planet; they were territorial arachnids, imposing in stature.
As if I would fear an overgrown insect, the training I received from my Master did not necessarily improve my combative abilities, but my senses have been enriched.
There were many crystals scattered throughout the cave.
I could not hear them calling for me; they were awaiting someone else.
A chill ran down my spine; I heard vibrations echoing through the cave and the sound of shattering ice.
The noises grew in numbers; there was a source distinct from the others as if a large man was hissing; it seemed I was not alone.
I followed the tunnels of the cave system, discovering a large area adorned with human skeletons, weapons, and animals stringed in a web.
At that time, I had felt no fear quite like this; it is difficult to describe their figure, even more so to explain why I did not decide to escape immediately.
The creatures were enormous; their arms were met with a sharpened point, with one attaching to their head to continue their attacks without debilitating posture.
They stared at me through their multiple eyes; they began snarling, it seemed before I; none had dared to enter their cavern in considerable time.
Defenseless, I rushed to grab a weapon from the ground.
I had no time to be selective; as I gripped what appeared to be a vibrosword, my body became immobile.
What is that creature that stood before me?
It was one of those abominations I saw earlier; it seemed as if it could engulf the cavern itself.
It was their queen.
Fear was not something I had accustomed myself to; this sensation, thrilling yet ferocious, I was adamant in finding my crystal; I would not meet my end to a glorified insect.
They came from all directions; I swung my blade valiantly, but my efforts amounted to nothing; their armor was virtually impenetrable.
A sensation unknown to me, someone or something was calling to my spirit; I closed my eyes in the hope of direction.
It revealed itself to me, a bright orange glow emitting from what appeared to be a block of ice from a distance.
I dropped my vibrosword; the texts were correct; I had never felt such vitality in the Force.
The creatures heeded my will, and nearing the Queen, I felt appalled to see that what I thought was ice was an egg sac.
To begin my journey, I had to end many others; I did not have time to feel conflicted.
With slight hesitation, I rummaged through the egg sac, retrieving my crystal.
How irrational would I be to remain any longer?
Fleeing with glory, I felt no remorse.
Hurrying to Master Rath Lo, I presented my orange crystal; their expression was unsettled but understanding.
While assembling my lightsaber hilt to reflect my endeavors, a dark metallic body with a white gradient symbolizing the impact on the galaxy I wish to compel, I asked my Master what the implications of an orange crystal are.
It became clear that I had received the privilege of bearing the title of Jedi but that my morals were now in question for all to see; I had violated a balance between the dark and light side of the Force.
My mind ridicules me; this knowledge resonates with me to no foreseeable end.

I missed Coruscant, my Master, and I would continue awaiting the sunrise, but now I have cause to force combat instruction.
At the age of 23, we embarked on countless assignments throughout the galaxy; I neared my Knighthood Trials.
While that is an event all Padawans aspire to reach, I could not bear to leave the man that has given me such an opportunity.
I became a seasoned warrior myself, with Master Rath Lo as my inspiration.
We all sensed a disturbance in the Force; we are living in troubling times, and the fate of the galaxy is clouded.
We were informed of a massive army of clones bred in discretion; we all have our sentiments on the matter; I, for one, was excited to share the battlefield with them.
The Temple received word that the Senate has lawfully assumed the army, and not long after, Master Yoda requested for us all to meet in the board room.
What we heard was unprecedented, unthinkable; we were to travel to the terrestrial planet Geonosis in preparation for war.
I could sense the diverse emotions in the room; we were left without an option, and my dreams as a Youngling appeared to be materializing.
Hundreds of Knights and their Padawans boarded a shuttle to the battlefield.
This task force included Master Rath Lo and me, it took some discussion, but I pushed him to agree to join our cause.
The Clone Army would unfortunately not be able to deploy alongside us; regardless, we were adamant this ordeal would be met with success, I assured it.
Pushing the other Padawans aside, I discreetly entered the coliseum awaiting the command to strike.
The planet was arid.
Merely 5% of the surface comprised water; these were no conditions for a lengthy battle.
Multiple shots were heard from a distance, and at that moment, I saw but a glimpse of what to expect; as the locals evacuated, the coliseum was loaded with bloodthirsty Battle Droids.
The war had begun.
Hundreds of Jedi poured into battle; I followed my Master to deter reinforcements from the west doorway.
Unlike our previous assignments, I had not witnessed bloodshed of this caliber.
We had witnessed the ferocity of the Battle Droids previously; it was evident these were nothing alike.
Our numbers dwindled, and I began to wonder where the reinforcements were; my confidence intact, I pushed forward.
I remember the screams, Padawans pleading for help; what was I doing?
Unfortunately, I was too immersed in the battle ahead; how foolish I was.
Amid the conflict, a scream halted me; how could I forget his voice?
After nearly a decade of training to preserve the life of the one person I had grown close to, I let my obsession supersede my responsibility.
His final moments were spent laughing; I carefully listened to his words as I could no longer control my emotions.
As his grip began to loosen, he said, smiling, "We truly were reckless." Looking over him in turmoil, my actions became uncertain; I failed my Master.
I tightened my lightsaber grip, glancing at my blade's hue.
I recalled what we spoke of when I found my crystal; hatred would not consume me.
The clones, at last, arrived, forcibly pulling me away from my Master's body; I boarded a shuttle to continue the battle, never thinking I would become disinterested in all this conflict.
I assumed a leadership position of a clone platoon; I was tasked with destroying any remains of the Geonosian subterranean catacombs.
I was unhinged; I led my men to a trap; I could barely hold the falling rocks long enough for them to escape.
So why are all of these memories coming back to me?
I opened my eyes to darkness; I had never considered doing something so selfless in the past; why have I sabotaged myself?
I have yet to fulfill my endeavors.
I began to lose air; while I may not be present to reap the benefits, I know that I have done well.
As I lay, wishing for one last rainfall, I see a familiar face in the form of a spirit, the man that granted me everything, Master Rath Lo.
I could not express all I wanted to say to him at the time; I took advantage of this moment together.
Time has always been an issue, and that is especially true now.
I could only form a few sentences, "Instead of wasting our time, we should have been practicing.
So tell me!
Why, why did we spend so much time meditating?" As my eyes began to close, I heard his final words "I wished to see the sunrise together, even after death." I indeed had but one regret, how foolish I was.
