# Introduction
“Focus.” Her master stated as she was thrown back to the floor again.
“There will come a time when you will need to fight a greater threat than me.
Then, you must be ready.” He spoke again, helping her up.
He then walked back to the end of the mat and ignited his lightsaber, the brilliant gold color glowing through the temple.
“Remember, focus your mind.
Hear the force speaking to you.
Don't let your mind get ahead of your soul.
Do not act with fear, nor favor.
You are a Jedi.
Feel your surroundings, don't simply see them.” He uttered in a long breath.
She ignited her blade, the emerald color sputtering as she got into a low stance.
The force to her had always felt like a song.
A rhythm, or a tune that had a constant beat.
She just had to feel that beat.
She took a long breath and focused her mind, feeling the beat throughout her soul as she ran forward to confront her master again.

Reality snaps back hard.
So it did for her, as the memory of her master played through her mind.
The teachings still ring true.
But now, he is gone.
Another victim of the war to claim thousands.
She leaned back in her chair.
She had no one now, sitting in the debris of the old Jedi temple she used to call home.
The temple she was taught in.
Danger always seemed to be lurking in the parts where she least expected it.
She stood up, and walking into the moonlight of the forest, kneeled down.

“Master, how much more of this must we do?” Her own thoughts rang in her mind and she asked that same question to herself.
How much more of this would she have to endure?
Life was not easy for any Jedi.
Her kind was scattered to the brim.
Still kneeling, she focused, feeling the force around her.
The only calm that she could have anymore in this time of turmoil.
Her mind and memories flashed before her, of what had happened.
The future seemed to call to her too, what was to happen.
This feeling of calm and uncertainty, in one combined into the only sensation she seemed to be able to feel anymore.

This sensation however was cut off by a horrific noise.
The cackling of a red blade.
It spat and sputtered and she spun around, igniting her emerald blade.
She didn't dare jump forward, staying but holding a low guard.
The words of her master rang through her mind and she prepared for the worst.
“Focus.” It was almost as he was speaking to her.
She felt the rhythm through her mind and the sith came dashing at her.
She held her block perfectly and met his blade, creating a violent glow and a bone chilling noise.
She flipped backwards, confident she could beat him now.
She went in for a swing at his side, but was met by an immovable snap of the enemy.
Her lightsaber went flying out of her hands and crashed into the dirt and the victorious sith snapped a hold on her neck.
The enemy raised her up by the neck and brought her close to his face.
“I could kill you quickly now, but I would rather watch the life drain from your eyes.” The Sith snarled as she struggled for her life.
As she was brought closer to his face, the red glow of his lightsaber illuminated his face.
As the world became black around her, the last image she saw was her own master's face, staring back.
