# Introduction
The architecture's ancient design and the ambient lighting cast upon it create a sense of serenity in these halls.
Embraced by the eternal history of the Order as one passed the decorated walls and sculptures for the significant individuals of the past.
Without a moment's notice, the sound of footsteps filled the room.
"It's integral that we remember the sacrifices of the Founders; the sculptures across the temple were made in their honor, along with the numerous others that devoted their life to the betterment of the Galaxy." cheerfully said Kraios, a gallant Sentinel unknowing of what his origins were other than being Human.
"Do you think I would ever earn one of myself, Master?" Aiva said as her face lit up, a female Chiss and Kraios' padawan.
Kraios erupted in a soft laughter, "Well, now I have your attention?
Aiva, you control your destiny if you wish to be remembered.
I'm confident that you'll have a sculpture in the future for us to laugh about as we go on our walks." Aiva stared at her Master for a moment, then at her feet as they walked down the hall, smiling as she could nearly envision the future she had long yearned for.
"It's crowded here today." Aiva lifted her head to see they had reached the Great Hall with hundreds of fellow Jedi.
Extensive chatter brought the hall to life, laughter as far as the eye could see.
The dawn of a new day was welcomed with clear skies and friendly conversation that would leave any enamored.
Kraios never paid much attention to it; his realistic approach to life made him a controversial figure within the Order as it contradicted the ancient Jedi philosophy.
His Padawan, Aiva, allowed him to be more appreciative of the Order and the daily responsibilities of a Knight.
"Oh, Aiva, did you want to continue where we left off with your lightsaber training-" Kraios was abruptly interrupted by his comlink.
Besides an eerie static, nothing was received, the embodiment of emptiness; Kraios waited for something to be made out of the unknown signal.
One by one, all the other comlinks in the hall received a similar static.
Kraios looked around in curiosity as the Great Hall, once filled with roaring laughter, was engulfed with the sound of a premonitory tone.
His heart began to race as his breath shallowed, hastening with every passing second, an indescribable feeling thought to have been forgotten.
A message was made out in the panic: "My chains are broken."
A bright light could be seen in the reflection of Kraios' eyes, and with one final gasp, they were closed shut.
Menacing clouds of smoke filled the hall, and screams of torment were silenced as Kraios stared into the darkness of the void.
Kraios tightened his grip on his lightsaber, and the other Knights followed suit.
He called out to Aiva, worried for his young Padawan, visibly shaken by what was before her.
"Are you alright?!" shouted Kraios, to which Aiva responded with a subtle nod as she reached for her lightsabers.
Kraios was petrified, but not for his own life; that wasn't it.
An image from the depths of hell presented itself, a gale of hatred barreling towards the inner hall; sinister laughter echoed off the walls as red streaks of light collectively followed, illuminating the dark.
And from the darkness emerged a menacing figure wearing a hideous grin as blood dripped from its face.
Piercing red eyes that set your soul ablaze, illuminating from their black, almost mechanical body.
The crimson hue from their blade cast an ominous glow within the dark smoke; even the most courageous were startled by the scene.
With a swift readjustment, the figure let out a petrifying screech and a malicious grin hidden behind its blade as it sundered through the air.
The silhouette on the temple floor mirrored a dreadful vision.
Master Rostoni, unable to defend himself in time, was dropped to his knees; his struggle was futile.
Kraios' eyes widened in horror as his mentor, an honorable man who devoted his life to the assistance of others, struggled for air as he choked on his blood.
The figure opened its mouth, "My chains are broken.
What a delightful view, I'm quite envious." The figure laughed maniacally as he swung his blade across his body, and Master Rostoni's head rolled across the hall, giving a final glimpse of his struggle to live be silenced.
A man who offered everything throughout his life received nothing but frightful stares and a sense of vain in his final moments.
This display left the spectating Jedi without action; grips loosened as their lightsabers vibrated within their hands.
There was no mistake; this was the impenetrable Dark Lord of the Sith.

His affixed glowing stare at Rostoni's body as if it were prey amid the hum of his blade left Kraios riddled with despair.
Slowly, the Dark Lord's gaze turns away from the corpse and towards him with an insatiable lust for blood.
His swiftness intact, he lunged himself toward Kraios as he revealed his amber blade, meeting the Dark Lord at a standstill, lost in the glowing inferno of his pupils.
At that moment, his army revealed itself.
An inconceivable number of Sith warriors sprinted to the Dark Lord's aid; the Jedi Knights regained composure, ignited their blades in unison, let out a battle cry, and ran towards the Sith Warriors to defend their Temple.
In a battle of will, the Sith charged toward the Jedi with hatred and bruteness, while the Jedi positioned themselves with grace as they coordinated their defense, a display of their opposing perceptions of the Force.
In a seemingly endless battle, both sides demonstrated their talents in lightsaber combat, refining them through countless years of practice.
While going toe to toe with the fierceness of the warriors, the Jedi had to dodge incoming blaster fire from the Sith Empire's troopers; a whirlwind of force energy filled the room, and conflicting ideologies battled to determine which would be victorious.
As Kraios held his own against the infamous Dark Lord, he concentrated his Force to release a shockwave to disrupt his balance; the seasoned Lord demonstrated his experience by evading the attack and countering it with one of his own.
A damning burst of lightning emerged from his black fingertips, and promptly, a deafening crash that startled even some of the Sith nearby.
Kraios witnessed the blue streak of light dart frighteningly near; he extinguished his blade and concentrated on defense.
By meeting both hands and cupping the bolt of lightning, he could deflect the lightning at a Darth he saw from the corner of his eye.
"Most impressive." said the Dark Lord with an intrigued stare in his eye, "Spare me the flattery, bastard," Kraios responded as he clenched his teeth.
Once more, they ignited their blades, swift movements that only the most versatile could dance in.
The Dark Lord perfected numerous combat forms, alternating during the duel, and Kraios was relegated to do the same.
Countless Jedi were overwhelmed; not only were there Knights, but Padawans, Younglings, and the sickening Sith chased down even the defenseless.
The Jedi were at a breaking point; they required support, assuming the Republic would soon aid them.
Misplaced wishfulness if only they knew the gravity of their situation.
The Great Hall was previously brought to life with energetic chatter and has been filled with dead men.
The most damning moment for many, though it seemed that the Dark Lord was savoring every moment of the devastation he had unleashed.
"I revel in their agony; it sustains me." cheerfully said the Dark Lord.
Kraios retained a disgusted expression as sweat began to form on his brow; after immense acrobatics, he began to feel weary, though his heart was committed to vengeance, "What is this feeling?" thought Kraios.
Countless screams were lost in Kraios' determination to deliver a similar fate to the abomination that murdered his Master.
However, there was one, an unmistakable voice that he would not dare ignore.
A shiver ran down his spine; they had been separated amid the conflict; in a sudden moment, the epitome of perdition became secondary, the hum as their lightsabers clashed shallowed.
Kraios' mind attempted to convince itself that he didn't hear what he thought; he became dizzy, trying to console himself and envision false realities where this day never occurred.
All other sounds were muffled; Kraios silently waited to hear it again, hoping it was just his imagination, waiting as his eyes began to lose focus, "GET AWAY, SOMEBODY!" Kraios reignites himself; his greatest fear has been realized: the Dark Lord softly laughs in his face.
Kraios attempts to redirect himself and rushes toward his Padawan's aid, but the Dark Lord was quicker.
Kraios sensed his ominous presence stirring behind and blocked his attack, "Do you know that poor girl?" the Dark Lord said with deceitful sympathy.
Kraios let out an expression of fury, precisely what he was hoping for, "With such a look, how could I ever let you go?" Kraios knew what he was referring to immediately and looked away.
He scanned for Aiva across the hall, and there she was.
Aiva's fighting style consisted of dual-wielded lightsabers; she was not the most capable of duelists, but for that reason, today, she intended to train with her Master.
Kraios attempted to break away from the Dark Lord as Aiva clashed with a towering brute; he wielded a lightclub, also known as a greatsaber, a lightsaber designed for larger species with a more intimidating appearance.
The Brute was far from elegant, but his attacks infused with raw strength pushed Aiva back.
As she struggled to keep her footing, she lost one of her lightsabers; she was visibly overwhelmed, and her screams for help were for naught; a few nearby Jedi who initially attempted to aid her were swiftly diced.
Lacking no remorse for her age or noticeable inexperience, the Brute continued with an unyielding onslaught of overhead attacks to force Aiva onto her back, tears in her eyes as she yelled Kraios' name.
The Dark Lord entrapped Kraios with a combination of the Force and his blade, "I'm grateful for your company as we watch her demise." Kraios ignored him and called out to nearby Jedi to help her; he was disregarded, "What are they doing?
Do they not have any sympathy for the feeble youth?!" Kraios angrily thought to himself.
Out of desperation, Kraios turned back to his foe, his arm locked; he collected all of his strength and kicked the Dark Lord's leg inward, dislocating his kneecap, slid his lightsaber down his arm, and with one swift movement, cleaves the side of his body cutting off the Dark Lord's arm wielding his lightsaber.
He uttered a daunting cry; the Sith nearby came to his aid; Kraios rushed towards his Padawan while being pursued by infuriated warriors, effortlessly clearing a path towards her.
Intimidating the Jedi and Sith parties, Kraios made his way to the Brute with his back turned, his grey eyes glowing with wrath.
Kraios was prepared to attack the Sith from behind, an unspoken taboo for some Jedi.
Suddenly, the Brute picked up Aiva from behind her neck, lifting her several feet off the ground, and turned her around to face Kraios directly.
He froze for a moment; her glance was faint, half-opened, and she looked apologetic when at arm's reach from her Master.
Kraios extinguished his blade as he made his way to her, chattering his teeth, and let out a smile to conceal it.
The Brute peeked over Aiva's shoulder and gave Kraios a smile of his own; with a sudden lunge, his crimson greatsaber pierced through her heart from behind; a red glow lit on Kraios' face as he watched horrified as Aiva's eyes widened in agony, tears streaming down her cheek.
Kraios' forced smile slowly rests.
His jaw began to tremble out of disbelief and shock; Aiva's cry had been silenced but continued to ring in his ear.
The Sith viciously withdrew his blade, and yet the color crimson remained; Kraios had yet to react; in the midst of the chaos, the Dark Lord was satisfied.
Kraios could feel Aiva's life force depleting, a tear for every second that remained, and as he struggled to formulate a word, his legs began to shake as his welcoming arms had not yet been dropped.
The future where they could laugh together in the face of her sculpture was lost; his Temple and his family were lost.
Does his mind remain intact?
The Brute tossed Aiva's lifeless body aside and glanced over Kraios' reaction, licking his lips as if it satiated him.
Kraios' hands trembled, yet he grabbed his lightsaber, a heavy weight on his shoulders and incinerating rage in his gaze.
The Brute launched another overhead attack over his head; Kraios dropped his head, and the Brute perceived this as a declaration of submission, "How distasteful!" the Brute yelled as the blade neared Kraios' head.
He looked up and reached out his arm, grabbing the blade itself, absorbing the energy and channeling it through the Force, then dismissing it entirely, negating the electrical power of the blade.
The brute tried to pull away in fear but was unable due to Kraios' grip; spinning his hilt, Kraios ignited his blade and decapitated the ferocious Brute, his cry concealed by Kraios' haunting scream of outrage.
Using this anger, he turned to lock eyes with the Dark Lord, the first instance where he discerned fear himself.
Kraios sprinted towards the Dark Lord and unleashed the most potent lightning burst he could with merely one of his arms at his disposal.
Kraios blocked the attack with his lightsaber, pushing onward as he neared the Dark Lord.
Kraios was approaching his limit, and his bull rush came to a halt; holding on to his blade as the lightning pierced through the blade and his body, he was launched across the hall, smashing through a pillar, covered in rubble where he lay unconscious.
Though his eyes were unable to open, he could hear everything.
Hours of torment he had passed where he overheard explosions and the crumbling of the Temple's walls, followed by silence.
"What was more startling, the sounds of reassuring agony or the silence?" thought Kraios.
More time passed, and Kraios opened his eyes, expecting to be embraced by the ancient architecture of the Temple; he was shocked to see the moon through an immense hole in the ceiling.
Rainfall drops added to his tears, and though emotions were verboten, he could not stop the streams coming down from his cheeks as he covered his face with his hand.
Kraios rose from the rubble, embraced by the once impressionable Temple hall that has now been reduced to ruins.
Silence filled the former Great Hall, though Kraios did hear faint explosions in the distance.
As malicious as the sounds coming from outside the Temple were, Kraios knew it was evident that it would collapse at any moment and must go off-world.
Gradually regaining his composure, his sore back was the last thing on Kraios' mind.
Flashbacks began rushing to him; seemingly, a legend appeared before him and took everything away.
"What could we have done differently?
How were we so ill-prepared?" faintly said Kraios as he caught his breath.
Kraios always thought poorly of the Jedi Order to a certain degree, but what he had witnessed only reinforced those feelings.
"They made a burial site out of my home," Kraios said as he attempted to hold back a psychotic laugh to a fault.
Eventually, he neared the main gate of the Temple, the epicenter of this massacre.
Kraios heard a scream for help, initially believing it was just another memory; his name was called out near the entrance.
"Kraios, is that you?!
Thank the stars!
Please come quick!" said the unknown figure.
Kraios had already walked past numerous corpses but did not falter; he knew his objective.
Upon nearing the origin of the screams, a cold sensation rushed down his spine for the second time today as the horrors he had just endured fully settled in.
He remembers the expressions on his Padawan, Aiva's face, her screams as she pleaded for help, and how other Jedi were either too incapable or blatantly disregarded her pain at the face of what was in front of them.
Resentment had simmered in, and as he neared the screams, he uncovered the source: an Elder who had been trapped under immense rubble following the initial explosion.
"Kraios, what a reassuring sight!
Please help me; my legs have been crushed, but together, I'm sure we can lift this rubble!" pleaded the Elder.
Kraios looked blankly at him as he struggled to push off the rubble, almost with a look of disdain.
The disturbed Elder asked Kraios, "What are you standing around for?
Please help me!" Kraios wasn't necessarily indifferent toward his anguish; rather, he enjoyed entertaining the idea of having the Elder suffer to compensate for their inability to save Aiva.
Kraios felt a sensation he had not experienced before.
The teachings he received from his Master and taught to his Padawan were the same, though that was in the past.
Dancing with the fires of damnation did not frighten him in the slightest, for he knew what he must do.
Kraios walked away from the Elder with a sense of self-satisfaction and a smirk as the Elder's scream for help faded.
The grand entrance to the Temple was once slathered in gold and overlooked by sculptures of the Founders that were said to deter hostilities.
"As Jedi, we sanctified these people, depicted by the sculptures, but now they lay beneath my foot, with their heads facing the earth, covered in ash and misplaced glory." Kraios thought to himself.
As he exited, Kraios glanced at the sky; the days where he looked to the stars for direction have long passed.
Chaos was widespread; the attack on the Temple was merely the beginning.
The sky had been claimed by an overcast of smoke and fighter ships trading blaster fire.
Kraios walked on the roads leading outside the Temple and came across a particular corpse of a Sith; as Kraios cautiously examined the body, he came across an acolyte mask that caught his attention.
The mask this fallen Sith had worn was the final sight for many of Kraios' fellow Jedi, "The craftsmanship on this is second to none," Kraios convinced himself.
Nevertheless, appreciation for the arts was never something Kraios inhibited; his motives lay elsewhere.
As Kraios took the mask of the body's face, he reached for his lightsaber when he revealed that the Sith's gold and red eyes were opened, although he had already passed.
There was only one dead man in that area, though Kraios' lifeless silver eyes would tell a different story.
As the mask covered his face, his expressions were no longer visible.
He raised his head, looked to the sky along with the dead man beside him, took a deep breath, and began to walk away from the temple, later turning into a sprint as he screamed out of the top of his lungs.
A pathway that overlooked much of the Galactic City, complimented by what appeared to be cherry blossom pedals, was merely engulfing embers.
The aftermath of the Galactic City occurred in Kraios' side view; though he did not turn, his resolve was intact, and he looked ahead.
Kraios was given a purpose in this wretched galaxy, whether through the means he had hoped for or not.
Those involved with today's events would meet a similar fate, or so Kraios thought.
As Kraios continued to release all of his anger, screaming as one of the moons shined upon him with tears in his eyes, it was undistinguishable; the mask had served its intended purpose.
Kraios fled to the ventilation shaft on Coruscant to escape the carnage inflicted on the Galactic City.
Said ventilation shaft not only collected the Galactic City's sewage and network much of the planet's shipping, but it granted access to the Underworld, known colloquially as the Underworld Portal.
Kraios went through countless alleyways to prevent being spotted to reach the turbo-lift safely, one of the only manners of descending to the Underworld without a starship.
Quite the crowd was surrounding the turbo-lift, designed to transport merely five to six people at a time, give or take.
Kraios put on his hood and avoided eye contact to avoid having his mask recognized.
Kraios did not have the time to wait for the other passengers, and as he pushed his way to the front of the hostile crowd, he overheard a few conversations that the Sith Empire would make their way here soon, though challenging to make out due to the ensuing chaos.
Kraios considered something horrifying, "Use your blade to clear a path; these rodents are in your way; mow down these insignificant citizens and reach the Underworld," Kraios' mind told him.
And as Kraios reached for his lightsaber on his hip, he heard the sound of the turbo-lift arriving and let go of his lightsaber.
He was forcibly pushing through civilians and darted onward; the turbo-lift was filling up hastily, one by one; Kraios could see his chances of going off-world diminish before his very eyes.
The turbo-lift doors began to close, and with a swift swipe of his finger, the doors remained open; he grabbed a woman carrying a child by the shoulder and dragged her out of the lift to make room for himself.
And so, the door closed with the woman banging on the glass with fear in her eyes as they descended.
Though it was certainly cramped, the other passengers somehow made room to keep their distance from Kraios.
Several minutes of odd silence had passed, and some of the families felt relieved to have escaped alive; a younger Kraios would have given the civilians in the turbo-lift aid and consolation, giving him a sense of fulfillment, but all he could feel at that moment was indifferent towards them.
Kraios grew impatient, and in his defense, so did all the others.
And at long last, they reached the depths of the Underworld.
Kraios was the first one out.
Though he was accustomed to the finer things in life living in the Temple, he felt serene; oddly enough, the underworld, outside of the Outer Rim, was where crime was most rampant.
Kraios continuously saw the face of a malevolent grin in his visions but shrugged them off.
He was adamant about seeing out his promise.
The Underworld consisted of narrow, dimly lit alleyways leading to impoverished buildings, creating an unnerving environment.
Despite the prevalent litter on the streets and the high crime rates, the Underworld is in a better state than the Galactic City, virtually untouched by the Sith.
The underworld consisted of outlaws and the impoverished.
Kraios never put much thought into it, but the Republic viewed them as having the same social status.
The Republic demonstrated more interest in the outlaws by allocating time and resources to capture them.
A scene that would leave many sick, emaciated children turning to crime for survival people on the streets as if they were disposable garbage.
Quite the surprise.
Who would have thought Kraios would have such a leisurely walk at a time like this?
As Kraios walked past neon-lit buildings, he glimpsed over monitors elaborating on the situation in the Galactic City.
The Order has fallen, the Republic has fallen, and the remnants are being persecuted.
You would assume the locals reacted worriedly, but as the news that the Supreme Chancellor was murdered broke out, the crowd of listeners opened in celebration.
The scum had a complete lack of regard for the Republic and their lives, but who could blame them.
Walking, counting every step on these grimy walkways, a sudden brightness caught Kraios' attention; it was liberation, a docking bay.
Though not visible, his smile quickly faded as he noticed the ray shield preventing entrance, "Seems I'm at a loss for options," said Kraios as he reached for his lightsaber.
With an amber glow radiating from the emitter and an abrupt shove, Kraios jabbed his blade into the wall beside the ray shield, carving an entrance of his own.
Pushing the wall inward, he stepped through the opening he created, his boot clanking on the metal floors as he entered.
He sensed he was not alone, then heard the draw of a blaster.
Kraios directed his lightsaber at this figure.
"That's an odd hue for a Sith." said the Mandalorian Crusader.
Kraios grinned under his mask and replied, "Odd?
I'm certain it can cut through you all the same.
And one more thing, I'm no Sith." He darted towards the stunned Mandalorian, "Wait!" as she lowered her weapon, "You must be a Jedi then?
I came for your help!" With his eyes of judgment, he stared down the Mandalorian, debating whether he was curious enough to hear what she had to say.
"The Sith Empire is too powerful for me to deal with alone.
I'm willing to help the Republic in peace." She piqued his interest to think that was all she needed to say.
"Well, considering what is going on in the Galactic City, the conditions here in the underworld don't tell half the story.
The Republic and the Order have fallen to the Sith,"  Kraios said distastefully.
"Dammit, I don't suppose you have any capable allies around?" said the Mandalorian.
Kraios stood in silence.
"Right, well, I guess it's just the two of us.
I'm Astrid Vizla." "Kraios." "Best to move swiftly; the Empire likely has a blockade surrounding the planet; best to move swiftly-" Astrid said before Kraios interjected, "You never told me what your dealings are with the Sith Empire.
Why did you want help from the Republic?" "Cautious because I'm a Mandalorian, are we?
You must really be a Jedi, after all."
Astrid said jokingly.
Kraios, noticeably irritated, repeated himself in a more hostile tone.
"Easy, easy, whether you believe me or not, you can decide that for yourself, but don't think that we- Don't think that I side with-" Astrid paused before finishing her sentence, "Them.
You are likely familiar with our Mand'alore, Kreed Mand'alore, that is.
His combative prowess is unquestionable; regardless, I uncovered something dreadful.
Our ruler is but a mere puppet of the Sith Emperor.
My people have endured the horrors under the word of a false sovereign.
It is unforgivable." Astrid was shaken but recollected her calm and led Kraios into her starship.
Kraios appreciated her passion; he had decided to go along with her rather than merely slay her and take the ship.
"Let's hope you're quite the pilot to evade the potential blockade you spoke of," Kraios said as he crossed his arms.
"I'm that, and then some, just enjoy the ride," Astrid said as the cockpit hatch was lowered.
The dimly lit deck was illuminated by the engine start, and the sound of bustling mechanics bounced off the walls.
The control panel danced in various glowing colors and flashes, and with a sudden movement, the starship began its ascent out of the underworld portal.
The engines roared; Astrid was naturally worried about what they might encounter but was also affixed to her goal.
And so, she hit the thrusters and was met with the skirmishes in the Galactic City's skies.
Countless buildings toppled, the aftermath the Sith caused can not be overstated; the once glorious capital of the Republic has been reduced to debris.
The remnants of the skylines smoldered by fire, creating an eerie aura that illuminated the city as the dark overcast above the city blocked out the sunlight.
This was the galaxy's center; as you glanced outside your window, all that could be seen wee the rising sun, elegant skyscrapers, and speed cruiser traffic across the sky.
That is in the past; this is the reality for the Coruscanti now.
"Engrave this into your memory, Astrid; in the face of this havoc, I'll give them a similar scenery.
Kraios growled.
The system's radar picked up on a ship trailing them, and sure enough, the laser blasts followed once they didn't identify themselves.
Astrid expertly evaded the attacks, though by the narrowest margins, Kraios can rest assured that he found a capable pilot.
Before the Frigates could catch notice of their escape, Astrid began the hyperdrive sequence, laughing in jow while doing so.
The cockpit was bathed in the blue shine due to the hyperspace tunnel.
"I must give you credit where it's due; that was smooth." Kraios calmly said as he began to sit back in his seat.
"Compliments like that are just another incentive to make it out alive," Astrid said with her hands gently resting on the control panel as she gazed at the endless cosmos.
Astrid whispered to herself, "In the vacuum of space, out here, there are no screams, no violence.
It's beautiful." Kraios looked upon her in deep thought, then towards the stars; though concealed by his mask, Astrid knew that he was smiling under there, even if she let out a relaxed sigh for the first time all day.
Kraios reached out his hand, the stars merely out of arm's reach, entranced by the void of space, "I have stared into the abyss.
The Force's so-called mercy shall act as a catalyst." Kraios thought to himself as he clenched his fist.
"Astrid," she turned toward him, "Where did you say we were going?" Kraios asked curiously, "To meet some friends at the Glorious Jewel.
I'm sure we can get the information we need." "Why haven't I heard of this place?" asked Kraios.
"Must be because it is out of the Republic's reach," suggested Astrid.
"Hold on!
We'll be jumping out of hyperspace...now!" As the starship exited hyperspace, a burst of light illuminated the cockpit and was shortly followed by a thunderous vibration that shook the entire vessel.
The view no longer consisted of a rotating blue tunnel, but the stars were visible again in all their glory.
