=============================DECRYPTING…=============================
=========================BEGIN TRANSMISSION=========================
For the eyes of Master ????
????,

Do you remember the first two words you said to me?
In your beautiful Twi’lek language, you said Chini, wachamio!
Those two words were the start of it all.
The words that led to me falling in love with you.

In short, the sin I confess to is withholding details and purposefully lying to you about a specific aspect of our dynamic - namely, the whole range of motions I have for you.
It's unfair to you that I've been open about so many other unpleasant things but not this one issue.
You gave me no cause to doubt my ability to communicate these details, but I still did not force myself to be entirely honest.
Yet I don't have an excuse.
I was well aware that complete transparency would alter our relationship, and in my selfishness I did not want to cope with the possibility that you might leave me.
I intended to continue the charade, but I just can't.

I remember when, on one of the last days of official classes, we were sitting in the Awareness Course classroom, and you turned to me and said, "Master Vega has such beautiful hair!".
My impulse reaction was to reply, "So do you," and I was actively trying to not let that slip out.
That was the first of many omissions.

In one of our many conversations, you asserted, "I don't think there are many people who would like me." This is clearly meant as self-depreciation.
Still,  I felt an impulse to interject here, but I didn't.
It either would have come off as phony and said to be consoling, or it would have come off as genuine; and the latter would have been risky because I couldn't gauge how you would have reacted.

"I seriously cannot imagine myself loving someone.
The basis for that feeling doesn't seem to exist in me.
So my future is decidedly uncertain.
I've given up on love before even trying it, and I don't want to keep dwelling on it." I find myself using this statement as a crutch to convince myself that I am doing you some favor by not revealing what I truly feel, but it's high time I face the music that, until now, I have been finding excuses to not speak up.

So where does this leave me?
In an ideal world, I would directly tell you that I love you.
But I can't do that; I can't even say I like you.
Why?
To some extent, I don’t believe it’s because such relationships are prohibited in the Order - at least, relationships like the one I’m looking for.
Frankly, I believe it’s the fact that I don't know enough about my own emotions.
What's friendship?
When does it become love?
How do I know that a strong sentiment today will be strong tomorrow?
I’m unable to even enquire about my emotions to anyone; I’d just be treated like an outcast.
Such is the glory of the Jedi Order.

On top of that, my track record scares me, and I don't mean my academics.
Five out of the six times I failed the Expansion Course, I quickly overcame it.
Did I not honestly care?
Did it not work?
The one time that I’ve ever felt this way - also the one with the highest likelihood of being genuine - now feels like a fever dream, and I can't compare what I feel for you now to what I felt back then.

Despite all the doubt, there are fundamental truths I have clarity on.
The vulnerability and manner in which I talk to you are reserved only for you.
I intend to keep talking to you till you don't want to talk to me.
Comments like "Just the guy I was waiting for!" will make me nervous if I don't have the context, and words like "I wanted to compliment you in front of everyone," will make me stupidly happy.
When I say I don't mind talking about your feelings or future specialization opportunities, I mean it; it feels good to be helping you.
Despite the general helpful attitude I want to have, I'm not interested in being this beneficial to anyone else in the slightest.

This is a lot to take in and certainly changes our dynamic.
We may never speak this frankly about anything or even talk with each other again, but I will not worry about that now.
This is my one shot, and I am going to capture it.

??????, I know you will do great things in this Order.
You set the standard when it comes to personal motivation and work ethic.
Whatever you must face, you will tackle it head-on.
I hope that the passage of time makes you feel more confident in striving for those things you don't necessarily need to, but it will make you all the happier if you do so.
You can do so much and so amazingly well in a position like an Investigator.
You have a great shot at it too.
If you focus on showing people the real you, everyone will be drawn in.
More than anything else, I hope you find joy in the little things that will come up in your life and in that final masterpiece I know you will create.
For whatever it is worth, I believe in you, ??????.

“.???" - Now that they were finally alone in the classroom, she called his name
He turned around.
His brown hair was still the same spiky mess it had always been.
But now, it was almost… angelic to her.
She closed the transmitter with shaky hands.
She was unsure how to begin, but took a shot at it anyway.
“With my terrible performance at the Combat Course class today, I thought today was destined to be a terrible one.
Your letter, though, single handedly made it a good day.”
His smile was unlike anything she’d ever seen - the embodiment of joy.
“I’m glad.
It was meant for the day we graduated from the Corps, but I couldn’t have kept it with me until then.”
He looked at her, eyes sparkling with the light of the setting sun.
“Thank you for reading it.
Really.”
All she could do was give him a slight, uncertain nod, although she wanted to express so much more.
“Are you kidding?
You know I’m not one to smile for trivial things.
But when I was reading this, I found myself grinning like an idiot.” She tried to demonstrate, but ended up smirking and quickly glancing away.

“So thoughtful.
So thorough.
So… ???.”
It was his turn to look away, abashed.
“I wish I had been more “???” sooner.
But better late than never, I suppose.”
She stepped closer, her eyes unwavering this time.
The smell of lavender peeked out from behind her robes, and yet it was as if that smell had filled up the entire room.
She was still as beautiful as ever.
So why can’t I have her?
Why are the Jedi so… cruel?
“I just want to say…” He looked up at her, stunned.
For the first time since they met, she was doubting herself.
“...I understand if you’re confused about your feelings for me, especially since we’re Jedi and all - we’re not meant to have these sorts of emotions cloud our judgment.
But…”
“I just hope we can keep our thought-provoking conversations alive, like they’ve always been every single day of our lives.
Even when you leave to become a Sage, and I eventually leave to become an Investigator.
And I just know that once you’re there, you’ll look back and think that it was okay to let people like me exit your life.”
His voice, now taking on a crestfallen tone, pierced the room like the sound of a lightsaber being ignited.
“Is this an… easy way of letting me down?”
She shook her head, her hair fluttering from side to side, the purple highlights clashing with her obscure-coloured eyelashes.
“I’m saying all of this genuinely.
Wherever you go, you’ll be alright.
What will happen, will happen - we’ll be in two completely different realms of the Order, so it doesn’t matter how I feel right now because we don’t have much time even if we tried to make this work.”
“So I don’t want you to dwell on this.
I want you to be happy with someone you actually do have time with, wherever you go.”
She sat down for the first time since she entered the room, facing him.
Her wistful eyes starkly contrasted with his melancholic ones.
“I care about you, ???.
I really do.
You’re the one person in this Academy who I think is a real, honest-to-the-Force friend.
The only one I don’t want to let go of.”
“But… I don’t think the feelings I have for you are the same as yours.
At least, not yet.”
His tone more confident, his eyes more melancholic than ever, he replied, “Fair enough.
Thank you for telling me that at least.”

The conversation lilted awkwardly, either one not knowing how to continue.
“Can I… ask you something?”, she offered.
“Is the way you feel about me now the same way you felt about… ?????”
His head jerked up, his posture screaming ‘startled’.
He answered, cautiously at first, “If I’m being honest… no.
I think I liked the drama of the whole process more than her as a whole.
It was endearing - a forbidden relationship with someone who was more than willing to take things to the next level if I let her.
But the entire time, I was always searching for signs of my love for her.”
“With you… I’m just in the moment.
I take things for what they are when I’m with you.”
“All I want is a peaceful relationship with someone I truly love.
I don’t want anyone - not the Masters, not our classmates, not even if the High Council themselves intervened - to weigh in and tell me what to do regarding this relationship.”
“I understand it looks bad from the outside, but trust me when I say I didn’t mean to hurt her-”
“Don’t say that.” She interrupted his flow like a falling leaf causing ripples over a river.
“You did what you had to do when you ended the relationship.
You don’t need to explain yourself to me once more.”
He looked at her with only gratitude in his pupils, and continued.
“At some point with her, I realized it was a circle peg-square hole situation; the kind of situation where there’s been a horrible mismatch.
But I was too stubborn to give up on her.”
“I don’t want to speak for you, but in general I think people would agree that we’re much more similar than her and I.”
She bestowed upon him a nod to silence all doubts of his feelings for her.
“Yes, actually.
It’s a bit… cartoonishly ironic how things have turned out to be exactly the opposite of what they first seemed to be.”
“I used to regret that,” he interjected.
“But I’m thankful for it now.
No other timeline would bring us to where we are right now, right here.
And if my character ever comes into question by the Council, that’s a price I’d pay every time - even if I relived that experience a hundred times over.”

She gasped, completely taken aback.
For the first time in her life, she had no words left to say.
So she let him do all the talking for once.
“????, I’ve said many things to you before and I believe I’ll have many more things to say once I can phrase my emotions properly.
But I think the statement I’m about to give conveys the majority of my feelings in the best manner.”
“Your presence in my life is more important to me than the type of relationship we have.”
Tears welled up in her eyes, causing her line of view to be tinged with salt and water.
She felt the breeze of the Dantooine plains enrapture her skin, and wished it could take both of them far, far away - somewhere they didn’t have to hide.
Somewhere they didn’t have to run.
Somewhere they could be free.
Then she realized he was still speaking, so she pulled her gaze away from the leaves of the Blba trees and focused it back on him.
“I really wish I could say ‘I like you’ with absolute certainty.
But you mean too much to me to make you go through that.”
Her heart throbbed with sadness.
She looked away yet again, her stormy eyes not daring to meet his emerald ones, shining with honesty.
“What are you thinking now, ?????

Her entire body was burning up.
Her mouth was dry.
Her fingertips ached to brush the hair fallen on his forehead off of his eyes, so that she could see them more clearly.
But instead she said, “Nothing as such.
I just want to thank you again for the letter.
It… means a lot to me.”
He laughed, the melodic tones of his joy and fulfillment equalling the sound of the fabools outside.
“After all I’ve said, I don’t know how to describe how I feel at this moment in time.”
“Do you have any idea?
How you feel, I mean.”
For once, she wanted to be the transparent one in the relationship.
So she let herself be.
“To be completely honest, I’m in pain because I had to hurt someone I care about, simply due to the fact that I wanted to be honest with myself.
I’m in pain because you’re an amazing person, and I couldn’t give you what you deserved by not requiting your feelings.”
“I don’t want you to think of me any differently, or think I nurse any feeling of awkwardness or weirdness towards you.”
He smiled and said, “You’d have hurt me a lot more if you said yes when you didn’t mean it.”

Is this the same ???
I grew up with?
Not knowing how to respond to anything anymore, she offered, “I understand if you need time to yourself to figure out the… logistics of the situation.
I won’t take offense–”
“I don’t care about logistics,” he declared.
“I don’t want to make you uncomfortable by avoiding you just because the Code forbids it.
We’re still young, and we’re going to go on so many adventures.”
“You said you want me to be happy wherever I go.
Well, I want you to be happy - even if I’m exiled, or if you choose something else over me.
At the same time, I still want us to be at a level where we can remain transparent with each other.”
“I don’t ever want to make you feel uncomfortable by suddenly ghosting you.
Truth be told, I need to figure out how I should act going forward.
Whether I really do want to continue my life as a Jedi or not.
I don’t want to act like nothing happened and just go back to how things were pre-letter.
Whatever pain this may have caused both of us, I don’t want it to ever be forgotten.
In a sense, I feel this proves we can work through things - and that feeling is invaluable.”
“Let’s move outside,” she offered.
“To our sacred spot.”

The garden was quiet with the night.
The leaves of the Blba trees rustled, waiting in anticipation.
The Candlewick flowers were in full bloom, their scent covering his usual musk like a blanket.
Their footsteps were in unison, as they always were.
She felt a sense of finality in the air, as if he was making up his mind on something.
“You know, if the outcome would be me with the Sages and you with the Investigators no matter what, it could then be asked, ‘What was the point of any of this?”
“I can’t give you an objective answer.
Subjectively, though, I can say our friendship made a huge impact on me, and my experience in the Service Corps was certainly the better for it.
I’m truly grateful for that.”
He laughed again, this time without much mirth in it.
“Sorry for my random thoughts here.
I’m just blurting them out as they come.”
She shook her head, indicating that it was alright, It was now her turn to speak at random.

“You know what I most admired about the letter?” He glanced at her, curiosity in his gaze.
“When you said ‘This is my one shot, and I’m going to capture it.’ This was your shot.
This is the last time we meaningfully see each other face to face before the day we graduate.”
“I sincerely admire how you had the courage to confront your emotions.
To put your heart out there, even though you knew it might get bruised.
That takes real determination, you know.
Something that not even the strongest of Jedis have.”
She looked at him, and her smile lit up the night, the color of her hair blending in with the sky .
“I’m keeping this letter forever, you know.
No matter what happens after this.”
He smiled, breaking through the darkness of the night sky with the light of a thousand moons.
“I wouldn’t have it any other way.”

With determined steps, they made their way back to their quarters.
She was the first one to break the silence.
“So… where do we go from here?”
He thought for a second before responding, “I don’t know.
But we’ll figure it out, no matter what anyone in this temple says.
Just like we always have.”
And as they departed for the night, all she could think of was a quote from the Revised Jedi Code, written just 50 years ago - “Love is the Force’s finest dagger; because it has such perfect aim.”
