# Introduction
Desaust landed his stolen Liberator-class starfighter in the base-level hangar of Coruscant’s Jedi Temple under the guise of a Jedi Knight.
It would not be the first time he had passed as a “cultist” to infiltrate a facility, nor the last.
One thing he had learned from fighting both the Sith Empire and the Republic was that arrogance has and will continue to lie unseen, instilled deeply within the two.
He planned to exploit this – to walk into the heart of the Jedi Order and take what he wanted.
There was no better day than the present to accomplish this.
There wouldn’t be a Jedi Temple or anything of value within its halls by day’s end.

Before exiting the fighter, Desaust armed the proton bomb aboard the vessel.
It would serve as a diversion, rendering the hangar and the docked fighters inoperable.
In a way, he was assisting the Empire.
 Climbing from the cockpit, he drew his cloak overhead and walked out from the hangar.
The schematics of the Temple ran through his mind as he traversed the grand halls, turning down corridors as if he’d done so hundreds of times before.
He trod the halls quietly with his arms concealed in the sleeves of his cloak; to an observer, the action wasn’t unusual.
Unbeknownst to them, Desaust's fingers subtly tapped at the controls embedded in his Beskar vambrace.
First, he worked to conceal his presence in the Force.
A Jedi or Sith with practice and a strong connection with the Force could do this effortlessly, but Desaust was neither.
He wasn’t gifted like his brother - ‘blessed’ as his adoptive parents ingrained in him.
Much like the rest of his equipment, his latest addition to his armor mimicked a Force ability.

The hide of the Dxun Maalraas allowed the animal to conceal its presence in the Force, rendering it a mere shadow to the untrained eye and nearly impossible to sense.
 Due to Desaust’s lack of Force sensitivity, he had spent months attempting to get the hide to replicate its natural capabilities.
Following several failures, he discovered that Kyber would suffice as a Force-attuned stand-in.
In trial runs, the process was an identical replication of the Maalraas.
It was like a ghost headed for the Temple’s sublevels under the cloak.

# Section 1
Akeither grew tired of the nonsense his peers were spewing.

The High Council had been in session for several hours, arguing over the threat of the Sith Empire.
Most Councilors believed the Empire had weakened substantially since the Emperor died — fractured even.
But Akeither was one of three who refused to acknowledge the theory.
His gaze shifted toward Councilor Drexel, who fiercely pushed the notion.
She was a Senior Councilor who hadn’t seen the front lines in years; all her information had ridden in on reports; she treated them as fact.
Unfortunately, the majority agreed.
It bothered him that his peers could so easily believe that the Republic had the upper hand.
If anything, the Sith were more organized under the new Empress, turning the tide of war in her favor.
“Even the Chancellor believes the Sith threat will diminish by the end of the year.” Drexel smiled.
“We’ve already pushed the Sith out of three major worlds.”
“Reclaiming those worlds was too easy.” Councilor Sudo shook his head, “It was as if they wanted us to have them.” 
Councilor Greene shrugged.
“Perhaps they are becoming disorganized.
We all know how the Sith love to undermine one another.
A power shift is a perfect time to fulfill an agenda.” 
Akeither leaned forward in his seat, rubbing his temples in irritation.
“There’s something we’re missing.” 
“Which is?” Councilor Gest inclined his head, gesturing for the newest Councilor to continue.
Though, new wasn’t quite the word.
Akeither had been on the Council for three years but was the only recent appointment.
Gest wasn’t fond of nor trusted the man, but his efforts in the war made him favorable amongst the others.

Drawing a breath, Akeither sat up and spread his hands.
“The Empire is more unified than we realize.
They have an active leader now who participates in their  conquest.” It wasn’t something he could say about most of the people in the room.

Drexel waved her hand dismissively.
“We know nothing of this Empress.
For all we know, no one is leading them.” 
Murmurs of agreement filled the room.
Greene scowled at his fellow Councilors.
He had never known them to be so content with the possibility that victory drew near in his thirty years as a Councilor.
It didn’t make sense for that outcome to happen if you were involved.

“I believe we’re overlooking something as well.” Councilor Idris said when the room quieted.

Gest scoffed.
“You as well?” 
Idris ignored him.
“Our enemy, when we haven’t been reclaiming our worlds, has been attacking military installations that are off record.
Only select individuals know about them or had when we ran the Taskforce program.” 
“Information is bought often, Idris.
We have an abundance of traitors,” Drexel said.
“Same as the Imperials.” 
Idris conceded but held her hand up, “This is different.
They’re picking apart our tactics more efficiently.
Doesn’t this tell you something?” 
“They have a strategist on their side,” Akeither added, folding his arms.
“A former member of the Order or .
.
.
another rogue Republic leader.”
 Gest inclined his head.
“Do you have any proof?
The reports weave a different story.”
“I serve on the frontlines, not lounge in the confines of the Temple.
You have no idea what you’ll condemn the Republic to if we refuse to act.” Akeither retorted.


For the first time since the meeting began, Grandmaster Luen spoke.

“That’s enough.” He snapped, “Chancellor Bhest and I have spoken extensively about the war recently.
We’ve come to share the same thoughts most of you have.” He said softly.
“The Republic will concentrate its efforts on forcing the Sith to surrender, peacefully if possible.” 
Councilor Sudo’s mouth hung open in disbelief.
“You can’t possibly—” 
“I do, and I believe this meeting is over.
We’ll reconvene tomorrow to discuss demilitarizing the Order,” Luen stated with an air of finality behind his words.


Each Councilor respectfully nodded and rose from their seats.
There would be no further debates on the matter.
Akeither knew it to be a mistake.
One that would cost the Republic everything if it didn’t wake up from its ignorance.
He took the turbolift down to the first level of the Temple.
Something began to bother him, a tugging feeling in the back of his mind.
He frowned.
Something was wrong.



# Section 2
Desaust approached the Temple Guardsmen posted outside the vault.
He knew he would never get in without a fight and was glad for it.
After years of cutting down lightsaber-wielding freaks, he’d face something new.

	The Senior Guardsman held his hand out as the ‘Jedi’ stepped closer, “HALT!” He ordered.
Only Councilors had authorization to be in this sector of the sublevels.
They were wise enough not to conceal their identities.
But, he and the rest of the Guard would’ve sensed someone long before they arrived.
He hesitated; he couldn’t feel this ‘Jedi’ in the Force.
He called his double-bladed lightsaber to his hand.
The yellow blades illuminated the hallway as the Senior Guardsmen thrust the point of his saber forward into the trespasser.

	A grin formed across Desaust’s lips as he swayed casually out of reach, seizing the blade with his cortosis-gloved left hand.
The lightsaber erupted in sparks and shorted out.
Desaust’s right hand grasped his own lightsaber, plunging it into the Guard’s chest.
The hilt fell from the Guard’s grasp as he collapsed.
	The remaining Guardsmen leaped forward and swung at the trespasser with a flurry of attacks.
Bringing his arm up, Desaust let the third swing connect, the blade riding off his armor as he spun his hilt into a reverse grip, cleaving the Guard in two before they could react.

Bending down, he relieved the corpse of its belt, cycling through the keys to find the vault’s match.
In hindsight, the Jedi should have thought of this situation.
Killing just one of their Guards gave an intruder free rein over the Temple.
Maybe he would share that information so more people would stand against the Jedi.
Once he had found the correct key, the door began to open inwardly.
He craned his head.
Peering inside before the door entirely cleared, he raised his eyebrows in surprise.
There was more hidden away than Desaust realized.

The room was at least twenty meters deep with a vaulted ceiling.
Various artifacts from across the galaxy littered the walls.
If Desaust had more time, he’d take more.
Learn from what he could to better equip himself for the future.
He glanced up at a security camera as he scanned the walls.
By now, more Guards would be on their way.
He continued his search — looking for the weapon that would level the playing field he was but a pawn on.
Then, he saw it.

	Toward the back of the vault, a modified rifle rested on an otherwise barren table.
Desaust took it, inspecting the weapon closely.
It appeared to be in working condition, free of any apparent damage or sabotage.
It did appear unfinished, with plenty of room for modification.
He withdrew one of four sabers he carried with him, sliding it into the gap behind the barrel, clicking as it locked into place.
Feeling he’d worn out his welcome, he departed from the vault.

	Temple Security intercepted Desaust when he was halfway out of the sublevel.
They were secret police entrusted with monitoring the Temple Precinct.
Although disappointed that Jedi hadn’t come to stop him, it was better that way.
He didn’t have enough munitions to deal with them.

The Sergeant before him regarded Desaust as nothing more than an overzealous bounty hunter who’d bit off more than he could chew — who got lucky with the Guards.
There was no need, in his mind, to bother with getting a Jedi to come down here to help with an arrest.
Besides, the intruder was outnumbered five to one.
Any sane man would surrender.

“Surrender; we have you outnumbered,” the Sergeant warned, his men raising their weapons.
Squeezing the trigger, Desaust smirked malevolently; “You’ve miscounted.”



# Section 3
The ground trembled beneath Akeither’s boots, stopping him dead in his tracks.
Fear’s icy grip clamped over his heart.
The first floor became deafeningly silent as the Jedi around him felt what he felt.
Whatever happened had killed several people.

	He began to walk toward a stairwell that would take him to the next level but hesitated.
His mind was screaming at him to “GET OUT OF THE WAY!” — couldn’t the Force be more directional?
Akeither thought.
He threw himself to the side as the floor disintegrated beneath him.
The Jedi who were immediately around him weren’t so fortunate.
He crawled back from the gaping hole in the ground, momentarily panicked - questions racing through his mind as he stood.

	His questions didn’t go unanswered for long.
The all-too-familiar whine of a jetpack angered him.
Emerging from the rubble with a rifle, he was face-to-face with his brother, Desaust.

	Without a word, Desaust made a fist and rapidly hovered away from Akeither, sending a mini-rocket from his gauntlet as a non-traditional greeting.
With an outstretched hand, the rocket froze midair and plummeted into the ruins below, where it exploded.
The distraction gave Desaust enough time to blast another hole in the Temple and the distance not to be swung at.
He exited hurriedly, catching the faint hiss of a lightsaber igniting behind him.

	Akeither was determined not to let Desaust get away again.
In their prior encounters, fate intervened.
Or he had to honor a truce; he wasn’t going to let the twisted will of the Force refuse him again.
Desaust would stand trial and answer for his crimes.

	The terrace was an expansive stretch of concrete that surrounded the perimeter of the Temple.
Desaust had to cross the sea of stone to reach his rendezvous point.
His ship would meet him relatively undetected, being his fastest ticket off Coruscant and the Republic’s radar.
He pressed down on his earpiece as he ran and instructed his daughter to bring the Rogue Tide to his location.
Fast.
Now, all he had to do was buy time.
Desaust leveled the rifle at his brother, finger looming over the trigger.
If Akeither were smart, he would back off and live to pursue him tomorrow.
No.
He knew Akeither’s sense of duty would go beyond family.
Desaust had caused enough damage and hurt too many in his actions.
It was him or his brother.
At this range, Akeither would have enough time to evade the blast.
Desaust fired, bracing for the powerful recoil of the rifle.

The beam tore across the terrace toward Akeither, raising his lightsaber to meet it.
Akeither believed the weapon was essentially a glorified lightsaber.
Therefore, redirection into the sky wouldn’t be so impossible.
If his logic held up, that is.
He braced for the impact, praying to the Force this would work.
If it didn’t, he’d end up like the others.
Dead.
Angling the blade at the last moment, the beam connected, jutting out into the sky - subsequently getting thrown backward from the sheer force of the weapon.

Akeither let out a pained groan but was pleased that he was still alive.
At least his plan worked.
He pushed himself to his feet, ignoring the protesting of his aching wrists and arms as he regained his grip on his lightsaber.
He and Desaust held each other's gaze for a few moments.
Then Akeither ran toward him.

Desaust ejected the spent lightsaber from the weapon, loading the next from his belt in a fluid motion.
Akeither had seconds before he fired again.
He extended his hand and concentrated on the rifle.
He knew he wouldn’t be able to rip the weapon away.
Desaust had come prepared against Force users, finding that magnetism prevented his weapons or himself from being hurtled.
However, it didn’t hinder his movement entirely.
The rifle jerked upward, but years of experience kept Desaust from firing prematurely.
Unable and unwilling to fire at close range, Akeither seized the opening and fought for control over the weapon.



# Section 4
Darth Eir, Empress of the Sith Empire and former Jedi Commander observed her forces as they filed onto transports aboard her Harrower-class destroyer, Valkyrie.
	It had been well over fifteen years since she had last set foot on Coruscant, carrying out complex missions for the Republic and its citizens.
Now, she planned to lay waste to the heart of the Republic to show the galaxy the consequences of arrogance.
For centuries, the Republic boasted that its capital was impenetrable.
An attack was out of the question.
During her time as a Jedi, she knew Coruscant wasn’t as protected as it seemed — how stories alone kept the Sith from burning the city down.

	She leaned forward and rested her hands on the rail of the viewing area above the hangar, running the battle plan over in her mind once more to rule out any weaknesses in the siege as the first wave of transports waited for the Valkyrie to exit hyperspace.
Eir, with her knowledge of the interior of the Jedi Temple, would lead her forces inside and provide a distraction for her Dark Council to bombard high-value targets scattered throughout the city.
They would arrive later in the battle, letting the Republic believe that her ship and Gage-class escorts would be naive enough to challenge the planetary defenses alone.
They would soon find themselves outflanked by the rest of her fleet.

	Below, the first wave of transports was ready for deployment, awaiting Hyperspace travel to end.
She stepped away from the rail and headed down to board her shuttle in the middle of the hangar.

The Dark Honor Guards inside snapped to attention as the bay door slid shut behind their Empress.
In recent history, the Imperial Guard was regarded as nothing more than living decor by the Empire’s enemies, forced to remain on Droumund Kaas as the previous Dark Lord of the Sith grew inactive in the war effort.
The opportunity for the six crimson guardsmen to remind the galaxy of their dominance on the battlefield was before them - each eager to carry out the will of their Empress or die in the process.


	The Valkyrie lurched as it came to a halt above Coruscant’s city.
Moments later, it began its bombardment as Interceptors and transports flooded out from its hangars - the Gage-class transports following suit with their Interceptor squadrons following close behind Darth Eir’s forces.


The Imperial forces had expected Coruscant’s Temple to be untouched, a perfect canvas for destruction.
The Temple was already up in smoke on the eastern side.
Darth Eir noted that the damage went through two mediation rooms near the front of the Temple - whatever had happened would have killed anyone using them.
However, it made for a secondary entry point to the inside.

	“Set us down by the smoke.” She told the pilot, beginning to turn away from the cockpit when a beam of energy cut through the air and slammed into the shields of the Banshee — one of her Gage-class escorts.
Darth Eir narrowed her eyes as she scanned the area the blast came from.



# Section 5
Akeither and Desaust stared up at the Imperial crafts that littered Coruscant's skies, forgetting their struggle for the Lightsaber Rifle for a few seconds.
Then, they locked eyes.
Desaust triggered the flamethrower built into his gauntlet — forcing his brother to release the rifle to protect himself.
From previous encounters, he knew Akeither had learned pyrokinesis, a perfect counter-ability for dealing with fire or Mandalorians.
The flames never reached Akeither’s skin as he lept backward, half glancing up at the Imperial transports that began landing in front of the Temple.
His day was getting worse by the second.

	Exploiting his brother’s setback, Desaust took to the air with his jetpack.
He had gotten what he came for and had no plans to stick around to greet his old employers.
Or the Empress.
Frankly, he had fully intended to leave before the siege began but didn’t anticipate this setback.
Finally, the Rogue Tide emerged and pulled alongside the edge of the terrace.
Desaust made his ascent toward the lowering ramp.

	Akeither resisted the urge to pull the ship into a forced landing and would have done so if the situation hadn’t become so dire.
The Temple was his priority now.
His brother looked down at him as the ship began to depart.
If Akeither survived the siege, it was only a matter of time before their paths crossed again.
And if this occupation endured for as long as Desaust expected, he had quite the head start.

The landing ramp rose; Desaust noticed an Imperial shuttle land near his improvised exit.
As it opened, he counted a full detail of Dark Honor Guards marching out, half-armed with lightsaber pikes and blaster rifles.
Very few people in the Sith Empire had their protection.
The Imperial flag-ship belonged to Darth Eir, Sith Empress.
She had almost killed Desaust before, inflicting permanent damage throughout his body.
Now, she had the chance to kill his brother.
A brief pang of guilt came over Desaust.
Even if he wanted to, he couldn’t go back.

The moment the landing ramp sealed, the Rogue Tide entered Hyperspace.



# Section 6
The Senate District began to crumble and burn as turbolasers relentlessly bombarded the infrastructure from above, reducing the capital to rubble within the first few minutes of the siege.
Overhead, Sith Interceptors hunted down Republic fighters.
Panicked and disorganized, Republic forces didn’t stand a chance.

The Imperial shuttle departed behind Darth Eir.
She directed her Honor Guard to join the fighting inside the Temple and began walking further into the terrace.
She had a nuisance to take care of.

Akeither felt cold, like a cloud overhead blocked the light and warmth of the sun.
He could sense only hatred and corruption from the Sith approaching behind him.
Yet it was familiar.
Spinning around, he expected to see a Sith he had bested before - someone who managed to escape the Republic’s cells or his blade.
Seeing her caught him off guard, and for a moment, he believed his old friend to be a ghost.

She had become something far worse.

"I watched you die .
.
.
Maravia, what did they do to you?" His voice trembled, her 'death' playing out in his mind.

They were so close to escaping an Imperial listening post with vital intelligence.
A sniper had her in their crosshairs and got off a shot before Mara reached their ship.
The bolt slammed into her back, and she tumbled off the cliff’s edge and fell.
It was a cheap way for Taskforce’s best Commander and saber master to die.

"What did they do to you?" She mockingly replied, igniting her lightsaber.
"They bowed .
.
.
with a little motivation." He stared at her, struggling to envision the kind and compassionate friend he knew becoming the person in front of him.
She had always disagreed with the Code and how the Jedi conducted themselves, but he never considered this outcome, nor was there ever a reason for her loyalty to the Republic to be in question.


Knowing how Mara used to be, words would not save him or sway her convictions.
Fighting was an inescapable reality for Akeither, and there would be no point in delaying it further.
Wordlessly raising their blades, they circled each other in tense silence.

Darth Eir broke the tension.
She dashed forward and arced her blade upwards, following up with a thrust with blinding speed.
Either blow would have killed anyone unprepared, but Akeither dropped his blade downward, blocking the first swing, and swayed out of the way of the next — parrying a backhanded slash as he paced out of reach.
She swung a controlled series of strikes at him, backhand, forehand, and overhand, never overextending herself or leaving herself open to a riposte.
Akeither stayed light on his feet, trusting the Force to anticipate each stroke.
He couldn’t trust his eyes alone.
He had learned that the hard way in their training sessions long ago.

Akeither whipped his saber around his body, blocking and countering Eir’s flurry of attacks.
He lunged, aiming for her hand to perform Shiim, a technique to disarm and wound.
Rotating her wrist, she caught his blade, flicking it to the side, stepping in to close the distance.
She waited for him to block, then feinted her next attack.
Akeither brought his blade across his body to deflect, but the swing never came.
Electricity coursed through Eir’s fingertips as she brought her hand parallel to the opening in Akeither’s defense, extending her arm forward as he instinctively stepped back to cover himself.
He was too slow to fix the mistake -  managing to bring his blade back only halfway before the red lightning connected with his body.
 
The pain was excruciating, and his body spasmed defiantly against his wishes.
Akeither stumbled back, his free hand shooting to his face as he swung wildly.
He had managed to block most of the blast between the saber and his armor, but it wasn’t enough.
He suffered severe burns across his face, neck, and hands.
Eir took advantage of his weakened state, grazing his saber arm.
A dark line of burnt flesh and fabric sprang across his arm.
Akeither Force pushed her away in retaliation to survey the wound, grimacing at the sight.

Kolto could mend the shallow cut, but it would affect his ability to fight.
She knew Akeither couldn’t keep going, and as she got her feet under her, she could see she had already won.
Though, she never doubted that she wouldn’t.

He was out of options, and help wasn’t coming.
Akeither looked back on the ledge behind him in contemplation.
He refused to surrender and let his former friend kill him.
And he severely doubted their past friendship would warrant mercy.
If he wanted to end the war, he would have to survive.
He redirected his gaze to Maravia; there wasn’t a remnant of kindness in her eyes.
Only hate that burned back into his own.

Darth Eir understood his plan as he backed to the ledge.
She lowered her blade with the point hovering above the concrete, a red glow partially illuminating it.

“Go ahead.
Jump,” She said icily.
“I’ll simply hunt you down.” 
Akeither winced as he shrugged, “Don’t keep me waiting then, Maravia.” 

He stepped backward off the ledge, dropping into Coruscant’s lower levels.

 She remained still for several moments before stowing her hilt and surveyed the fleet’s damage in relative silence, watching buildings crumble under their weight.
Then, she left the ledge and returned to the Temple — victorious.

Her forces had wiped out the Jedi foolish enough not to surrender.
Those that did were rounded up and kept under the watchful eye of her Guard, who awaited her decision on what to do with them.
She figured some would be willing to turncoat if it meant they kept their lives.
But the others, such as the Councilors, would be made into examples.
They were the reason for the Order dulling in its ability to bring stability and prevent corruption.
Responsible for perpetuating the cycle of gross arrogance of the Republic and its leaders.
It was time for them to face the consequences of their indifference and opinionated views.
Eir recognized the Councilors that survived the slaughter, pacing before them, taking hold of her hilt.

The hiss of the weapon made Grandmaster Luen flinch.
I should have listened, he thought.
His eyes were glued to the floor until he heard the saber pass through the air and cut through Councilor Idris at the end of the line.
Her body began to slump forward — then was thrown back as the Empress’s boot struck her square in the chest, falling into the chasm created by the infiltrator.
She went down the line, slaying each of his friends similarly.
He couldn’t bear to watch.
When she approached him, he lifted his head to acknowledge his undoing.
Luen knit his eyebrows in perplexion.
He knew this woman and oversaw the operations she and her team conducted many years ago.
As a Knight, Akeither had reported her killed-in-action.
But as she loomed over him, she was very much alive.
He wondered if Akeither had always known the truth and simply withheld the information.
Perhaps he was to blame for the Order’s fall; why else wouldn’t Akeither be here?
Unless he was already dead.
He pushed the thought aside.
There was nothing he could do about it.
He could only die now and join the others in the Force.
 "Get on with it, you’ve won," Luen muttered, scowling at the Sith Empress.
"Eager to die, aren't we?
Very well."

Luen felt the static in the air as her hand rose, fingertips pointed toward his head.
His eyes widened.
A flash of red was the last thing he saw as the current of Eir's lightning blinded him and tore through his body, setting his robes and flesh aflame.
His scream cut off when she intensified her electrical judgment, reducing the Grandmaster to a mere ash pile at her feet.
The remaining Jedi recoiled, some screamed out, and the younger members of the Order began wailing or shaking.
Eir’s forces shifted uncomfortably at the sight; they’d only seen her display this power once before on a pompous Lord.
She stepped away from the pile and pointed toward it, addressing the entire room as she spoke, “Any of you who wish to remain with the Jedi Order, I’ll be happy to reunite you with your Grandmaster.
Choose your allegiance wisely.” Several Knights immediately protested and were shot by nearby Sith Troopers.
Others found her mercy appealing and began swearing themselves to the Empire.
