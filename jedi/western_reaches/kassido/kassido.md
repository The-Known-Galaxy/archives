The planet would become linked to the rest of the galaxy due to the creation of the Senex-Juvex Loop hyperlane.
This hyperlane would connect a pathway between Kassido and Monforgon; later, the formation of another hyperlane would link the world to even more of the known galaxy.
This secondary lane would be known as the D'Aelgoth Trade Route.
The trade route formed a pathway from Kassido to the Yhifar system alongside the D'Aelgoth sector's Selenius region.
Kassido itself was one of the most heavily urbanized and populated worlds within its respective region.
The world would later become notable for its housing of House Kassido, a noble house that performed heavy trade inside the D'Aelgoth sector.
