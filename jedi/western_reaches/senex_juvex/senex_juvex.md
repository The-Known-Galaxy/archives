# Introduction
The Senex-Juvex was a dense cluster of star systems located in the nebula Thull's Shroud.
It was formed as a rejection of centralized power, and as a result, there was no government in the region beyond that of the noble houses.
Senex-Juvex developed into a zone of huge, aristocrat-ruled farming worlds, leisure planets, and wilderness worlds designated for nobles' safaris.
The native species of the region were almost totally subjugated to the Human aristocrats.
The Senex-Juvex bordered the Ninth Quadrant, the Agarix sector, the D'Aelgoth sector, and the Hadar sector.

Thull Vandron, a hero of the New Sith Wars and a hyperspace explorer, was chosen to serve in the Galactic Senate when the Brotherhood of Darkness was vanquished during the war.
Vandron was a great opponent of centralized government power and headed into the outer reaches of the galaxy with a group of like-minded wealthy Core World families.
The settlers' technology was far ahead of the region's native species, and by 900 BBY, the settlers had taken control of all the habitable planets they could reach, making them the unquestioned masters of the region.

For nearly 200 years after the settlement of the Senex and Juvex Lords in the region, they lived in peace and prosperity on their plantation worlds.
The settlers' advanced technology allowed them to establish dominance over the native species and become the unquestioned masters of the region.
However, with the expansion of the Galactic Republic into the Mid and Outer Rims, the Senex-Juvex Lords faced a new challenge in the form of the powerful Eriadu.
To protect themselves against this new rival, the Houses annexed a group of adjacent systems and established the Ninth Quadrant as a buffer zone.
Despite their attempts to maintain independence, the Senex-Juvex Lords and the Galactic Republic were forced to coexist in a state of uneasy peace.
The Houses were known to reject the Republic's attempts at diplomacy and sometimes went so far as to mine the hyperspace routes that led into their territory.
This meant that travel into and out of the region was made difficult and hazardous, allowing the Lords to maintain control over their territory.



# Section 3
As the Galactic Empire solidified its grip on the galaxy, the Senex-Juvex region was not immune to its influence.
Despite the region's long-standing opposition to centralized government power and the principles of the Republic, the noble houses of the Senex-Juvex were forced to bow to the authority of the Empire.
During this time, the region gained a reputation for its insular, aristocratic nature and strict social hierarchy.
The noble houses maintained their power and control over the commoners and non-human species that lived within their borders.
With the Empire's resources and military might backing them, the Senex-Juvex lords were able to maintain their grip on their domain.
However, the region's isolation and elitism also made it a subject of fascination and speculation among the wider galaxy.
Tales of the region's aristocracy and their luxurious lifestyles were popular among spacers and other travelers.
Some of these stories also involved daring adventures and escapades, with characters navigating the treacherous political landscape of the Senex-Juvex and outwitting the powerful lords.

Each of the major planets in the Senex and Juvex sectors had unique characteristics and played a significant role in the region's economy and society.
Karfeddion, the homeworld of House Vandron, was primarily an agricultural world, renowned for its fertile land and vast fields of crops.
The planet's large agribusinesses were controlled by House Vandron, making them one of the most powerful and wealthy noble houses in the sector.
Atron, controlled by House Garonnin, was a bustling urban center and the hub of the region's industrial and commercial activity.
The planet was known for its towering skyscrapers, busy spaceports, and high-tech manufacturing facilities, making it an important hub for the sector's trade and commerce.
In the Juvex sector, Kassido was a hub for commerce, with a grip on Coreward trade.
Its bustling markets, active spaceports, and sprawling financial district contributed to its status as one of the richest and most heavily populated planets in the area.
Deminol was a port world - renowned for its universities, which attracted students and scholars from across the sector.
The planet was home to some of the most prestigious educational institutions in the region, offering advanced degrees in a variety of subjects, including engineering, medicine, and the arts.
Loovria, on the other hand, was infamous for its brutal gladiatorial games.
The planet was a major center for the sport, attracting fans and participants from across the sector.
Despite widespread criticism from many in the Republic, the games continued to be popular, making Loovria one of the most lucrative and profitable planets in the Juvex sector.
