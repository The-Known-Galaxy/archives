# Introduction
Carsanza was an industrial world located within the Carsanza System in the Western Reaches of the Mid Rim.
Carsabza was one of the many planets connected through Hyperlanes, allowing for efficient trade routes.
Along with the rest of the planets within the Juvex Sector, Carsanza was controlled by the aristocratic Ancient Houses of the Senex-Juvex region.

# Section 1
During the era of the Galactic Empire, a small spaceport would provide shuttle flights to Carsanza, allowing for easy access on and off the planet.
During this time, one of the flights scheduled to depart was rescheduled earlier.
Mardig, a man who desperately needed to catch the flight, was not warned of this and was forced to rush to the shuttle as he was sure that if he missed this flight, his boss would fire him.


Missing the shuttle was not an option for Mardig, as the next available flight was a week later.
To speed up the process, Mardig would leap onto a Mark V14 baggage handler which would speed him to his destination.
Mardig would then make it onto the shuttle with only minutes to spare before lift-off.
