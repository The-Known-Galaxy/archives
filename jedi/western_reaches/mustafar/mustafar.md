# Introduction

Mustafar was located in the Mustafar system along the outer rim.
Mustafar usually sits around 800 degrees.
That’s because of its volcanic terrain, rivers full of lava and hot rocks surrounded the planet.
Although the planet seemed inhabitable, there is standard gravity, along with type 2 air.
Which makes the planet habitable.
This was proven true with the mustafarians, the local natives who lived in the northern and southern areas of Mustafar.
Many events have happened on this hellish planet.
For instance the assassinations of the confederate, separatists and trade federation leaders.
Anakin Skywalker, a powerful Jedi turned Sith was ordered by his master Darth Sidious to murder these leaders to make a further leap to end the clone wars and begin a new empire.
Shortly thereafter, Obi wan Kenobi, a Jedi Master on the Jedi High Council and the former master of Anakin Skywalker, was sent on a mission to reason with Anakin to prevent him from doing any further damage.
However Anakin believed otherwise, and the two fought all over the lava terrain.
Eventually with Obi Wan getting to the high ground and ending the duel with a swift strike cutting off the legs and an arm of his former padawan.
Another event occurred on Mustafar with mercenaries on a mission to gather intel on an imperial operation and completely sabotage whatever they were doing.

During that time Darth Vader built a fortress, named Fortress Vader.
It was built because Vader believed Mustafar gave him access to channel force energies surrounded by the darkside.
Many years later, Kylo Ren.
Son of Han solo and Princess Leia, was on a mission to seek out Emperor Palpatine after he gave a message to the galaxy announcing his return.
Ren, who was looking to keep his new rank as Supreme Leader, went on Mustafar and killed colonists called Alazemc of Winsit, in search of Vader’s Wayfinder to find this new threat to his empire.
