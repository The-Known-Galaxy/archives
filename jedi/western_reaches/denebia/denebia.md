# Introduction

A planet known as Denebia could be found among many other star systems in the Senex sector.
This system was directly connected to the Senex-Juvex Loop trade route.
Although the planet may have had a cool and dry climate, different sorts of plantations were located across the surface, allowing a consistent trade with the other systems that shared the same hyperlane, Anturus and Kalgo.
Every town and plantation on the planet belonged to one of the aristocratic houses of the region, House Hax.
