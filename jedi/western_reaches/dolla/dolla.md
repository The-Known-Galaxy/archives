# Introduction
The Dolla system was named after an astronomical object that took place in the area; people often referred to it simply as Dolla.
The system had a population of 1-10 million habitants and was located in the Western Reaches.
It was also connected to two different trade routes, those being Anturi Reach and Nothoiin Corridor.
For a long time, the system had remained under the control of the Galactic Republic.
However, as time went by, it eventually became a major staging area for the Imperial Starfleet during the Galactic Civil War.
