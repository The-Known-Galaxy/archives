# Introduction

A planet that mostly consisted of obsidian and lava could be found within the Sullust system inside the Outer Rim Territories.
It served as a homeworld for a species known as Sullustans.
Despite the fact that Sullustâ€™s atmosphere mostly consisted of toxic, Sullustans were still perfectly capable of living there due to them being advanced in technology.
Sullustans built their cities under the surface, where they were able to live without having to breathe the toxics from the atmosphere.
These cities were known for their beauty, which often attracted visitors to Sullust.
While most of the Sullustans lived underground, factories and such where they worked were built on the surface.
Sullustans often used tunnels, lifts and shuttles to reach them safely.
During the Imperial era, the Galactic Empire began mining fuel on Sullust for their Army and Navy.
Sullustan workers agreed to this and proceeded to cooperate peacefully with the Empire.
