# Introduction

Lar was a large orange star located in the D’Aelgoth sector of the Western Reaches, located in the Mid Rim.
One planet in its orbit was named Mima II which due to Lar’s radiation had its tectonic plates smashing into each other constantly.
Due to the tectonic plates of Mima II colliding, many species of wildlife and lush forests sprung up from the surface of Mima II.
The wildlife of Mima II was also featuring the Bilars who were said to be great interest to the Galactic Empire, due to their intelligence.
