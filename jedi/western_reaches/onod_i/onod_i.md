# Introduction

Onod I, (or more simply, Onod,) was a planet that was located within the Mid Rim Territories and the Western Reaches.
This planet was the first orbital planet within its star system, and was in the grid K-17 of the Standard Galactic Grid, which was the standardized map of the galaxy.
For reference, Coruscant was on grid L-9 and Kashyyyk was on P-9.

# Section 1

Onod I was the birthplace of an Onodone forger named Gwellis Bagnoro, who specialized in transit documents thirty years after the Battle of Endor.
His appearance, being an Onodone, consisted of a long, trunk-like mouth and a short appearance, as well as mostly wrinkly purple skin, with large beady black eyes.
Gwellis was extremely secretive about his history and past experiences and was seen spending time in the castle of the pirate Maz Kanata located on Takodana.

The planet was originally noted by a historian known as Eloc Throno, who, after leaving his homeworld of Davnar II and studying cartography at the Graf Archive on the moon of Orchis 2, which were the Archives of the extremely wealthy Graf Family, noted the position of Onod I in his Travelerâ€™s Guide to Batuu, which was among his dozens of guides such as The Traveler's Guide to Tatooine, The Traveler's Guide to Xibariz, Volcanic Planets: Your Guide to the Galaxy's Hottest Destinations, and Mandalorian Battlefield Tours.
