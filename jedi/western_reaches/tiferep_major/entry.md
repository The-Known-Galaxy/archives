# Introduction

A planet known as Tiferep Major, or Tiferep, with a population of nearly two billion, could be found in both the Mid Rim Territories and inside the Western Reaches region.
The primary surface of this world mostly consisted of large landmasses and oceans, the planet also had a large asteroid rim orbiting around itself.
During the Galactic Civil War, the people of Tiferep Major were split into two categories.
One supported the rising Rebel Alliance and the other stood with Imperial rule, however, the public opinion was in favor of the Alliance.

# Section 1

At one point during the Galactic Civil War, an Imperial mobile prison, known as the Accresker Jail was purposely set to collide with Tiferep Major, after becoming unable to be a functional holding vessel due to a dangerous infestation incident.
The Empire’s goal was to wipe out the Rebels that were stationed on the planet at that moment, while also punishing the habitants for their treacherous actions towards Imperial rule.
The impact, however, was delayed as a tractor beam was activated from Darth Vader’s flagship, the Executor, holding the Accresker in place, and allowing him to board the vessel.
The Sith Lord was in pursuit of Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra, but after an unsuccessful chance to capture her, the Sith Lord returned to his ship and released the mobile prison from the tractor beam, causing it to continue its collision course.
By the time the Accresker reached the planet's surface, the Alliance forces pulled away from the impact zone in time.
Tiferep Major, however, was met with a devastating blow.
