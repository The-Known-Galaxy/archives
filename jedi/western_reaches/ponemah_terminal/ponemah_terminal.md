# Introduction
A harsh, warm desert planet known as Ponemah Terminal or Ponemah could be found among many other star systems in the Western Reaches of the galaxy.
It was also positioned near the planet Olgem and was part of a hyperspace route known as Burke’s Trailing.
The route was connected to another desert planet called Jakku, which happened to be near Ponemah as well.
This world did not possess many habitats as the whole planet was buried in sand, making living there difficult.
Although it wasn’t uncommon to live on a desert planet, Ponemah Terminal took it to another level with its enormous sand worms that were capable of growing over ninety meters long.
This planet also had electromagnetic storms rage on it, though they mostly took place in the south polar region.
The storms would get more immense and intense the closer one got to the said area.

During the Clone Wars, a cruiser belonging to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, known as the Obrexta III, fell on Ponemah’s surface.
As decades passed, pirates and similar groups and crews found out the whereabouts of the vessel.
Later on, as the Galactic Civil War was nearing its end, an Imperial space station was positioned above the planet’s orbit, where Grand Moff Randd would wait and be prepared for the upcoming Battle of Jakku.
