# Introduction
The Gaderffii, also called the gaffi sticks, was a two-handed, traditional weapon that was worth around sixty credits.
It would be crafted by pieces of scrap metal and weigh five kilograms.
The Tusken Raiders would use this for melee and it would be used as their signature weapon for centuries.
Its appearance was a pyke-shaped weapon but with a spike on one end and a blade on the other.
They were very effective in close combat and very sharp as well, most Tusken Raiders would be very skilled with these due to practise.
Those who weren’t proficient with it would try to get better or use the Tusken Cycler, a rifle used for far-range.
In depth, the Gaderffii was to usually range from 120 to 125 centimeters long with different weapon heads on both sides.
These two heads would assist the wielder a wide for quick and versatile attacks.
The gaffi stick could also be used for important survival tasks that needed to be completed day-to-day such as hunting or farming.
Tusken Raiders would treasure this as it was traditional and was custom-built instead of brought from the black market.
It would make them identifiable as they would understand that only the Sand People would wield and create such a piece of equipment.
Whenever bounty hunters are sent to eliminate this species, they would be asked by the client to bring back their Gaderffii as proof and a medal of honor for such a defeat.
During the Dark Lord Revan’s search for a star map of the planet Tatooine, a corporation known as Czerka would request that he bring back their gaffi sticks so it could stop their organization from being attacked by the Tusken Raiders.
