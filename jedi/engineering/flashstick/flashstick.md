# Introduction
Flashstick is a weapon that releases a powerful and blinding flash of light able to blind someone for hours.
A flashstick was a small baton, mainly made and used for law enforcement on Drall.
The flashstick was most effective for the native Drall, they were exceptionally sensitive to bright lights, actually disabling them completely.
These flashsticks did not work as good on other species such as they do on Drall, species like humanoids did not have a sensitivity for bright lights, meaning it would only blind and not disable the humanoids such as it does with Drall.
One flashstick weighs one kilogram, and is widely accessible.
