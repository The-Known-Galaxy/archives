# Introduction

The QuietSnipe was a sniper rifle that fired magnetized pellet (mag-pellet) projectiles at its target.
The QuietSnipe utilized magnetic acceleration to fire its ammo.
The QuietSnipe featured a telescoping barrel to practically eliminate recoil, as well as a front sight and a trigger.
One QuietSnipe magazine could fit a hundred mag-pellets inside of it, which could all be released in three seconds if shot continuously.
These projectiles were mostly used as armor-piercing devices, able to penetrate through body armor, or if used for an assassination, the back of a chair.

The QuietSnipe was used in the Second Galactic Civil War, which spanned from 40 ABY to 41 ABY.
In this conflict, the Sith Lord Darth Caedus lead a faction known as the Galactic Alliance against the Jedi Coalition.
In 41 ABY, the Jedi assaulted Darth Caedusâ€™s home in the Roche System, where he lived on the asteroid Nickel One, guarded by the fleet of the Galactic Alliance and remnants of the Galactic Empire.
In this battle, Jedi Knight Jaina Solo, the sister of Darth Caedus, infiltrated the asteroid with a QuietSnipe in an attempt to assassinate her sibling.
She was able to hit his shoulder when she had the opportunity, but Caedus ultimately escaped with only one arm.
