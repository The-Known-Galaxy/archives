# Introduction
The B2 Battle droid also known as Super Battle droid was the upgraded version of the B1 Standard battle droid, focusing more on the aspects that the B1 battle droid lacked such as Armour and armament the B2 battle droid was known for their toughness and durability compared to their predecessors this was made with the idea of making them “heavy assault droids” sadly, the droid had now a new set of flaws thanks to such upgrades, yet the CIS used them after the first initial battles at the start of the Clone Wars, the Super Battle Droid was the second most-produced droid in the war although they didn’t have as many numbers compared to the B1 Battle droid since their materials and requisites were more complicate and took longer time to make, yet this wasn’t an issue during the war at any point.

# Section 1
The formal design of the B2-Series droid as mentioned before was focus on the major flaws of the B1 Battle Droid, these flaws were analyzed based on the results of major battles like the Battle of Naboo, to compensate more, they now added a whole 2 waves of plot armor to the chest arms and upper chest of the droid and as well adding some “small” reinforcement on the legs and arms, counted with the new addition of adding a remade arsenal of weapons been a blaster torrent in their right forearm or even in both forearm since the new model was too “big” for smaller blasters, they decide to equip the blasters as part of their hands and wired with a special emitter, they could shoot just by aiming their arm and hand in such direction, not only that but in their second produced batch of B2 Super battle droids, they were also equipped with a small rocket launcher in their left forearm.
Sadly the B2-Series was never equipped with the “OOM-Series”, unlike the B1 battle droids, thus making them unable to have variants.
Even though their main flaw wasn’t only their lack of “Own thinking of awareness” they also had the second-biggest flaw for their processor which was the first flaw noticed during the first detachment and battle we see the Battle droids and is that their command chip was connected to a signal from whatever battle station they were deployed on.



# Section 2
This was quickly fixed with the same idea of the OOM-Series processor, and even for a safer option, their processors are hidden in their torse to avoid any lucky shots able to fry their circuits but come with a sacrifice is that the droids easily forget their target if it moves out of their visual range.

The B2-Series even though it was stronger and deadlier than the B1 they still had major issues as stated before regarding most combat situations such as the aim when your arm it’s your own weapon you can see the difficulty on that and the processor this series had.
Now after the failure of Naboo and the implementation of self-command chips, this is the reason why they work so slow and have the same lack of tactics as their B1 battle droids relative, although better keeping them like this even though controlling them from a command
