# Introduction
A hyperdrive docking ring, more commonly known as a hyperdrive ring, was a piece of technology employed by starships without any built-in hyperdrive.
This device allowed for small vessels to dock with the ring, and use it to travel through hyperspace.

# Section 1
Most notably in the era of the Galactic Republic, many starfighters were too small for an onboard hyperdrive to be safely built into the starship.
As sublight travel was not practical in some instances, a hyperdrive docking ring provided an alternative way to travel while preserving a starship’s compacted design.



# Section 2
Traditionally, a hyperspace docking ring was powered by two reactors and two ion drives, allowing for sub-light, and faster-than-light speeds.
Hyperdrive docking rings could be controlled remotely and contained hypermatter, a fuel used for hyperspace travel.
There were many variations of hyperspace docking rings, and the technology could be fitted with additional acceleration pods, allowing for faster travel.
Once a hyperspace jump was complete, the docking ring detached from the starfighter, idly waiting for the ship's return.
This was considered a weakness by many, as the destruction of one’s hyperspace ring could effectively leave their starfighter stranded.
