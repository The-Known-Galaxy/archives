# Introduction
Navigation buoys — also called marker or beacon buoys — are devices that are placed on the hyperlanes of a star system and are used to mark hyperspace jump points.
These assist starships in staying away from potential danger when entering or departing a system from hyperspace.
They are designated with unique alphanumeric callsigns.
Scouts used these buoys when discovering new areas.
