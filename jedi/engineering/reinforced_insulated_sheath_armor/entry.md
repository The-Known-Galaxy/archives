# Introduction

Reinforced Insulated Sheath Armor or R.I.S was a very strong armor that was first forged in Dantooine during the events of the Galactic Civil War.
This armor had the properties of being heavy, yet flexible while offering a good amount of protection to its user.

This armor was created using local minerals found in Dantooine such as copper, aluminium, fiberplast, among others.
Depending on the materials used it could gain a specific color to it.

R.I.S armor offered enough protection to save a user from light blaster bolts so long as it hit the armor itself.
One of the weak points of this armor was that it didn’t offer fool cover.
It’s armorsmith, a Bothan by the name of Mol Ni’mai, designed the armor to consist of individual plates bound together with the use of fiberplast that protected key points of a warrior but ignored many areas in order to be flexible.
Traditionally, this armor consisted of a helmet, chest plate, two plates of the upper and lower arm for each limb the user had, legging and a pair of reinforced boots.

Due to the types of the materials used, R.I.S.
armor was extremely difficult to make and only a professional armorsmith could take on such a task.
