# Introduction

Trauger gas was first discovered on planet Socorro, it was a toxin created by volcanic activity.
Immense build up of pressure underground resulted in jets of this gas being released through steam vents.
Trauger gas was extremely deadly, as it could kill almost any creature within minutes and it was colorless and odorless which made it undetectable.
Trauger gas was even more harmful upon contact, it would cause severe nerve damage and the loss of the limb it comes in contact with.

# Section 1

This gas would sell for a lot of credits if it was able to be contained, usually bought by assassins for their operations.
But those who dealt with this gas for an extended amount of period would suffer from respiratory problems and slight deformity.

# Section 2

Trauger gas was named after a bounty hunter called Trauger, who was in pursuit of a bounty on the planet.
Trauger would blackmail the Ibhaan’I tribe, demanding a member of the tribe to lead him to the bounty or he would kill an Ibhaan’I woman.
The woman’s son Oceke agreed to Trauger’s demands but instead tricked him and led him to a field of gas (Trauger Gas), which instantly killed the bounty hunter.
From then on, the Ibhaan’I tribe would call the gas “traugi’ha”, Trauger gas.
