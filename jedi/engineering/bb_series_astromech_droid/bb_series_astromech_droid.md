# Introduction

The BB-series astromech droid, or known as a BB-unit, were droids that were manufactured by Industrial Automation.
Powered by a selenium drive, these droids had a sphere shaped body allowing them to roll across any terrain.
Instead of the head staying on one specific part of their body, wireless telemetry allowed the two sections of the droid to communicate.

BB units were also equipped with a type of grappling wire that could tether and reel the droid onto hard to reach spots or certain areas they were unable to get over.
The droid's head was composed of a lightweight cranial frame, along with a round primary photoreceptor along with a small holoprojector ray that would emit a hologram from certain messages or recordings.
As well as an antenna to receive the messages onto the droids data port that was a part of its head.

# Section 2

These droids had a dedication, goal focused personality, and were protected by self-preservation protocol.
However, some BB unit droids were known for their loyalty towards their masters, this would cause the BB unit to get into danger if the master of the unit was facing a certain threat.
The droids had a communications system like any astromech language or the more common languages equipped to most droids.
