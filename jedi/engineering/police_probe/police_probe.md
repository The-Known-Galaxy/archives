# Introduction
The Police Probe were a type of probe droid that was programmed to assist in policing on the Jedi hub planet, Coruscant.
This speciality of probe would be known for being covered in blue-gray paint with two, large lights on its head one red, while the other blue.
It was designed with a siren, sensor and antenna.
Police Probes were also able to speak, but they had a basic masculine voice.They could be seen monitoring this populated planet, looking and identifying people within the streets who have committed any crime(s) and those who can be suspects in some.
One police probe could be seen present during the death of Davu Golec who was killed by an assassin.
At the time, the droid heard the shot and went to the scene.
Therefore, seeing Satine Kryze, who was Duchess at the time before her very own death, on Mandalore at the scene holding a blaster within her hands.
This certain police probe assumed that she was the murderer behind all of this so it initiated a police chase against the Duchess though she later fled the scene.
This made the shock trooper’s of Coruscant join in with the GU-Series Police Droids and Police Probes carry on the chase.
However, the probe was disabled during the chase due to Satine Kryze with her deactivator allowing her to escape it.
A Police Probe could also be seen present when the two droids,  C-3PO and RD-D2 went to the market to buy a jogan fruit for a cake to honour a Senator.
