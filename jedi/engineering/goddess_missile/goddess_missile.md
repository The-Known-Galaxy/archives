# Introduction
The Goddess Missile was a weapon utilized by Jedi Knight Jaina Solo and the remaining members of the Myrkr strike team during the Yuuzhan Vong War.
With the help of members of the Wraith Squadron like Voort saBinring and Sharr Latt, a campaign of psychological warfare was staged to provide an advantage against the Yuuzhan Vong.
While psychological warfare was widely used in the galaxy to counter the Yuuzhan Vong, Jaina had a creative way to use her own personal exploits against them.
 Originally, a frigate analogue, called the Ksstarr, was stolen from the Yuuzhan Vong by Jaina Solo.
It was later renamed the Trickster, becoming a great insult in the eyes of the Yuuzhan Vong against them.
Causing them to fall into blind rage to recapture it and capture Jaina Solo.
The Goddess missile was given its name because it had the symbol of Yun-Harla, a goddess in the eyes of the Yuuzhan Vong.
The Yuuzhan Vong became obsessed to apprehend the thief that they were easily led into traps.
During the Wars, Jaina was able to manipulate the gravitic signature of enemy fleets by matching the gravitic signature of the Trickster with the Goddess missiles.
The effects that were produced made the Yuuzhan Vong believe the missile was the Trickster vessel itself.
The missiles were fired from a starfighter into a Yuuzhan Vong Yorik-et, also known as a coralskipper, which tricked their ships into attacking each other.
This was a huge factor in the defeat of the Yuuzhan Vong in the war for the galaxy.
Later, saBinring suggested to Solo that the missiles could have been improved.
