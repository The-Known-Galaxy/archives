# Introduction
The C-series protocol droids were a line of household protocol droids designed by Cybot Galactica during the New Republic era.
There were nine variations of C-series protocol droids, each being numbered C-1 to C-9.
 They performed similarly to other protocol droids, functioning as assistants to sentient beings for everyday use.
 The C-series protocol droids were all manufactured in a vast moon-spanning factory on Telti.
It was alleged that Cybot Galactica introduced the droids to take advantage of the success of the 3PO-series droids that they had also developed, as well as the fame of the Rebel Alliance droid C-3PO.
The manufacturer had dismissed the claims in a public statement.
