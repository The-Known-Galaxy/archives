# Introduction

The HK-51 Series Assassin Droid was a model of hunter-killer droid manufactured by the Czerka Corporation shortly before the end of the Great Galactic War.
Standing 1.8 meters (5.9 feet) tall and highly armored yet mobile, the series was designed to be the most efficient assassin droid created to date.
Programmed to be polite and courteous towards those not deemed a target, the series was able to hide in plain sight.
Their primary appearance resembled a Systech Corporation protocol droid, ensuring they couldnâ€™t be picked out in a crowd.
The HK-51 series droid was highly advanced compared to the previous HK-47 assassin droid, with improvements to armor and accuracy, as well as being much more mobile and agile.
The HK-51 series could perform acrobatic leaps and rolls, feats typically unheard of in droids of any variety.
To add on to their lethality, the 51 series featured built in weapons, including smoke launchers, wrist mounted rocket launchers, a stealth field generator, and even the ability to repair themselves rapidly in the event of critical damage.
In events of a possible mission failure, the 51 series was designed with a large explosive to be used in a kamikaze attack.

The first and only shipment of the HK-51 droids was lost on the planet Belsavis in 3668 BBY, deep within the swamps.
In 3640 BBY, escaped sith dread masters attempted to reclaim their property, however all but one of the droids had maintained critical, irreparable damage.
An individual known only as the Commander managed to fight through the remaining dread master forces and took the final HK-51 series droid for themselves.
Gathering the proper schematics and repair parts, the individual managed to rebuild the last remaining HK-51 droid, once more introducing to the galaxy the epitome of assassin droids.
The final HK-51 droid served alongside the Commander through the fall of the empire, as well as alongside the Commander during the reemergence of the Eternal Empire.
Scholars are unsure as to the whereabouts of the HK-51 assassin droid after the collapse of the eternal empire.
