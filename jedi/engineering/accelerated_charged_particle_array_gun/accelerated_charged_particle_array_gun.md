# Introduction

The Accelerated Charged Particle Array Gun, otherwise known as an ACP Array, was a close quarter weapon used by the Trandoshans during the Clone Wars.
In short, it was an eight cartridge shotgun.
Requiring to rechamber a new cartridge to the chamber every shot.
The Particle Array Gun was more commonly used against organic targets instead of droids, because it was more effective against organic life.
The gun was just as powerful as the ACP Repeater, but it had a more limited range and a lower rate of fire.
Because of this, the ACP Array wasnâ€™t built for outdoor combat, where long ranges come into play.
It was mainly used for ship boarding or urban warfare, as well as against shielded targets.
The gun was ineffective against armor.
