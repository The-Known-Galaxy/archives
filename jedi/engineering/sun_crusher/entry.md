# Introduction

The Sun Crusher, easily one of the most devastating superweapons in the history of the Galaxy.
This creation was the result of a secret plan on an imperial research station.
The purpose of this destructive weapon was to destroy entire star systems, surpassing the Death Star.
The way this mechanism functioned was by aiming at the target's star before it would then turn supernova.

Even the schematics of the Sun Crusher are gargantuan, housing 5 laser cannons, a resonance torpedo launcher and a tractor beam projector.
The significant part about the design was the resonance torpedo launchers.
It could launch up to 11 torpedoes and travel to the system’s sun at light-speed velocity.
When the torpedo would make an impact it would then implode within the system’s sun causing a release of energy.
This energy created a chain reaction that forced stars within the system to burst into a supernova.
The entirety of this process caused mass destruction of many lifeforms.

In 11 ABY, Han Solo, Chewbacca and Kyp Durron found out about the secret imperial research base named Maw Installation.
This installation housed the Star Crusher and was overseen by Grand Moff Tarkin.
Han and his crew finding the installation caused the Battle of the Maw.
As a result of the battle, the Sun Crusher was sucked into a black hole which was present on the installation, marking the end of a possible superweapon.
