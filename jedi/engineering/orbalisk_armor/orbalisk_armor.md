# Introduction
Orbalisk Armor is composed of living lifeforms that are nearly invincible and parasitic in nature.
They come from the planet Dxun and have a very hard shell that is able to deflect blaster bolts and even lightsabers.
The parasites clung to the body with their thousands of tiny teeth and consumed the dark side of the Force within the user of the armor.
Notable users of orbalisk armor were Freedon Nadd and Darth Bane.
The orbalisks that lived on the surface of Darth Bane’s body granted him the ability of many different abilities, such as amazing healing properties and enhanced strength.
However, while the abilities were great to Darth Bane, it prevented him from using one of his greatest abilities as a Sith, that ability was stealth.
It was long thought that if the host could master the use of their orbalisks, they could become an unstoppable force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.
If one of the orbalisks were to die, they would inject toxins and other liquids into the host that would kill them in the span of a few days by breaking them down on a subatomic level.
