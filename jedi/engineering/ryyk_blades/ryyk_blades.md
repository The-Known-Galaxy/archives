# Introduction
Crafted by the skilled Wookie Warriors of Kashyyyk, a Ryyk blade accounts for and protects one from all the dangers found in Kashyyyk’s towering forests.
These hand-crafted blades have been staples of a Wookie’s arsenal since they were technologically primitive and, like their bowcasters, the blades were to be considered an extension of one’s body (somewhat similar to a Jedi’s connection with their lightsaber).
Due to this inseparable attachment, Ryyk blades are designed to be able to carry out many tasks as well as uses - including combat and harvesting as well as many more.
Their multiple utilities could also be attributed to the blades’ varied designs - some similar to a scythe, schemitar or other tools (the first one being dubbed the Ryyk kerarthorr).
Consequently, due to the Ryyk blades’ many designs, new fighting styles came about - including the graceful as well as deadly dual-wielding of two blades.
However, this unique weapon could not be wielded just by anyone without incurring the wrath of the Wookie Warriors : to avoid doing so, they’d have to provide an explanation in their trading language, Shyriiwook.
Some would not bother to go through the process and, in fact, slave traders would often taunt captured Wookies by using Ryyk blades.
