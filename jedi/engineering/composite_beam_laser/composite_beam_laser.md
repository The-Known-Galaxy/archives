# Introduction
This Composite-beam laser was a weapon that was used to destroy planet cores; this weapon was a part of Deathstar I and II.
It was multiple points of a laser beam that came together to form one big and more ruinous laser beam.
Some examples that have a similar composition to the laser beam were the Arb Skynxnez’s double blaster and the anti-infantry turrets from the Republic LAAT/i.
In many battles, these composite-beam laser weapons were used to keep enemies from passing into ally lines; one example is during the Battle of Kashyyyk when two of these weapons were elevated up in the air near the main Republic command to slow down Separatist forces.
Another beam weapon that was used was during the Battle of Mon Calamari, which was the crab cannon by the Separatists; this was their weapon that could deal serious damage.
