# Introduction

The landing jet was a type of component that was implemented on starships throughout the whole galaxy.
This component was only used during landings and take-offs.
There were multiple jets located on the so-called “ventral” side of the starships.
These jets would let out multiple pressurized “bursts” of gas directed towards the surface below where the ship was located.
This was done when both landing and taking off so that the ship would have an “auxiliary” thrust and an aerostatic lift.

An important subcomponent of the landing jets was temperature sensors.
These sensors monitored the heat made from the ship to prevent damage to the surface of the landing jet.
Famous smuggler Han Solo once modified the sensors on the Millenium Falcon, so he could use the jets’ “bursts” of immense heat as an anti-personnel usage, as he could not be located easily then.
Landing jets were also a special feature that the pilot seat received, which was deployed during an emergency ejection.
