# Introduction

The R3-Series Astromech Droid was a part of the same series as the R2 unit and manufactured by the same company Industrial Automation.
The R3-Series Astromech Droid was built to have more capabilities for processing and abilities than most R2 units.
During the clone wars, R2-D2 went missing and Anakin Skywalker got a replacement R3 droid nicknamed Goldie but eventually, R2-D2 was found and returned to Anakin Skywalker.
Some R3 units had different shapes and sizes but the same internal components.
