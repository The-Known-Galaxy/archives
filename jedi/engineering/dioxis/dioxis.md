# Section 1

During the invasion of Naboo, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi were sent to the planet by the Supreme Chancellor Valorum to negotiate about the invasion.
The Jedis arrived on the flagship of the Trade Federation, also known as Saak’ak or Profiteer, and were brought into the ship’s conference room–in which they waited.
Some time later, the Neimoidians released the dioxis gas, as ordered by Darth Sidious, using the gas emitters into the room in an attempt to intoxicate them.
Fortunately, the Jedi were able to survive by the command of the Force in which it allowed them to sense danger.
They were able to escape and rescue Queen Padmé Amidala.

# Section 2

During the Clone Wars, Dioxis was used as a part of a contest on the planet Serreno by Count Dooku.
The Count gathered thirteen bounty hunters consisting of: Kierra Swan, Derrown, Sixtat, Jakoli, Embo, Mantu, Sinrich, Mantu, Sinrich, Twazzi, Onca, Cad Bane, and Obi-Wan Kenobi–disguised as Rako Hardeen–in an area called the Box.
Dooku had them compete in a series of challenges to prove their worthiness and capability to be part of a team that would kidnap Chancellor Palpatine.
The first challenge had them escape a room that was being filled with Dioxis.
