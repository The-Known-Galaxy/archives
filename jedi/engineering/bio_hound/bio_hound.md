# Introduction

The Bio-hound is a man-made construct that is made out of grey Flexi-skin; the Bio-hound is also very malleable and is able to change its shape on command to better fit its hiding place.
The Bio-hound was developed by Biogear Unlimited which was a Galactic Empire run business.
Once the hound had a target and attached itself to that target it would be exposed to the genetic makeup and information through the use of biomaterials like hair or skin.
The Bio-hound had two different courses of actions that could be taken once they attach to a target, inject a tracer fluid into the target or Inject a poison to kill the target.
Around the time of creation, it was one of the most effective and unique assassination tools.

Once the Bio-hound has located its target it will send out a broadcast to the Empire or the person that is watching over the houndâ€™s actions, this broadcast has an impressive range that lasts over 50,000 kilometres and will accurately ping the location of the target.
The Bio-hound is developed to the point where it could be almost sentient, adapting to situations and figuring more effective methods of hunting its prey such as using the environment to better disguise themselves or even hiding on a vehicle.
