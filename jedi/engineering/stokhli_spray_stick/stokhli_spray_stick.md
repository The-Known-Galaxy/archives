# Introduction
The Stokhli spray sticks, also known as the Stokhli sticks, were rod-like weapons that were crafted from metal.
They would weigh around four kilograms and cost very much compared to Gaderffiis, which would be 14,000 credits.
Stokhli sticks were first developed by the Stokhli like the name suggests that would lurk on Manress, a planet that is mostly unknown.
Their purpose was to stun from a far distance but mostly for hunting creatures.
Being quite popular among bounty hunters and just hunters, they had enough strength to stun species such as Gundarks.
To go in depth, it was described as a metal tube with only one thick nozzle.
Stokhli sticks were sometimes found to be fitted with some additional stun pads for more powerful shocks against the opponent(s) if they were still conscious after the first few blows.
Allowing it to be used as a close-ranged weapon as well, the weapon emitted a reptilian hiss sound and gained recoil quickly.
The sticks would start off by emitting mist towards the enemy to a range of a near hundred or two hundred meters.
A trigger would adjust the range to see how long it would take for the net to form.
While the net trapped the target, it would deliver a non-lethal stun charge.
Surprisingly, the power that the stun and net had combined, was able to quickly and efficiently knock out a creature or person.
