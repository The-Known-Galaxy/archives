# Introduction
The B-One battle is a battle droid class that belongs to the B-series battle droid production line.
These droids were mainly used by the Trade Federation and CIS (Confederacy of Independent Systems) but were used by smaller group from independent security forces to even smugglers.
They were made by the secretive illegal small blasters and droid producers Baktoid Combat Automata; a sister company to the  similar, public company called Baktoid Armor Workshop.
With both being owned by the Techno Union, the company that was contracted by the Trade Federation.
While the B-One was a very inexpensive trooper, they were very weak and slow in combat.
The droid’s main tactic was to be used for superiority in numbers.
Having to suppress the enemy in mass armies until the enemy could no longer sustain it.

# Section 1
The B-One series took action during the clone wars.
Their first programming consisted of them being linked to a central mainframe controlling their actions from a distant location.
This was later changed to an independent processing system for the droids after the battle of Naboo.
Since it was now seen that if the mainframe were to be destroyed, the droids would shut down immediately and simultaneously.
They would keep this style of processing for the rest of their production span.



# Section 2
The B-One series battle droid stood a little over six feet tall (Just under two meters) and weighed one-hundred forty-three pounds (Sixty-five kilograms).
They were designed with a very slim body with a crescent shaped head.
While the usual coloring of B-One’s was either bone white or a rust-like brown.
They could also be produced to match the environment pattern they are placed in.
This type of action happened on the red sands of Geonosis, for example.
The standard equipment of a B-One droid is either an E-Five blaster rifle or a SE-Fourteen blaster pistol.
Either one being equipped with a thermal detonator.
