# Introduction

The Infinity Gate was a system of structures developed by a species called the Kwa, an ancient species native to the Outer Rim world of Dathomir.
The Kwa built them during the Pre-Republic era.
They enabled almost instant interstellar travel between distant places, and could also be used as a weapon of mass destruction.

Powered by what the Kwa called the “power of the cosmos”, the Infinity Gate allowed them to travel across the galaxy or release devastating Infinity Waves.
Infinity Waves were pulses of incredible power that they could release anywhere in the galaxy.
These waves were able to suck entire planets and all of their inhabitants into infinity.
The Gates were located inside of Star Chambers, which were also inside of massive structures known as the Star Temples.

# Section 1

The Infinity Gates were constructed by the Kwa during the Pre-Republic era.
They enabled the Kwa to travel to other worlds in their region of space for the purpose of colonization.
Their expansion brought them to conflict with the Gree Enclave, a region of space in the Outer Rim controlled by the Gree race.
This conflict caused their power across the galaxy to shrink.
Eventually, they sealed the Infinity Gates and the Star Temples and placed guardians to protect their realms.
After the Rakatan Infinite Empire ordered their extermination, the Kwa devolved into the primitive Kwi species on Dathomir.

# Section 2

In 31 BBY, the Nightsisters took over a Star Temple on Dathomir and slaughtered the Kwi that lived around it.
The Nightsisters wanted to access the hidden powers of the Infinity Gate and use it to destroy Coruscant with an Infinity Wave.
However, their plot was foiled by the Jedi Knight Quinlan Vos, who redirected the Infinity Wave back at the Infinity Gate.
The Star Temple was dissolved into shattered ruins.
The Kwi also disappeared into the deserts.
