# Section 1

The DC-15A, having been invented by BlasTech Industries, was a deadly weapon to the personnel facing the front of the muzzle.
Yet at times, the blaster did have some incidents with the blaster very rarely overheating to an extent where the rifle explodes in the user’s hands.
The weapon had a total capacity of 500 shots, using Tibanna Gas cartridges.
Yet the Charge Pack, a light-weight easy to use type of ammunition clip, can shoot up to 50 shots.
To reload the gun with Tibanna Gas cartridges, the user opened the buttstock of the weapon, removing the old cartridge from the slot, then closing the buttstock.
To reload the Charge pack, the user would press the release button, letting out the empty charge pack to then reload the rifle with a new one.
