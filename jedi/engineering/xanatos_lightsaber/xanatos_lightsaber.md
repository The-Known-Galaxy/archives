# Introduction

Created in 53 BBY when Xanatos was only sixteen, Xanatos’s lightsaber would withstand many battles and would last the entirety of his life, from the light side to the dark side of the Force.
Xanatos, once Jedi Padawan of Qui-Gon Jinn, started with a blue lightsaber crystal.
The lightsaber was used on Telos IV, Coruscant, and Bandomeer where he would spar with his previous master Jinn and his current student Obi-Wan Kenobi.
His lightsaber crystal would later turn synthetic red after he turned to the dark side when witnessing his father’s execution by his Jedi Master.
In 43 BBY, the lightsaber would disintegrate in a pool of acid with its then twenty-five-year-old wielder, Xanatos.

As the lightsaber owner’s last test before becoming a Jedi Knight, Yoda would send both Xanatos and his master Qui-Gon to Telos IV to meet his father, Governor Crion, after he secretly orchestrated the murder of one of the Telos priestesses, Liora.
While Qui-Gon was trying to investigate the incident, Crion would convince the lightsaber owner to side with him.
Xanatos decided to side with his father during the civil war, thus failing his final trial.
The lightsaber would then serve its holder, while head of the Telosian army.

After finding out, Jinn went after the governor in hopes to rescue the wielder from the wreck his father had caused, but the governor decided to duel Jinn instead.
Xanatos watched as, eventually, his former master destroyed his father’s sword and knocked him into the decorative fires of his palace, causing his instant expiration.
As Jinn tried to apologize, the wielder’s fury at the death of his father caused him to turn to the dark side, the reason for the lightsaber’s later change to synthetic red.

In 44 BBY, the lightsaber wielder met up with Obi-Wan Kenobi, his former master’s then padawan, in Bandomeer after finding out about him being an unfit Jedi.
He then talked the padawan down, telling him he was not going to make it as a Jedi Knight.
Wanting to take Obi-Wan Kenobi’s lightsaber for his own, he then dueled him with his synthetic red lightsaber but was then intercepted by Jedi Master Qui-Gon, who remembered the lightsaber wielder’s fighting tendencies and who was able to outmatch him.
After, the wielder then tricked his former master and his then padawan into a mine with hidden explosives scattered throughout.
The lightsaber holder attacked them with his speeder bike’s laser cannon, forcing them deeper into the mine and closer to his trap.
The wielder was then pushed back by Obi-Wan, who appeared stronger than he originally believed, while his master Qui-Gon also helped fight the rogue lightsaber wielder.
After noticing he was outnumbered and out-skilled, he was forced to retreat.
