# Introduction

The HK Protocol Pacifist Package was a module created for the HK-series assassin droid somewhere between 4015 BBY and 3951 BBY.
It was made to stop its assassination routines and instead add pacification programming without the droid in question knowing about it.
The module itself was designed to be downloaded onto the droid’s behaviour core and could be installed by those that were not knowledgeable in technology.
It could also suppress the droid’s memories and when asked to take part in combat or kill a being, the droid would not remember it’s past behaviour as an assassin but instead show shock and dismay at the concept.
The droid would now act as a translator and protocol unit, becoming interested in teaching itself by educational activities, this desire being installed by the module.
However, not all the changes were permanent as if the module got removed the droid would return to its former self and retain the memory of the module’s presence and the motivation of resolving conflicts.
Jedi Knight Meetra Surik would obtain one of these modules and install it onto her HK-47 droid.
The module had an immediate effect that drew concern from Surik and companions.
The module was removed with HK-47 expressed disgust at the forced change and asked for any future updates to be run through diagnostics first.
Though the module did give him insight into the desire for peaceful resolutions.
