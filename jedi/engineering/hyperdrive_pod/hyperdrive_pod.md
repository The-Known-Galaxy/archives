# Introduction
According to scientific studies, hyperdrive pods which also has many nicknames such as hyperspace pods, pod ships, as well as probiotic pods were ships that are single-seated and are capable of flying in hyperspace, an alternative dimension, which was used to deliver a special type of droid to their destination that could be used for deep space exploration called probe droids as well as creating a small amount of more powerful hyperdrive than other hyperdrives along with a sunlight engine that can allow a ship to break through the atmosphere as well as the engine being placed in a shield that had sensors.
These types of pods are built to crash down fast based on the design, simulating a meteorite crashing down, preventing others from detecting the crashing pods.
Inside the pod is a comfortable cushion, and the person’s arms are being retracted when they enter the pod.
Furthermore, the probe droids on the ship used an umbilical cord to control the status, as well as the location of the pod’s transport.
In order to prevent any harm to the droid, the umbilical is removed before landing any ship.
A type of pod called X3-13 were special hyperdrive pods that were used for the sole purpose of deploying an E-XD-series infiltrator droid which was also known in a simple form called E-XD infiltrator droid, a type of droid used by the Galactic Republic.
