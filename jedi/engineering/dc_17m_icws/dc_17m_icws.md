# Introduction
The DC-17m Interchangeable Weapon System (ICWS) was a customizable blaster rifle designed by BlasTech Industries for use in the Grand Army of the Republic.
 The weapon system was primarily issued to Republic commandos to meet the demand of a versatile weapon to be used by special forces.
Its modular design allowed it to be transformed into a regular assault rifle, sniper rifle or an anti-armor grenade launcher.
The weapon had proved to be extremely useful to its clone commando owners as it could be altered to be more effective in varying environments and against certain targets.

In its base form, the DC-17m was recommended for ranges up to 45 meters but was viable up to 450 meters.
Modifying the blaster’s attachments was as easily performed as changing ammunition magazines.
Despite its advantages, it weighed at least 5 kilograms which was a hefty weight for a blaster rifle.
The production of the weapon required heightened quality control to prevent it from jamming due to extreme conditions.
The DC-17m was designed with durability in mind and the stock was robust enough to be used as a melee weapon.
The blaster rifle was valued at 4,500 credits making it over twice as expensive than the standard issue DC-15A and over quadruple the cost of a DC-17 hand blaster.
The DC-17m served as a high performing, yet expensive weapon in the Galactic Republic’s arsenal.
