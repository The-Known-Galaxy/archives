a company known to produce several different items for space travel.
It was used in the Rebel Alliance’s RZ-1A-wing interceptor.
The J-77 Event Horizon was said to have mass amounts of agility and quickness due to the dual Bpr-99 fusion reactors, thrust-vector controls and thrust control jets like in the A-wing.
Even with all these perks and some of the best pilots in the galaxy the J-77 is nearly impossible to have a stable flight.
