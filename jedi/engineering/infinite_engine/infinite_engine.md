# Introduction

Of Rakatan origin, the Infinite Engine was a vital piece of the Rakatan Star Forge.
This space station drew energy and matter from a nearby Star and was capable of creating entire star fleets, droid armies, nutrients, and much more.
After the fall of the Rakatan Empire, the station was explored by Darth Revan, who used the machine to create a Sith Fleet, before taking the engine itself to be stored, studied, and utilised in a secure compound guarded by his followers.
Revan taught them that in death, their bodies should be given to the machine so that it could produce more materials for it to keep them alive.
This eventually allowed the machine to grow from a small handheld device to a machine able to occupy an entire room.
The Sith Empire later discovered the compound and the machine was then taken for study by the Imperial Reclamation Service.
