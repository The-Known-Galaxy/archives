# Introduction

I2-CG Droid
The I2-CG Droid was a droid with a similar shape to the R2 droid except mainly white and a barrel-like body, except for its bowl-shaped head with tints of red and silver combined.
In the near years of 34 ABY, it was known that Roodown dragged a sled with parts of multiple non-functional I2-CG Droid parts he brought the droids through an outpost on Jakku, passing the one and only Rey Palpatine and a BB unit droid after their encounter with Roodown was never seen again with the droids.
