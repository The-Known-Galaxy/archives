# Introduction

A majority of the most well known world-destroying and battle-ending weapons were fueled and powered by an element known as Baradium.

Baradium was infused into the chambers of thermal detonators, slugs and other weapons used for mass destruction.
It’s a highly flammable and chemically reactive element that is ideal for waging war.

# Section 1

Although baradium is now mass-produced in factories across the galaxy for obvious reasons, it used to be discovered on normal planets through normal geological changes.
Duro and Anobis were examples of these worlds.
It is hypothesised however that upon their discovery and continued usage, a synthetic replacement was needed as the natural resources were stripped completely.

The baradium itself, being highly reactive, when detonated, created a gigantic swirl of pulsing energy that incinerated anything and everything in its radius.
This was as a result of the intense heat that the fusion impulse created.

Due to this chemical being so dangerous, mistakes could not be afforded.
It was also expensive to reproduce and was often transported in only small quantities to prevent it from accidentally exploding during transportation.

# Section 2

Baradium as previously mentioned, was utilised in a multitude of devices.
Thermal detonators were the most well known, and were called baradium charges.
It could pierce through the hardest of materials and devastated enemy forces when used as mortar rounds.
Bounty hunters often used these baradium charges in that sense.

Another was baradium missiles which were used to great success by the Jedi Order during the Yuuzhan Vong War.
They tore apart even the biggest of capital droid ships, and melted away evenemy defences.
The most notable of events included the Battle over Exodo II whereas they were applied to a significant extent to peel away enemy forces.

An even more well known use of baradium was the fission device which was a system embedded in Galactic Republic superweapons.
These are present in the Deathstar and were used to destroy entire planets, shipyards and of course, rebellions.

Lesser known uses included detonator tape for blast doors, and seismic charges used for mining and other uses.

# Section 3

During the Old Republic, a more conservative time, baradium in itself was banned due to its highly unethical nature.
The punishment of violation was death.

However, this didn’t deter bounty hunters and other unethical organisations such as the Sith.
They applied it to great use against the Jedi in their efforts to gain any advantage available to them.

More specifically, a Jedi team led by Vannar Treece attempted to erode the Daiman supply line who were supplying illegal baradium materials on Chelloa.
This resulted in many casualties as Odion (a Sith lord) used baradium to incinerate some of the task force during the battle.

Depa Billaba provided a very good argument with regards to Mace Windu’s decision to begin the Clone Wars on that infamous rescue attempt on Geonosis.
She stated that if only a baradium bomb had been used to incinerate the entirety of the Geonosis colosseum, millions of lives would have been saved including hundreds of Jedi.

Han Solo kept a couple baradium bombs on his Millenium falcon for exceptional circumstances.

Other less notable events included baradium bombs, and throughout history a multitude of sizable explosions can be attributed to the presence of baradium.
