# Introduction

The 7-PrG Proton Grenade was a small 1-kilogram charged explosive made by weapons manufacturer Merr-sonn Munitions.
In 4 ABY, it was planted in the control and generator rooms of the Endor shield generator bunker, which was protecting the Death Star II, by the Rebel Alliance strike team.
Activation of such a device required the use of a twistable primer to set a delay time and an activation plunger to commence the countdown, ensuring that no accidental detonations were made.
Once activated, the grenade wasnâ€™t easy to disarm and needed force to twist the activation plunger in the opposite direction.
However, smugglers were known to degrade the bottom of the grenade to diminish the chances of a successful de-arming procedure.
The power of this proton grenade was comparable to an unstable thermal grenade but was focussed in one direction, and had the added benefit of being an Electro-Magnetic Pulse emitter with a range of up to 20 metres away.
Similarly to the workings of proton torpedoes on larger starfighters, proton grenades had a proton core, making them very powerful explosives that could be held.
It detonated and disabled the deflector shields over the Death Star, allowing Rebel starfighters to get into the insides of the orbital station and take out its power generator.
