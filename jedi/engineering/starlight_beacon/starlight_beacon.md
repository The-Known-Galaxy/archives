# Introduction
A space station known as Starlight Beacon, or alternatively the Starlight Station was built by the Galactic Republic under the supervision of the Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh.
The price of this station was increased greatly due to the size and location of it.
This station could be found inside the Outer Rim Territories.
It had many purposes such as acting as a hospital and a research station.
One of its main purposes was to guide travellers through the unexplored zones.
It was meant to reinforce active communication networks and could be used for military purposes if needed.
Its grand opening happened some time after the Great Hyperspace Disaster.
Many individuals arrived  at this event from across the galaxy for the effort and dedication that was put in to finish the project.
Many high-ranking Jedi could be seen at the event, including those that rarely left Coruscant at that time, such as Grand Master Yoda.
A Jedi Temple was built inside the station, it was designed by a Jedi architect known as Oaki Hidalla.
At that time it was the largest area that held Jedi outside the Coruscant.


Jedi Master Jora Malli was given the task to oversee the temple on the station but was killed quickly after receiving this information.
Avar Kriss continued in her place.
Eventually the station could be seen falling from the sky in flames due to a bomb planted by the Nihil, it was completely destroyed once it collided with a planet known as Eiram.
