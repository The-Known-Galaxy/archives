# Introduction
SoroSuub Corporation made the X-45 sniper rifle sometime before the 2nd year of the clone wars, which is known to be a highly accurate sporting sniper rifle.
A long computerized targeting scope was attached to the weapon as well as it having a maximum of twenty-five shots a round.
The X-45 weighed four kilograms and had a maximum range of 500 meters.
The rifle could be disassembled and put into a specialized case.
A downside of having the  X-45 sniper rifle was that it was fragile, this would mean only taking it out when you are at the time in point to use it, it also can compromise you for your target or targets to escape if they spot you setting the weapon up.
To own an X-45 sniper rifle you would need anywhere from 750-1000 credits.
This rifle was available from as early as the Clone Wars, the rifle was used throughout the rule of the Galactic Empire, and into the administration of the New Republic.
The bolt was reported to be overfocused in the barrel, which made the bolt thinner than a normal bolt from a normal blaster, but the X-45 sniper rifle bolt was much more lethal.
The weapon was initially marked as a civilian weapon called the Riflette.
Eventually, the weapon was re-classified for military use this was because the weapon became popular with assassins.
If the shooter was using the X-45 sniper rifle it was easy to pick off your target without drawing too much attention.
