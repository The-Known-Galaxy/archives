# Introduction

The Trade Federation Assassin Droid was a droid used by the Trade Federation to aid their invasion of the planet Naboo in 32 BBY.
Their appearance resembled that of a human, and their armor and weapons were primarily made out of Cortosis.
Cortosis was a strong and highly conductive metal that was capable of making lightsabers short out on contact.
Their armor was an alloy chassis shell that was capable of deflecting lightsaber attacks.
Trade Federation Assasin Droids carried swords or maces that were made out of Cortosis, which were designed specifically for killing Jedi.
These droids had a pair of red photoreceptors where eyes would normally be.

# Section 1

During the Trade Federations attack on Naboo, they dispatched many Assassin Droids to hunt down the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
The two Jedi defeated the first ones they found with ease, taking the droids down swiftly.
However, they were faced with adversity when they were attacked by many Assassin Droids when they tried to meet up with the Queen of Naboo, Padme Amidala.
These droids met the same fate as the others before them, and the Jedi escorted her off-planet to Coruscant.

# Section 2

After the Trade Federationâ€™s defeat in the Invasion of Naboo, these Assassin droids were no longer seen, and it was assumed that manufacturing of these units had ceased.
