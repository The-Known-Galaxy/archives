# Introduction
The IG-100 MagnaGuards were one of the deadliest and most versatile droids utilized by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars.
Constructed by Holowan Mechanicals, these droids were designed specifically to battle and kill Jedi.
They were equipped with advanced combat learning programs that allowed them to adapt to a highly diverse variety of tasks, ranging from melee and ranged combat to starfighter control.
The MagnaGuards were partially plated with thick duranium armor, enhancing their purpose of murdering Jedi.
They could speak and were trained to mock their opponents in a low, rumbling Basic.

MagnaGuards stood around two meters tall and had a humanoid body shape, but their mechanical anatomy was considerably greater, allowing them to perform superhuman acrobatics, speed, and warfare.
Their faces were outfitted with two red or yellow photoreceptor "eyes" that were supplemented by a backup device located on the chest.
The internal systems of the MagnaGuards were equipped with advanced warfare learning programs, allowing them to adapt to a wide range of activities, from melee and ranged combat to starfighter management.
Each type of the IG-100 MagnaGuard had its own programming, training, and speciality.
Many types existed, superficially distinguished by color: black, ivory, blue, and the anomalous gray.
MagnaGuards belonged to the same Holowan Mechanicals line as the later IG-88 range.
They also appeared to utilize audible droid language on occasion.
They made yelping sounds when they were in danger, such as when they were trapped on the ground.

Count Dooku commissioned the development of the IG-100 MagnaGuard to suit General Grievous's requirements when the InterGalactic Banking Clan obtained Grievous's services as an enforcer and refused to recruit his Kaleesh.
Grievous killed all the MagnaGuards present upon activation, releasing his rage at being treated like a droid.
Grievous then personally trained the remainder of his bodyguards in the seven classic techniques of lightsaber combat, allowing them to engage and kill Jedi successfully.
Grievous refused to allow routine repairs to the droids, claiming that their numerous scratches and battle scars made them more fearsome to opponents.
Grievous used his bodyguards in practice bouts as part of his training, often injuring them.
The MagnaGuards were first employed in warfare during the Battle of Parein II 4, when one of Grievous' MagnaGuards killed Jedi Master Sannen by shoving its electrostaff through his throat.
The MagnaGuards quickly proved to be fearsome, easily defeating Jedi and clone troopers and were viewed by some as more intimidating than droidekas.
Despite their numerous advantages, however, they were not invincible; Boba Fett managed to destroy one using a strategically placed blaster bolt during the Battle of Florrum.
Despite this, the MagnaGuards remained a major force throughout the Clone Wars.

MagnaGuards, being vessels of advanced technology and unparalleled combat expertise, carried with them a formidable assortment of weaponry that included electrostaffs capable of unleashing electrical surges upon their foes, and blasters for precise offensive strikes at varying distances.
Their primary weapon was the electrostaff, a long-handled weapon that discharged an electrifying and deadly current upon hitting its mark.
The electrostaff could also be split into two shorter weapons, allowing for increased versatility in combat.
MagnaGuards also boasted built-in rocket launchers within their forearms that enabled them to unleash explosive projectiles upon their adversaries.



# Section 4
There were several notable MagnaGuards that stood out in combat.
Of them was the IG-100 MagnaGuard Commander, General Grievous' personal bodyguard, who was identifiable by its crimson markings and superior combat skills.
During the Battle of Mon Cala, another noteworthy MagnaGuard battled Jedi Master Kit Fisto in a one-on-one duel.
The MagnaGuard held its own against the experienced Jedi but was defeated in battle.
