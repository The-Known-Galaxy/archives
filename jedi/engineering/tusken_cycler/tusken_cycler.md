# Introduction

Tusken Cyclers were the weapon of use by the fearsome Tusken Raiders of Tatooine.
The Cycler itself was usually hand crafted by Tusken Raiders from broken ship parts, smelted metal and other pieces of scrap that Tusken Raiders could find lying around.
The Cycler fired slug rounds but some tribes got their hands on explosive slug rounds.

The Cycler was usually used as a rifle as they added extended barrels to it and also scopes occasionally for more precise shots.
The Tusken Raider loved to go to the Boontaâ€™s Eve Classic Podrace track and fire at random podracers when they came flying past the hilly areas, where the Tusken Raiders would perch on.
