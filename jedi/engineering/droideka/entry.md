# Introduction

Droideka, or destroyers, were droids made during The Clone Wars.
Notably, Droideka were used during the Invasion of Naboo by the Trade Federation.
Destroyers move in two ways; One way is rolling into a ball-shape form, and rolling at speeds that could reach up to 75 Kilometers per hour (or 46 mp/h).
The second way is by using their 3 spider-like legs to walk.
Destroyers emit a blast shield while firing, used to absorb blaster fire.
At the beginning of their production, the Republic had to destroy their shields, then their bronze armor in order to kill the Droideka.
Towards the middle of The Clone Wars, though, the Republic developed an EMP, that when rolled under the Droideka, would shut it down entirely.
Attached to the destroyer are twin repeating canon blasters, which have a very unique sound when fired.
One shot from one of these blasters to any part of the body will instantly kill the victim.
One of the many ways troops have adapted to the Droideka is to attack it from behind, as it’s completely blind from the back.
It’s shields rendered all side-arms and blasters useless, and most hand-held weapons were not able to pierce it.
