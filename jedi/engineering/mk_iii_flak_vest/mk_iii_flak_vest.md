# Introduction
The MK.III Flak Vest was produced by Pacnorval Defense Systems and saw common usage by security forces during the Galactic Civil War; however, it was not uncommon to see them worn by non-combatants.
It was designed to protect against light blaster fire, as well as fragmentation from slug rounds and fragmentation grenades.
It consisted of light dura-steel plates and was configured in the typical flak jacket or tactical vest form, depending on the situation it was used for.
