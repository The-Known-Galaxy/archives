# Introduction

Swamp gas was a chemical weapon used by the CIS (Confederacy of Independent Systems), against Gungans on Ohma-Dâ€™un, a small moon that circled planet Naboo.
The creator of this chemical weapon was the leading scientist of the CIS, Jenna Zan Arbor.
This gas proved fatal to the Gungans, being able to kill them within seconds but it took a while to eliminate any other species.
This gas caused blisters all over the skin and started internal bleeding, which put the victims through an extremely painful process.
Fortunately Obi-Wan Kenobi recovered an antidote for this deadly bio-weapon on a mission to Queyta.
