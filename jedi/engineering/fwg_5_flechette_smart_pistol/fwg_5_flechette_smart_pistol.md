# Introduction
The FWG-5 Flechette Smart Pistol was a handheld flechette pistol designed and manufactured by Malaxan Firepower Incorporated during the Galactic Civil War.
A second version of the weapon with an unknown designation was also manufactured using a skeletal construction and lighter materials.
The weapon was designed to mimic the power of a weapon like the BlasTech DL-44 heavy blaster pistol.
Unlike most similar weapons, including the FC-1 flechette launcher, the FWG-5 utilized smaller pellets filled with only up to a dozen razor sharp durasteel flechettes.
It's smart pistol designation arose from the ability of its rounds to track targets while in flight and make course corrections to stay on target, aided by an advanced laser guidance system built into the lightweight pistol.
Furthermore, it was rated to pierce most basic blast vests and even stormtrooper armor at the correct ranges.
Strangely, this weapon was known to have an unusual energy blast option also built into the weapon which allowed for more precise shots compared to the highly destructive flechettes the weapon was designated to fire.
