# Introduction

Ion pulses are types of warheads that utilise ion disruption technology.
Ion weapons fry and disable electronic systems and vehicles by firing ionised particles.
An ion pulse, when detonated, the ionised particles move in an expanding sphere, disrupting all technology caught within the blast radius.
Although traditionally detonated as a warhead, it can be triggered without one.
One such example was an ion pulse created by the astromech droid R2-D2 at Sunspot Prison, a Rebel penitentiary for dangerous Imperial prisoners, between 0 and 1 ABY.

# Section 1

Following the invasion of the Trade Federation, an ion pulse was installed on the planet of Naboo, in the capital of Theed, in 32 BBY.
It was placed so that upon activation, it would disable any technological threats outside of the Royal Palace.
Installation of the ion device began under the reign of Queen Padmé Amidala, and was finally completed under Queen Réillata.
In 4 ABY, it was used to defend the city against an Imperial invasion force.
