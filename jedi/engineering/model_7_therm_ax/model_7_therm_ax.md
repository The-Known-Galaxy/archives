# Introduction
The Model 7 Therm-Ax was a two-handed heavy weapon.
It was manufactured by the SoroSuub Corporation based on Sullust.
SoroSuub manufactured weapons and technology throughout the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War.
The Therm-Ax was expensive, selling at the high price of 850 credits.

# Section 1
The Therm-Ax was made of a durasteel alloy, an alloy stronger and more resistant to kinetic damage than standard steel.
Underneath the surface of the blade were thermal coils.
The coils heated the blade up to a temperature of 500 degrees.
This made the blade so hot that it could burn flesh and flammable materials.
