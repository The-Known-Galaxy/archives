# Introduction
Tibanna was a material found in both gas and liquid form.
Tibanna was located in the atmosphere of many planets.
The most well known source of tibanna was the planet Bespin, located in the Outer Rim Territories.
One of the first users of Tibanna gas was the Beldon, the native species of Bespin.
The beldon were large creatures, some of them seen with an olive skin color, and some had a light orange skin tone as well.
These creatures’ metabolism evolved the necessity to process Tibanna gas.
Both Tibanna gas and liquid were very valuable because of its many uses in military operations.
In its gaseous form, it was used as a power source for energy weapons and fuel for fleets.
In liquid form, Tibanna gas was highly volatile and could be used in explosive manufacturing.

Most commonly, Tibanna gas was used as ammunition for blasters, turbo lasers, as well as fuel for many galactic naval fleets.
One notable weapon of Tibanna gas was the Death star.
The Galactic Empire had many supply platforms located in protected locations with the purpose of providing a steady supply of fuel to their fleets.
During the Clone Wars, the Tibanna gas was used in its liquid form for clone troopers to heat their post on the Rishi moon, but the Tibanna liquid seemed to be explosive, because, when battle droids invaded the post, clone trooper CT-782, named Hevy, used the Tibanna liquid to engulf and destroy the outpost.
We understand that TIbanna gas was very valuable and very expensive; during the Galactic Civil War, a criminal named Tyber Zann successfully stole an enormous amount of Tibanna gas from Bespin.
He then proceeded to sell the valuable Tibanna gas on the black market for a very high price.
