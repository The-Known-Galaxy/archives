# Introduction

Radiation grenades are one of the several small explosive weapons that could only be purchased throughout the galaxy in an unsavory manner.
The grenade’s market price was around 500 credits, buyers of this kind of weapon were those who preferred results over morality in its use.
A well known example of these grenades being used in combat was during the Clone Wars.
The Confederacy of Independent Systems used radiation grenades in their conflicts with the Galactic Republic’s army and the Jedi Order.

# Section 1

Radiation grenades were light, weighing only half a kilogram (Slightly over a pound).
While it was a single use weapon, the grenade could be projected in two ways, either by a hand-held throw from the user or with a portable weapon called a grenade launcher.
When the explosive would be launched and detonated, it could expel a mist of toxic radiation in its area.
Any living organism caught in its way would suffer heavily from the radiation, leading to severe genetic mutation or death for victims.
The blast radius of the grenade would be around three meters (nine feet) in size, excelling in compact areas such as rooms or hallways.
