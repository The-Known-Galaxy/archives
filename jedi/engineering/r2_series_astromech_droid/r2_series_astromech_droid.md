# Introduction
R2 units were one of the most popular astromech droids produced by Industrial Automaton, a company that developed droids.
The droids, which were about 1 meter tall and had domed heads, were programmed to perform many tasks.
One of their most successful models in the series was a droid known as R2-D2.
One of the R2 unit's greatest weaknesses was its ability for compassion in its programming.
