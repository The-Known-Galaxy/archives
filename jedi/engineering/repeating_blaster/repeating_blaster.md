# Introduction
The repeating blaster was a classification for weapons that had the ability to fire a large volume of projectiles within a short time interval.
These powerful infantry support weapons were used to provide suppressive fire and proved to be effective at eliminating masses of infantry.
They were generally required to be mounted on a tripod, though lighter versions could be handheld.
Even the lightest of repeating blasters were larger than the standard infantry weapon.
 Repeating blasters were frequently placed upon defensive installations and often mounted on light vehicles to provide heavy mobile fire.
