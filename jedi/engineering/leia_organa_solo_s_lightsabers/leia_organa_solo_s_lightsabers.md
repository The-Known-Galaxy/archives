# Introduction
After discovering she was force-sensitive Leia went on to ask her brother for assistance with building her very own lightsaber.
This saber didn't last very long, for she always would lose her lightsaber while dueling or even just exploring.
Through her time as a Jedi she would keep this lightsaber for a fair amount of time until losing it.
The lightsaber was made during the Thrawn campaign in 9 AB, and was wielded by Mara Jade to kill her brother Luke and Joruus C’baoth.
This lightsaber was green and had a very unique hilt to it with golden parts on different sides and then some silver rings around it.
Eventually, she was able to retrieve her lightsaber back from Mara Jade by dueling him.

A few years later, she went on to make a yellow lightsaber which she dueled the fallen Hut Jedi Beldorian with it on Nam Chorios.
The lightsaber her brother Luke had gifted her was a ruby red lightsaber in 19 ABY, which she used for a bit until red became the Siths colour once again.
She later on had a  blue lightsaber, which was her 4th lightsaber ever that she used throughout Swarm War and many decades on.
When she had died a Jedi named Rey Palpatine buried her lightsaber along with her fathers.
She would also bury his brothers beside hers.
