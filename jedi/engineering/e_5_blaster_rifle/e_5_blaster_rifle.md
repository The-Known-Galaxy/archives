# Introduction

The E-5 blaster rifle was initially created by the Baktoid Armor Workshop for use in the Trade Federation Droid Army.
The blaster was very light-weight, being slightly over two kilograms (just under five pounds).
The blaster included a large gas pack with a 500 shot capacity, a high amount of blast power and a very short barrel.
This short barrel would make it difficult to be used by organic beings because of the high heat exhaustion from each shot, but would have little to no effect on non-organic beings' limbs.
This blaster's price ranges from where you find it in the market.
That range was usually from the lowest of 600 credits to the highest of 900 credits.

The E-5 rifle was used mainly by the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Trade Federation.
Both organizations equipped B-1 battle droids with the E-5 before and during the Clone Wars.
The low cost for the blasters was more inexpensive than the DC-15S (1000-1500 credits) the clone army used.
That price reduction would ease the budget for mass-producing droids, who did not need to wear additional gear unlike organic beings.
The Trade Federation and Confederacy of Independent Systems used this cost reduction method to install more droids in their ranks.
Their cost per soldier would be much lower compared to the Republicâ€™s, allowing them to fulfil their superiority in numbers tactic as desired.
