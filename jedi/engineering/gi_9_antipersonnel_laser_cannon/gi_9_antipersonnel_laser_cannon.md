# Introduction
The Corellian Engineering Corporation were the creators of several types of weapons and vehicles.
The Gi/9 anti personnel laser cannon or blaster cannon is one to include in their list of weapon creations.
The weapon was a Gi/9 model laser cannon that had a mountable design, this allowed the owner to equip their laser cannon to vehicles such as sail barges.
A great example of Gi/9 laser cannon use is on the desert planet of Tatooine.
The Hutt Crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure or Jabba the Hutt was the owner of several of these laser cannons.
Jabba had the modeled cannons equipped on his LO-KD57 luxury sail barge the Khetanna, specifically the top deck of the barge.
