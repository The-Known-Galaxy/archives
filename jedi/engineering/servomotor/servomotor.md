# Introduction
Servomotors, also known as servos, intermotors, or movement/balance processors, were a type of motor that was placed in droids to move body parts for beings.
These motors were also used in the replacement of limbs for beings.
There were some vehicles, such as the Imperial Aquatic Terrain Armored Transports, that had to use servomotors; otherwise, the vehicle would not function properly.
Most humanoid droids would need a pelvic servomotor for it to mimic human movement.

# Section 1
An AT-AT, nicknamed “Swimmer,” was once stationed on the planet Sedri during the Galactic Civil War.
This AT-AT needed a replacement servomotor, so it could be used during the civil war in Sedri and was ordered by Aban, a base commander.
The motor was delivered by shuttle, along with stormtrooper reinforcements.
Once the motor was installed, it was ready for war and eventually deployed at the Battle of Fitsay.
The AT-AT, however, was not proven to be a help and was destroyed by the Rebels, who were aiding the people who occupied Fitsay, along with the motor in this war.
