# Introduction
The Metal Crystal Phase Shifter was the result of a project that had a goal of creating an ultimate weapon.
The weapon was able to alter the structure of any metallic structure on a cellular level.
The weapon had the ability to turn any metal object into dust within it’s range.
It also was able to significantly weaken any metal object to the point of no return.
This weapon was in the works since the beginning of the Galactic Civil War within the Imperial Maw Installation.

# Section 1
During the takeover of the New Republic, Mon Mothma ordered any Imperial Superweapons in the works or in design to be hunted down and destroyed.
However, during the Battle of the Maw, an Imperial Admiral named Dalaa managed to download the designs for the weapon before fleeing his station from the incoming Rebel attacks on the Imperial Maw Installation.
Due to this, he used the weapon during the Second Battle of Fondor.
Most of his soldiers were equipped with them, which allowed him to turn the tides on the war.
