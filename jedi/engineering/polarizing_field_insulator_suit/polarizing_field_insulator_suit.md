# Introduction
A polarizing field insulator suit, manufactured by VargeCorp, was a heavy suit of armor used for protection against powerful energy discharges.

# Section 1
Worn most frequently by technicians, the suits generator could create an insulation field around the wearer, offering protection from electrical and ionization energy.
Using a standard power pack, the generator could function for 30 minutes, and although the suit could provide protection from energy discharges such as blaster bolts, a more kinetic form of attack would often prove the armor to be futile.
