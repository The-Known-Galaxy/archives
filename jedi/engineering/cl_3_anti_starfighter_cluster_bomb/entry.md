# Introduction

The CL-3, an antistarfighter cluster bomb designed by FreiTek Incorporated, was a weapon commonly employed by the Rebel Alliance for destroying star destroyers.
They used this weapon in particular as it is highly effective against large, unshielded ships, such as the star destroyers utilized by the Galactic Empire.
It is a bomb consisting of two stages.
The explosion of the bomb released a burst of high velocity shrapnel, followed by magnetized grenades in a sheet.
They were common on the Mon Calamari cruisers, however, they were also used in both EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigates and CR90 corvettes.

# Section 1

FreiTek Incorporated, the company behind the CL-3, was a major manufacturer of military vehicles.
They openly supported the New Republic, and built a craft, the E-wing escort starfighter, specifically for the New Republic.
The initial design for the E-wing was rejected for its inferior weapon systems by the Republic.
It was eventually accepted after they created a division specifically for weapons development.
They supported this department by selling upgrade kits for older starfighters.
