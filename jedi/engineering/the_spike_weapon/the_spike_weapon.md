# Introduction
The spike was invented by Galactic Solutions Industries.
It was a giant cylindrical pulse hammer.
Its main purpose was for taking out military bases stationed below the crust of the planet it was deployed on.
However, this proved to not be effective as the weapon would unleash a very powerful pressure wave on the operators.
This meant that the weapon failed for what it was originally designed for.

# Section 1
Although the weapon may have failed in its originally planned way, it found a new purpose when it was discovered that it was suitable for digging into Rakghoul territory, usually underground.
It was deployed on Alderaan, in King’s Pass to deal with the subterranean territory, and was very effective in helping with expeditionary use for THORN.
It was redeployed on Tatooine in the Dune Sea and on Corellia when the plague resurfaced on those planets.
