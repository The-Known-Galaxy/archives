# Introduction

The Atlatl was a Gungan made throwing stick that was used to throw energy balls at a longer distance than what was capable with the naked arm.
It was made from a non-conductive hardwood and once finished, a ready to use Atlatl weighed around 1.5 kilograms.
The Energy Ball itself had an outer layer that would break upon impact.
This would release a plasma and electric shock, damaging the target.
By making the Atlatl out of non-conductive hardwood the wielder would not be affected should the energy ball break on the Atlatl.
While it did have a shorter range than other Gungan tools it was more precise, could be used as a blunt force weapon, allowed the use of an energy shield for protection and could be used to fish.
