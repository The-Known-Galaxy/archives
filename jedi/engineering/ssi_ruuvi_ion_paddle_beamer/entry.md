# Introduction

The Ssi-ruuvi ion paddle beamer, originally developed for medical purposes, became a formidable weapon in the arsenal of the Ssi-ruuk race.
This paddle-shaped device emitted a unique silver ion beam capable of stunning and disabling targets.
Its effectiveness made it a preferred choice for the Ssi-ruuk ground forces during their conquests.
However, its distinct properties posed challenges to conventional defenses, making it a formidable threat.

# Section 1

The ion paddle beamer featured a flat disc shape, designed specifically for the hands of the Ssi-ruuk.
The weapon was lightweight and could be easily operated with one hand, utilizing a control stick on the underside for firing.
Emitting a slender silver ion beam, the weapon targeted the nervous system of its victims.
Even a glancing blow could render an extremity numb for an extended period, while a direct hit could induce unconsciousness.
Its optimal range extended to eight meters, with a maximum range of twelve.
Notably, the weapon possessed the unique ability to bypass conventional shields and armor, presenting a challenge to standard defensive measures.

During the Ssi-ruuk invasion of Bakura shortly after the Battle of Endor, the paddle beamer played a pivotal role.
The Ssi-ruuk, driven by their quest for living specimens to power their battle fleet through entechment, relied heavily on these weapons.
Rebel forces managed to capture some of these paddle beamers during their resistance, but their incompatibility with conventional weaponry led Luke Skywalker to destroy the samples, freeing the enteched spirits that powered them.

Nearly twenty-five years later, as the galaxy was embroiled in the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Ssi-ruuk attempted another assault on Bakura.
However, their technology had not significantly evolved, and the paddle beamer remained fundamentally unchanged.
Despite the passage of time and the emergence of new threats, the Ssi-ruuk continued to rely on this weapon as they sought to reclaim Bakura.
