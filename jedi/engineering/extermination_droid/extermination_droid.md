# Introduction
The extermination droid was a class of droid at The Foundry which was a very old location owned by the ancient Rakatan.
They had many differences like some had two legs and some had four, some had a normal humanoid height and some were huge, some had guns attached to them and some had to be provided a weapon and other things like that.

# Section 1
They were brought to creation after Revan had been freed from imprisonment.
Revan hated all of the Sith and went to The Foundry after his freedom to commission an army of Extermination Droids to kill off the Sith.
Because of that Revan killed off 97.8% of the Sith Empire with the commander of the droids being the assassin droid HK-47.



# Section 2
The Sith Empire finally managed to take over The Foundry which had been constantly making droids for an extensive amount of time despite the huge amount of Extermination Droids protecting the installation.
The Sith Empire eventually rewired HK-47 and managed to control the droid army themselves.
