# Introduction
The hovering pram was a containment device that was used for the transportation of small, sentient beings such as Grogu.
It was first seen alongside Din Djarin on Arvala-7.
Djarin utilized it to continue the movement of Gorgu until they reached the Client.
However, when he returned to rescue Grogu, he could no longer use the hovering pram as he found it discarded in a nearby dumpster.

# Section 1
In need of assistance, Din returned to Arvala-7 to recruit the help of Kuii while on board the Razor Crest.
Growing tired of the temporary hovercrate to carry Grogu he commissioned Kuiil to add padding within the crate in order to increase the child’s comfortability.
However, he took it one step further and created an entirely new hovering pram which retained multiple characteristics of the original but created out of entirely metal.
This was used for the transport of Grogu until it was irreparably destroyed by Koska Reeves in order to rescue him from the clutches of mamacore.
