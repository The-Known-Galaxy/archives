# Introduction

The Fire Blade was an industrial cutting tool designed on the planet Dathomir to cut through the claws of the native Kwi.
Tools of this variety can be found almost anywhere throughout the galaxy, however, the Fire Blade became known as the bounty Hunter Dengarâ€™s personal melee weapon.

# Section 1

The Fire Blade gives off a small but bright red energy beam similar to that of a crimson lightsaber and is strong enough to cut through the claws of the particularly tough Kwi species, making it practical as a short-range melee weapon.
Due to its smaller hilt size, the Fire Blade was often used as a weapon for personal defense, particularly by miners.
