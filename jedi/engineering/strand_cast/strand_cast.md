# Introduction
Strand-Casting is a method of cloning in which the original genetic template has been mixed during the cloning process with the cells of other living creatures.
This method was designed to change the natural characteristics of a clone in whichever way the cloner wished.

# Section 1
It is unknown when the method of strand-casting was created, though it is known that genetic cloning has been part of many scientific experiments for over several thousand years.
The first we see of this specific method of cloning however is in the experiments of the Sith Lord; Darth Sidious.


Darth Sidious was obsessed with the idea of immortality, and so sought a wide variety of methods to preserve his own life.
One of these methods was through the creation of Stand-Casts.
Darth Sidious would attempt to clone his own genetic template so that he may pass on his consciousness and live forever.
However, due to the dangers and high failure rate of strand-casting, only one clone was ever moderately successful, and they were not Force-Sensitive.



# Section 2
Supreme Leader Snoke of the First Order was secretly a Strand-Cast experiment created by Darth Sidious and his followers.
Unbeknownst to most, Snoke was one of many clones but was chosen due to his ability to retain his Force sensitivity.
However, typical of all Strand-Casts there is a clear genetic disfiguration in Snoke’s skin and overall body.



# Section 3
Strand-casting is an extremely risky method of cloning, with a majority of attempts resulting in death or severe genetic disfiguration.
The few attempts that do succeed and live are always found with some form of genetic failure or flaw; for example, Darth Sidious’ clone lacked his force sensitivity.
