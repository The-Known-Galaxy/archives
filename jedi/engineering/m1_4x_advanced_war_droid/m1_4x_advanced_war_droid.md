# Introduction
The M1-4X Advanced War Droid was a droid designed by the Galactic Republic however during the prototype stages the project was abandoned.
Later in the Cold War a team of defectors from the Republic Special Task Force led by Captain Andrik saved one of the M1-4X Advanced War Droids and attempted to activate the droid on the planet Nar Shaddaa with the intention to use the droid against the Republic.
After learning this information, Havoc Squad was sent by the Republic to deal with the traitors.
Once Havoc Squad found the droid, they were ordered to destroy the droid.
Later down the line, the droid would be rebuilt by the SIS to serve with Havoc Squad.
During his time serving with Havoc Squad he was a part of many covert missions to take down high value targets such as the Sith Lord Kavos, and Colonel Rebus.
