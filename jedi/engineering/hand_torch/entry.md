# Introduction

A Hand Torch was a portable device that produced light and heat.
It was mostly used as a light source in darkness and tight spaces.
Other than itâ€™s portability as a light source, certain hand torches were also reportedly used to burn or weld items and metallic surfaces.
As such, hand torches were of significant importance in ship repairs and maintenance as well as movement on foot in dark environments.

Hand torches often took the form of long metallic rods with the light source found at one end of the frame, usually encased in some sort of clear material.
Due to their small size, hand torches could be used in cramped spaces with restricted mobility, hand torches could also be used to light up certain areas on machinery for further inspection.
Furthermore, some hand torches could also be attached to blaster weapons.
