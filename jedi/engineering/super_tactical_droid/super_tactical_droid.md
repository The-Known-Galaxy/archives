# Introduction
The Super Tactical Droid was an improved model of the T-series tactical droid, created by the Separatists during the Clone Wars.
The Super Tactical Droid was created to serve as a general and tactical advisor to the droid army and other generals.
They were programmed to resist interrogation and come up with the most logical strategy of the situation at hand.
The Super Tactical Droid model was unlike it’s predecessor, the T-series, as it was able to engage in combat when needed, whereas the T-series was easily defeated in combat situations.
A Super Tactical Droid named Kraken was assigned to be an advisor to Admiral Trench while at Ringo Vinda.
Kraken oversaw the capture of CT-5385, otherwise known as Tup.
He was later captured and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker attempted to interrogate him, but to no avail.
Kraken escaped with the Separatist Navy after the assault.
The droid was on Count Dooku’s ship and escorted Dooku to Coruscant, after Darth Sidious ordered them there.
