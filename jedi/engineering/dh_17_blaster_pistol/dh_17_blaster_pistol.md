# Introduction

The DH-17 (Produced and manufactured by BlasTech) was a ranged weapon primarily for shipboard combat and favoured by many planetary militias and even the Rebel Alliance.
It was medium range, and had an optimum range of 30 meters, it even had effective armor piercing bolts.
The blaster was a semi-automatic but could be modified to fire short bursts.
It had a low-powered stun setting and even an automatic fire setting, which could drain the power pack in 20 seconds but risk the shooter’s life by overheating the blaster to the point of exploding.

In the final years of the Galactic Republic it was used by the Galactic Republic’s Planetary Security Forces as their main sidearm.
After the declaration of the Galactic Empire of Palpatine, it was sold on the black market to the Rebel Alliance and made up the bulk of its weaponry.
Rebel Troopers were commonly issued the DH-17 because of its low price and durability which made it work on the planet Hoth.
It was also used by the crew of the Tantive IV.
It was also suggested that after the “Outbound Flight” it continued to be used by the Empire of the Hand.
