# Introduction
The DC-15x Sniper Rifle was a Sniper Rifle created for Clone Snipers in the republic.
The DC-15x was a heavily modified version of the DC-15A featuring a slightly longer sight and barrel.
It fires powerful blue, hyper ionized plasma bolts that are effective on droids and organic beings alike.
The ammunition capacity was reduced to five or six bullets per magazine.
In exchange, the bullets had higher firepower.
The DC-15x fires a single fire mode in exchange for intense firepower which is ideal for a sniper.
In the hands of a sharp shooter, it is proven to be very deadly and can one-shot anyone without protection from a shield or a barrier.
