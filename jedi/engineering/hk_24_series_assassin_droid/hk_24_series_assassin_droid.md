# Introduction
The HK-24 series assassin droids were a type of droid created during the Mandalorian Wars.
The Czerka Company built the HK-24 droids to resemble protocol droids, making them appear harmless while effortlessly eliminating their targets.
Despite being one of the deadliest droids of its day, the HK-24 failed commercially because there was no considerable demand for an assassin droid.
However, Arkoh Adasca, the CEO of Adascorp, later purchased the entire supply to aid him in his search for Arkanian Offshoot scientist Gorman Vandrayk.

# Section 1
The HK-24 assassin droids wore red durasteel armor plating and had orange optical sensors.
They appeared to be typical service droids, but they were engineered to be lethal with a blaster rifle, capable of quickly dispatching their targets.
They also had a utility vibroblade, which allowed them to specialize in chopping off limbs, making them an effective hand-to-hand combatant.
The HK-24's heuristic processor improved its learning and reasoning abilities, and its translation unit enabled it to comprehend millions of communication forms.
The HK-24's tough durasteel frame allowed it to withstand crushing blows from larger opponents, making it appropriate for security use.
It was, nevertheless, fiercely autonomous and despised cooperating with other HK-24 droids.
Infighting and insults occurred when several HK-24 units were gathered together, since each one thought itself to be superior to its fellow units.



# Section 2
The HK-24, which was mass-produced in anticipation of the Mandalorian Wars, was expected to be in great demand from the Galactic Republic and planetary governments.
Unfortunately, demand for assassin droids was much lower than expected, resulting in the HK-24's financial failure.
As a result, Czerka abandoned and closed its manufacturing facilities.
Despite their failure in the market, the HK-24 droids were purchased in bulk by Arkoh Adasca, CEO of Adascorp, and deployed in his search for Gorman Vandrayk.
Vandrayk was a crucial figure whose expertise was key to Adasca's plot to sell the services of exogorths, an enormous slug species, to one of the factions fighting in the Mandalorian Wars.
Vandrayk was discovered thirty years later by Adasca's Rodian aide, Eejee Vamm, and HK-24 droids were dispatched to track him down.
Although HK-24 soldiers cornered Vandrayk on the planet Ralltiir, they were finally annihilated when Vandrayk 
unleashed a swarm of gigantic exogorth creatures on Adasca’s ship, the Arkanian Legacy.



# Section 3
HK-24 Assassin droids served a variety of purposes, including assassins and bounty hunters, though their deployment drew criticism from organic hunters during the Mandalorian Wars.
They were also excellent for use as security because of their durable durasteel frame, which allowed them to withstand crushing blows from larger opponents.
However, their independent nature made them unsuitable for cooperative work.
Their heuristic processor allowed them to learn and reason, making them perfect for missions that required independent thought and decision-making.
