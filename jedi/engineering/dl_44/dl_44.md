# Introduction
The DL-44,  designed and produced by BlasTech (33 BBY), was an accurate, powerful and highly modifiable blaster pistol.
Its compactness but overall power made it a prime choice for many individuals and even groups, examples would be smugglers, bounty hunters and even the Rebel Alliance.
Since this blaster was popular with rebels, the Empire put restrictions on this model, causing many rivaling companies to release similar but weaker versions of their own.
