# Introduction
This lightsaber was made by a Dark Jedi, Yun.
After being allowed on Jerec’s flagship, the Vengeance.
A defenceless Qu Rahn stole Yun’s lightsaber so he could protect himself at least a little bit from Jerec’s Dark Jedi.
He was only able to divide Maw into 2 parts before he was struck down by Jerec.
Yun then continued to use his lightsaber in a intense duel with Kyle Katarn, taking it with him while fleeing away from the remaining Jedi.
When Sariss tried to assassinate Katarn after his noticeable crash on Ruusan, Yun used it to prevent her from doing that and he failed and died.

# Section 1
After Yun's death, Katarn took his lightsaber and killed Sariss, Boc Aseca and Jerec in an intense duel against each other.
He used it for many years, which led him to the Dark Side where his vision was clouded.
Yun’s lightsaber had a modified pistol grip onto it that didn't work very well but gave his index finger a nice rest.
Not just that but the grip was made with a certain type of metal that was much sturdier than average metal.
His lightsaber was quite customizable for anyone that wanted to modify it so it was very nice to the people that wielded it.
