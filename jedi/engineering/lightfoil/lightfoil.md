# Introduction
Lightfoils were considerably rare and small energy swords that were based on the lightsaber and were on par with their more well-known counterpart in terms of quality.
They were initially designed in secret by the Sith assassins of the Mecrosa Order, with small, elegant handles and a lightweight build that well reflected the single-handed usage of these blades.
Lightfoils were especially well-suited for those who studied Form II: Makashi.

# Section 1
The original lightfoils, also known as “archaic” lightfoils, saw most of their usage in the years leading up to the Great Sith War.
After the Cleansing of the Nine Houses and the decline of the Sith in the Tapani Sector that came with it, “modern” lightfoils started to see production.
These blades were relatively weaker than their archaic counterparts, mainly due to lesser focus on crystal quality and a lower level of craftsmanship.
However, these modern lightfoils saw usage by the non-Force sensitive nobles of the Tapani Sector as they did not require a connection to the Force in order to create them.
