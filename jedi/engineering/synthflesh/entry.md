# Introduction

Synthflesh was used to cover prosthetic replacements or enhancements for organic body parts.
This material imitated natural flesh, and looked undistinctive, so much so that it could also be used for disguises, it was capable of altering the shape of someone's nose, chin or cheeks.
Darth Vader was forced to use Synthflesh after his skin was burnt by the blazing lava of Mustafar, Synthflesh was used to cover his body but this caused a lot of itchiness and irritation on his body.
