# Introduction
ARC trooper armor was a type of armor made for the Advanced Recon Commandos during the time of the clone wars.
For a while, they used Phase 1 ARC trooper armor which was like Phase 1 Clone Trooper armor with additional gray armor plating, kama, range finder, ammunition pouches, double pauldron, and two small arms holsters.
Eventually, the equipment got upgraded and they were given a survival backpack with a prototype helmet that kept the fin from their old helmet along with the characteristics of the old uniform.
When the Phase II armor became standard issue for all stormtroopers, the equipment, and the unique helmet were replaced by the better, more modern equipment.
