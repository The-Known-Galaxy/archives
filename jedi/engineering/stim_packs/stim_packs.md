# Introduction
Stim packs were a medical device that was used all throughout the galaxy.
The Chiewab Amalgamated Pharmaceuticals Company and Athakam Medtech created the design of the tool together, which had a small utility tool and was attached to an auto-injection tube for the patient.
The main purpose of stimpacks was not to be a general use of medical equipment, but to act as a medication or painkiller when a med center was not available.
The device was carried by both soldiers in the field or citizens exploring untouched areas.
It should be noted however that stim packs have their own cons, the negative being that using the medication repeatedly with little time between doses will reduce the stim packs effect.
