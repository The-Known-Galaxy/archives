# Introduction
The famous Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas was noteworthy due to his weapon of choice: a humble walking stick augmented with the Force.
Despite being an expert in lightsaber construction, Vodo-Siosk Baas preferred to utilize a quarterstaff strengthened with the Force, similar to how the ancient Je’daii would imbue the Force into their metal swords to make them stronger.
Augmented with the Force, Master Vodo’s Quarterstaff was able to withstand lightsaber strikes that would otherwise slice through a simple wooden staff.
It was also capable of performing attacks far more powerful than a normal wooden staff.
His staff was roughly a meter and a half in length.
One end of the staff was wrapped in white fabric to allow a steadier grip.

In 3997 BBY, the staff was broken during a training session with Exar Kun, who utilized dual lightsabers.
When the power-hungry Exar Kun fell to the dark side shortly thereafter, he and his former master became destined to face each other once again.
Vodo-Siosk Baas managed to repair his Quarterstaff with the aid of the Force.
He would utilize it in his final duel with Exar Kun in the Senate Rotunda on Coruscant in 3996 BBY, where Exar Kun would reveal his newly-invented double-bladed lightsaber.
Unfamiliar with Exar Kun’s new weapon, Vodo-Siosk Baas struggled to fend off Exar Kun’s attacks.
The Sith Lord managed to break through the Jedi Master’s weapon, killing him.
