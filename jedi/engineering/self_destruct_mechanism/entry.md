# Introduction

A self-destruct mechanism is simply a system that allows an important craft or device to destroy itself in important circumstances.
It was often used as a last-resort defense for when somebody gets captured or is about to get captured, in hope of protecting important data.

# Section 1

After the Battle of Hoth, every single TIE fighter had a self-destruct mechanism installed.
In case they got captured, they could destroy themselves so there would not be important information lost.
When attempting to destroy a TIE, the power core will overload and explode, damaging nearby troopers and or other crafts.
