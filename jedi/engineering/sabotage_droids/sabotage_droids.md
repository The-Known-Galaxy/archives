# Introduction

Sabotage Droids were first used in the Clone Wars by the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS).
These droids were very expensive to make for the CIS, due to their High-technology equipment.
They would be used in several battles, for sabotage as their name suggests.
These droids were hard to detect because of their stealth field generators, added this they were also equipped with
Electrical prods to stun an enemy and bladed rotors as an offensive device.
