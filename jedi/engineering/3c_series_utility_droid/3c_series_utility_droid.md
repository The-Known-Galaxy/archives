# Introduction
The 3C-Series model of utility droid was designed and manufactured a few years prior to the Dark Wars.
In tune with most utility droids, it specialized in mechanical and electrical repairs, along with a sonar and radar scanner and a multi-function arm.
It’s main characteristics were a flat rotating head, an adjustable height of 0.96 meters (or approximately 3.14 feet) and a four (wheeled) leg movement system where the two frontal legs were placed on rotating joints attached to its blocky chassis giving it the ability to slide forward and backward lowering and increasing it’s height in the process.
It’s creator was the Duwani Mechanical Products.
This model was the predecessor of the T3-M4 model of utility droids and was used alongside it.
One notable C3-Series utility droid was 3C-FD which helped a T3-M4 droid with the repairs of the starship Ebon Hawk near Peragus.
