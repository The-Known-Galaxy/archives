# Introduction

Servo slippers were also known as Servo braces or Repulsorlift-assisted braces.
They were braces that can be placed on various parts of the body: joints, feet, legs, hands, and arms.
The technology of the braces was used to provide ease of movement in high gravity.
However, they could also be used in normal gravity conditions as medical devices.
Servo slippers helped people with impaired motor skills move easier.

# Section 1

Servo slippers were invented and developed by Mahled Medical Services.
MMS manufactured medical equipment to aid people who were movement-impaired.
The braces used muscle stimulators and movement servos to help the wearer move.
The device also contained repulsor compensators to hold up the body part supported by the brace.
Due to the high quality of the technology, the devices were expensive, costing 2,500 credits for a pair.
