# Introduction
The GEMINI Droids were a technological ingenuity created by the Iokath species; sentinel droids with feminine features able to communicate via a hivemind to operate the Eternal fleet, controlled by a GEMINI Prime.
GEMINI captains commanded the fleet's warships via a specific frequency, allowing them to transmit information to each other even after their physical droid body was destroyed.
It was during the civil war on Iokath when the creators drove the Eternal Fleet and GEMINI droids in Wild Space.

# Section 1
The GEMINI droid program was eventually captured by the Eternal Emperor.
His son, Arcann, succeeded him and launched the Eternal Conquest, an event that would make the super artificial intelligence SCORPIO aware of the existence of the GEMINI droids.
SCORPIO allied with the Eternal Alliance to stop the Empire by installing itself into the GEMINI frequency, a trap that would free the droids from the Prime's control and gain free will.
The Prime was what was used as the mold for new GEMINI droids as well as where all protocols could be over-ridden.
This led to some droids choosing to explore other versions of freedom, while others stayed with the Eternal Fleet.
SCORPIO surrendered the Eternal Throne to Vaylin after Arcann’s defeat, and it was now a possession of the Alliance.



# Section 2
The GEMINI droids, having free will now, were hesitant to face their opponent without fea.
In response to this, Vaylin rebooted the GEMINI Captain to its factory settings using a purifier drone.
Vaylin used this purifier drone to later as well, revive the GEMINI droids to their default programming, thus eliminating their free will and returning them and the Eternal Fleet to the command of the Throne.
Vaylin, in a turn of events, decided to use this to her advantage and destroy several Alliance strongholds.
One of these assaults eventually led to her death, causing the GEMINI Captains to revert to their primary objective - to destroy all sentient life in the galaxy.
The Alliance Commander was able to take hold of the Throne and have the droids under his control, further using them to find a hostile presence on Iokath.



# Section 3
However, a single droid, GEMINI 16, managed to avoid capture and still had free will.
Becoming aware that it was vulnerable to outside control, it was determined to destroy the Eternal Fleet and the GEMINI network.
With the use of another Iokath creation, Zildrog, it was able to gain control of the Gravestone, the only frigate that was able to destroy the Fleet.
Though successful, GEMINI 16 and Zildrog were then destroyed by the Alliance, marking the end of the GEMINI droids.
