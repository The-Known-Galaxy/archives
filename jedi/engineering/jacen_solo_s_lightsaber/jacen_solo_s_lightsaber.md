# Introduction
Jacen Solo’s lightsaber was a lightsaber used by Jacen Solo during the reign of the Jedi Order.
By the very young age of 13 years old Jacen Solo would be trained by Luke Skywalker on Yavin IV in the ways of the Jedi Order.
It was in the Praxeum that he along with the rest of the students constructed his Lightsaber.
The lightsaber was constructed how Jedi from many years ago constructed their lightsaber, the only difference being that the blade was powered by a Corusca Gem acquired from Lando Calrissian’s GemDiver Station.
Later down the line Jacen fought in the Yuuzhan Vong War with his friends and family by his side.
Jacen used his lightsaber against a Warmaster by the name of Tsavong Lah who was responsible for torturing his mother.
During a mission Jacen’s lightsaber was taken by a mysterious Fosh Jedi Vergere.
Later Vergere returned his lightsaber and Jacen continued to use it in the Dark Nest Crisis and the Swarm War.
