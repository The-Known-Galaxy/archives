# Introduction
The Tensor rifle was a highly regulated weapon of squib design, mainly manufactured by Amberlandrax Armaments.Its frame was based on a standard rifle design, consisting of a handle, a foregrip, and a weapon's barrel with a flared muzzle attached to it.
Additional modifications could have possibly been mounted on it.
Weighing around 7.2 kilograms (approximately 16 lbs) with a medium-sized body, the Tensor rifle was originally designed for use by squib hands.
Although its optimal range was up to 45m between the weapon itself and the target, it was possible to affect a target from a range of up to 450 meters.
The Tensor rifle could be armed with 15-50 charges/shots depending on the model used and its energy source.
If a power pack was used as an energy source, the Tensor rifle could fire off 15 rounds before having to recharge, if the rifle’s energy source was a power generator, its available ammunition could reach up to 50 rounds.
Due to its somewhat rarity and the tractor beam technology used as well as the energy source, its price bracket could be defined in the 10.000 to 15.000 credit range.

# Section 1
The aforementioned tractor beam technology was used in a certainly unorthodox way compared to its normal use.
Instead of being used to trap or move objects or starships, the weapon fired invisible but loud bursts of compressed tractor beam waves, on a level at which short term or extended periods of exposure to the weapon’s shots at a biological (non-artificial) target caused complete cell-destruction, eventually leading to death.
As previously stated, firing the weapon caused large amounts of noise, more specifically a sort of din, possibly alerting the target(s).
Furthermore, due to the shots being invisible to the naked eye, the rifle was particularly hard to aim.
All of these factors rendered using the Tensor rifle very hard if the user wasn’t specialized/trained in its use.
A more opportunistic use of the sound made by firing the Tensor rifle was getting the attention of someone.
