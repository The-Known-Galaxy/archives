# Details
Ajunta Pall was the greatest of the master summoners who fought in the Hundred-Year Darkness.
His inspirations came to him in rumors and dreams and only now in the minaret of Ziost does he realize it was the call of the Sith all along.
It is known that the Sith alchemists have had ages to perfect their art.
  Sith alchemy is applied to both the living and the nonliving.
Each is a distinct discipline of study, with the latter being better suited for new apprentices.
Alchemy on the nonliving is far simpler because there are no living cells to resist you.
This science is used to create amulets and enhance weapons.
Any object touched with alchemical science will become Force Sensitive itself, forever retaining a mirror imprint of its forger.
  Alchemy on the living is suited only for Masters.
The subject’s own Force energy will fight you as you twist and shape the host.
By recasting the shape again and again, you will get a Leviathan.
