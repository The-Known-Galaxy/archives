# Overview
Dark Illusion was a power that grew from the dark side of the Force.
Those who used this ability could manipulate a selected targets' Force visions.
To gain access to this ability, the user must go through an ancient Sith ritual.
This ritual required the user to have a Force-sensitive’s blood, while also maintaining a Force-bond with that user.
The user would then have to concentrate all of their energy into the bond so that they could compound the blood with Force Lightning.
Using this ability could cause the target to hallucinate certain individuals, both through appearance and sound.
Only one Sith can actually use this ability, with that being Darth Sidious.
