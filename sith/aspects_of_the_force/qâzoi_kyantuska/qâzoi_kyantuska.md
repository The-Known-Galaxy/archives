# History
Sith Acolyte Satal Keto displayed a physically taxing yet working mastery to mind control.
With his power, Keto telepathically took command of his Krath chaos fighters and turned them into living weapons to kill.
These suicidal pilots all met their demise under Keto’s hypnotic will, using their ships to crash into the opposing Republic forces.
Perhaps the most famous use of the mass mind control was by the Dark Lord of The Sith Order Exar Kun.
During the trial of fellow Sith Lord Ulic Qel-Droma, Kun stormed the hearing and mentally somehow froze the entire assembly except for Supreme Chancellor Sidrona and several others.
Kun grabbed the Chancellor by grabbing his head, and when Kun’s Sith amulet began to resonate with the Dark side, the Chancellor’s words were those of Kun- he was exerting his psychic control via direct physical contact.
When Kun was finished, he released his grip on Chancellor Sidrona, who then slumped down dead on the floor.
