# Overview
The Force scream was an exertion of the Force, usually involuntary, and was exhibited by individuals with a connection to the dark side of the Force.
However, it could also be used as a controlled ability by those who knew how to do it.
As the name suggests, it was a scream of strong raw emotions such as rage, frustration, or grief and amplified through the Force.


The ability was primarily done at a nearing loss of a Sith in battle, where the Sith would draw upon his emotions and the dark side to let out a scream that could trigger shock waves through the Force, causing catastrophic damage to those who happened to be in the radius of its blast.
It was in essence, a desperate and powerful attempt to turn the tide of a losing battle in most cases, but it could also be used to express triumph, such as when Exar Kun won his battle against the spirit of Freedon Nadd and let out an incredibly powerful Force scream, one so potent it could be heard light-years away.

# Notable Users
Although the ability is a staple for many dark side practitioners, one of the more significant ones who used it were Freedon Nadd, Exar Kun, the Sith triumvirate and Darths of the reconstituted Sith Empire like Darth Malgus or Darth Baras.
In later eras, following the rule of two, Sith who particularly fixated on their rage used the ability well like Darth Maul.
However, perhaps the most renowned user of the Force scream was Darth Vader, who famously and inadvertently used it as he let out a cry of rage, shame and grief upon learning of the death of his wife, Padme Amidala.
