# Overview
Ice Image gives its user the capability to see events unfold planet-wide, with clear perception.
It also gives the ability to monitor those you hold dear or the foes you’ve come across.
Developed by the descendants of Fallen Jedi on the planet of Kesh.
They’d monitor the Lost Tribe of Sith with this power.
This however wasn’t its only use; with little knowledge of the planet, they’d use the power to observe its fauna, any plants, creatures, or even civilizations.



Raising a crystal-like formed ice from the ground, the ice would display a somewhat reflective image, acting as a live camera the crystal would display in real-time.
Using the force they could change the view produced by the crystal.
