# Overview

Psychometry, postcognition, tai vordrax, or telemetry, are all names to refer to the same thing, a Force mental power that made its user capable of perceiving the history about the object touched and the people that had surrounded it.

# Description

This power made it so the user could view events as if they had been there at that moment.
That included everything, even the emotions of those that had wielded the object before.
The main disadvantage it had was that it was extremely easy to use in everyday used objects than in those objects that had only been used 2 or 3 times.
It was a great skill for explorers as it helped with tracking, however during a battle it wasn’t useful as an opponent's position constantly changes.
This power was extremely dangerous for wielders of the light side, as the usage of it in an object wielded by a dark side wielder could eventually make them fall into the dark side.
However, as a dark Side wielder, it was a very strong power, enough to even be used in living things and tear their minds apart.
The use of this technique on dead bodies was prohibited by the Jedi Council, as the emotions one had nearing his end likely paired with the dark side.
It was even more extreme during the time of the Invasion of Naboo, where the Jedi Order had their position questioned and the dark side was strong making it extremely easy for Jedi to fall to it if they experienced strong emotions.
Extreme cases caused the user’s mind to become trapped, and even rarer caused death.
