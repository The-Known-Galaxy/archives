# Overview
The force-bond is an ability obtained by force-sensitive individuals in which it would connect one force user with another allowing for contact and conversations face to face.
This ability would have no boundaries and would allow for a connection even at far distances.
If the bond was strong enough it would sometimes be capable of teleporting any kind of matter further displaying it as a useful skill to possess.
However, even when considering its advantages this ability would also be exploited by strong force users who sought to deceive and manipulate others.

# History
During the time of the Clone Wars, Darth Sidious and Darth Tyrannus would perform a dark ritual in hopes of breaking Jedi Grand Master Yoda’s will.
Tyrannus and Yoda would have their bond restored however it proved too weak to break Yoda’s will.
Sometime after the creation of the Galactic Empire and its significant rise to power, the young padawan Ezra Bridger would become psychically linked to Darth Maul which was a result of the merging of two holocrons.
The young padawan would occasionally experience a variety of different visions and hallucinations which lasted until Maul’s death.
