# Overview
Force Slow was a Force technique used by the Sith as well as the Dark Jedi.
Another variant existed known as Force Exhaustion which was used during the Cold War and the Galactic War.
This move could impair or even fully stop movement.
This ability was capable of stopping energy blasts, enemies, and items in motion such as physical projectiles or debris.
This ability would make the opponent's mind clouded as well as the body stop in its tracks.
With a powerful user and the right scenario it could be on the same level of power and utility as Force Affliction and Force Plague.
