# Overview

Deadly Sight was a force ability from the Dark Side of the Force that converted the user’s hatred and fury into deadly energy.
Everyone in the practitioner’s sight would get injured heavily, as it would cause blisters on the skin, and their extremities would be vaporized.

# History and Effects

Deadly Sight was a rare ability for both the Jedi and the Sith, but its use exploded in the last battles of the New Sith Wars.
As we know, for now, the only practitioner after Bane’s Rule of Two was established is Sariss, a Dark Jedi who used it in her duel against Kyle Katarn in 5ABY.

This ability could make everyone in the user’s field of vision burn and smoke while dying.
Although the Deadly Sight was tiring to sustain, it was effective in the right situation, allowing the practitioners to kill as many enemy groups as they wanted depending on their fury.
