# History/Uses

Force barrier was a neutral ability of the Force that was used for defensive means.
It was a barrier composed of Force energy and was used to block out destructive attacks.
Because it belonged to the same branch of Telekinesis, it aligned to any Force user.
This ability could also protect you from a poisonous gas because it couldn’t enter the barrier, once used in such a manner by Aayla Secura and Yoda.
Darth Vader would also use this ability often to protect himself from environmental dangers such as falling remains of terrain, stopping seawater from swallowing him, holding back explosions, and blast fire.
As said, this ability could hold out even explosions, shown once again by Kanan Jarrus using a force barrier to save his crew from dying by such a cause.

While fleeing from the Fortress Inquisitorius on the planet Nur, Cere Junda used the ability to avert Darth Vader’s lightsaber from wounding her and Cal Kestis.
He managed to wound a bit of the barrier until they escaped.

In 9 ABY, a member of Yoda’s species used the technique to defend and deflect a pressure wave of fire from an Incinerator trooper.

In 35 ABY, Kylo Ren used a version of this ability to stop a bowcaster bolt.
After those events, he used the Force barrier during his ship crash on Pasaana and another time when he was with Hux, which in all instances left him both unharmed.
