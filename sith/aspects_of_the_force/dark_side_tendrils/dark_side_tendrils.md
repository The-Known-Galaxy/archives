# Overview
Dark Side Tendrils were malevolent manifestations of the Force summoned through Sith magic.
This ability could only be executed by a Sith Sorcerer and required full concentration to work.
Besides being powerful and hard to conjure, these Tendrils raised from the ground as a black mist to later transform into tentacles that swarmed and attacked their victim, annihilating them instantly.

# History

Almost a thousand years later in 11 ABY, Jedi Kyp Dorrun summoned Dark Side Tendrils with help of the ghost of Exar Kun against Jedi Master Luke Skywalker.
