# Overview

Inertia is a force ability that allows its user to amplify their body’s momentum, using the force to redirect your movement in unpredictable ways.
This enables its user to execute seemingly impossible stunts.

# Physics

Inertia in physics, is a property that continues in its existing state of stillness or rest, and also its default motion in a straight line.
In other words, Inertia, is the inability to change its motion unless manipulated by an outside force.
If we stand still or move forward in a straight line, it is our Inertia, but if another force, such as wind or friction, is added to the equation, it may cause our bodies to move in an unexpected way.

# Force

Inertia is used for many aspects of combat or movement.
Running on ceilings, walls, or even water are all involving Inertia.
Inertia was also commonly utilized in Combat.
One combat use was first recorded by Darth Bane, it is to redirect what looks like a lumbering charge forward then turning that into a hooking lunge.
Darth Bane stated that Inertia, “(...) can surprise an enemy by making your moves unpredictable.”
Inertia has always been a Sith aligned ability, as it was invented for the sole purpose of beating your enemy.
However, some Jedi would attempt to use this.
For example, Jedi Master Quinlan Voss attempted Inertia, he recorded, “No way I’m trying this.
\[...\] Okay, tried it.
Dislocated my shoulder.” This account tells us that Inertia is difficult to master, as even a Jedi injured himself attempting it.
