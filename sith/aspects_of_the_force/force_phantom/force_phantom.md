# Description
Force Phantom is a Force ability that allows its user to create a creature using the Force.
The creature was a servant of its creator, fulfilling any wishes and tasks given to it.
The appearance of a Sith Phantom is very similar to a Force Ghost, which made many Jedi get tricked into thinking that a Phantom is one.
It was an ability used by Dark Side users and required a powerful bond with the Force, strong will, and a considerable mental reserve.
Every Sith Phantom is connected to something that is real, alive, and possibly even far away.
Force Phantoms were mostly to harass and spy on an enemy of its user, spying was an effective way of using a Force Phantom, the creator of it could use it from far away.
The Force Phantom force ability was developed by Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vectivus.
Later on it was re-discovered by Sith Lady Lumiya.
Force Phantom was similar to a Dopplegänger, a Force Ability developed by the Jedi.
