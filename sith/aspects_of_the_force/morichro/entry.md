# Overview

Morichro was a very dangerous technique utilizing the Force.
This ability would stop someone's bodily functions for a long period of time.
Some Jedi Masters used this technique but by future Jedi Knights it was considered an off limits ability.
This ability is close in nature to the Force Trance ability, which would suspend bodily functions such as breathing and the beating of heart.
If the user was to use this ability upon themselves they could stop themselves from succumbing to death by starvation, dehydration or even asphyxiation.Though this ability can be highly beneficial to oneself it could also be highly damaging if used against an opponent.
Morichro could be used to subdue your opponent none-fataly but if left unchecked could permanently put them in a coma or even kill them.
Surprisingly practitioners of the Dark Side of the Force never used this ability due to the fact it needed less than a malice intent.
Notable users of this ability included Jedi Healers and Jedi Master Yaddle who was the most recognised practitioner of such an ability.
