# Introduction
Force flight is a manifestation of the Force that allows its user to travel to different destinations by levitating.
It is a very efficient way for a Force-user to travel.
Force flight is a great addition to its user's dueling style, granting him more mobility and speed.

# Description
The Dark Jedi Maw was an iconic user of this technique.
Maw after getting his lower body destroyed by Jedi Master Qu Rahn in a duel was able to move around, and fight using this technique.
Even without his lower body, Maw remained a skilled duelist because he knew the technique of Force-flight.
Some notable Sith that used this technique are: Darth Vader, Darth Sidious and Darth Thanaton.
