# Description
Force blinding was a telekinetic light side power.
Although it was a light side power, it was utilized by dark Jedi Yun and Dark Mara.
Upon use of this technique, a blinding flash of energy is generated from the user’s hand, manifesting as a flash of light causing blindness for a temporary amount.


Because of this technique, the Jedi used this to defeat their opponent quickly with said ability.
The only way to perfectly counter force blinding was by training yourself with force sight and unleashing it before they use their ability.
