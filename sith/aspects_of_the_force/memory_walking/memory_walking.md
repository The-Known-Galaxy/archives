# Overview
The use of this Ability was to torture people.
The casters would make the victim relive all of their trauma, even if it was only a little.
They soon realised that once someone had undergone such torture, they would have a very small but significant increase in efficiency and intelligence.
This ability, due to its effect on people was called Torture by Chagrin.

# History
Torture by Chagrin was a Force ability that was used over the millennia by few Dark Side groups, including the Order of the Sith Lords.
It consisted of mentally reaching into the victim's mind and forcing them to relive their worst memories.
The victim would experience their most painful and embarrassing memories, causing them physical pain.
This ability was used by Darth Wyyrlok III in his duel against Darth Krayt in the Battle of Yavin, and again by Darth Maladi and Cade Skywalker in the world of Wayland.

Discovered by the Sorcerer Rokur Gepta the subjects showed a slight increase in intelligence and efficiency after being tortured.
He believed he could make Lando Calrissian last for several weeks before the gambler's mind finally snapped, and he died.
Fortunately for him, a squadron of Renatasians attacked, distracting Gepta long enough for him to execute a plan to escape.
