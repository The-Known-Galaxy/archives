# Overview

Force Repulse was a telekinetic ability in nature and held no alignment to either side of the Force.
This ability built on the foundations of the Force Push and amplified it to cover 360° around the user and to greater effect, staggering or knocking back anyone caught within the zone of attack.
Unlike its basic counterpart, the Repulse manifested physically as a wave of distortion in the atmosphere akin to ripples in the air or a small sonic boom.

# Application

Force Repulse could be used both offensively and defensively, it can drive off multiple attackers in the event of one being surrounded or obliterate a squadron of fodder enemy forces given the intention of the user.
Alternatively for an attack, one can hurtle vast amounts of debris or upturn the ground beneath them to uproot an opponent.
No matter the technique at play both those adept in the Light or Dark can use this ability to great effect.

# Practitioners

Savage Opress - In 20 BBY Opress demonstrated this ability whilst attempting to flee Darth Tyrannus’ flagship after a failed assassination attempt, in his attempt he was met with heavy resistance from armed droids who surrounded him and opened fire, Savage attempted to defend against the assault, yet was unsuccessful and received multiple blaster wounds.
All was not lost for Opress however, by tapping into his pain for strength Opress unleashed a Force Repulse and incapacitated the droids before fleeing and escaping on a nearby ship.
Starkiller - The clone of deceased apprentice Galen Malek refined the Force Repulse over his training into a much more destructive force.
Using his unimaginable power in the Force, Starkiller was able to reach a point where his repulse would disintegrate any organic matter and obliterate anything inorganic if he wished for it to be so.

Obi-Wan Kenobi - In 22 BBY Kenobi utilized a basic yet powerful version of the Force Repulse to obliterate the bounty hunter Durge from the inside after being absorbed by the bounty hunter in a final bid for victory.
