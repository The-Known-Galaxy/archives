# Overview

The act of transferring consciousness between bodies touches on a subject that still troubles many Sith Alchemysts.
The patterns that define each mind can be stored in the pneuma field (an important part of the Sith Alchemy, which includes the alternation and control of the conscious mind), but these patterns degrade almost instantly if they are not anchored in a new biological form.
The speed of this degradation is so rapid that it seems to render the argument for life after death moot.

All beings are afraid of oblivion.
Every culture has written fables to assure themselves that death is not the end.
Even the Jedi do this.
Through midichlorians, they believe that they have a connection to the universeâ€™s fundamental energies that others do not.
Therefore, Darth Plagueis was reluctant to dismiss their histories too rapidly.
During the Great Sith War, Jedi combatants were said to have vanished at the moment of their deaths, with the cells of their bodies sublimating into energy.
It must be noted that although many Darth have witnessed the death of Jedi, none of them have ever witnessed this phenomenon.
Some of these Jedi were said to have returned as pure consciousness, communicating specific and verifiable information to the living.
Ghost stories are so common they are laughable, but the pneuma leads many Sith Alchemysts to believe that such a thing is possible.
