# Overview
Control Web, Known by some witches as crawlers perch or guiding net.
This certain force ability was known by The Nightsisters of Dathomir.
To make this powerful ability you would need several Nightsister to make a web to control everything that lies underneath the web.


In the year 43.5 BBY, Most of the Nightsisters used this ability while the clans Raining Leaves and Broken Columns met so they could make the clans into a big unstoppable one.
The Night sisters were not okay with the all-male tribe's broken columns joining the witches of Dathomire.
To prevent the unification they made a Control Web and had all spark flies attack the clans and later sent 30 raincores.
Thankfully Luke Skywalker was at the conclave and found the Nightsisters and killed them.
Some of the night sisters were taken by the Sith and they tried to make the sisters teach them the Control Web technique.
