# Introduction

Force Fear is an aspect of the Force that is used by the Sith and the Jedi that has the tendency to the dark side.
The wielder of this ability would expect the victim to cower defenselessly, or outrightly run away from the wielder when it is used.

# Description

Force Fear was one of the dark side abilities that was used in 4000 BBY, with wielders being both the Sith and the Jedi that had a tendency for the Dark Side of the Force.
The wielder that uses the Force Fear on the victim would strike into the victim’s deepest parts of the mind, drawing it out.
This would cause the victim to shake uncontrollably, while the victim’s capabilities would be subject to degradation.
The wielder could use the pure force of will, and this causes the victim to lose their courage, and if the victim cannot defend their mind, the effects of Force Fear would cause them to feel depression rapidly, with the ever growing of their hopelessness, and filling the victim with a sense of regret.

Force Fear was then classified as an ability of the Dark Side, which is why the Sith and the Jedi that contained the tendency of the Dark side oftenly used it.
However, the Jedi usually use this ability in order to diffuse an escalated situation.

This ability is basic compared to its advanced variants, Force horror and Force insanity.
Force horror had an ability to cause multiple targets to enter into a catastrophic state of panic, with the full concentration of fear and more powerful compared to Force fear, with the victims finding it difficult to defend against unlike the Force fear.
The another variant, Force insanity causes the multiple targets to be driven into agitated madness, degrading their state of mind as they descend into a complete helpless state, feeling nothing but full scale of hopelessness.
