# History/Uses

Force deflect was an ability of the Force that could deflect energy-based attacks like blaster bolts and force lightning.
This ability was used as a form of both defensive and offensive fighting.
In 239 BBY, Jedi Master Porter Engle fought a group of Nihil on the planet of Elphrona.
During the battle, Engle threw his saber at a raider, before he could go get his weapon, the other raider fired at him and he was forced to deflect the shots with the ability.

In 22 BBY, Jedi Grand Master Yoda was fighting with Darth Tyranus in the hangar on the planet of Geonosis.
Darth Tyranus fired a blast of Force lightning at Yoda.
He deflected the blast back at him, only for him to use the Force to deflect the blast into the ceiling.
On many occurrences, Yoda managed to retaliate force lightning with force deflection.

Sometime later, Ahsoka Tano confronted the Sith Lord Maul in the Grand Salon during the Siege of Mandalore.
Lady Bo-Katan Kryze was with Ahsoka and charged at Maul while firing multiple blaster shots which he easily changed the direction of the blaster shots with the waves of his hand.

In 18 BBY during the Invasion of Mon Cala, the Sith Lord Darth Vader was fighting in the battle of Dac City.
During the skirmish, the planetary defense services fired upon him and he used the Force to deflect a blaster bolt.
In 14 BBY, Governor Wilhuff Tarkin stated that it was difficult to kill Vader since he was capable of deflecting blaster shots with the flick of his wrist.

In 0 BBY, Vader was on the star cruiser, Profundity in the search of the Death Star plans that were stolen.
He cut through the soldiers that were in his way and used Force deflection to block and redirect a blaster shot back at the rebel who shot it.
His mission failed either way because of the plans managing to escape on another rebel ship, Tantive IV.
