# Description
A Force user could create an exact copy of themselves; the clone was known under the name of a Dopplegänger.
The Dopplegänger would be able to do anything, even fight, but it would live a short amount of time.
Mastering this ability would make a user be able to create a Force Illusion and a Force Phantom.
A Force Phantom is really similar to a Dopplegänger, but the difference between them is that the Force Phantom was more of a Dark Side ability, and the Force Phantom was something different than the user’s appearance.
The Force Sensitive is able to control all acts of the Dopplegänger and even use the Force with him.
The technology which is included in droids can detect a Dopplegänger.
Some of the users of this technique were: Darth Tyranus, Jedi Master Yoda, Luke Skywalker and Xesh.
