# Introduction

Essence transfer, sometimes referred to as transfer life or transfer essence, was a dark side of the Force capability that allowed one to transfer their essence into an inanimate item or another living person.
Several Sith Lords, particularly those from earlier eras, used this ability to repeatedly evade death.
They typically had a backup copy of themselves on hand in case their body were to change or expire.
But if the person in some way failed to capture their target, they would have no more attempts and would be transported to Chaos, the Sith equivalent of Hell.

Karness Muur, a master of many forms of Sith alchemy, was among the first Sith Lords to learn this method and craft a talisman.
There is only one documented instance of this talisman unsuccessfully possessing a victim entirely, Celeste Morne, but it could take possession of any other victim who wore it.
When he died, he would transfer his spirit into the talisman and take on any victim who made contact with it.

Sith Emperor Vitiate had also perfected the ability, allowing him to live for more than a millennium by typically transferring portions of his essence to numerous victims throughout his life.
If it became necessary, he also employed this power to independently manage his Voice and the Children of the Emperor.
He was also capable of simultaneously controlling thousands of bodies.
He captured most of the Imperial outposts and some of the Republic troops that gathered at Ziost during his onslaught in 3637 BBY, and after he depleted the planet's surface of life, he consumed their essences.

Exar Kun, the head of the Brotherhood of the Sith, refrained from using his power to possess bodies in favor of imprisoning his spirit inside a Massassi Temple on Yavin IV after his ally Ulic betrayed him during the Great Sith War.
This kept him alive and driven to insanity for more than 4,000 years until his spirit was unintentionally let out and engaged in combat with the New Jedi Order.
In the end, Luke Skywalker annihilated him utterly in 7 ABY.

When Darth Bane found the holocron of Darth Andeddu, an additional ancient Sith Lord with exceptional transfer skills, he became conscious of this power.
During a confrontation with his apprentice Zannah, he believed that his pupil was too weak to take his place, and they proceeded with a duel.
Fortunately, Zannah's Sith magic helped her overcome him.
He suffered severe injuries, and through transfer, attempted to grasp her in an attempt to take control of her.
She was able to evade his powers, though, and his spirit ultimately vanished into the void.

Darth Plagueis, who mostly sought to remain immortal in his own body, had found this ability and was currently researching it to understand its power.
However, he wanted to use it very carefully.
Unfortunately, though, Plagueis was finally slain by his pupil, Sidious, before he got to use it.

Sidious, one of the last known Sith Lords to wield this talent and the most prominent in its use, survived the Battle of Endor following his first death at the hands of Anakin Skywalker in 4 ABY by transferring his spirit into a clone.
The duration of each time he assumed a body deteriorated, allowing him to occasionally shift bodies.
