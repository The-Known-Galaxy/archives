# Overview

Force empathy is, as given away by the name, a form of empathy that is reliant on the Force to detect and understand the feelings and emotions of other individuals.
Those whose emotions were being ‘read’, in a manner of speaking, were not required to have any connection to the Force, which allowed for Force empathy to be an incredibly powerful weapon if applied to galactic politics.

# Description

There is little documented history behind the use of force empathy, potentially because it was never seen as substantial enough to warrant research or because it was found so valuable that no one wanted to risk it being discovered and abused.
While most individuals who could utilize force empathy could glean into the most basic feelings of the individuals they used it on, a small number of force sensitive individuals were capable of pushing it much further, such as Anakin Skywalker, Darth Sidious, and Jaesa Willsaam.
They could look past simple emotions and use the Force to understand the motivations, wishes, fears, desires and secrets.
This made force empathy incredibly powerful; it could be used to manipulate anyone who was not Force sensitive without their knowing.
Jaesa Willsaam had such an aptitude for Force empathy that she was able to predict how people were going to act and what they were going to do.
Anakin demonstrated his skill in force empathy when detecting his mother’s pain, allowing him to locate her on Dantooine.
Force empathy could also stretch beyond understanding a person.
There was the potential for those particularly adept at force empathy to begin to use the force to control emotions, which could be disastrous if that power was placed in the wrong hands.
It was necessary to keep a clear mind and heart when using Force empathy, as clouded judgment could render the ability ineffective, which could lead to disastrous results.
