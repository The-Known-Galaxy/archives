# Introduction
Alter Environment is a way of manifesting the Force by manipulating nature.
With this ability, you can create things such as Force Whirlwinds, and fogs.
The Alter Environment manifestation needed a mastery of basic force abilities, such as Force pull and Force push, since it relied on them.

# Description
With the Alter Environment force skill, you could manipulate temperatures.
The temperature manipulation could be used in combat to freeze your enemies to death or light them on fire.
You could also manipulate air pressure with this, which links this ability and the Force push together.
With Alter Environment its user could manipulate lighting in a majestic way which could let anyone with this skill mastered win any fight.
This ability may work on a larger scale too, those who are born strong with the force may use this ability to manipulate places, we could even say planets.
That is what happened to Dromund Kaas, the Sith Emperor used this ability to corrupt its environment.
This manifestation of the Force is a powerful power that could be used in monstrous ways to destroy, but with this, you can also create.
In the wrong hands, it is very dangerous.
