# Overview
The Spell of Concealment is a Sith spell that allows the caster to hide or cloak the presence of multiple individuals including themself.
This ability was used by Darth Zannah, the Apprentice of Darth Bane.
Zannah used this spell to sneak up behind and impale Echani weapons on Jedi Master Raskta Lsu.
Zannah also employed this technique to hide herself and her Master in a secret compartment within Caleb’s house on Ambria.
It was said that Darth Zannah’s Spell of Concealment was so strong that the effects lingered for years after its use.
These remnants were powerful enough to violently disrupt the psychometry of Darth Cognus when he attempted to read Caleb’s Hut.
