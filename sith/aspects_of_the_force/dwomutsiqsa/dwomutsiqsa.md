# Overview
The Dwomutsiqsa was an ancient Sith Incantation that would summon the Smoke Demon, a being made entirely of smoke which would take the form of the Victim’s worst fear.
The ritual to summon this manifestation of the Dark Side was written on Sith Scrolls, where it would show how to invoke the demon, step by step.

When read by an imprudent Sith, the spell released a malevolence as a safeguard against those who wanted to know the secret of the Sith Scrolls yet were unfit to handle the knowledge within them.

# A Brief History
Sorzus Syn once found a Sith Scroll whichshowed the Dwomutsiqsa on the planet of Korriban.
In one of his reports regarding the Sith Species, she wrote a partial translation of the Dwomutsiqsa detailed in this scroll.
