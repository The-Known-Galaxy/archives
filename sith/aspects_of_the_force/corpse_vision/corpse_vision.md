# Overview
Corpse vision was a Dark Side force ability falling under the category of Sith Magic.
This ability drew upon the power of the Dark Side to conjure visions that would alter corpses into illusions of one’s loved ones or those the victim shared relationships with.
This ability could do no physical damage to an opponent yet was highly effective at affecting an opponent's mental state by playing on one’s fears and regrets to temporarily incapacitate them with illusions.

# Application
The application of this ability was very rare among the Sith, having only one historical usage.
This was in part due to the high amount of power required to cast this ability and the requirements needed to do so.
This, therefore, meant that less taxing and convenient techniques were more suitable and effective.
For one, the target needed to have such regrets and losses in the first place for the technique to reach its full effect.
Moreover, in its one historical usage, the technique was so complex that its practitioner required the assistance of numerous Force Spirits of deceased Dark Lords to be able to cast the ability.
Furthermore, the nature of the ability renders it useless for close combat situations where the preparation of the very skill could result in being cut down before it is even being cast.



# Practitioners
The first recorded usage of Corpse Vision was in 23 BBY by Darth Tyrannus who used the technique with the help of the fallen Sith Lords on Korriban to conjure visions to haunt the eight-strong Jedi team who were on the planet to hunt two infamous criminals.
Tyrannus aimed to halt the Jedi to allow him to seize the opportunity to meet and ally with the two criminals.
The ability in its use was a great success as it subjugated the entire Jedi force to visions in that some were unable to shake off without external help.
One such individual being Padawan Anakin Skywalker who suffered heavily at the vision of his mother conjured by Tyrannus, becoming unable to free himself from the visions torment without intervention from his master, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
