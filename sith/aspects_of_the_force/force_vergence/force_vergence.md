# Overview
Occurring naturally, Force Vergences were high concentrations of Force Energy within an object, person, or place.
They often cause those who were Force Sensitive to experience heightened interactions with the Force such as visions and glimpses into particular memories.
Individuals with more training in wielding the Force can use them to enhance their powers.
Both the Jedi and the Sith sought out Vergences and established shrines and temples on locations thought to be Vergences or nexuses while objects thought to be Vergences were used as talismans.
The only known individual suspected of being a Vergence was quickly taken in by the Jedi Order.

# Known Instances
Both the Sith Shrine in the Depths and the Jedi Temple on Coruscant were built around a Vergence known as the Sacred Spire.
  
       Other Jedi Temples built near Vergences include the Temple on Ilum, the Temple of Eedit, and the Temple on Lothal.


Some Vergences that had a strong connection to the Dark Side of the Force are the Cave of Evil on Dagobah, the Sith Cave on Mustafar, the Mirror Cave on Ahch-To, the Well of the Dark Side, Korriban/Moraband as a whole, and the Valley of the Dark Lords.
 

       It is said that Mortis, the Chasm on Ushruu, and the Wellspring of Life are also Vergences.
Aleen, Iktotch, and Exegol were all suspected to house Vergences, the latter of the three being excavated by the Sith in hopes of discovering the rumored Vergences.


There are only few known objects that are recognized to be Vergences, which are the Skywalker Lightsaber and the Bardottan Sphere, with them both being the source of Vergence-like traits and behavior.
