# Introduction
Force storm was a dark side force power wielding the potential to create hyperspace wormholes, even within the galaxy and spacetime itself.
These storms were capable of shifting various objects across the longest of distances, containing so much power that the ability could reign havoc and destruction upon the surfaces of planets as well as any other structure, terrain, or objects in its vicinity.
Not only that, but this power served to act as transport across the galaxy and time itself, providing users with the chance of advancing themselves throughout time.
Only those that possessed an extreme mastery of area, control, and alteration of The Force could use this ability at their leisure but their control over the storms was extremely hindered.
Force-sensitive beings that lacked the mastery to summon force storms through their will could turn to the usage of the Darkstaff, a Sith artifact with sentient nature able to create these same force storms that generated hyperspace wormholes.

# Applications
The first usage of this riveting force prowess dates back to 1900 BBY when the Sith artifact known as the Darkstaff was constructed and used during the battle on Almas by Darth Rivan.
This artifact wielded the power to create these wormholes in space through the usage of The Force.
Once in the possession of Darth Rivan, the staff would begin to drain his Force energy and as a result, created a force storm that obliterated Rivan’s armies.
Rivan on the other hand, who also fell victim to this maleficent phenomenon was forwarded further into the future where the Light and Darkness War took place between the Brotherhood of Darkness and Army of Light.
Due to the rather unfortunate events that transpired, Darth Rivan would meet his demise at the hands of another force-sensitive being involved in the battle.
For the next generations to come, the destructive ability would not be seen for quite a long period of time.
It wasn’t until Darth Sidious devised a way to summon these wormholes entirely through means of his prowess in the Force.
In 10 ABY, Sidious unleashed a series of storms across the galaxy within a multitude of star systems in order to transport Luke Skywalker, along with the rest of his rebellion to Sidious’s fortress on Byss.
After sending out yet another storm to the Republic Fleet, his connection to the Dark Side was severed by Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa by using Light Side energy.
Darth Sidious would ultimately lose control of the weapon of destruction he crafted and was engulfed by the storm which vanished moments after doing so.
The whereabouts of everything that happened to be demolished by the storm were unknown.
Within history, the only users of this ability were the Darkstaff, Darth Sidious, and his Dark Side Adepts.
The Darkstaff was the only notable user in history that was capable of utilizing force storms with utter control.
