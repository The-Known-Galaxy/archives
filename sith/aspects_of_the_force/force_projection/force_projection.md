# Description
Force Projection is one of the hardest Force abilities to perform.
It requires full concentration and a strong bond with the Force.
This ability allows a Force user to manifest in a place from very far.
Force Projection is very similar to a Force Phantom, however, the Force Phantom is more of a Dark Side ability.
Force Projection was used by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker during the Battle of Crait.
During that battle, Luke was located on the planet Ahch-To, but he managed to use Force Projection and manifest on Crait.
The Jedi Master caught the attention of the First Order, causing them to start firing at him, but that still did not affect Luke’s Force Clone.
Luke used so much energy by performing that skill, that he passed away right after Kylo-Ren’s tries to kill him.
