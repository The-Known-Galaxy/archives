# Introduction

Force lightning was an ability that Force users could manifest through the dark side of the Force.
It could eject electrical energy from the user’s hands that could cause severe pain on the opponent, disfigurement, and even decomposition.
In some cases, the potency of this ability was so powerful that the victim’s skeletal system glowed and could be perceived through their skin.
Darth Sidious was one of the most notable users who used this ability, showing a great example of how powerful his ability can be after he disabled the ships in the Citizen’s Fleet from a great distance.

# Countering

This ability could be deflected and countered with a lightsaber or with the ability of Force deflection, but only for a short while.
This was proved by Jedi Master Yoda using Force deflection to deflect it and Jedi Master Mace Windu and Rey deflecting Darth Sidious’ lightning.
Because Rey deflected the dominance of his force lightning, it led Sidious to his demise.
Even any personal energy shield could protect against the ability, such as the gurgan shields.

# Prohibitions/variations

Although Jedi could use it, using it was prohibited by the Jedi Order and its members.
The ability had at least four color variations: blue, green, yellow, and red.
Darth Sidious and other notable users like Rey, Snoke, and Darth Tyranus had the blue to purple variation which was the most common one.
The Nightsisters’ force lightning was green because of their shadow magic while Son and Darth Vader had a red lightning color showing a portrayal of the side they were on and the emotions they embraced.
Yellow lightning was acquired alongside being utilized by Darth Momin.
