# Overview
Force Crush was a Force ability that originated from the Dark Side of the Force, being a derivation of the ability known as Force Grip.
Force Crush was known primarily for its violent form of usage and execution, barely being used by the Jedi, as only a bare few used this technique only against droids, however it was a common ability to be used by the Sith on every being.
The way Force Crush was executed towards an objective was by first using the ability of Force Grip by lifting the target into the air using the Force, then the body of the target will begin to implode as it's being crushed by the Force while it is lifted in the air.
This ability was most commonly used against droids specially for the Jedi, since it was more appealing to their code, however the Sith frequently used this technique not only on droids, but living beings as well since it bringed a lot of pain to the person suffering from said ability.

This ability was mostly used by the Jedis during the Clone Wars, since most of their enemies were battle droids, they usually didn't hesitate on using it since many of them didn't see the droids as living beings.
It was also believed that Force Crush worked more easily on droids than on living beings since they were more fragile to crush than a person.
