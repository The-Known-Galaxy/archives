# Overview
Force walking was an ancient technique of the Sith that was capable of binding earthly-tethered ghosts to the caster to grow their strength.
It was invented by the Sith Lord Ergast, who attempted to fabricate the rituals performed by Tulak Hord when he devoured the spirits of those who opposed him in his conquests.
Instead, Ergast made another and arguably more powerful ritual, which he named Force walking.

# Description
Force walking itself required incredible willpower but once a Sith bound a spirit to themselves, the effects were rewarding as they could draw upon the ghost for Force energy.
However, Force walking had a catch.
If a user bound a more unwilling ghost to themselves, the user could draw more power.
But if the ghost was more willing, it could draw more from the user.
Many Sith mastered this ritual and quickly rose to prominence, but also quickly faded into obscurity.



# History
One person would defy this fate and become an incredibly powerful Dark Lord of the Sith, recognised and respected by many whether servants of the dark side or soldiers of the military.
This person was told that he had a unique pull among ghosts by the spirit of his ancestor, one of the many contributing factors to how he would become a master at Force walking.
In an attempt to gain as much power as possible to triumph Darth Thanaton,

Lord Kallig sought out how to bind Force spirits to himself, learning from the spirit of Ergast before binding his spirit.
The Sith Lord would go on to take the spirits of Darth Andru, Kalatosh Zavros, and Horak Mul.
But Ergast neglected to inform Lord Kallig that it was only possible to bind one spirit as any more would destroy a person's own self, which caused Kallig to seek out a cure on Belsavis and Voss before he was able to properly control his newly gained power.
With the strength of four ancient Sith, Kallig won against his opponent and rose to the title of Darth Nox.
It is unknown what happened to the spirits after they aided in the defeat of Thanaton.

Some sources claim that they were set free.
Others say they found peace, but most historians agree that Darth Nox continued to keep the spirits bound to his soul for his own gain.
