# Introduction
Force Stealth was a Force ability that allowed its user to hide his Force alignment.
Force stealth would result in the technique’s user not giving any signs of presence in the Force to surrounding Force-sensitives.

# Description
Force Stealth was used by powerful force users, only ones strong-in force could use it.
We could say that the most powerful user of Force Stealth was Darth Sidious, Sidious kept himself hidden with this ability which allowed him to not be detected by the Jedi High Council.
Force Stealth is one of the reasons why Sidious didn’t get detected and why his plan did not fail.
 It was used mostly during and after Order 66, where Jedi that survived the purge would use it to not get detected by the Galactic Empire’s forces.
 A good example of this was Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Kenobi was a Jedi Master who was one of the Jedi that survived the Great Jedi Purge and used Force stealth to keep himself hidden.
Force Stealth is a good skill to use while infiltrating a place, like when Xanatos managed to infiltrate the Jedi Temple with this ability.
