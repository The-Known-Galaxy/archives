# Overview

Battle Sense was a Force ability only accessible by determined Force practitioners, assumed to be used by both students of the Light and Dark Side of the Force.
After strenuous months of training with an opal Tasar crystal, a user could utilise it in battle.
These stones were native to the planet Tasariq, and its people dumbfound about the exact powers they unlocked, some believing they had healing magic.
The main perk of the power was enhanced intuition, which benefited a time of planning at the start of a battle.
Notably, this skill was used in its Ta-Ree variant on the planet Kathol by the Ascendant, which sought to manipulate the Force with technology to eliminate the Sith.
Still, it required them to master the Ta-Ree spells, Detect Life and Sense Danger, before learning Battle Sense.
Due to its similar name, it was commonly mistaken for Battle Meditation during conflicts, which is a different ability that increased the mental will of allies while reducing that of its enemies.
