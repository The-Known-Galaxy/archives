# Introduction
Midichlorian Manipulation was a form of Sith Alchemy that could only be used by the wisest Sith.
One of those Sith was Darth Plagueis, a Sith Lord that has mastered the art of Sith Alchemy and Midichlorian Manipulation.
He used his talent to bring back people to life, and also heal them.

# Description
Darth Plagueis could use this ability to make a creature give birth without a second partner.
This is how the chosen one, Anakin Skywalker, started his life.
His mother, Shmi Skywalker did not have a partner, and because of the Midichlorian Manipulation used by Darth Sidious, Plagueis’s apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen one was born.
Plagueis said that a child born with this technique would be the embodiment of the Force.
As said, the ability to reincarnate with this Force power was possible.
An example of this is Darth Venamis, Darth Plagueis killed him many times and has brought him back to life, causing a lot of pain and suffering to him, Plagueis did it many times, but with time, he couldn’t be revived, and faced death.
Later in the story, Darth Sidious has manipulated Anakin by telling him about this ability, which made Anakin desire to learn about Midichlorian Manipulation, the desire with time led him to the Dark Side of the Force, making him take the name of Darth Vader.
