# Introduction

Shatterpoints were a series of intricate fault lines within a person or object.
Those highly disciplined in Force mastery or born with natural talent in the Force were able to sense these fault lines through the Force regardless of their allegiance, specifically noting actions that produced the makeup of what was presented before them.
With this knowledge, users of this technique were capable of targeting the weaker points in order to “shatter” whatever challenged them.

# Application

The ability to influence shatterpoints comes in the form of both physical objects and events.
In a physical manner, a Force user could spectate an object through the usage of the Force and see the history of how the said object was constructed, more specifically, the weak points of the object.
This would allow the user to shatter the object into multiple different pieces due to their ability to identify and alter the fault lines of an object, even the strongest materials known within the galaxy.
Users were also capable of perceiving shatterpoints through different scenarios by using the Force to identify the different actions and people within them, taking note of how these factors came together to create a said scenario.
Due to this, it was possible for one to see all the vulnerability represented through the actions that had transpired.
From there, a decision could be made regarding what actions seen from the fault lines are the best ones to take in order to break the shatterpoint.

# History

Usage of this ability dates back to 3653 BBY during the Cold War, this power would be used by both Sith and Jedi throughout the war.
Mace Windu, a Jedi Master during the Clone Wars that was most known for this technique, was able to see the different shatterpoints in Darth Sidious during their battle.
He sensed the connection between Sidious and Anakin, recognizing the faults in their connection, that very shatterpoint being Sidious’s faith in Anakin.
In other words, the weakness within Darth Sidious that Windu perceived through the Force was the foul chancellor’s trust in Anakin that would lead to his downfall.
