# Overview

Battle Meditation was a Force ability that was used to influence armies and fleets during conflicts, wars or battles.
This ability allowed them to perform at their best and could also be used to reduce the opponent’s combat effectiveness.

This ability wasn’t exclusive to a specific faction, because the Jedi and the Sith used it.

# Dark Side Practicioners

The Dark Side of the Force used another variant of the Battle Meditation, which was called the Sith Battle Coordination by the Dark Lady of the Sith, Lumiya, but later identified as Sith Battle Meditation by Darth Caedus.
The most notable practitioners of the Sith Battle Meditation are: Sith Lord Skere Kaan during the New Sith Wars, Bastila Shan during the Battle of Rakata Prime in 3956BBY, Grand Admiral Nial Declann during the Battle of Endor, Emperor Palpatine, Darth Caedus during the Second Battle of Endor, and Joruus C’Baoth.
