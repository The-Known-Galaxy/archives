# Introduction

The Force Blast is a Force Ability primarily used by the Sith and other Dark Side Users.
The ability consists of projecting concentrated blasts of pure Dark Side Energy at whatever the user is aiming at.
This tends to cause extreme amounts of damage to anyone or anything that it connects with.
Using one’s hands as a point of projection, someone using the Force Blast would focus the concentrated Dark Side Energy into their hands and be able to throw it at their targets.
Due to the immense power that pure Dark Side Energy has, the Force Blast would cause the user damage as well for the first few times that they used it.
The damage would usually consist of burns to the hands but with no feeling of pain due to the amount of energy flowing through the user.
The power of the Blast could be enhanced if the user was in possession of a Sith Amulet.

# Origins and Notable Users

The origins of the Force Blast can be dated back to 3998 BBY(Before the Battle of Yavin) when Ommin, the King of planet Onderon at the time, used the ability to fight back against two Jedi Knights that were sent to free a Jedi Master from imprisonment.
Catching the Jedi off guard with the unknown power, Ommin had the upper hand against the Jedi until one of the Jedi, Ulic Qel-Droma, sliced Ommin’s armature, an exoskeleton that Ommin used to move around.
Without the exoskeleton, Ommin could no longer move and crumpled to the ground.
Another user of the ability, Exar Kun, gained the ability to use the Force Blast when the spirit of Freedon Nadd guided Kun to a Sith Amulet.
Exar Kun used the newly gained power to destroy Freedon Nadd's spirit.
Even though the Force Blast had damaged Kun, Kun enjoyed the use of the power and would continue to use it commonly against his enemies.
During the Second Battle of Empress Teta when Kun stormed the Krath Palace located in Cinnagar, Kun clashed with Sorceress Aleema Keto.
Keto shot a Force Blast of her own at Kun.
Kun blocked this and sent back an even stronger Force Blast that sent her across the room.
As a Force Ghost, Kun would use the Force Blast ability to kill one of Luke Skywalker's younglings, Gantoris, for not turning to the Dark Side.
