# Overview

Cryokinesis was a force ability that allowed its user to draw heat away from an object, person, or organism, causing its temperature to drop rapidly and drastically.
This arcane technique causes the heat vitality of the victim to suddenly rupture.
The subject would become cold to the touch, shrouded in ice, and incredibly brittle.

# Body

Darth Bane’s teaching system was separated into 3 schools, or focal points.
Body, the second school, encompasses the abilities that draw from the living Force.
The premise of Body was to draw on the user’s own cells and then use that to alter or affect the physical structures of others.
Most notable from this category was Force Lightning, Life Drain, etc.
Darth Bane stated, “The demands of the Dark Side can ravage the flesh, but fortunately it is possible to balance the scales by siphoning life from another to bolster your own.”

# Darth Bane

Cryokinesis is heavily aligned with the dark side of the force, in fact it is most likely exclusive to Sith.
Darth Bane was one of the only Sith to ever master this ability, and not only that but he passed it onto future generations with his famous teachings.
Unfortunately, Cryokinesis got lost somewhere in the swarm of generations.
Regardless, Darth Bane made a comment on this specific ability, he described it as  “A siphoning of essence that leaches the life intensity from another, leaving behind a first-shrouded corpse”.
The strange thing about this comment is the keyword leech.
Although Cryokinesis, in a way, drains the life force of an individual, it doesn’t absorb another’s heat into your own body like most other Body teachings do.
Cryokinesis is a means to completely ruin your victim, not to bolster your own vitality or strength.
Also, unlike its name, Cryokinesis doesn’t allow you to manipulate ice or cold air from your fingertips, the power itself instead freezes another’s body from the inside.
