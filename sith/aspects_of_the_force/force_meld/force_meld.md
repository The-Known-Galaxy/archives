# Description
Force Meld, otherwise known as Battle Meld was an ability that was often used by the Jedi, but it can also be commanded by the Sith.
Force Meld was a refined technique compared to Battle Meditation, which would allow the Force users to connect with another Force user, allowing themselves to draw power from each other.
When this ability is used for a prolonged amount of time, the Force users will be able to finish each other’s thoughts or sentences.
This can be oftenly be seen as a form of telepathy.
Force Meld can also destroy a mind of Force users and any that was involved, as to maintain a singular form of ego without killing or destroying any individual's minds requires great amounts of power and a deepened state to the Force.
This ability oftenly was focused on coordinating and improving the Force-sensitives of the user’s side.
