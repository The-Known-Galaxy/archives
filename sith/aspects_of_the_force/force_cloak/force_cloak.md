# Overview
The Force Cloak which was sometimes referred to as Force Camouflage was an ability not often seen due to the requirement of having to bend Light and Sound Waves.
This Force Ability would render the user invisible to the naked eye.
As such, this ability allowed users to sneak into enemy territory, carry out assassinations, and going in restricted sections.
This move was mostly used by the Jedi before the Galactic Empire arose, but it was also used by the Disciples of Twilight, a force-sensitive group of individuals stationed on the moon Dyspeth.
The Force Cloak should not be confused with Force Blank, an ability which caused a Void in the force.
This technique of Force Cloak was mainly practiced by force-sensitives ever since the old days of the Republic.
Practitioners would photo-kinetically call to the force to bend light itself and even sound to render oneself invisible.
This skill can come to people who are naturally strong with the force, trying to learn it through normal study can be a very difficult process though.
Force Cloak was also known to deceive droids and subvert other force abilities.
This ability was commonly used by Anakin Skywalker and his fallen apprentice Starkiller.
