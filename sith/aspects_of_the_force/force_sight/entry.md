# Description

Force sight was a force ability that was a variation of Force Sense.
This technique enhanced the user’s visual perception, allowing you to see in the dark or even behind walls.
This technique was reliable to people who didn't have eyes or seemed to be blind, a perfect example of this would be the Miraluka species.
They mastered this technique and because of this, their reflexes were greatly strengthened.

This technique could perfectly counter the abilities of Force persuasion and Force blinding.

Although the ability is an attribute to the Miraluka species, its version could likewise be taught to other species but there’s a catch after being taught.
If utilizing the version of the ability to such an extent, their eyes would deteriorate after disuse.
