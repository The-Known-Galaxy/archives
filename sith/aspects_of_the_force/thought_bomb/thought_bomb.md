# Overview
The Thought Bomb was an ancient ritual from the Dark Side of the Force capable of annihilating every Force-Sensitive caught in its blast radius.
The Thought Bomb could only be used as a last resort for victory, and only those who were really strong with the Force would have a chance to survive.

# Origins
Even though the Thought Bomb is an ancient Sith ritual, its origins are found in the Ritual of Nathema, which saw the Sith Lord Vitiate perform a Dark ritual to eliminate the presence of the Force from the planet of Nathema.
The details of the ritual were discovered during the Jedi Civil War by Darth Revan and were hidden in the Temple of the Ancients in Lehon.
Said details were discovered by Darth Bane in 1000BBY, who later gave them to Sith Lord Skere Kaan.



# The Incantation
To create the Thought Bomb, many Sith Lords who were considerably strong with the force were required to attend.
The Sith Lords had to make a circular formation and hold their hands to chant an incantation that would channel the Force into the center of the circle.

During said incantation, the Sith Lords' minds were united and consumed by the formed vortex until everyone was transformed into a single entity and the ambient temperature dropped significantly, making the attendees’ extremities frost, etc.



# Users
One of the most known users of the Thought Bomb is Sith Lord Skere Kaan, who used it against the Army of Light after seeing he and his army were being defeated by the Republic fleet.
Sith Lord Vitiate also used it in the Ritual of Nathema.
