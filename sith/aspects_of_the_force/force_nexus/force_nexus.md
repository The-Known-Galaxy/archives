# Overview
A Force nexus is a name given to areas where the Force in the environment or its aspects such as the dark or light side were exceedingly powerful in its presence.
Force nexuses were usually the consequence of an action, ones that usually involved being the final resting place of the bodies of Force wielders or being the place that tethered their spirits to the physical world.
Members of both Sith and Jedi were well aware of the existence of nexuses, the former usually seeking to harness the energy there for themselves.
It should be noted that if an item was left in a Force nexus and exposed to the energies in it, it would eventually be imbued with a special ability such as being able to withstand certain plasma-based Force abilities.
It was possible that if the nexus was of a certain aspect of the Force like the dark side, the item that was empowered from the nexus would be unbearable for those who followed the light.

# Notable examples
Korriban, the original homeworld of the Sith species and its Valley of the Dark Lords was a powerful Force nexus of the dark side, mainly due to the innumerable amount of Sith Lords buried and entombed within it.

In Dagobah, there was a Force nexus known as the Dark Side Cave which was the final resting place of a powerful unnamed Dark Jedi.
When he was struck down, his energies were absorbed into the cave which birthed a nexus strong in the dark side.
Those who entered in search of answers would often experience visions that would either have them receive a great epiphany or be traumatised from the experience.

In Wild Space, close to the Unknown Regions, Odessen was a planet strong in both the dark and light sides of the Force, maintaining an equilibrium of both.
It was the place that Grandmaster Satele Shan exiled herself to in repentance after the Eternal Empire dominated both the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.

What many believe to have been the most powerful Force nexus in the history of the galaxy, the Valley of the Jedi was the site of a battle between the Brotherhood of Darkness and the Jedi Order with the support of the Republic.
It had become a Force nexus due to the trapped souls of over a hundred Jedi and Sith as the result of Lord Kaan’s thought bomb detonating and confining them.
It was a virtually inexhaustible well of power and Jerec, a Dark Jedi, engulfed some of the dormant energy and became nigh-godlike.
However, he was killed by Kyle Katarn, a Jedi who would free the tormented trapped souls of the valley and allow them to finally rest.
