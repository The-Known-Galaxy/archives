# Description

Force dash was an ability of the Force that allowed its user to increase their agility for a brief amount of time.
Because of this ability, it allowed the chance to dodge attacks or strike quickly with great ease as the entities around them were in slow motion.

Those skilled in this ability could use it to run on vertical surfaces shown by Jedi Jocasta Nu and even move at a greater pace, displayed again by the Second Sister.
