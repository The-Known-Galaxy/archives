# Overview
Force Rage can go by many names, such as Dark rage, Force Enrage, or Force Fury and it was a Dark Side Force ability.
The way this ability works is by using their anger to convert it into immense strength, speed, endurance, etc.
This Force ability wasn’t just anger, it could be fear, pain, and hate.
The power boost this ability would give you came with a major risk; being weakened for a while as the rage faded away, leaving you vulnerable to enemies.
On top of that, the rage continued to harm the body if the user was to use it for a long time.

This ability is to be used with caution, especially when it comes to Light side Force-users, as, the rage may consume them and turn them to the Dark side if not dragged out of the grasp of the Dark side by external measures.
Only a small portion of capable Jedi can master such an ability without being consumed by the Dark side.
Additionally, there is a chance that the ability’s wielder falls into extreme mental and physical problems in an instant.

# Notable Practicioner
Darth Malgus was one of the practitioners of this ability as he used his emotions to fuel his power of the dark side, be it anger, disliking, or any of the negative feelings that he had.
It was often used to close the skill gap between his enemies, which makes him a ferocious user of this ability.
