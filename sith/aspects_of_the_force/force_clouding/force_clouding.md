# Overview
Force clouding is a Force ability employed by the Sith to disguise themselves as Dark Side users to the Jedi and other users of the Force.
Force Clouding works with the wielder using the ability to pull their dark powers into themselves and adopting a mask of manipulation to disguise themself from any Jedi.
This mask of illusion would let any Sith who has mastered the ability to go out in public without the people in the Sith surroundings knowing whether or not they are a Sith or just a normal person.
By blocking their connection to the dark side of the Force, Sith Master and their Apprentice would be able to interact with the Jedi when necessary and without ever getting caught as Sith due to the Force Clouding.

By concealing their identities with Force Clouding, Darth Sidious was able to manipulate the Jedi into thinking he was but only a regular man and take over the government of the planet Coruscant.
Due to the fact the senate was close with the Jedi, Sidious had much inside information about the Jedi hidden from the Sith, and finally, once he had the information he needed Sidious was able to execute the plan the Sith had all along and from then on was the Rise of the Galactic Empire.
