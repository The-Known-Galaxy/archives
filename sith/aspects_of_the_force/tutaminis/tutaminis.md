# Overview
Tutaminis was an umbrella term used for force abilities that involved energy absorption and deflection.
In a broader sense, Tutaminis was the ability to absorb potentially harmful heat and energy sources through the user’s bare hands and diffuse it or channel it for another use.
The ability was taught to more or less every Jedi during the days of the Galactic Republic and was expected to be perfected upon graduation from the academy, wielders of this ability developed the skills around it over a lifetime.
In addition, it was not strictly for use by the Jedi; every force-sensitive organization practiced Tutaminis, including the Sith.
While Tutaminis was usually used to absorb impact from blaster bolts or lightsaber blades, more advanced use of Tutaminis allowed the wielder to absorb other Force powers, such as Sith lightning (as famously demonstrated by Jedi Grandmaster Yoda), heat, and even microwave and electromagnetic radiation, such as gamma or alpha rays.
Tutaminis users could also use the absorbed energy to heal their own wounds, describing the ability as a “non-harmful Force Drain”.
