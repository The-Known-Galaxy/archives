# Overview

The Ceremonial Rally is a event that happens every time at the end of the month.
It is hosted by the Dark council, specifically the Overlords of spheres.
There are lines that are sorted by spheres - the members must go in rank order within the line.
Where present, each sphere's Overlord will be there and announce each member's name, giving them awards one by one.
There are Dark Council marks and Prestigious recognition.
For the Dark Council marks, you can get Mark of Activity, Combat Prowess, Mark of Dark Knowledge, Mark of Leadership or Mark of Loyalty.
For the recognition rewards, you can get Defender of the Order and Dark Lord's Favor.
If there are Lord promotions or major promotions, the Dark honor guards will go to the Dark Council chambers and set everything up so the people can enter.
The Dark Council and Hand of the Dark Lord will start to line everyone up behind the doors of the chambers, proceeding with the ceremony that is set up and wait for someone to be announced.
After everything has happened, the Dark council will bring people onto the stage and take questions.
