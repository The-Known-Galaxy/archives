# Overview:

The Academic Alliance is a collection of members from the Jedi Order’s Librarian’s Assembly and members from the Sith Order’s Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, both being the respective groups of each Order dedicated to writing.
It originated on the 5th of November 2022 from multiple conversations, all beginning with JennyBean’s request to both the Librarian’s Assembly and Ancient Knowledge to fulfil a set of goals involved with the development of the Known Galaxy.
Loremaster Lord daedima contacted Chief Librarian CannonMalvern regarding the topic, and the Jedi Master had the idea of making a collaboration between the Librarian’s Assembly and Ancient Knowledge.
Jenny was onboard with the idea, leading to daedima’s creation of the server, inviting Cannon and Jenny.
The server quickly grew with Loremasters and the Inner Circle of Ancient Knowledge joining alongside the members and high ranks of the Librarian’s Assembly; within a few hours, Jenny had Vermened and TiberiusMalvern join.
Ownership of the server was transferred to Tiberius, but the project had two high ranked members of each group oversee the whole thing apace with Jenny.
The project is used for one group to communicate with another in regards to making stories for the Known Galaxy and assist the developer team by being assigned tasks related to lore.

The Jedi leadership of the Alliance since November 6th are ValSenko and CannonMalvern.
The Sith leadership of the Alliance since November 6th are LuciferTemenos and daedima.
