# Overview
The system known as “Three Orders” was based on the presence of three centralized Spheres of Influence, with one “Order” division under each - therefore, only three spheres with three Orders.
This system was extremely similar to The Jedi Order’s three council system: 
The Librarians’ Assembly manages the Jedi Archives and serves under the Council of First Knowledge, like the Order of the Loremaster managed the Sith Archives and served under the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.
The Jedi Assault Team is an elite fighting division and serves under the Council of Reassignment, like the Order of the Immortal acted as an elite fighting division under the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy.

This system was around for about two months: from the initial Order of the Loremaster’s creation on the 5th of March to the removal of all Orders on the 8th of May.
The three Orders were introduced in the following order: 
-Order of the Loremaster on the 5th of March
-Order of the Oracle on the 18th of April
-Order of the Immortal on the 19th of April 
Whilst all three were decommissioned on the same day.

# About the Order of the Loremaster
The Order of the Loremaster was under the jurisdiction of Sith Philosophy and led by Chilimeni.
It was a small organization with ranks and duties very similar to the ones of the current Ancient Knowledge.
The sphere itself managed to deliver a good amount of articles weekly, although wasn’t very demanding to allow its members to focus both on the Order and the Sphere of Sith Philosophy at the same time.

Other than some inactivity, the biggest issue of the division arose when the rank of “Sith Curator” was introduced in the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.
It was the new Inquisitor specialization, which meant that if an Inquisitor wanted to advance in the Sphere of Sith Philosophy, the Inquisitor in question would’ve been forced to join the Order of the Loremaster as well.
This caused many issues as many members simply wanted to host trainings and had no interest in article writing.
Not only that, but the requirements to become a Sith Curator were also considerably difficult, leading to less Inquisitors wanting to advance in the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and a Curator shortage.
To compensate for the shortage, later on, members outside of the Order of the Loremaster could contribute by writing articles as well.

Overall it was a very open and functional division, although it suffered from understaffing and management issues by the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.
Perhaps if re-introduced today with the larger number of members in the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and a different organization more similar to the Sith Academy, it could be functional, but it cannot be said with certainty.



# About the Order of the Oracle
The Order of the Oracle was under the jurisdiction of Laws & Justice and led by Morsaki.
Despite its short duration, it was a very united and tight-knit division: it had extremely passionate leaders and active high rankings; in particular, the sphere’s leader Morsaki, being the former Overlord of the disbanded Sphere of Mysteries, had great amounts of experience in the sector.
It was said to be a much more hands-on division than the current Sphere of Mysteries, often being seen in-game rather than working in the backlines to gather info.
Despite the passion put into it by its leaders though, the Order of the Oracle had severe issues regarding activity.
The new members of the Order tended to lose interest in the Order over time, leaving it understaffed.
There were also some communication issues, as the Order wished to communicate the found intel to the group as a whole, but had to go through the Sphere of Laws & Justice first as it was their jurisdiction.

Overall, the Order of the Oracle was a small yet welcoming Order which is still remembered fondly by all of its members.



# About the Order of the Immortal
The Order of the Immortal was under the jurisdiction of Expansion and Diplomacy and led by ChillPain.
Defined by the leader himself as “A big family”, it was a fun and enjoyable division, although it had extremely strict entrance requirements.
It began as a small division but gained members at a good pace over time.

Unfortunately, by the time it had enough members to begin conducting major raids, the Orders were all shut down.
The main issue of the division itself was how high the bar was set for its members: on average, when a tryout for this Order was hosted, out of 10 attendees only 1-2 passed.
Although, those who passed truly were the finest duelist The Known Galaxy could offer at the time.
Those who passed would also get personal lessons and the Advanced Combat Manual.

All things considered, the Order of the Immortal was a fun and extremely challenging division for the short while it existed.
It is unlikely that this Order would return the same with the new combat system that’s less skill-based than it used to be, although Expansion & Diplomacy has already begun a Sith Immortal program to reintroduce elite fighting attachments again.



# Analysis of the system
First and foremost, the main reason this system was adopted in the first place was mainly to respond to the decommissioning of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, Sphere of Mysteries, and Sphere of Defense & Security.
It is easily noticeable that the logos of the three orders are, in fact, the same ones as the three aforementioned spheres.

Such a system did have some substantial advantages: 
-High similarity to TJO’s council system, allowing members to transition between the orders seamlessly if needed.

-Being able to divide the duties of each sphere more evenly.

Albeit, also some disadvantages: 
-The heavily centralized spheres still had an array of duties too wide to administer properly.

-The fact that each Order was under the control of a single sphere greatly reduced its interaction with other spheres.


Whilst not the greatest system, overall, it generated three communities which all shared three qualities: small size, high specialization, and above all always warm and familiar.
