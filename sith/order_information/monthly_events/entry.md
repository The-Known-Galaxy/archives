# Overview

In our order there are three different monthly events made to test your creativity, skill, and even your sense of style.
Hosted monthly, each one of them guarantees a special title for the duration of the month, along with plenty of other interesting prizes.
These events are known as “Lord of the Drip”, “Wrath of the Dark Lord” and “Artificer of the Dark Lord”.

# About "Lord of the Drip"

First hosted on the February 5th 2022 at 2 PM ET, by the Overlord of the Sphere of Laws & Justice Darth Havok, better known as OmegaVanquished.
Today it still stands as a very appreciated and fun event that’s hosted monthly.
Since its creation, Lord of the Drip has always been in the hands and jurisdiction of the Sphere of Laws & Justice.

The event consists of an outfit competition.
There are three different “themes” the participants must base their outfits off of.
The themes aren’t actually restricted to the Star Wars Universe: there may be themes like “Cyberpunk”, “Halloween” or even “Wild West”.
The three themes remain completely secret until they are revealed throughout the event.

The event structure is usually as follows: it begins with all participants lining up and waiting for the event to start.
The first theme is revealed, and all participants are given a countdown of usually 15 minutes to update their roblox avatar and build their outfit.
As a result this obviously makes it pretty hard to participate in the event without a vast collection of roblox items or robux.
Nevertheless, after the countdown ends all people respawn and line back up to be judged one by one by a team of 3-4 judges, usually L&J members, who shall give a 1 to 10 vote to the outfit.
Then, the cycle is repeated for the second theme, and then for the third.
In the end, all votes are summed up and the one who has obtained the highest score is crowned “Lord of the Drip”.

The winner receives a unique role in the Sith Order’s discord server, and before the rewrite, the title would also show in-game.
Since the 3rd of April, first place in Lord of the Drip would also determine a prize of 1,000 robux, although after the 2nd of July, the prize was changed to 7,500 in-game credits for lightsaber hilt customization.

As of today, the most proficient participant to Lord of the Drip is Chilimeni, having gotten the first place in Lord of the Drip twice, being the only one to have done so.
ChillPain is also a very proficient participant, having arrived at the podium three times in total.
Additional users who won at least once are: JeruShiro, Gh0stOrigin, Skahtos, Vulcan_Volcano, and Youngboyboosie.

# About “Wrath of the Dark Lord”

First hosted on the February 12th 2022 at 4 PM ET, by the Overlord of the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy Darth Lividus, better known as TaitusTemenos, is one of the most competitive and difficult events hosted monthly.
It is managed by Expansion & Diplomacy, although this doesn’t prevent the sphere’s members from participating.

The event consists of a 1v1 elimination tournament.
It is quite similar to The Jedi Order’s “Duelist of the Order”, or the event “Duelist of the Galaxy” in which both orders participate.
The event is restricted to Adept+, regardless of sphere.
All participants must register themselves about a day before the event.
After the registrations close, the tournament brackets are organized and published, this way everyone can see who they’re going against before the event starts.
The title of “Wrath of the Dark Lord'' actually originates from a special rank that existed in The Sith Order before Vermened became the Dark Lord, and signified being the second-in-command of the whole group.
It used to be held by KentuckySquid.

The event per se is pretty simple.
All participants join the game and wait for their turn to fight.
When it comes, they enter the dueling area and fight a best-of-three duel to pass to the next stage.
Those who pass advance to the next duel, and those who are defeated are eliminated.
This continues until there are only two contenders: in which a final duel decides the true Wrath of the Dark Lord.
The loser of the final duel occupies the second place, and the third place is defined by an extra duel between the two losers of the semi-finals.
Of course this event has changed a lot throughout the months: map changes, combat system changes, new forms being added… There are plenty of variables, but this still remains a fairly accurate way to prove one’s proficiency in combat.

The winner receives a unique role in the Sith Order’s Discord server, and before the rewrite the title would also show in-game.
Since the 11th of March, first place in Wrath of the Dark Lord would also determine a prize of 1,000 robux, although after the 25th of June, the prize was changed to 7,500 in-game credits for lightsaber hilt customization.
Additional benefits of winning the tournament consist in being an honorary member of the Dark Lord’s Powerbase (although technically not in the Dark Council), and access to expanded boundaries on Dathomir.
Not only that, but those on the podium often get a DC | Combat Proficiency accolade and some even gain access to the prized Advanced Combat Manual.

As of today the most proficient participant to Wrath of the Dark Lord is ChillPain, having gotten the first place in Wrath of the Dark Lord twice in a row.
Vandradtica is also a very proficient participant, having arrived at the podium three times in total.
Additional users who won at least once are: Esociety, Vesparum, keys14, and Chilimeni.

# About “Artificer of the Dark Lord”

First organized on the February 13th 2022, by the Overlord of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy Darth Praefectus, better known as xLiamint, is a more relaxing and laid-back event focused on creativity, and is organized by the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.

The event consists in a free submission of any creation, which is usually about the Sith Order: music, writing, art, edits, and more are all valid submissions.
Once the event is announced, a channel in the discord opens for submissions, and after a week they are closed to be judged.
After the first, second and third place submissions are decided upon by the Inner Circle of Sith Philosophy, they are announced.

The winner receives a unique role in the Sith Order’s Discord server, and before the rewrite, the title would also show in-game.
Since the 11th of March, first place in Artificer of the Dark Lord would also determine a prize of 1,000 robux, as well as one month of Nitro Classic to the second place, although after the 10th of July the prize was changed to 7,500 in-game credits for lightsaber hilt customization.

As of today, the most proficient participant to Artificer of the Dark Lord is Aathic, having gotten the first place in Artificer of the Dark Lord twice.
Brolion1 was also a very proficient participant, having arrived at the podium three times in total.
Additional users who won at least once are: Stalechite, Stellarch, 6lkingpoint2, and HissingScorpion.
