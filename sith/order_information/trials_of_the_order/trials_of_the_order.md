# Introduction
The Order's Trials are a set of challenges that you must complete before entering either the Knighthood trials or the Advanced Knights trials.
When  completing those tasks, your education and  time spent will prove if you are worthy of taking the trials, passing them, and unlocking new ranks.
Individuals who are ready to progress on and work hard towards their goals can be identified by the trials themselves.
Even though our order only has two trials, they are harder than one another and are divided into two groups: the KT trials are for apprentices, while the ASK trials are for Knights who will be capable of advancing into their Advanced Knighthood.
The two trials in our order can only be taken by the levels of Apprentice and Knight, though a current ASK may be exempt if they are moving to another sphere.
 The trials of the order are a significant occasion for the whole organization because they allow us to identify potential Lords and Darths of Spheres by demonstrating how individuals can use their KT and ASK skills to manage on a Sphere of Influence.

# Trials of the Sith
The Trials of the Sith, sometimes referred to as the Knighthood Trials, are a series of requirements that apprentices must achieve in order to advance to the rank of Sith Knight.
The actual trials are divided into five sections: the Trial of Carnage, which requires the apprentice to demonstrate both writing and combat Lightsaber skills; the Trial of Corruption, which requires the applicant to write a detailed explanation of the significance of the sphere they are currently in and a task from a Lord+ of their sphere; the Trials of Madness, which challenges the apprentice with the demands of a four-day cooling-off period; and, most importantly, the four interview questions.
  

The apprentice's final two trials are the Trials of Philosophy and the Trial of Vengeance.
In the Trial of Philosophy, the apprentice must devote his time and effort to learning the Sith code, writing about it, and defining what it means to be a Sith.
In the Trial of Vengeance, the apprentice must demonstrate his combat prowess by defeating a Jedi Knight+ while making sure to record the fight.



# Trials of Advanced Knighthood
The Advanced Knighthood trials consist of only three trials, however you have numerous possibilities, as when you become an ASK, you must pick between becoming a Sith Inquisitor and a Sith Warrior.
 Some may find the decision straightforward, but because we have 5 spheres of influence, we also have different trials for each sphere.
Let us begin by describing the default trials for both Sith Inquisitor and Sith Warrior that a Sith Knight must complete.
The first two trials are for the Sith Warrior rank, where the individual must hunt down an Advanced Jedi Knight+ and write a comparison of two lightsaber forms that are currently in game.
  

Additionally, The Trial of Immortality is an advanced Warrior trial in which a person must remain alive and engage in 3v1 combat for 60 seconds without losing.
The two prerequisite trials for a Sith Inquisitor are the Trials of Hatred, which requires the individual to murder a Jedi Master and document it while also elaborating on the significance of protecting the integrity of the Kaggath without allowing it to destroy the group's structure, community, and leadership.
The Trial of Deception, which requires the Knight to demonstrate his cunning by coming up with a scheme that will deceive a Jedi Order official.
  

Specifically, there are Trials of the Spheres of Influence that a Knight must pass before becoming an ASK.
Let's start with the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge trials, where contestants must compare and contrast the Jedi and Sith creeds in addition to receiving sponsorship from the Sphere's Lord.
 The second sphere would be the sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy, where a person is required to participate in three raids in addition to receiving a sponsorship from a Lord+, which is required for all other spheres that will be discussed.
  

The third sphere is Laws and Justice, where an individual must come up with a suitable answer when the host presents them with a situation involving breaking the law.
The fourth sphere is the Sphere of Mysteries, where a person has to finish two tasks and provide a synopsis of each one.
The last sphere is the Sphere of Philosophy, where the participant is required to create a lesson plan based on the curriculum for one lesson as specified by the Sphere of Sith Philosophy's rules.


The Advanced Trials may appear straightforward at first glance, but they are actually rather challenging because they also include the Universal Trials, which required them to train for their Knighthood while also serving as a Knight for two weeks.



# Conclusion
To sum up, the trials of the order are very important for progression in our order since they enable us to identify individuals who are deserving of progressing to higher ranks while also enjoying the process.
Finally, the purpose of the trials of the order is to merely test and evaluate our knowledge, combative skills, and—perhaps most importantly—our capacity for learning.
