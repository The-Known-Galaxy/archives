# Introduction

The Spheres of Influence, also known as pyramids, power bases, and offices were a set of twelve political power bases that acted as oversight of different domains within The Sith Empire and its operations.
Dark Councilors, the governing body of the Empire held complete responsibility and command over their respective sphere of influence.
These power bases served to run the daily operations of The Sith Empire, each member displaying obedience to the councilor that regulated the sphere.

# Foundation of the Spheres of Influence

Occurring inside the date of 4980 BBY, the Sith Emperor Tenebrae restored the Sith Empire on the world of Dromund Kaas.
In the early days of reformation, the Sith Emperor created the twelve spheres of influence, each one’s organization entrusted to the most loyal Dark Lords that followed in Tenebrae’s steps, known as the Dark Council.
Upon doing so, the Sith Emperor would flee into hiding, seeking to expand his knowledge in order to achieve ultimate power.
With the absence of the Sith Emperor, the Dark Council operated the Sith Empire’s day to day operations, holding supreme power over different portions of the Empire's organization such as the function of the Imperial Military, technological advancement, judicial systems, preservation/enforcement of Sith philosophy, and more.
Regardless of social class one was in or even the type of member within the Sith Empire, everyone under the control of the Empire answered to at least a single Dark Councilor.
Whilst conflict was common among the different spheres, their Overlords were responsible for dealing with resolving the issues that may have arisen in their powerbase.
However, in the future, the spheres of influence would see alteration.

# Sphere of Laws and Justice

The Sphere of Laws and Justice was responsible for the administration of the judicial system in the Empire.
This pyramid would control a multitude of justice branches and law enforcement, ensuring that the citizens of the Empire, along with enlisted members of the military and Sith Order were brought to proper justice by the law.
As a product of their work, society in the Sith Empire remained undamaged.
Darth Mortis, head of the sphere during this time sought to establish proper equity yet still adhere to Sith tradition and philosophy.
This influential domain would see change under the rule of Empress Acina in 3636 BBY, when she decided to integrate Laws and Justice with the Sphere of Production and Logistics to create the Sphere of Civil Administration.

# Sphere of Imperial Intelligence

The Sphere of Imperial Intelligence held oversight over the Ministry of Intelligence, a mainline division within the Empire.
Consisting of other divisions like the Outreach Bureau, Operations Branch, and Imperial Intelligence.
Likewise, this sphere was involved in matters of espionage, intelligence information, spy work, propaganda, manipulation, assassination, and all things related.
Most of the sphere’s members operated in the shadows, even the most skilled non-force sensitive insiders being just as dangerous as the Sith, perhaps even more.
Headed by Darth Jadus, a Dark Lord of the Sith who served on the Dark Council.
He would spend most of his time providing work to the Outreach Bureau, letting the majority of his other power base function the other matters within the sphere.
Just like many other spheres that would see alterations, Empress Acina later combined the Sphere of Imperial Intelligence with Expansion and Diplomacy to design the Sphere of Galactic Influence in 3636 BBY.

# Sphere of Ancient Knowledge

The Sphere of Ancient Knowledge oversaw the protection, expansion, and preservation of all Sith history, artifacts, and general knowledge.
Like other spheres, this powerbase also had control over a division, that division being known as the Imperial Reclamation Service.
Naturally, this organization ran archeological expeditions in order to recover Sith artifacts and other forms of knowledge, including lifeforms.
The pyramid had multiple leaders throughout its existence, three in total.
Darth Arctis being the first overlord, then being succeeded by Darth Thanaton who would later be defeated in a Kaggath by Lord Kalig, a Sith Lord that ascended to the Dark Council, adopting the name of Darth Nox after the death of Thanaton.
Under the rule of Empress Acina later in the days of the Empire, the pyramid would be unified with the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and Mysteries in order to create the Sphere of Sith Doctrine.

# Sphere of Sith Philosophy

The Sphere of Sith Philosophy was entrusted with the enforcement of Sith tradition, including the Code of The Sith.
Those that chose to pose a threat to the Sith’s principles of any kind would be excised by the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.
Not only that, but this sector distributed anti-Jedi tradition and propaganda so that the Empire may remain unenlightened about anything related to the Light Side and its practices.
Darth Aruk would act as oversight of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and would make it his destiny to destroy the Order of Revan, a cult that followed the teachings of Revan which included Light Side philosophy.
Along with the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and Mysteries, the Sphere of Sith Philosophy would be reformed with these other two spheres to originate the Sphere of Sith Doctrine under Darth Acina’s reign as Sith Empress.

# Sphere of Mysteries

The Sphere of Mysteries was tasked with the preservation of Imperial information and lore meant to remain confidential.
Holocrons that contained secret material or documentation would be locked away, protected by the Sphere of Mysteries.
The majority of the assassin forces that worked with the Empire served under this domain and likewise, were required to dispose of any targets that would be deemed as major threats to the Empire.
Organizations such as the Red Legion, an Imperial unit within the Sith Empire responsible for assassination of its enemies.
Even given the public description of the Sphere’s functionality, most people a part of the Empire were not aware of Mysteries accountability considering the sphere’s title of the most confidential and secretive out of all spheres of influence.
During the ruling of the Sith Emperor, Darth Rictus wielded the province over the Sphere of Mysteries.
Later down the line, the Sphere of Mysteries was merged with the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and Sith Philosophy to create the Sphere of Sith Doctrine.

# Sphere of Biotic Science

The Sphere of Biotic Science concerned itself with all matters within the Empire related to disease control, augmentation, Sith alchemy, and the organic body as a whole.
With the establishment of this sphere, another division would make itself known, this division being known as the Imperial Medical Corps assigned to treatment and other forms of medical care for Imperial forces.
Individuals not of human or Sith Pureblood descent were discriminated against and the corps even assumed duties on active battlefields.
The Imperial Science Bureau also worked under the Sphere of Biotic Science as a service obligated to do research and conduct a series of tests, genetic engineering, and experiments in order to advance science research as a whole.
Alien Control was also another organization working under Biotic Science at the time and had the grueling task of instigating population control of any and all alien species that the Empire felt needed attention.
Darth Archaron served as oversight of the Sphere of Biotic Science as it complimented the Dark Lord considering he himself decided to augment his own body with various cybernetics produced by his sphere.
Seeing as the Sphere of Biotic Science worked alongside the Sphere of Technology, it is no surprise that during Empress Acina’s rule that both of these power bases were amalgamated to make the Sphere of Scientific Advancement.

# Sphere of Technology

The Sphere of Technology managed all projects and work to construct cybernetics, military weaponry, superweapons, machinery, and other mechanisms that could be used by the Sith Empire.
Similar to the other Spheres of Influence, the Sphere of Technology also had its fair share of divisions.
The Imperial Corps of Engineers was a unit of the Empire’s best engineers to craft many apparatuses even in the midst of battle.
Another sect under the Sphere of Technology was the Imperial Ordnance Acquisition, an organization tasked with the collection of scientific material such as blaster rifles for use against the Empire's opposition.
In order for the Empire to have stable energy, the Imperial Power Bureau was enacted to deal with generators or any form of energy science.
Darth Acina was the most notable overlord of this power base given that she eventually deemed herself as the Sith Empress.
Being a sphere that dealt with technological advancement, the Sphere of Technology was well acquainted and affiliated with the Imperial Science Bureau that happened to serve under the Sphere of Biotic Science.
Once other spheres were united to establish reformation among the Spheres of Influence with the ascension of Empress Acina, the Sphere of Biotic Science and Technology followed along.

# Sphere of Production and Logistics

The Sphere of Production and Logistics acted as oversight of the Ministry of Logistics.
Through this ministry, the sphere managed influential assets that were vital to the Empire’s functionality such as trade routes, resources, supply lines, and even slave populations.
Being the most logistical sphere, it was provided with different organizations under the sphere’s command to properly organize its operations.
The Imperial Citizenship Bureau was one of these organizations and managed all records of the citizens that resided within the Empire.
Having to manage some forms of the economy, the Imperial Treasury Department was vital in the functionality of the Sphere of Production and Logistics.
This department oversaw all Imperial pay stations and would even issue bounties upon those that decided to interfere with their operations.
The leadership of the Sphere of Production and Logistics remained unchanged as Darth Vowrawn would make himself comfortable as its leader for all of its time.
The Sphere of Laws and Justice and Production and Logistics unified during Acina’s term as Empress to devise the Sphere of Civil Administration.

# Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy

The Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy was in charge of the expansion of the Empire’s frontiers and dealt with all matters related to diplomacy.
Most of the work regarding diplomacy was left to the Imperial Diplomatic Service which was assigned to establish beneficial relationships and allies with the Sith Empire, ensuring that their allegiance remained.
Under the leadership of Darth Ravage, more focus on military expansion as opposed to the political and diplomatic duties of the sphere.
Expansion and Diplomacy eventually joined with the Sphere of Imperial Intelligence in order to enact the Sphere of Galactic Influence desired by Acina who took the throne after Vitiate’s scheme was revealed.

# Sphere of Military Strategy

The Sphere of Military Strategy devised and controlled all strategic battle plans, strategy, and other operations pertaining to the Imperial Military.
Just like the Sphere of Defense of The Empire and Military Offense, the Sphere of Military Strategy also had control over the Ministry of War but directly controlled the Imperial Consolidation Corps, a division responsible for ensuring security among newly acquired planets by the Empire.
Its leader, Darth Decimus, would devise many strategies for plans of invasion, one of these invasions being known as the Invasion of Corellia.
Given all the similarities and congregation between the sphere of Military Strategy, Military Offense, and Defense of The Empire, Empress Acina decided to unify all three spheres together to produce the Sphere of Military Command.

# Sphere of Military Offense

The Sphere of Military Strategy established supremacy by leading the Imperial Military’s offensive operations against the Empire’s enemies through means of directory over military resources and strength.
Imperial Military forces answered directly to the Ministry of War, another authority granted to Military Offense.
This ministry was one of three branches of the governing body within the Empire, leading all matters related to war including control over the Imperial Navy, Army, High Command, and Reclamation Service.
The most notable leader of this power base was Darth Baras who would be succeeded by a multitude of different Dark Lords of the Sith as the sphere continued.
This office worked well alongside the Sphere of Military Strategy whose duties was to act as general advisors to offensive operations and battle planning devised by the Sphere of Military Offense.
Due to this, Empress Acina would later combine the two spheres with the Sphere of Defense of The Empire to formulate the Sphere of Military Command given that all three spheres possessed control over the Ministry of War.

# Sphere of Defense of The Empire

The Sphere of Defense the Empire made it known that no external or internal threats would arise outside or within the Empire.
Given the responsibility of this pyramid, it worked closely with Imperial Intelligence forces to ensure none would pose danger to the politics and structure of the Sith Empire.
The Ministry of War was shared with the Defense of the Empire just as it had been with the Sphere of Military Strategy and Offense.
During all eras of its reign, Darth Marr acted as the power base's oversight, asserting his duties in order to preserve the Sith Empire from all those that were deemed as threats.
After his death and with the establishment of reform at the hand of Empress Acina, the Sphere of Defense of the Empire joined with the Sphere of Military Strategy and Military Offense to construct the Sphere of Military Command.

# Empress Acina's Reformation

After the Eternal Empire of Zakuul exposed itself to attack both Empire and Republic forces in 3636 BBY, Darth Acina, one of the last surviving Dark Councilors chose to claim the throne within the Sith Empire thus deeming herself the Empress of the Sith.
Some of her first acts of reconstructing the Sith Empire included merging the twelve spheres of influence into five different new spheres in 3630 BBY: the Sphere of Military Command, the Sphere of Galactic Influence, the Sphere of Civil Administration, the Sphere of Scientific Advancement, and the Sphere of Sith Doctrine.
Her reasoning for doing so was to reduce the infighting among the Dark Council that was extremely prevalent during the existence of the twelve spheres of influence.
With these changes, only five Dark Councilors were allowed to serve at a single time, each one acting as the overlord of one of these newly founded spheres.
The majority of the previous members of the Dark Council that served before Acina’s ascension were either killed at the hands of the Eternal Empire or chose to exile themselves from the Sith Empire.

# Sphere of Sith Doctrine

The Sphere of Sith Doctrine was formulated by Empress Acina by combining the Sphere of Mysteries, Sith Philosophy, and Ancient Knowledge.
This power base was trusted with ensuring the preservation of all Sith knowledge whilst also enforcing the very tradition upheld by the Sith.
Darth Anathel, a previous Sith Lord, advanced into the Dark Council making him the Head of the Sphere of Sith Doctrine.

# Sphere of Scientific Advancement

The Sphere of Scientific Advancement was founded by merging the Sphere of Technology and the Sphere of Biotic Science at the discretion of Empress Acina.
Naturally, this sphere was responsible for all matters related to scientific, technological, and biotic research, advancement, and projects to benefit the Sith Empire in any form.
After the foundation of the power base, Darth Malora would be assigned as oversight up until her replacement Darth Savik took over due to Malora’s incompetence following the conflicts that had transpired on Ossus.

# Sphere of Military Command

The Sphere of Military Command was yet another pyramid of the Sith Empire formed by Darth Acina by integrating the Sphere of Military Command, Military Offense, and Defense of the Empire upon her ascension to Empress of the Sith.
Tasked with all offensive and defense strategies as well as military procedures, the Sphere of Military Command established the Empire’s true strength in the galaxy.
Darth Korvos acted as oversight of the Sphere of Military Command during its time.

# Sphere of Civil Administration

The Sphere of Civil Administration emerged as another power base within the Sith Empire after Empress Acina chose to fuse the Sphere of Laws and Justice, and the Sphere of Production and Logistics together.
This power base concerned itself with managing weapon production, supply line management, and held administrative rule over internal law such as judicial systems pertaining to the Empire and its citizens.
Its only known leader in history, Darth Vowrawn, dealt with all matters related to internal law enforcement and general supply production.

# Sphere of Galactic Influence

The Sphere of Galactic Influence was another product of reformation of the spheres of influence under Empress Acina that was created by combining the Sphere of Imperial Intelligence and the Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy.
This pyramid within the Sith Empire was trusted with gathering intelligence about internal and external threats to the Empire as well as assuming diplomatic responsibility in the name of the Sith Empire.
Darth Xarion would stop at nothing to further expose any threats to the Sith Empire and establish diplomacy for the Empire considering his leadership status of the sphere during its existence in 3630 BBY.
