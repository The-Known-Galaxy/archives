# Offensive Raids:

Offensive raids are attacks against the Jedi planned by the Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy.
Regularly hosted on Fridays, the raid will usually be announced 1-3 days before the actual event so people have time to prepare for the raid.
Everyone gathers 15 minutes before the raid to make sure the plans are concise and everyone is on the same page.
Occasionally, Ancient Knowledge will meet up and collaborate to pirate Jedi Archives.
We all stand STS in front of the person commanding the raid and oftentimes we split up into 2 groups; a flanking group and a main force.
Sometimes we set a group of people forward for a distraction.
We rush in and start raiding, killing and gaining as much ground in the temple as possible.
If Ancient Knowledge attends, we make a stop at the archives and start pirating articles and steal any information possible.
Once everyone is done we exit the library and continue attacking until Jedi forces wear out.
Then we all meet up and take a group photo.
Then the raid is concluded.

# Defensive Raids:

A Defensive Raid occurs when the Jedi are attacking us and we must defend Dathomir.
These raids consist of Jedi raids, JAT raids, and Temple Guard raids.
Once an alert is made, we all get on that can and assist in the defense of  the temple.
The most important task is to keep the Jedi out of the archives no matter the cost.
The raid ends whenever all Jedi leave the Temple on Dathomir.

# Flash Raids:

Flash raids happen when there is an unplanned raid.
They usually appear for two reasons; from a Jedi raid, or a pop-up raid.
These raids are usually very simplistic and attendance for these raids aren't as high as defensive or offensive raids.
