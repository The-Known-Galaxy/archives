# Overview

The AT-AT, full name All Terrain Armored Transport, was an important part of the Galactic Empire's fleet of vehicles.
The Armored Transport was an extremely massive transport that was feared by citizens all over the galaxy.
The Walker played a role in many Star Wars events, ranging from the Clone Wars to the Second Imperial Civil war.
Despite the AT-AT being a massive and heavily feared superweapon, it was extremely slow and required many small fighters alongside it for safe transport.

# General Description of Functionality

The AT-AT was a massive armored walking tank.
It was often considered a “behemoth of a war machine.” The walker was specifically designed to replicate ancient beasts of war that conquered the Dark Side of the Force.
The walker was made to crush and destroy everything in its path, while also serving as a transport for imperial troops and weapons.
Hundreds of AT-ATs were produced for the Galactic Civil War, and due to their massive size it was often the first weapon on the battlefield.

The head of the AT-AT acted as a central command for the Pilot, Commander, and Gunner.
These war machines could carry up to forty Imperial Troopers and five Speeder Bikes.
The body also contained sliding ramps for easy in and out access, especially when leaving or entering on a speeder.
The AT-AT had an odd way of unloading, which was by kneeling and opening the sliding ramp, where soldiers could leave and enter.
A quicker way to deploy troops was through its grapple system, where the Trooper simply latched on and was dropped.

The AT-AT contained intense weaponry, hosting guns such as Fire Linked Heavy Laser Cannons, Medium Repeating Blasters, and Heavy Repeating Blasters.
The Walker also has an extremely durable armor plate that allows it to withstand huge hits.
This armor not only needed to be strong for defense but also to hold the intense weaponry and massive cargo.
The main weakness of the AT-AT was its neck, which was not as heavily guarded due to the need for it to move.
