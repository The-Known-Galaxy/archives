# Description
The Dynamic-class freighter was a starship designed by a subsidiary of the Core Galaxy Systems on the planet Transel.
It was designed during the period of the Mandalorian Wars.
The ship was easy to add changes to, it had built-in blaster cannons and shields, making it technologically advanced.
Dynamic-class freighters had a lot of space for passengers, making it a good way to transport people.
The cargo area of the ship was great, it could hold up to 60 tons of material and could even serve as a garage for speeders or smaller ships.
It was a perfect ship for many missions and a place where an entire crew could live.

The Dynamic-class freighter had a very famous variant of it, the Ebon Hawk.
The Ebon Hawk was the ship of Revan, former Dark Lord of the Sith.
It assisted him and his crew during their adventures in the galaxy, mostly during their mission to find and destroy the Star Forge.
Back then, it was considered the fastest ship in the Outer Rim.
