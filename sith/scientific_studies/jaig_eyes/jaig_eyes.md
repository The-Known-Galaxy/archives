# Overview
Jai’galaar’la sur’haii’se, translated to Galactic Basic as; Shriek-hawk eyes, or more commonly known as ‘Jaig eyes’ are a Mandalorian tradition of honour dating back to the earliest settlements of Taung on the world of Mandalore.
The honour marks a Mandalorian as having achieved a remarkable act of gallantry in the eyes of their Clan Chieftain.


When a Mandalorian is bestowed the honour they will typically paint a set of Jaig eyes onto their armour, most commonly on their helmets.
However, it is not unheard of for the recipient to paint the Jaig eyes on other places of their armour.

# Recipients
During the training of the Clone forces belonging to the Grand Army of the Republic, many Clones, most notably Clone Commandos and Advanced Recon Commandos would adopt the Mandalorian culture and way of life and hold onto many Mandalorian traditions over the course of their lives and service.


As a result of this the Jaig Eyes tradition would become popularised by Clone troopers who would take it upon themselves to informally bestow the honour upon their most valiant members.


Such notable Clones are; 

ARC-77, Captain ‘’Fordo’’
CT-7567, Captain ‘’Rex’’
CT-1284, Commander ‘’Blackout’’

Other notable recipients are; 

Mand’alor Fenn Shysha
Jedi Knight Caleb Dume
