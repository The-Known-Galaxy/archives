# Overview
The Goddess Missile was a weapon Jedi Knight Jaina Solo and the remaining Myrkr strike team used during the Yuuzhan Vong War of 25-29 ABY.
With the help of members of the Wraith Squadron, namely Sharr Latt and Voort saBinring, a psychological warfare campaign was staged to provide an advantage against the Yuuzhan Vong.
Initially, Solo stole a frigate analogue, called the Ksstarr, from their enemies.
It was later renamed the Trickster, becoming a great insult in the eyes of the Yuuzhan Vong.
Additionally, the Goddess missiles were named so because they appeared with the symbol of Yun-Harla, the Goddess of Deception for the Yuuzhan Vong.
The Yuuzhan Vong became so obsessed with apprehending the thief that they were easily led into traps, as much as they were obsessed with their religion.

# Encounters with SCORPIO
During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Solo manipulated and altered the gravitic signature of her allies’ fleet to match that of the Trickster.
The Goddess missiles were also tagged the same.
This effect confused the Yuuzhan Vong, allowing for a window of opportunity to launch their weapon.
The missiles were fired from a starfighter into a Yuuzhan Vong Yorik-et vessel, which tricked their ships into attacking each other.
Although this ultimately led to Yuuzhan Vong’s defeat in the war, saBinring later suggested to Solo that the missiles could have been improved.
