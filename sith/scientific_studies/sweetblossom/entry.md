# Overview

There was a flower known as sweetblossom, the extract of which had a substantial narcotic effect.
Despite the fact that the extract did not cause addiction, many who misused it still did so in order to avoid the responsibilities of everyday life.
Even though they were acutely aware of their surroundings, people who used sweetblossom exhibited attitudes of indifference and sloth.

According to Greglik, a pilot affiliated with the Rebel Alliance, he stated that the narcotic Sweetblossom might bring an end to galactic civilization in less than a week.
He characterized the drug as being "exactly like sleep" while he was speaking about Sweetblossom.
If the user took five drops of sweetblossom, they would be able to sit for an infinite amount of time, curled up in comfort, without worrying about anything, and watching dust motes weave patterns or addercops spin webs.
A person who had taken sweetblossom for the first time would initially have a totally clear mind.
Nevertheless, once they had consumed seven or even eight drops, they would become immobilized - awake yet motionless.
Those who were worn out by life and felt the need to take a break from their everyday lives favored Sweetblossom.
