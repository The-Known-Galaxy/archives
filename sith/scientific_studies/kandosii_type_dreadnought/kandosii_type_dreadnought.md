# Overview
The Mandalorians used the Kandosii-type Dreadnought as a warship during the Mandalorian Wars, it was the largest ship used by the Mandalorians.
The design of the ship was based on stolen technology from the Fenelars, a species eliminated by the Mandalorian Crusaders by 6700 BBY, but the Fenelars made one big flaw in the ship's design, the hyperspace navigation system could easily be destroyed.
With a very large capacity, the ship could carry an astonishing amount of over 10,000 crew members, 30,000 troops, and 45,000 tons of cargo.
The ship possessed a large cargo hold and could carry around 128 Davaad-type starfighters, and 8 Shaadlar-type troopships which could hold 800 troops each; it could also carry a few Basilisk war droids.
The ship was present during the Battle of Serroco, where the fleet consisting of the Kandosii-type Dreadnought and Jehavey'ir-type assault ship bombarded the planet.
Although the ship was later replaced by more modern ships, the Kandosii-type Dreadnought remained a formidable ship,
