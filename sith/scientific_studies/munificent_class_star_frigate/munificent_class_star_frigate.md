# Overview

The Munificent-Class Star Frigate, colloquially known as the Separatist frigate, was one of many warships that were designed and fabricated by Hoersch-Kessel Drive Incorporated.
They had partnered their production of this ship with Gwori Revolutionary Technologies for the primary use of transportation in items during the years of the Clone Wars.
These frigates were extremely powerful, multi-role starships that often contained navy forces of the Trade Federation to use against the Galactic Republic.
The frigate measured 825 meters in length, 426 meters in width, and 243 meters in height, making this ship colossal to most creatures.

Despite the frigate’s monstrous design, the frigates were incredibly fast ships due to being primarily lightly armored and powered by a nuclear reactor.
They were designed to operate in squadrons supported by smaller crafts to take down larger capital ships, hence the ship’s naturally light armor compared to its counterparts.

The frigate came equipped with a large array of weapons, to compensate for its lack of defense.
The frigates contained: armed with two forward-mounted heavy turbolaser cannons, two forward-mounted heavy ion cannons, thirteen port and thirteen starboard twin light turbolaser cannons, ten port and ten starboard turret-mounted light turbolasers, six port and six starboard medium flak guns with roughly thirty-three shells per gun, ten dorsal, ten ventral, ten port, and ten starboard turret-mounted retractable point-defense twin light turbolasers, including several ordnance launchers and a hyperwave jammer.

The crew of the frigate was almost entirely automated, which compensated for the amount of troops this ship was able to carry.
The ship could carry roughly 150,000 battle droids in total while maintaining less than 200 crewmembers itself.
The frigate contained hangar facilities that could hold up to a maximum of four squadrons of vulture droids, several Sheathipede-Class transport shuttles, and numerous DSD1 dwarf spider droids.
