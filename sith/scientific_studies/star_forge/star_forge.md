The Star Forge was a giant automated shipyard designed and constructed by the Rakatan Infinite Empire to create the most powerful army of all time.
The Star Forge was able to create an endless supply of any war material, most notably ships and droids; The energy required for the Star Forge to operate was drawn from the nearby star Abo in combination with the power of the Force.
The Star Forge’s defences were based on the Star Forge’s infinite manufacturing of ships and droids to defend against any threat; But the Temple of the Ancients held a mysterious and powerful disruptive field that would force any starship to land or crash on the planet, this together formed the defensive system of the Star Forge.

The Rakatan were a cruel species, known to the galaxy for their inhumane and infamously savage treatment of other species.
These negative and dark traits were what the Star Forge would start feeding off of, slowly turning the Star Forge into something based on the dark side’s energy, reflected by the Rakatan their dark principles and behaviour.
All of the dark energy required for the Star Forge to operate would start to corrupt and destroy the Rakatan, resulting in dark side corruption taking control and feeding off of the Rakatan their strength in the Force, this ultimately resulted in the collapse of the entire Rakatan Infinite Empire.

The Star Forge was sought-after thousands of years later by the Emperor of the Sith Empire; he directed the fallen Jedi, Revan and Malak, to search for the Star Forge.
After finding the Star Forge through the Rakatan’s Star Maps, it would ultimately be in the service of Revan and Malak, which would then see the creation of the New Sith Empire under their control.
However, where Revan would not allow the Star Forge to feed off of him or let it gain too much control, Malak would do the opposite and further explore the powers of the Star Forge.

After the Jedi wiped Revan's mind, he was tasked with finding the Star Forge, which led to a confrontation between Malak’s Sith Empire and Republic Forces; This is known as the Battle of Rakata Prime.
With the combined effort of the Republic fleet, swarms of bombers and Jedi combat meditation, the Star Forge's orbital stabilizers were destroyed, resulting in the Star Forge drifting into the Rakatan sun, causing a massive eruption and explosion with the debris of the Star Forge flying millions of kilometres away.
