# Introduction

The Gozanti Cruiser, also known as the Gozanti-class armed transport, was a slow but powerful transport designed by the Corellian Engineering Corporation.
It was described as a flying fortress and was built for durability and firepower rather than cargo capacity and speed.
The design for the cruiser was leased to other companies for construction, one of them being Gallofree Yards.

# Section One

These cruisers were first built during the Old Republic and were made purposefully slow to prove to Republic Inspectors that the ship couldn’t be used as a private vessel.
However, the ship was used by many independent organizations, including the Hutts and a number of crime lords.
Lots of the ships were refurbished and turned into warships by the Rebellion during the Galactic Civil War.
Rebellion engineers were able to get most of them up to standard for operations in modern combat.
The Rebellion deployed Gozantis as escort vessels and they also used them as capital ships in times of need.

# Section Two

Gozanti cruisers were known for being difficult to board and were equipped with unusually heavy armor and hull bracing.
They also had retractable weaponry, including, four laser cannons, two quad laser cannon turrets, and a proton torpedo launcher.
The ships were primarily used by merchants, militaries, and mercenaries to defend cargo from being pirated.
A rare few were used as diplomatic vessels and were popular choices for mobile command centers.
However, one of these ships did fall into the hands of a criminal and it was turned into a prison ship.

# Section Three

The design for these ships fell out of popularity during the reign of the Galactic Empire.
However, the post-Endor collapse took place and the demand for heavily armed ships was once again in demand.
The Krayt’s Honor was the name of a notable Gozanti Cruiser used by freelancers to protect merchants from harassment by the Trade Federation.
During the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems militarized the cruisers and used them as support ships.
They were painted with Separatist colors and served in the fleet under the command of the super tactical droid Aut-0.
The Black Sun crime syndicate later modified them to be used as frigates.
After the takeover of Mandalore, the Separatists’ and Black Sun Gozantis were seen hovering over the sky of Sundari.
