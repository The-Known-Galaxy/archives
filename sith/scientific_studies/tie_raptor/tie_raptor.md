# Overview
The TIE Raptor, or TIE/rpt starfighter, is a unique variation of the classic TIE Fighter that packs a punch.
Instead of the usual large wings, this bad boy sports four short fins jutting out from its spherical cockpit.
It may not be as fast as the TIE Interceptor, but don't underestimate its maneuverability, which rivals the nimble A-wing.
Plus, it's armed to the teeth with four laser cannons and two concussion missile tubes.
Some lucky prototypes even got shields for added protection.

# Section 1
Those who witness the TIE raptor for the first time, just can't help but notice its one-of-a-kind design.
The cockpit's got that signature spherical shape  with a cool octagonal window up front.
But those four short fins sticking out at right angles?
You don't come across something like that every day.
Those fins are the secret to its impressive maneuverability, making it a force to be reckoned with in a dogfight.



# Section 2
Despite not being as fast as the TIE Interceptor, the TIE Raptor more than compensates with its impressive arsenal of weapons.
With four laser cannons, it can take on both enemy starfighters and capital ships effectively.
Moreover, it has two concussion missile tubes that can launch guided projectiles, causing massive damage to its enemies.

The TIE Raptor prototypes differed from the traditional TIE Fighter designs as they were fitted with shields.
This provided the starfighter with an added defensive capability that was uncommon in other TIE models.
As a result, pilots were able to withstand enemy attacks and engage in prolonged battles, reinforcing the TIE Raptor's image as a robust and adaptable combat platform.



# Section 3
The TIE Raptor owed its existence to the ingenuity of Warlord Zsinj's engineers, who developed the starfighter within his shipyards on the dark and mysterious world of Dathomir.
Unlike the original TIE series, Sienar Fleet Systems had limited involvement in this project, with their contribution primarily confined to establishing the initial TIE design lineage.
As a result, the Raptor saw little to no deployment among units of the Imperial Navy loyal to the central authorities, making it a unique asset exclusively utilized by Warlord Zsinj's faction.



# Section 4
While the TIE Raptor did not achieve widespread adoption within the Imperial Navy, its impact cannot be understated.
With its exceptional maneuverability and powerful weapons, the TIE Raptor proved itself capable of thriving in different combat situations.
Pilots who had the opportunity to fly the TIE Raptor praised its responsiveness and firepower, often likening it to a deadly predator soaring through the stars.

Once introduced, the TIE Raptor left a lasting impression on the world of starfighters in the years that followed.
Its influence can be seen in subsequent starfighter designs, with elements of its unconventional configuration and enhanced defensive capabilities finding their way into future iterations.
While not commonly employed, the TIE Raptor serves as proof of the imaginative and resourceful individuals who aimed to expand starfighter technology in the vast universe.
