# Overview
The MC80 Liberty Type Star Cruiser was a prototype Mon-Calamari Star Cruiser that was put under the service of the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.
During this war, the rebels rebelled against the Galactic Empire until after their fall in 0 BBY.
Each Mon-Calamari Star Cruiser had a unique design, and the MC80 Liberty-Type was no exception.
The MC80 line was exemplified by the cruiser Liberty.
The Cruiser contained a total of nine engines spread across the ship and dawned a large wing infrastructure on either side of the cruiser.

Whilst also containing tractor beams and weapon pods, the MC80 contained turbolaser cannons, deflector shields, Ion cannons, and beam projectors, making it a formidable foe against the Galactic Empire’s arsenal of weapons.
The majority of the ship’s weapons were located on the wing infrastructures of the cruiser.
The primary sensor array was also located on the ventral side of the cruiser.
Storage-wise, the hangers on an MC80 were able to house up to three squadrons, typically one X-Wing, A-Wing, and Y-Wing.


The bridge of the MC80 was located at the stern of the vessel, allowing those on the bridge to better view their surroundings in the event of a sudden attack on the cruiser.
The bridge was also slightly sunken into the hull for better protection against incoming firepower.
The cruisers were primarily used by those from Mon Calamari due to the nature of the display systems held within the bridge being designed specifically for them.
