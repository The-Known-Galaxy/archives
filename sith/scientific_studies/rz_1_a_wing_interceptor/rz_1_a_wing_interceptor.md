# Overview

The RZ-1 A-wing interceptor, even known as the RZ-1 A-wing starfighter, was a wedge-shaped starfighter fabricated by Kuat Systems Engineering, which brought innovation incentives from the Republic starfighters of the Clone Wars.

The RZ-1 A-wing interceptor was an undersized, wedge-shaped craft with a central cockpit connected to twin engines.
Like its Clone Wars ancestor, the Eta-2, the A-wing required pilots of amazing skill to take full advantage of the vessel's speed, agility, and special features.
The A-wing's wing-mounted laser artillery could pivot up and down sixty degrees for a significant increase in fire control thanks to a short hydro-servo bearing at the end of each wingtip.
Some A-wings even had their guns adjusted to swivel in a full 360-degree arc, providing a shock to any chasing fighter.
