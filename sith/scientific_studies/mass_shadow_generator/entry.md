During the Battle of Malachor V, a superweapon called Mass Shadow Generator was produced and designed by Bao-Dur, a Zabrak tech expert at the request of Revan, who was a Jedi Knight at the time.
Revan gave specific orders to Bao-Dur to originally intend it as a gravitational trap (hence the name), hoping it would mess up the gravitational fields and stop the Mandalorian Wars.
The one who would supervise the device’s harness would be Meetra Surik, a Jedi General.

Revan baited the Mandalorians towards Malachor V leading to a fight breaking out between enemy fleets in space.
In the fight, Meetra Surik ordered the technician to activate the superweapon with his remote.
Shortly after, a powerful impact from a gravity vortex was caused by it, which led to some ships being disabled while also crushing both parties, and Malachor V’s disaster.
All that was left on the planet was a place were recollections of the battle that existed, thousands of echoes of warriors, Jedi, and Mandalorians alike.

In 3951 BBY, this device was used again, for the last time, by Meetra in search of Darth Traya.
On Malachor V, she managed to slay Darth Nihilus before moving to the Trayus Academy where she defeated both Darth Traya and Darth Sion and while she was fighting, Bao-Dur once again triggered the remote given by that would start the superweapon.
Meetra just in time managed to depart and all traces of the planet were gone because of the impact’s cause, leaving only asteroids and warships from the old times.
