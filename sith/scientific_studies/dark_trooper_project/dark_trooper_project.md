# Introduction
The Dark Trooper Project was an experimental wing of the Galactic Empire’s Stormtrooper Corps.
The idea of the project was to eventually outphase the more common stormtrooper with a cybernetic battle droid that could fight more efficiently than most of the Empire’s ground forces at the time while also being able to withstand harsh attacks.

The Project was created by Imperial General Rom Mohc, a veteran of the Clone Wars who developed a keen and particular interest in the various models of battle droids produced by the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
General Mohc believed battle droids to be the future of ground warfare, seeing the droids as a far more effective method of waging war, even more so than the Kaminoan method of cloning and flash training.

# Part I: Phase Zero
The Phase Zero variant of the Dark Troopers stood as the first iteration of the program and came before the program had been officially sanctioned by the Emperor.
General Mohc made use of many of the remaining Clone troopers who still served in the early years of the Galactic Empire and combined their genetic material with cybernetic enhancements designed to increase their strength, speed, stamina and overall combat efficiency.


General Mohc would use many of the same methods employed to create Darth Vader’s cybernetic enhancements.
The Phase Zero Dark Troopers were considered successful despite being considered as inhumane abominations, very little resembling the original Clone Trooper under the armour.


Clone Troopers would volunteer willingly for the cybernetic enhancements, often seeing it as a way to remain in service and combat the Clone aging process.
Those who were successful would be outfitted with enhanced combat equipment and had access to a wide variety of Imperial weapons akin to that of other Imperial Special Forces units.
Despite the questionable quality of life of the Dark Troopers and methods used to produce them, their combat effectiveness was not something that could be argued against.


Only a few years later the Emperor would personally green light and fund the creation of an official Dark Trooper Project with General Mohc at the helm.



# Part II: Phase One
The Phase One Dark Trooper would be the first iteration of the program that did not make use of sentient beings and instead were a prototype droid.
Designed with light armour and serving an entirely melee combat role, the Phase One Dark Trooper was never officially deployed into a combat zone and only served as the foundation of ideas and concepts that would further the creation of its vastly superior model, the Dark Trooper Phase Two.


The Phase One was still an efficient combat model and made use of an extremely mobile chassis.
Despite not being officially deployed into combat, the Phase One did guard numerous Imperial installations and would find itself coming up against the Rebel Alliance on numerous occasions, proving itself to be an effective enemy in its own right.



# Part III: Phase Two
The Phase Two Dark Trooper can be credited with being the first true adaptation of the program.
Taking elements from the Phase Zero and Phase One projects, the Phase II would be the most mass produced variant of the program.


At one stage in the history of the Rebel Alliance the Phase Two Dark Trooper was the largest threat to Rebel Cells.
Many Rebel ships and installations could be boarded and dispatched in a swift and decisive manner that even the best Imperial Commando units struggled to keep up with.

The Phase Two Dark Trooper could be utilized as a battle droid and even as an exoskeleton for Imperial soldiers.
As such they were often worn by decorated Imperial Field Officers who had a background in Imperial Special Operations and on many occasions the Phase II Dark Trooper would be deployed in small squads and even as individuals to support larger military activities.



# Part IV: Phase Three
Easily the most lethal variant of the Dark Trooper, the Phase Three stood at nearly 3 meters in height, towering above its previous models.
The Phase Three would most often be deployed as an individual unit with the goal of tackling particularly difficult hostiles.
Considered to be on par with a small tank, the Phase Three would find itself fairing against Jedi, heavy armoured opponents and entrenched enemy positions.


The Phase Three model was seen as the true success of the program, so much so that General Mohc had intended for the Phase Three to become the next set of armour for future Stormtrooper generations.
However this would prove difficult due to the cost and rarity of the armour material utilized by the Phase Three.
General Mohc himself would utilize a Phase Three exoskeleton model as his own personal armour.



# Inquisitorium Dark Trooper
This model was produced to support operations undertaken by Imperial Inquisitors.
As such they wore black armour and were programmed to conduct operations against Jedi and force-wielders.
Due to their size and arsenal it would be safe to theorise that the Inquisitorium Dark Trooper is an off-shoot of the Phase III model.


The Inquisitorium Dark Trooper would wield melee weapons, being one of the rare varieties to do so, this is likely due to the nature of the enemy they were tasked with killing, often wielding a lightsaber.



# Triumphant-class Dark Trooper
The Triumphant-class Dark Trooper is a lesser known sub-unit of the program.
The unit would make appearances on worlds often visited by Darth Vader, and two Triumphant-class Dark Troopers could often be seen escorting Darth Vader during his visits to Naboo.

The Triumphant-class Dark Trooper is the only model seen to not sport a jump pack, unlike other variants of Dark Troopers, it is unclear if this model is an exoskeleton or a droid, or if it can be utilized both ways such as the Dark Trooper Phase II.
 Due to the lack of armaments and jump packs it could be theorised that the Triumphant-class Dark Trooper served a formality and intimidation purpose and much less of a combat purpose, though likely still very capable.



# Dark Novatrooper
The Dark Novatrooper was a variant of the Phase II and III Dark Trooper that specialised in ship boarding operations.
They donned black armour with orange markings, similar to that of the Novatroopers who carried out the same operations.



# Exogen-class Dark Trooper
The Exogen-class Dark Trooper was a unique variant of the Phase II Dark Trooper that was responsible for carrying out policing duties in towns and cities deemed important to Imperial infrastructure.
These units would deploy armament that could not typically be found in local police forces and even in local Imperial garrisons.



# Oppressor-7 class Dark Trooper
The Oppressor-7 class Dark Trooper was a more advanced variant of the Exogen-class Dark Trooper.
Appearing mostly the same and conducting the same duties as the Exogen-class Dark Trooper, this model simply had more advanced AI programming that allowed it to calculate tactical risks and decisions far more efficiently.



# Oppressor-9 class Dark Trooper
The Oppressor-9 class Dark Trooper was in all ways except one the exact same as the Oppressor-7 class Dark Trooper.
It was also responsible for policing duties; it was simply outfitted with heavier armour than the Exogen and Oppressor-7 variants.



# Glory-class Dark Trooper
The Glory-class Dark Trooper was unique in its battlefield duties in that unlike most other models this model was designed for defensive purposes.
The Glory-class Dark Trooper undertook the task of defending Imperial cities against attack, specialising in urban warfare and defensive maneuvers and notably carried the T-21 repeating blaster.



# Urban Assault class Dark Trooper
The Urban Assault class Dark Trooper performed the opposite duties of the Glory-class Dark Troopers, whereas the Glory-class Dark Trooper was designed to defend and hold cities utilizing advanced urban warfare tactics, the Urban Assault class Dark Trooper was designed to invade and capture cities while making use of advanced urban warfare tactics and assault programming.



# Victory-class Dark Trooper
Nothing is known about this Dark Trooper variant but due to its appearances and lack of weaponry in comparison to other models it can be theorized that it served a somewhat similar purpose carried out by Triumphant-class Dark Trooper, simply there to intimidate and perform ceremonial duties.



# Black Hole Dark Trooper
The Black Hole Dark Trooper was utilized by Imperial Intelligence to carry out operations alongside the Shadow Stormtrooper division.
This particular variant had stealth programming, a rarity amongst Dark Troopers and utilized this programming to conduct missions sensitive to Imperial Intelligence.



# Purge Trooper
Not to be confused with the Inquisitorial Purge Trooper of the same name, this Dark Trooper model was a unique variant of the Phase II Dark Trooper class.
Outfitted with additional armaments and protection that would put an AT-ST to shame, these Purge Troopers were designed by the Techno Union and later commissioned by Imperial Intelligence to conduct advanced operations that involved the killing of force-wielders.


This model was so successful in its duties it served as a direct inspiration for the Phase III Dark Trooper model and many of its designs would be carried over into the Phase III project.



# Elite Dark Trooper
Elite Dark Troopers were variants of the Phase II Dark Trooper model that were designed to be even more physically terrifying than other models.
This however was not what earned them the title of ‘’elite’’, what made them elite was their advanced AI programming.
The Elite Dark Trooper was able to think faster and more efficiently than even seasoned Imperial Special Forces soldiers and would often act as one-man armies when infiltrating and disabling Rebel Cells.



# Part VI: Arsenal & armament
Dark Troopers would utilize the finest Imperial weaponry and be crafted from some of the strongest armour plating in the Imperial War Machine.
In particular the Phase Two and Phase Three models could provide so much firepower and withstand so much damage that they would often be a substitute for numerous Stormtrooper squadrons and even light armoured vehicles.

The Phase Zero model, who would see combat until even after the fall of the Galactic Empire would make use of ARC Trooper and Commando weaponry, such as the Commando blaster pistol, Arc casters, E-11s, jump packs and other such high grade weaponry.

The later generations would make use of assault cannons, wrist rockets, jump packs, rocket launchers of various models, shoulder mounted grenade launchers and high powered automatic weapons.
The design of the Dark Trooper was never intended for silent deployments, instead the method of deployment was often that of swift, shock assaults that would overpower the enemy before they could react, or to punch a hole in heavily entrenched enemy positions, often making use of their jump pack in the process.



# Part VI: Destruction
The Dark Trooper Project was headquartered on an Imperial Research base known as ‘’Arc hammer’’.
When Dark Troopers began making appearances across the galaxy, Mon Mothma, leader of the Rebel Alliance would dispatch a young Rebel Intelligence and SpecForce operative by the name of Kyle Katarn who had recently defected from the Empire to locate and destroy ‘’Arc hammer’’.

Kyle Katarn would achieve his objective and in the process he would personally kill General Mohc, thus putting an end to the production of new Dark Troopers.
Emperor Palpatine expressed great frustration at the program’s failure and would cease all funding for new models.


Despite this, many Dark Troopers would survive until the end of the Galactic Empire and even into the era of the New Republic, standing as a true testament to the durability and efficiency of the mechanised weapons.
