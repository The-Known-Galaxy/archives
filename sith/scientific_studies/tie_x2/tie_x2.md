# Origins
As the Galactic Civil War escalated, the shortcomings of the standard TIE Fighter became glaringly evident.
Its limited ground assault capabilities left a substantial gap in the Imperial Navy's starfighter fleet, particularly in heavy bombing operations, and the call for a more advanced and robust alternative grew louder.
Sienar Fleet Systems, well-versed in supplying the Imperial fleet, saw an opportunity to innovate and fill this strategic gap.
This realization gave birth to the TIE/x2 project, an initiative aimed at developing a starfighter that could deliver heavy payloads and operate effectively in hostile situations.

The project was a collaboration of talented engineers and military tacticians, who built upon the lessons learned from combat encounters, insights from reconnaissance reports, and the evolving dynamics of interstellar warfare.
The goal was to create a starfighter that was not only a bomber but also capable of executing precision strikes to disrupt enemy formations and break through fortified defenses.
The road to the TIE/x2's creation was paved with challenges, as the team grappled with the intricacies of integrating a dual hull design and balancing enhanced firepower with maneuverability.
Despite these hurdles, their tenacity paid off, and the first TIE/x2 models emerged, ready for battle.
These starfighters were swiftly deployed to the front lines and proved their worth in the subsequent engagements, providing a tangible validation of the strategic need that spurred their creation.
The TIE/x2’s development stands as a testament to the Empire's commitment to tactical innovation and adaptability in its bid to maintain galactic dominance.

# Imperial Use
Battle of Yavin:
In the Battle of Yavin, TIE/x2s were deployed to deter the Rebel's X-Wings and Y-Wings, as well as to deliver devastating payloads to Rebel command and control structures, disrupting their communication and coordination.

Siege of Lothal:
During the Siege of Lothal, the TIE/x2 was vital in the Empire's strategy to subdue the planet.
It rained down destruction on key defensive installations, weakening the Rebel defenses and clearing the path for Imperial ground forces.

Battle of Hoth:
The TIE/x2 also played a pivotal role in the Battle of Hoth, performing targeted bombing runs against Echo Base while simultaneously engaging in aerial combat against the Rebel Snowspeeders.
The Bomber's heavy firepower and tough armor ensured the Rebel's defenses were significantly weakened, paving the way for the Empire's victory.



# Design and Technology
The TIE/x2 possessed the characteristic solar panels and spherical cockpit found in TIE starfighters, but with an added distinct feature of a second hull pod.
The twin hull design, where one pod was dedicated to the pilot and flight systems, and the other accommodated the bomber's ordnance bay, stood as a unique feature.

Length: 7.9 meters
Height: 5.4 meters
Hull: Reinforced durasteel
Cargo Capacity: Depending on ordnance
Wingspan: 10.6 meters
Maximum Atmospheric Speed: 850 km/h
Engine: Twin P-s5.6 Twin Ion Engines
Shields: No standard shields



# Ship Armament
The TIE/x2 was heavily armed and carried an impressive payload.
It was equipped with two forward-facing laser cannons for self-defense and had a high-capacity ordnance pod that could be loaded with a wide array of explosive munitions.

Exact weaponry:
2x SFS L-s1 laser cannons
Various ordnance: Proton bombs, concussion missiles, thermal detonators



# Uses and Role in Ground Assault
The TIE/x2 was essential for ground assaults and sieges.
Its capacity for delivering a variety of heavy payloads was crucial for demolishing heavily fortified structures, clearing the way for Imperial troops.
This combination of bombing capabilities and strafing potential made it a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.
The mere presence of a squadron of TIE/x2s could significantly tip the balance in the Empire's favor, often deterring resistance before it could even begin.
Its role was crucial in expanding and maintaining the Empire's hold over the galaxy.
