# Overview

Kolto was a naturally generated liquid that was seen in the water of the nautical world of Manaan, with higher concentrations found in rifts and chasms on the floor of the seas that covered the world.
It was highly effective in both medical treatment and general healing, and it had been especially sought after during the time of the Jedi Civil War.
Despite it holding significance in the war efforts for both the Republic and Recan’s Sith Empire, it had lost value over time with the synthetic and easily made bacta replacing it as the mainstream healing liquid.

# History of Kolto

According to Selkath folklore, the inhabitants of Manaan, kolto was said to have originated from a large Firaxan shark named the Progenitor, which had been said to have been responsible for creating it.
However, according to Republic scientists Kono Nolan and Sami, the shark had actually reached its great size and old age due to long-term consumption of highly concentrated kolto.

During the time of the Jedi Civil War, kolto was one of the most highly valued one-of-a-kind materials that was one of the many deciding factors in the war.
However, the Selkath had monopolised the opportunities, remaining neutral and forcing an agreement between Sith and Jedi while they were stationed on Manaan to have an equal distribution of the product.
This did not mean that there was total peace, as there was tension between the two factions and there were often conflicts behind the backs of the Selkath.
Not only that, a secret project dealt with Republic emissaries and Selkath officials saw the creation of a facility to harvest Kolto in the Hrakert Rift due to the fear the officials had of the Sith and their abilities.

After the Jedi Civil War and until the Galactic Civil War, kolto had slowly lost its value in the market and means of production over time, losing to the cheaper and more mass-produced bacta.
Due to this, the economy of Manaan collapsed due to its one reliable source of income becoming obsolete.

At some point in the reign of the Galactic Empire, Emperor Palpatine knew of kolto’s existence as a healing product and its historical importance.
He ordered the invasion of Manaan and enslaved the Selkath on the planet, turning it into his large-scale resort and exploiting the supply of kolto to use as a cheap alternative to normal Bacta.
