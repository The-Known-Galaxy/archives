# Overview
Suluk was a group of modified Beta-class ETR-3 Escort Transports established at the Imperial research station Obsidian as part of the TIE Experimental Project.
The Rebel Alliance's first documented encounter with Suluk came when a pair of A-wings noticed a distress call from Calico in a nearby convoy while escorting a staff transfer through the Belat system.
Answering the distress call, the A-wings located the convoy to be under invasion from TIE Bizarros, and the escort vehicles of Suluk lurking at the fringes of the battle site.
In the following mission, Rebel Z-95s damaged one of Suluk, subsequently disabling it, and it was brought back to the calamari cruiser Liberty for examination.
It was discovered that the life support systems on board the vehicles were rigged to "malfunction" if the vessel were ever disabled, slaughtering all aboard and presumably keeping the Suluk's function a secret.
Regardless, further investigation unveiled that these ships acted as control ships from which human pilots could remotely manage the TIE prototypes.
Even though it was defended by a prototype, it was mysteriously absent during the attack on the Bretie facility.
However, they reappeared during the surprise on the Liberty and the final battle on Obsidian Station.
When a rebel invasion ended the project, Suluk's remaining vehicles were destroyed along with the research station.
