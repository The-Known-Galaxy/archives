# Overview
The Sith War Droids were battle droids employed by the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War, these droids consisted of the following 2 variants: Sith war droid Mark I & Sith war droid Mark II.
Mark I was notably used during the Battle of Alderaan, whilst Mark II was notably used during the Sacking of Coruscant.

# Mark I War Droids
The Mark I Sith war droids were battle droids that consisted of heavy armour plating, four legs with pointed ends, and arm-mounted dual blasters on both of their arms.
The Mark I war droids moved slowly, likely due to their heavy armour plating; They were however able to cross rugged and inhospitable terrain more easily than other battle droid types due to their tapered leg ends.

The Mark I Sith war droids were manufactured by the Colicoid Creation Nest, they are well known for their deployment together with the Sith at the Battle of Alderaan.



# Mark II War Droids
The Mark II Sith war droids were battle droids employed by the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War, they were created later than their Mark I variant and they were first deployed during the Sacking of Coruscant; they remained of importance after the sacking to keep control of Coruscant’s occupied levels.
The Mark II Sith war droids had three legs and four arm-mounted blasters; they were bulkier and larger than their Mark I counterpart.
