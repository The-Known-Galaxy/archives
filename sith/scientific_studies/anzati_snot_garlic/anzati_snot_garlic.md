# Overview
Anzati snot garlic is a genus of garlic known to be delicious when cooked, as well as a treatment for Syrox parasite infestations.

# Description
Anzati snot garlic is a seasoning with quite the fluid history behind its planetary origin.
While scholars debate whether this vegetable came from Anzat or Monsolar, the widely accepted theory is that it was originally found on Monsolar, but first cooked, and eventually claimed as their own by the Anzat.
The garlic was used as a folk remedy to treat the incredibly invasive Echinococcus subspecies: Syrox, also known as “Wolf Worms of Monsolar.” The garlic was extremely effective against these worms, as they would be attracted to the scent of the plant and would crawl out from the host’s oral orifice towards the Anzati snot garlic.

Anzati snot garlic was just as much a delicious seasoning as it was an effective cure.
Cooked alongside Shaak meat, space carrots, Ojomian onions, and Delton spice wine, it would make a delectable meal that anyone from a Coruscanti smuggler to Nabooan royalty would be unable to resist.
