# Origins
The TIE Aggressor emerged as a response to the evolving challenges faced by the Galactic Empire during its dominance in the galaxy.
Developed by Sienar Fleet Systems, the TIE Aggressor was designed to address the limitations of the standard TIE fighter, which proved to be inadequate in certain combat scenarios.
It was during the Galactic Civil War that this advanced starfighter came into existence, aiming to bolster the Empire's ground assault capabilities and counter the increasingly skilled Rebel starfighter pilots.

The project's origins can be traced back to the Imperial Navy's demand for a more versatile and resilient TIE variant that could handle various mission profiles, including supporting ground forces during planetary campaigns and engaging enemy starfighters with superior efficiency.
The TIE Aggressor's development commenced at specialized research facilities deep within the core worlds, shrouded in secrecy to safeguard its advanced technology from falling into the hands of the Rebel Alliance.
