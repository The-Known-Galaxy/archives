# Overview

The Terminus class Destroyer was mostly used by the Sith Empire during the Cold War and Galactic War alongside the Harrower class Dreadnought as a capital ship.
Although it was classified as a capital ship, the ship's firepower was nothing in comparison to any other capital ship at the time, which is why it was mostly used as a support-type ship by the Imperial Navy.
Because of how easy it was to produce a Terminus class Destroyer, the ship was mostly stationed on captured planets to save more capable ships for skirmishes.
Currently, there are two known types of the Terminus class Destroyer; the first one being the Ascendant Spear commanded by Darth Karrid, it was modeled after the Terminus class frame and had firepower similar to the Harrower class Dreadnought.
The second type of the Terminus class Destroyer has no recorded name but it was present during the Meridian Complex Assault, in which the ship was modified to have reactors and engines that used the substance called Isotope-5, one of the rarest substances.
The Terminus class Destroyer's design is similar to a Gage-class transport ship, they were practically the same ship but with differences in size and firepower; it was expected that the Terminus class Destroyer's design would be based on the Gage-class transport ship as the Imperial navy needed a new capital ship that could also act as a transport and support ship.
Due to their similar designs, the Terminus class Destroyer and Gage-class transport ships were normally used together in the Imperial Navy.
