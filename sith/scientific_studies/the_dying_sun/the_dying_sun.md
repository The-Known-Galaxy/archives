# Overview
The Dying Sun was used by Darth Glovoc as a flagship during the Jedi Civil War.
It was an Interdictor-Class Cruiser used by the Sith Empire.
Glovoc had imagined a world in his sleep, and linked it to the Luire system.
He immediately set course and flew there using the Dying Sun, to investigate this new and unknown world.
While sleeping, Glovoc attempted to get a closer look at this planet, but found himself unable to view its grounds.
After arriving in the system, Glovoc headed to the planet Nyriaan, which he believed was the one he saw in his visions.
After moving closer, the ship attempted to run a scan, which alerted the Galactic Republic who in turn sent out a fleet to attack.

Due to Glovoc’s intense focus on the planet, he did not sense the fleet attacking his ship.
Despite best efforts, they simply could not stand their ground and the Dying Sun ended up crippled.
After its destruction, the ship was pulled in by Nriaan’s gravity and torn to bits.
Even though the ship was torn to bits, somehow every crew member survived.
