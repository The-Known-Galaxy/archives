# Hypergate Technology

Hypergates were large pieces of advanced technology that could circumvent mass shadows of planets (the hyperspace energy that planets emit) to allow for near-instant travel across space.
The gates achieved this by creating a hyperspace wormhole and sending the travelers through it.
Each gate constructed had a corresponding gate built in the final destination.

These devices were made exclusively by the Gree, who had enormous pride in their advanced technology.
Amongst the Gree, only the Gree masters knew how to construct and operate the gates.
The Gree eventually refused to create more gates, as to not duplicate what they saw as sacred relics.
This caused the Hypergate technology to be lost.

# History of Hypergates

The devices were first made millennia ago, the date known only by the name “the most ancient and forgotten days.” As more gates were constructed, they were spread all over the Gree Enclave.
However, as the Gree society declined, so did their willingness to replicate and continue to produce the gates.
Soon, the Hypergates began to be neglected and ended up in ruins over the centuries.
By this time, not even the Gree masters fully understood the gates or how to operate them.

# Notable Hypergates

One of the best-known Hypergates was the so-called Grand Hypergate, located on Asation.
The gate housed seven archways, only 5 of which have known destinations.
Two archways lead to the planet Gree, while the other three lead to Te Hasa, Malanose, and Licha In.
The gate’s Grandmaster had forgotten how to operate it, so the Grand Hypergate remained dormant and became a historical landmark.
