# Overview
The Outrider is a famous YT-2400 Light Freighter owned and modified by Dash Rendar, the ship was famous in the smuggling industry as it was one of the fastest ships in the galaxy and could be used for speedy smuggling.
The ship was originally supplied by the Corellian Engineering Corporation and like all YT-2400s, the Outrider had its cockpit and escape hatch attached to the starboard side of the ship by two braced arms.
Dash Render heavily modified the Outrider by replacing the Outrider's engines with three KonGar KGDefender military-grade ion engines which he stole from the Imperial Academy on Corulag and Dash Rendar also replaced the Outrider's hyperdrive from the factory-issued ones with a modified SoroSuub Griffyn/Y2TG hyperdrive which gave the Outrider a class 0.75 Hyperdrive rating which was faster than an X-wing.
The Outrider looked like an ordinary modified YT-2400 but it was the devil in hiding, the ship was equipped with Dymek heavy turbolaser cannons which were mounted on the dorsal and ventral turrets.
The Outrider still had the standard issued Corellian 1D servo mounts which gave it a one hundred and eighty degree range of fire above and underneath the ship and they were also modified by Rendar to give them more range and fire-power.
The Outrider also had concussion missile launchers built into the cockpit tube and each launcher had approximately three missiles.
