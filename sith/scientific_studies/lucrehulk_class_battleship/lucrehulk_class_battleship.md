# Overview
The Lucrehulk-class battleship was the main capital ship of the Trade Federation's Trade Defense Force.
Most Lucrehulks were altered from massive cargo haulers.
Upgraded and modified versions were subsequently used by the CIS Navy, the Separatist holdouts, the Alliance to repair the Republic, the Corporate Sector Authority, and the Killik Colony.

At over three kilometers in diameter, the massive vessel looked like a donut shape that was skipping a section of its rim and it had a central sphere that contained the ship's bridge and reactor bodies.
The front void of the craft had two mammoth docking bays on either flank, which were striped with forward docking claws.
These massive cargo ships had been produced for many years by the Trade Federation to transport cargo between planets and were an important asset to their business.
