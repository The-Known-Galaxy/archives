# Overview

In order to save expenditures while still offering a vessel of comparable caliber to the regular TIE Fighter, Sienar created the TIE Lambda.
The Empire was in disarray following the death of Emperor Palpatine at the Battle of Endor when it happened.
The NEO Empire was founded as a result of the alliance of imperial warlords from all over the galaxy.

# History

The Lambda was the first to enter production and was designed to take the place of the TIE Fighter since it has a faster top speed and a stronger hull.
With this new beginning, it was determined to construct new, more powerful fighters to wreak havoc on the New Republic forces.

Life support systems, flight computers, and communications are all installed in the cockpit or pilot's compartment.
At first look, both sides of the cockpit still appear to feature the wing braces from the original TIE designs, however these are actually shield generators.
It is a robust, maneuverable variation of the TIE with a single wing, however the design is said to be somewhat unstable in an environment.
Two chin laser guns make up the Lambda's arsenal.

Due to its modest advantages over the regular TIE and minimal cost reductions, the ship was only produced in small quantities and was never used by any notable squadrons.
The limited number created has been stationed at research facilities where the non-standard parts needed don't put a huge strain on resources and where improvements to this peculiar fighter may be made, possibly yielding something valuable for the Empire.
