# Overview
Bluebell Squish is a flowering moss most similar to the Silene Acaulis species found on Urthha.
Said to have a pleasant smell, it's no wonder how it fell into the favor of botanists.

# Description
Bluebell Squish is a moss-like plant commonly found in dank, damp environments spanning across multiple planets.
Scholars debate over the planetary origin, but most sources point towards Koboh, due to the seeds being primarily found there.
Scholars theorize that some ancient plant lover brought them along on their intergalactic travels, which is how they ended up on incredibly unique planets.
This moss is able to live in these multitude of habitats due to its root sac, which is capable of storing water for dryer seasons or environments.
The root sac swells when absorbing water, and can be an incredibly valuable source of hydration on arid planets.
On top of the expandable root sac rests the Bluebell Squish’s flowers.
These flowers can be found in both blue and yellow hues, and even rarely in violet.
