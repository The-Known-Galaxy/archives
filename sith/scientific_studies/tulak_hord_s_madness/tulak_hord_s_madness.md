Tulak Hord, the Lord of Hate, was a Sith Lord of great power, a Sith that inspired among his enemies and even his comrades.
However, once Hord was killed by his apprentice, Ortan Cela, he was buried in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban, entombed with many of his artifacts, his mask, holocron, and many of his Sith writings.
Tulak Hord’s madness is a mental affliction affecting anyone who came into contact with Hord’s artifacts, due to his manipulation of the dark side.
Many would succumb to madness even centuries after his death; the Madness was unique in a sense that it only affected the weak-willed and drove them into delusions of self-grandeur and inevitably, even the destruction of themselves.
