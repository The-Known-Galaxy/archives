# Overview

The Kumauri Battleship was a creative battleship structure.
The warship was armed with a mass driver that utilized asteroids as artillery for planetary bombardment.
The  Battleship was created around 10,000 BBY by the Kumauri Empire in what were then the Outer Rim Territories.
The structure was originally designed in the frontier systems of Kumauri space and named after the empire's ruler, Vall Kumauri.
The final line in the string of warships was the Cal-class battleship.
Although the Kumauri Empire was quickly overpowered by the Galactic Republic, the Kumauri Battleship structure maintained its threat until the development of sufficient planetary shields and the ship layout was embraced by numerous different space fleets, including the Republic Navy itself.
