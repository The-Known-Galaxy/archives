The Aurora Cannon was an Ancient weapon that was created by the Rakata before the Rakatan Civil War.
At the end of the Infinite Empire, the weapon resided within Section X on Belsavis, The republic prison.
The creators of the Cannon were deemed as their attempt to create anti-orbital weaponry with it possibly being the most powerful one out of all of their attempts at creating the anti-orbital weapon.

During the Galactic War, which was between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, the Dread Guard, who were under orders from the Dread Masters, tried to gain control of the ancient weapon.
The Dread Masters plan was soon spoiled because of the Empire and the Republic.
Both groups had learned of the plans and two strike teams were sent into section X to destroy the ancient weapons energy core, The strike teams were successful in destroying the energy core with ion detonators.
