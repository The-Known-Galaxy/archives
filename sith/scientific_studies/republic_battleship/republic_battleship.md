# Overview

These gigantic ships in the Republic's fleet existed as long metal blocks of the superstructure.
They usually were limited in the middle with one or additional control towers and strengthened in some areas with thick, consistent armor.
Along their flanks were motor banks clustered in "islands'', connected to the main hull.
Separated from these attributes, the battleships had a specific extent of individual arrangement, considerably like the capital vessels of the Mandalorians and the Star Cruisers of the Mon Calamari.
Identical in structure to the larger Republic command craft Reliance I.
These battleships comprised the main attack fleet at the Battle of Koros Major and the Battle of Onderon.
Such ships were even present at the Conclave on Deneba soon after the battle had ended.
