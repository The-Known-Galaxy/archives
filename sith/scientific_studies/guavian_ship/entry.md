# Overview

A contingent of Guavian starships fought in a skirmish in Guavian Death Space after the Colossus intruded on their territory, though most were destroyed.
In 35 ABY, Guavian starships were part of a fleet assembled by Lando Calrissian to assist the Resistance during the battle against the Sith Eternal forces over the planet Exegol.

Then, long before they're spotted, their swarm of ships can launch a fierce attack against a much larger opponent.
