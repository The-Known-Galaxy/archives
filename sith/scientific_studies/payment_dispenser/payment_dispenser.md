# Overview

A payment dispenser was a flat, gray, square machine that could be bolted onto the lid of a GNK-series power droid.
The machine had a series of red, yellow, and white lights on the forward face and mixed wires on top.
On either side of the top externals at the front of the machine, there was a punch disc slot.
When a punched disc was inserted halfway into the slotted disc it would be distributed from the underside of the dispenser.

During the time Obi-Wan Kenobi was in hiding, roughly around 9 BBY, a power droid at Tibidon Station, on the planet Tatooine was equipped with a pay dispenser from which the station's workers contained their wages from at the end of each shift when a whistle connected to the top of the dispenser rang.
When the worker Padu Cherd inserted his disc after one shift he realized that he had only received half his pay, but when he begged for the rest from foreman Groff Ditcher he was terrorized into silence.
Cherd's fellow worker Obi-Wan Kenobi frowned at Ditcher, but eventually accepted his pay from the dispenser without expressing anything.
