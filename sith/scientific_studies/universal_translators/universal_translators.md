# Overview
Universal Translators are electronic devices used mostly by traders and politicians to be able to translate languages and communicate without having to worry about the language barrier.
A Universal Translator cannot function without a language chip; the language chip is a chip that contains a language of choice.
The translator has helped species communicate with other species to resolve any issues through diplomatic means.
Because of the company that developed the Universal Translator, Cybot Galactica, the device was compatible with protocol droids which allowed for more precise translations and a wider broadband receiver range.
The Universal Translator's size is comparable to a standard paperback novel which allowed for it to be carried around easily.
Multiple modifications were made to the device, the most notable being the modification the Empire did; it allowed the Universal Translator to be used by probe droids and assassin droids.
The Universal Translator also had a major feature of allowing discreet listening and private conversations.
