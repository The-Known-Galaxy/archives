# Overview

The Cal-class battleship was the final creation of a warship-type vessel by the Kumauri Empire.
The Cal-class ships were 3 kilometers elongated.
They maintained an armament of turbolasers for ship-to-ship warfare, but their main weapon was a large mass-driver artillery mounted along the top of the hull.
This was an orbital bombardment attack weapon, which was designed to smash its mark with captured asteroids, or different suitable interplanetary debris.
To collect shots for loading the prime weapon, Cal class ships were also equipped with six tractor-beam projectors.
The lineage was initially created around 10,000 BBY by Vall Kumauri, though it was taken by multiple different groups including the galactic republic to utilize.
