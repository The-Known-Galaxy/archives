# Overview
Aura blossoms were typical flora native to Endor, a forest moon orbiting a planet of the same name.
What made this plant so marvellous was its distinctly bright indigo colour; a field of these would appear like the deep blue sea.
Biologically, the flowers had the ability to glow, making them a prominently significant figure within Ewok culture.
These blossoms would be collected for the Ewok’s Festival of Hoods, a prestigious coming-of-age ceremony for their people.
In 3 ABY, there was a misunderstanding made by Wicket Wystri Warrick as he went to find aura blossoms.
He mistakenly thought a patch of Wisties were these aura blossoms due to their similar luminosity.
