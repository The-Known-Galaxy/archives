# Introduction
Sentience was the term used to describe an organism, object, or something that presented some form of intelligence that didn’t formulate only from their instinctive nature.
The species classified as sentient were those that were capable of thinking with reason, being able to communicate through verbal speech or language, and possessing the intelligence to make use of resources, particularly tools.
Sentience was not just applicable to living organisms, as droids and even objects such as artifacts were capable of possessing sentient nature.
Non-sentience was a term to define organisms that did not possess sentient nature, but this did not imply that they were unintelligent.
Some species that relied on their natural survival instinct were classified as non-sentient, sometimes even sub-sentient depending on their awareness level.

# Sentient Beings
The Sith possess sentience given their feats throughout history.
They were able to speak with reason through the form of written and verbal language as well as utilize the resources provided to them in their landscapes to craft weapons and begin their alchemy.
That wasn’t the only instance of sentience being displayed among the Sith, but the sect of Dark Side wielders also managed to create an entire tradition and philosophical culture in the name of what they stood for.


Non-living beings can also be classified as sentient, even artifacts such as the Darkstaff.
The Darkstaff presented enough intellect to understand what was being spoken to it by other sentient creatures, even displaying acts of anger if the staff felt as if other beings were a pest.
Not only that, but the Darkstaff relied on the suffering of others to bring itself joy, believing it had the right to decide when the life of a creature should come to an end.
Due to its ability to understand emotion, comprehend concepts such as compassion, and perceive communication, the Darkstaff is classified as a sentient object.



# Sub-Sentient Beings
Sith hounds spawned from Sith alchemy known as the Tuk’ata were considered sub-sentient due to their methods of communication.
While the Tuk’ata did not communicate through means of verbal speech or even language, they were capable of communication in some manner.
This form of communication was unknown and nobody has ever understood how these Sith hounds translated to each other.
Tuk’ata can perceive Sith language on a limited scale likely because these creatures were created from the alchemy of the Sith.
Even with their ability to understand Sith language to an extent and wield the intelligence to communicate with each other, it is not enough to classify them as complete sentient creatures.



# Non-Sentient Beings
Sith familiar is a type of scavenger bird-like creature also created from Sith Alchemy.
Their non-sentience shows itself from the behavior these obedient creatures display to their masters.
Sith familiar did not act on its own but instead by the will of its master.
The master would be capable of seeing and hearing whatever the ravager happened to.
These birds may have been Sithspawn as well as force sensitive, but they lacked the independent intelligence to directly communicate, display or understand emotion, or make use of tools.
The closest feat to resource usage was their ability to use Force powers projected to them by their masters but this was entirely from the master’s will and not the familiar’s prowess.
