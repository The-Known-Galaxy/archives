# Overview
The Eclipse-class Dreadnought was a massive star destroyer set to become Emperor Palpatine’s personal flagship.
The Eclipse was a marvel of Imperial engineering, being the largest & most powerful ship ever created.
It was equipped with 550 heavy laser cannons, 500 turbolasers, 75 ion cannons and even a superlaser ?
as powerful as the one found on the Death Star.
In addition, it included gravity well projectors, making retreat an impossibility for its enemies.
Given its massive size, the Eclipse fit 600 tie fighters, 96 tie bombers, 150,000 stormtroopers, 100 AT-AT walkers, 5 pre-made deployable garrisons and an entire legion of Royal Guards.
The ship was not without flaws, however.
It began construction in 0 BBY and took *10 years to complete.
On top of this, its size and myriad of weapons meant it required a crew of around 700,000 personnel, with 4000 being gunners.

# History
The Eclipse began construction sometime around 0 BBY (exact timeframe unknown) and, as stated previously, took nearly a decade to finish construction.
As such, it was never deployed in the Battle of Endor as was never put to use by Palpatine during his initial reign.
4 years after the Battle of Yavin, the ship was taken by crime lord Tyber Zaan in order to retrieve data from its memory banks.
The ship was later abandoned by Zaan and moved to the secret Imperial Fortress world Byss.
Once its construction was completed, the reborn Emperor Palpatine took command of the vessel, finally putting it to use as his own personal flagship.
Palpatine would use the ship to wreak havoc on the New Republic in 10ABY on their stronghold on Da Soocha during the Battle of Pinnacle Base.
During the battle, the Eclipse was destroyed in a Force Storm created by Palpatine, into which Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa redirected the dreadnought.
