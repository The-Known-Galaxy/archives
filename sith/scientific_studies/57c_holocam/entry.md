# Overview

The 57C Holocam was known as one of the automatic cameras and was manufactured by Merr-Sonn Munitions.
It was utilized by Imperial forces on the first death star for surveillance purposes, such as observing the detention blocks.
The 57C recorded holographic images of its targets and had 360-degree coverage of the target area.
Though the scanners recorded perfect images, the 57C was vulnerable to Han Solo’s, Luke Skywalker’s, and Chewbacca’s blaster shots as the screens would break upon being shot.

The parts of the Holocam included an audio pickup, motion sensors, signal transmitters, data relays, visual scanners, audio matrix, and screens.
