# Overview

The Midi-Chlorians were a chemical compound that was inside every living cell.
These microbes were the reason why many people lived, as they would make a strong link between life and the Force.
As said by Qui-Gon Jinn, without the Midi-Chlorians, life could not exist.

# Information

Midi-Chlorians were sentient and intelligent microbes relevant to someone’s life.
This chemical compound was found on every planet that supported life, for example, Naboo.
Midi-Chlorians would give information about someone’s potential in the Force according to their amount of Midi-Chlorians.
If someone possessed 2,000 or fewer Midi-Chlorians, they would be classified as non-Force-Sensitive persons.
Instead, if their Midi-Chlorians count was above 2,000, they would be classified as Force-Sensitives.

The only way someone could know their amount of Midi-Chlorians was through a blood test, though they wouldn’t give the specific amount.
Another way to identify Force-Sensitive users was through the Force detector device, an artifact used by the Galactic Empire.
The Jedi Order would find Force-Sensitive children through the Jedi Healers, a Jedi Knight specialization that served the Medical Corps within the Jedi Order, and the non-Jedi medical circles.
Darth Plagueis the wise was known for almost discovering the way to manipulate Midi-Chlorians, but was stopped by his Sith Apprentice, Darth Sidious.
Plagueis initially started out investigating species and using them for experiments, but he later experimented with Darth Venamis, his Sith Master’s secret apprentice.
He discovered that to reach immortality, he didn’t have to add more Midi-Chlorians to someone’s body.
Instead, he had to impose his will on them.
Eventually, he succeeded with small creatures and slaves but couldn’t do it with a person.
In his book, Plagueis wrote that to reach immortality someone had to focus to impose their will on the microbe.
The progress Darth Plagueis made was continued by Darth Drear.
