# Overview
The TIE Vanguard was a starfighter designed for spying and scouting, along with gathering intelligence, and was greatly used during the Imperial Era to obtain information on outside movements.
It was made based on the TIE/rc model starfighter, which was used for other purposes instead.
Unlike other TIE models, the Vanguard had many antennas used for communications between vast distances, with solar ionization panels at its sides and rendered outwards to prevent information leaks or interferences.
The Vanguard wasn’t really weaponized: it had only one laser cannon, and was just slightly protected with shields to defend the intel gathered.
