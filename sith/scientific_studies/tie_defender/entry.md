# Origins

The TIE Defender was conceived during a period of increasing desperation for the Galactic Empire.
The Rebel Alliance was growing more formidable, and their starfighters, especially the X-Wing and the Y-Wing, were proving to be more than a match for the standard TIE fighter.
The Empire needed a starfighter that could not only match but exceed the capabilities of these Rebel ships.
Recognizing this, the Imperial Navy initiated the TIE Defender project.
Spearheaded by Sienar Fleet Systems, the project was given considerable resources and prioritized over other initiatives.
The mandate was clear: to create a TIE starfighter variant that would serve as the Empire's ultimate weapon in space warfare.

The TIE Defender project was characterized by ambitious goals and groundbreaking innovations.
The project took a holistic approach to starfighter design, addressing every aspect from offensive capabilities to defensive measures, speed, and maneuverability.
The Empire's top engineers and scientists were pulled in to ensure the project's success.
They worked tirelessly, constantly refining and adjusting their designs in response to feedback from rigorous testing and simulated combat scenarios.
As the project advanced, it was clear the TIE Defender was set to be unlike any other starfighter in the Imperial fleet.
From its unique tri-wing design to the inclusion of deflector shields and hyperdrive, every aspect of the TIE Defender was meticulously planned and executed to create a starfighter that would ensure the Empire's dominance in space combat.

# Imperial Use

Battle of Jakku:
The Battle of Jakku, one of the last large-scale engagements of the Galactic Civil War, saw the TIE Defender once again playing a critical role.
With the Empire on the back foot and the New Republic gaining ground, the TIE Defenders were thrown into the fray to hold back the tide.
Throughout the battle, the TIE Defenders were in the thick of the action.
They engaged in intense dogfights with New Republic starfighters, their advanced armaments and robust shielding giving them the edge in these encounters.
The TIE Defenders also attacked New Republic capital ships, utilizing their speed and firepower to inflict significant damage.

Battle of Endor:
The TIE Defender truly proved its worth during the pivotal Battle of Endor.
This decisive confrontation between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance saw the TIE Defender at the forefront of the Imperial fleet, defending the second Death Star.
The starfighters were deployed en masse, presenting a formidable line of defense against the oncoming Rebel fleet.
The TIE Defenders engaged Rebel starfighters in high-stakes dogfights, their advanced targeting systems and powerful weaponry proving essential in combating the agile X-wings and resilient Y-wings.

# Design and Technology

The TIE Defender showcased several unique features.
Its tri-wing design enhanced maneuverability and stability, enabling intricate combat movements.
Its hull, built from reinforced durasteel and composite alloys, ensured strength, durability, and speed.
Unlike most TIE models, the Defender incorporated a Sirplex Z-9 deflector shield generator and a SFS N-s6.1 hyperdrive system.
The deflector shields offered robust defense, while the hyperdrive enabled faster-than-light travel, making the Defender suitable for independent long-range missions.

Length: 9.20 meters
Height: 3.81 meters
Hull: Reinforced durasteel / composite alloys
Cargo Capacity: 150 kilograms
Wingspan: 7.20 meters
Maximum Atmospheric Speed: 1,680 km/h
Engine: SFS I-s3a Solar
Shields: Sirplex Z-9 deflector

# Ship Armament

The TIE Defender's armament comprised four L-s9.3 laser cannons for excellent destructive power, primarily mounted on the wings.
It also featured two M-g-2 warhead launchers with a flexible payload that could include concussion missiles, proton torpedoes, or ion missiles, adapting to different mission profiles.
The Defender also incorporated two NK-3 ion cannons to disable rather than destroy targets.

Exact weaponry:
4x SFS L-s9.3 laser cannons
2x Borstel NK-3 ion cannons
2x SFS M-g-2 General Purpose Warhead Launchers

# Uses and Role in Ground Assault

The TIE Defender was primarily deployed to ensure Imperial space superiority.
It's not only a dogfighter; the Defender can take on capital ships thanks to its potent armament and robust shielding.
The starfighter's unmatched agility and firepower made it a significant threat to any opposition, allowing the Empire to control space around key installations and during critical battles.
This played a vital role in maintaining the Empire's dominance and suppressing insurrections across the galaxy.
