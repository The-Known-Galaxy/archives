# Information

This starfighter’s shielding was weak, and it was the reason the interceptor would last a maximum of 36 hours.
The Mk VI.
interceptor’s advantages were its 4 laser cannons that were divided into 2 parts of the starfighter, the wingtips, and the inside of the chin.
The laser cannons were used by the only pilot in the starfighter to engage in swarm tactics.
