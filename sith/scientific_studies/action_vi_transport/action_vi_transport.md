# Description

Action VI Transport was also known as the bulk transport.
It was a transport ship that was created by the Corellian Engineering Corporation.
These ships had no defense systems, making them an easy target for opponents of their owners.
That is why they needed to be used only in convoys and be protected by other cruisers.
This cruiser was used mostly by the Galactic Empire of Darth Sidious, due to it being a cheap transport way.
These ships were also used by the Galactic Alliance, but most of them were stolen from their sworn enemies, the Empire.
A well known Action VI Transport was the Wild Karrde of Talon Karrde.
It was a version of the cruiser which was modified, had futuristic technology, advanced durability, and defense systems, and could be used as a home.
