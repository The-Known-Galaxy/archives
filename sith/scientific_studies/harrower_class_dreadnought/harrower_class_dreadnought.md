# Overview
The Harrower class Dreadnought, was mostly used during the Great Galactic War, Cold War and Galactic War.
It served as the backbone of the Imperial Navy and as the capital ship of numerous fleets.
Due to the massive amounts of materials and power used to build the Harrower class Dreadnought, it resulted in a ship that could engage in battle without the help of other ships.
The Taerab Ship Manufacturing produced the Harrower class Dreadnought, the same company that researched a new hyperdrive that was capable of cutting fuel costs in half.
With such an amazing and influential manufacturing company, multiple Harrower class Dreadnought could be produced in the span of a few years, even though it required massive amounts of materials and energy.
Like many other ships, the Harrower class Dreadnought underwent several tests and alterations which resulted in seven different types, each with varying purpose.
With the number of materials and energy required to produce the ship, it was a guarantee that the Harrower class destroyer would be the peak of destructive power when it was made.
The Harrower class Dreadnought is also capable of transporting troops and supplies on a planet for missions.
The design of the Harrower class destroyer is similar to the Imperial Star Destroyer and Venator class Star Destroyer, with the ship having a triangle shape but unlike the ISD and Venator, the ship has a split down the middle where the hangar bay is located.
Though the design is unusual for others, it is a typical design for Sith warships during the Old Republic Era.
The Harrower class Dreadnought was decommissioned years after the Galactic War ended which proves that it can keep up with modern ships.
