# Overview
The TIE M3 was a decently great new starfighter for the Empire as the TIE M3 was a new and improved bomber ship that was a cross between a TIE and Intercepter but had the speed of an Interceptor but not as fast as a normal TIE Interceptor.
The TIE M3 looked just like an Interceptor however the TIE M3 had Warhead Launchers instead, This TIE was only an experimental series leaving it discontinued after all were destroyed.

# History
During the rise of the Galactic Empire the newly developed TIE Experimental M3 was produced but would not be used for war until Admiral Yamarus ordered a decoy convoy to steal one of the TIE Experimentals, resulting in a major loss in the factory that they were made in.
Because of this the stolen TIE Experimental was used to disable the life support of many ships and destroyed the factory resulting in the loss of the continuation of the TIE Experimentals M3.



# Appearance
TIE Experimentals were similar to TIE Interceptors with pointed wings that allow the ship to sooth fast through space, and a sphere in the center of the ship where the pilot would go, however the middle of the two pointed wings on he side had an extra addition to it hence why it wasn’t a TIE Interceptor, it was a Warhead Launcher.



# Equipment
The TIE Experimental had speed, Turrets and a Warhead Launcher.
