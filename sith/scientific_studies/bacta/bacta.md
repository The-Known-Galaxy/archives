# Overview

Bacta is a medical substance created from a mixture of kavam, alazhi, ambori fluid, and vraxitia renanicus.
Bacta was created by the Vratix with the sole purpose of healing injuries rapidly, Bacta was normally placed in Bacta tanks where the person enters.
Bacta's immense healing properties allowed it to reconnect broken bones, it also allowed the healing of any critical injuries.
Bacta is described to be slimy by individuals who have used it, which is why sedatives are first injected to make the individual slowly go into a meditation state.
Bacta is produced by two major companies, Zaltin Corps and Xuchpra Corps.
Although both companies are fighting over dominance in the Bacta market, their common goal is to be able to spread Bacta around the galaxy.
During the High Republic Era, Bacta was highly used by the Republic due to it being more powerful than the healing substance they used, juvan.
Bacta can have side effects, with some feeling worse for days and not being able to feel anything.
