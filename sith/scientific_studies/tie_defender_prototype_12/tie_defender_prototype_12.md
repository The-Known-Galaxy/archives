# Overview
Prototype 12 was one of 12 TIE Defender prototypes created by Grand Admiral Zaarin.
Prototypes were to be picked up by Cargo ferry group Mssan after being attacked by Rebel forces.
Proto 12 was taken to Admiral Thrawn, who constructed a new starfighter to counter the Defender, the Missile Boat.


When Grand Admiral Zaarin betrayed the Empire and failed to kidnap Emperor Palpatine, he had a contingency plan to gain the upper hand in the war against the Empire.
He attempted to loot his XQ6 platform for his research but was defeated by a Loyalist force led by Colonel Maarek Stele.
His attempt to destroy the TIE Defender's technology was thwarted when Proto 12 and its sister ship Proto 11 escaped the station.
The Proto 11 freighter was to join the converted Hashim corvette group.


However, they were ambushed and neutralized by Rneekii pirates.
Another pirate faction named Nami captured Hashim 1 and stole Proto 11 before Maarek Stele intervened.
Proto-12 was taken to Admiral Thrawn, who was building a new starfighter, a missile boat, to counter the Defenders.
By the time the fighter was commissioned, Tarrak had commissioned his chief scientist to create his own TIE Defender, with plans to disseminate the technology.
