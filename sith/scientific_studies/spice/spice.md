# Overview
Sadness shrouded the galaxy, for it was plagued by an illegal substance known as Spice.
It enticed many but caused destruction in its wake - from Wookiee slaves working until their deaths mining medicinal spice that would be converted into recreational drugs at Kessel's spice mines to other planetary systems like Ryloth and Naboo where variations of the narcotic ryll existed.
Sansanna spelled another type of tragedy throughout all parts of space-time with countless lives ruined or irreversibly altered forever due to this dark force known only as Spice.
