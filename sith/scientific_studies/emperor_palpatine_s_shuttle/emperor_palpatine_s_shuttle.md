# Overview
Emperor Palpatine’s shuttle was a Lambda-class shuttle and was considered crewed and well-guarded by only a few of the Emperor’s Royal Guardsmen.
Palpatine’s shuttle had a featured cloaking device that was marked by a gray stripe on the nose of the shuttle.

# History
Palpatine utilized this shuttle often on several trips throughout the galaxy.
The shuttle was at least hit once with Emperor Palpatine inside due to the premature and unintentional shooting by attempted assassin Raygar.
Raygar attempted to aim at a pod of  Ewok couples, Latara couples, and Teebo couples.
However, Raygar was punished by the Emperor for “high treason” after the crime, later personally delivering it.

During the Battle of Korriban, the Renegade Squadron was tasked to steal a data pack within Palpatine’s shuttle during the latter’s pilgrimage at Korriban, one of the ambush plans for preparations for the upcoming Battle of Endor.

Palpatine utilized this shuttle to travel to the second Death Star that orbited over Endor.
Upon arrival, the shuttle disembarked at Hangar 272 with a large number of Imperial Troopers such as technicians, droids, and military personnel honoring “his majesty” arrival along with air parades outside the station and personnel.
However, during the Battle of Endor, the battle station was destroyed along with the shuttle.
