# Overview

The IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tank, otherwise known as the IG-227 droid tank, hailfire droid, wheel droid, or simply Hailfire, was a model of droid tank crafted and produced by the Haor Chall Engineering Corporation, which was subservient to the InterGalactic Banking Clan and the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars, and to the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War.

# Description

The IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tank was able to quickly roll into action, armed with armored missiles, and it was easily identified by its treaded, hoop-like drive wheels.
Its possible speeds were extremely high, making it capable of flattening anything standing in its way.
Hailfire droids were mostly used to eliminate enemy vehicles.
Despite being so fast, they had a weakness in infantry attacks.
Their red photoreceptor eye could rapidly lock onto any target, be it in the air or on land.
Wheel droids carried a pair of Hailfire missile launcher pods, equipped with 15 guided missile warheads, very effective when used on still or slow-moving targets, but with little to no effect on fast targets.
A single warhead was capable of destroying a Low Altitude Assault Transport.
When the missiles were depleted, the droid relied on forward-mounted twin auto-blasters.

# History

The hailfire droid was first manufactured by Haor Chall Engineering Corporation and originally commissioned by the InterGalactic Banking Clan, which needed an increase in debt collection for the IG-series battle droid army prior to the Clone Wars.
During the Separatist Crisis, the Muunilinst Banking Clan donated multiple Hailfires to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which fought in the Separatist Droid Army during the First Battle of Geonosis.
During the war, Hailfire droids were colored in blue to distinguish them as Separatist equipment.
Despite how powerful its presence was on the battlefield, the Hailfire didnâ€™t last long because of the limited number of missiles carried and was soon replaced by the NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer.
During the Galactic Civil War, the Alliance to Restore the Republic adopted these droids.
To have weaponry capable of destroying turrets and vehicles.
