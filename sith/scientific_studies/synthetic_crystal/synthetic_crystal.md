# The Beginning
It is unknown when the Sith and other Dark side groups began using synthetic crystals, though red crystals have been in use since the times of the Old Sith Empire, with notables like Karness Muur and his followers wielding such weapons.
However, at the time, most Sith wielded Sith swords instead of lightsabers, though red lightsabers would become the quality weapon after the reformation of the Empire.
The primary Sith follower to wield a red-bladed weapon before the resurgence of the old Empire was the Dark Jedi Haazen, because the previous Dark Lord in power; Exar Kun; and his followers simply continued using their Jedi lightsabers in combat.
Darth Revan and Malak followed suit after they rose to power, making the usage of red-crystals widespread among their Sith followers.
Because of their common use within Revan's Sith Empire, red-hued crystals were marked as the staple of Darksiders.

# The Middle
The primary reason for the usage of synthetic crystals among Sith and other Darksiders was the necessity to remain hidden, as most of the sites where natural crystals suitable for lightsabers may well be gathered were frequented by the Jedi Order.
Eventually, synth-crystal usage among such groups became a convention, with most members considering the creation of an artificial crystal superior to the more passive Jedi method of gathering from natural formations, which was looked on as wishing on the "untamed wilds of space" to supply.
In fact, synthetic crystal creation was viewed by Darksiders to be an indication of greater mastery over the Force.
Conversely, the Jedi frowned on the creation and use of synth-crystals among their initiates, associating this with taking the short and straightforward path, as they believed they must depend upon crystals found naturally.
However, sometimes Jedi were forced to form synth-crystals when a weapon was needed and no present crystals were accessible.
Notable examples include Luke Skywalker, who used a synth-crystal for his first lightsaber, because he had no knowledge of the natural crystals at that time, and his niece Jaina Solo.
Synth-crystals made by the Jedi usually had colors apart from red, to avoid similarities with the Sith.
Skywalker created a green crystal, while Solo produced a violet one.



# The End
In fact, due to Darth Sidious looting or destroying most of the sites where crystals occur naturally, the New Jedi Order had to depend on synth-crystals almost exclusively.
The Imperial Knights crafted their lightsabers that featured synthetic crystals, using knowledge from Sidious' Book of Anger, during a process deprived of ceremony or significance.
To an Imperial Knight, a lightsaber was merely a tool, and their training devoted the maximum amount of attention to fighting in vehicles, bare-handed, and with the Force.
The blades of those lightsabers were uniformly a silver-white color.
Not all red lightsaber crystals were synthetic.
Adegan crystals featuring a red coloration weren't unprecedented; Darth Vader utilized such a crystal in one of his lightsabers.
Red-hued crystals were known to occur naturally within the Crystal Cave on Dantooine, together with blue, green, yellow and violet crystals.
However, unlike the opposite crystals, the red crystals from Dantooine were typically found in unhatched kinrath eggs.
