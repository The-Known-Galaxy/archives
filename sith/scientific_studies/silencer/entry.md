# Overview

The Silencer is a superweapon used by the Sith Empire during the Old Republic Era, it had the power to decimate fleets due to its rapid recharging.
Although unintentional, the Harrower-class Dreadnought's design was compatible with the Silencer.
Instead of a hangar bay, the Sith Empire utilized the design of the Harrower-class Dreadnought and replaced the hangar bay with the Silencer.
The main frame of the Harrower-class Dreadnought was not enough to withstand the sheer force of the Silencer hence why the Sith Empire reinforced and modified the sides of the gap.
The only known Harrower-class Dreadnought mounted with the Silencer is the Doombringer, the flagship of Moff Valion Pyron but the ship was later integrated into Darth Nox's fleet.
Later in the future, most ships mounted with the Silencer was lost due to the Eternal Empire; some ships escaped but could not be contacted.
