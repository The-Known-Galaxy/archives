# Overview

HyperSpace Travel is used a lot during the many wars and for everyday transport from galaxy to galaxy.
HyperSpace Travel is the fastest way to travel as it is faster than the speed of light and must be entered relative to the speed of light using a Hyperdrive.

# Section I

The main theory of the physics of HyperSpace Travel is that it is a different dimension of the space-time continuum.
This form of transport is mainly used by starships as they have the durability to withstand the amount of pressure caused by the high moving speeds.
During HyperSpace Travel, it seemed as though the normal laws of space and time did not apply.
This however would cause problems as the inside of the ship would be moving at faster than the speed of Light, so in order to not have that happen the stasis field was used to slow the passage of time in order for the pilot not to age at the speed of light but only age relative to the real galaxy.
