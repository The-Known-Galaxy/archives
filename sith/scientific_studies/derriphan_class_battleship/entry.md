# Overview

The Derriphan-class battleship was the main ship used by the old Sith Empire.
Most Sith Lords of the period harbored these ships in their massive amount of ships.
By current galactic standards, they were fairly little, sluggish, and bulky.
The Sith battleships, though, were among the most effective and terrifying warships of their time, despite wearing no shields.
One ship was said to surrender only to the firepower of six main Republic warships, thanks to its hefty armor, and even then was able to disable or eliminate at least one of the opposing ships.
The Battleship was equipped with a Hyperdrive, auto blasters, Point Defense medium blaster cannon batteries,  and heavy concussion missile launchers.
The ship is capable of handling a crew of 25 while carrying 6 starfighters and 2 Shuttles.
