# Description
The Gungan energy shield is a personalized model of a standard handheld energy shield, commonly manufactured by the Otoh Gunga Defense League.
Standard energy shields use hydrostatic bubble technology.
This shield would have a screen of energy that was useful for deflecting blaster fire and other physical weapons.
The shields had an oval shaped bubble with a semi transparent purple coloring, and would normally be carried on the wrist of Gungans in the Gungan Grand Army.
The shield would be able to cover the entire body, unlike some other shields on other planets, and would quite easily deflect blaster fire back at the shooter.
This was showcased in the Battle of Naboo.
