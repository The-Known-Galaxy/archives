# Overview

Renthal's Vigilance existed as a Carrack-class light cruiser in Drea Renthal's pirate fleet.
Initially, it had been an Imperial ship designated Vigilance under Captain Darv Eldon.
It was part of the Imperial Squad following the Battle of Nar Shaddaa in 4 BBY.
When the Vigilance penetrated the debris field encircling the moon, it was ambushed by ships of the smugglers' First Strike Element.

After a severe battle with the Hutt ship Dragon Pearl controlled by Mako Spince, Vigilance became damaged to the degree that the shields on the port side went down and the lasers began to score impacts on the hull.
The pirate vessels Too Late Now and Minestra came in to end it off, leaving the Vigilance a crippled wreckage in space and Captain Eldon deceased.
