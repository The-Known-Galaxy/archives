# Overview

Super Star Destroyer was an umbrella word used by both the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to reform the Republic to refer to several categories of enormous Imperial vessels bigger than Imperial Star Destroyers, the biggest of which was the Executor-class Star Dreadnought.

Around the period of the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service evaluated that the Empire maintained more than a dozen Super Star Destroyers including Darth Vader's flagship Executor, including some of the extras like the Arbitrator and the Annihilator.
Palpatine had a few ships of his own which included the Ravager and the Eclipse.
