# Overview

The Sun Crusher was one of the deadliest superweapons to ever be seen.
Not only was it nearly indestructible, but it was so powerful that it could destroy entire star systems regularly.
It is so strong that it has survived hits from things like an Imperial-class Star Destroyer, a hit from the Death Star, and a war during the Skirmish of Maw, which all of these events left the Sun Crusher in need of no repair.
It primarily used a resonance torpedo as a weapon, strong enough to leave the Sun Crusher unstable after use.
The Sun Crusher was also flyable, and was even capable of hyperdrive, and contained hidden defense.
It has a history in many areas of the galaxy, even stumbling into Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Kyp Durron at one point.
The superweapon is also strong enough to withstand environments like caves from the gas giant Yavin.

The Sun Crusher gained its extremely large shielding due to its Quantum Crystalline armor.
This material was so strong that it was recorded reflecting turbolaser hits without even gaining a scratch.
When being shot, it created a vortex look that indicated it was charging.
The Jedi pilot Kyp Durron, was one of the pilots of this ship.
The shot alone from this ship created shockwaves so strong that it ruptured the galaxy and obliterated any life that may have resided on these planets without even directly hitting it.
It was built from leftover funds from the Death Star I project.
The operation was run by Moff Tarkin, and after his death, it was completely forgotten about until a group of isolated Imperial Scientists ran into the ship and continued the project in his legacy.
It only took this superweapon a few hours for it to completely wipe out systems and destroy everything in its path.
