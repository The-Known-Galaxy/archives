# Overview

A plant native to and found everywhere on Makeb; the Makebian Skybulb were bulbs that had the strange trait of being able to grow upwards and stay suspended in the air, hence their name as the Skybulb.
They were typically orange, connected to each other by a single thin long vine.
The Skybulb typically grew in Makebâ€™s rockier terrains due to the planet's unique gravitational conditions.
They likely grew staying to the ground before slowly beginning to float up as they matured, tethered to another bulb.
