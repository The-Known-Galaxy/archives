# Overview
Imperial Bioweapons Project I71A or “The Sickness” was an infectious viral agent created for deployment by both the Sith Order and later the Galactic Empire.
The bioweapon attacked biological tissue, swiftly but painfully turning the victim into a hideous, mindless undead creature.

# History
Sometime before 4645 BBY, Sith Lord Darth Dear created the pathogen in an attempt to grant himself immortality.
Drear’s experiments failed, resulting in the Sith Lord falling victim to his own creation, becoming a mindless zombie.
Over a millennium later, following the Great Galactic War, the experiment was continued by Sith Lord Darth Scabrous, who attempted to fix the mistakes of Darth Drear.
He too failed, spreading the virus to the entire Sith academy on Odacer-Faustin, transforming all Acolytes and Masters into mindless zombies.
Knowledge of ‘The Sickness’ survived on Odacer-Faustin for millennia until it fell into the hands of Darth Vader one year before the Battle of Yavin.
The Sith Lord ordered a scientific team within the Galactic Empire to research it and use it as an Imperial bioweapon under the codename ‘Blackwing’.
Unfortunately, the virus was once again set loose after an accident aboard the Star Destroy ‘Vector’.
The crew, now infected, took control of the ship and used it to cripple ‘Purge’, an Imperial prison barge, forcing the barge’s occupants to board the Star Destroyer and fall victim to the virus.



# Biology & Infection
Unlike actual viruses, ‘The Sickness’ was self-aware and used the undead to spread itself pathogenetically.
Symptoms of the virus varied, with the most consistent being pale skin, a gray liquid leaking from the site of infection, severe pain, and hallucinations.
The mixture that composed this viral agent contained several ingredients, most of which are unknown.
The main ingredient, however, was the Murakami black orchid, a force-sensitive plant capable of sentient thought and telepathic communication.
The intended outcome was a yellowish liquid substance meant to be consumed by the alchemist in order to grant them physical undeath, therefore granting them immortality.


Transmission of the pathogen was incredibly swift and difficult to contain.
It could be carried through blood, saliva, or the coagulation of fluids found within the infected.
Methods of transmission varied, the most direct method being through a bite from an infected individual.
Symptoms were known to vary in speed and severity, with most cases reporting a full range of symptoms within minutes of transmission.
The pathogen could also cross species barriers, affecting not only humanoids but non-humanoids and even plant life.
In addition to this, even dead flesh was at risk of infection, as was the case with Von Longo, a human killed 2 weeks prior to the outbreak aboard the Vector who still managed to become infected.
