# Section 1
Vongforming was a  technique used by the Yuuzhan Vong to terraform planets better suited to them and their species to live on.
During the Yuuzhan Vong war, from 25 ABY to 30 ABY the Yuuzhan Vong would use Yuuzhan Vong-called shapers to shape the world for them so they would have a better fit on the planet.
Yuuzhan Vong would call this action worldshaping, as others called it Vongforming or Vongformation.


The Yuuzhan Vong would use their shapers and would build these temple-type structures to aid in the progress of, as they called it, worldshaping.
A few planets the Yuuzhan Vong would use their terraforming techniques on include Coruscant, Ossus, and Duro.

# Section 2
The Jedi would eventually task the Yuuzhan Vong, just before the Sith-Imperial War, with using their Vongformation techniques on a desolate and dead part of Ossus.
Even though the Vongformation techniques were working, the Sith would sabotage the Yuuzhan Vong and their Vongformation not only on Ossus but also on over 100 other planets.
This event would lead to the start of the Sith-Imperial War.
