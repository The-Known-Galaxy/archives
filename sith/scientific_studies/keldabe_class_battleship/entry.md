# Overview

The Keldabe class battleship, also known as the Keldabe class cruiser, was one of many distinct warship classes used by Tyber Zann's group and other groups in the Galactic Civil War.
Similar to the Crusader class Corvette, the Keldabe-class battleship was a Mandal Hypernautics design.
It was named after Mandalore's capital, Keldabe.
A bit like the Mandalorian Corvette structure, the battleship was marked by strong, point edges also similar to the ancient Mandalorian Kandosii class dreadnaught.
Keldabe-class battleships were used in many Consortium tasks, such as the Battle for the Eclipse, which was owned by Darth Sidious.
They had acquired it from the pirates who used to work for Tyber Zann.
