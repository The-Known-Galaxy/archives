# Overview

Kylo Ren's Command Shuttle was an Upsilon class, which was typically used for multipurpose transport for high ranks within the Empire as well as members of the Knights of Ren.
Kylo Ren's command shuttle unusually had two shield generators, rather than one as was common and standard on most starships.
Due to this, it facilitated and reinforced the shield, making it stronger and much more durable.
This would allow the ship to go through tough terrain better than most starships.
The shuttle even contained a practical magnetic area projection system, specifically useful against plasma shots.
This caused incoming shots to be off course, and miss.
