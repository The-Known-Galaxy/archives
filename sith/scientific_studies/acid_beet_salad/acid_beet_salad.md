# About

Dex's Diner, a beloved eatery on Coruscant owned by Besalisk chef Dexter Jettster, was well-known for its delicious acid-beet salad.
Prepared from natives to the planet Vjun and served as a side dish at 3.5 credits prior to its destruction under Imperial rule; this savory treat is sure to have left lasting impressions with all who had the privilege of tasting it!
