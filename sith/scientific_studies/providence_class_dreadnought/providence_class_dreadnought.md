# Overview
The Providence class Dreadnought, also named the Providence class destroyer, was a combination of a dreadnought, battleship, and destroyer developed by Quarren engineers on the world of Pammant.
It was extensively operated and utilized by the military powers of the Confederacy of Independent Systems while the Clone Wars were happening.
The personal fleet of the Trade Federation also used them to be command ships.


Operated with intense caution by the Confederacy's naval admiralty, the Providence was one of the biggest and most powerful ships that were used within the Confederate government, modded with heavy turbolasers, ion cannons, mass-driver cannons with the ability to tear apart light frigates, support vessels in a single shot, proton torpedoes, and tractor beams were also included.
It was more than capable of conducting planetary sieges, and the battleship also maintained an extensive supply of hundreds of starfighters and bombers.
