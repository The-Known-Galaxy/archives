# Overview
Death sticks were a type of hallucinogenic substance that possessed relatively moderate effects.
These substances were predominantly traded and distributed across the Outer Rim worlds which are delivered inside luminescent sticks, however they were also readily available in significant quantities on the planet Coruscant.
Initially created within illicit pharmaceutical laboratories located in CoCo Town, these products were characterized by their affordability and were secretly transported into urban clubs by individuals involved in illegal drug trade.
The cilona extract elicited a state of euphoria, but at the cost of a distressing consequence, resulting in an altered perception of reality characterized by vibrant colors.
Because of this, death sticks were a favorite among desperate addicts and thrill-seekers.
With each dose, the user's lifespan was diminished, and subsequent doses shaved off larger portions of a lifespan.
The urge for a more intense reaction grew with each successive intake.
Consequently, it posed a significant challenge for young people to overcome their addiction without the use of medical treatment.

# Characteristics
There were two common variations of death sticks.
When in a liquid state, these substances were composed of small tubes containing red or yellow ixetal cilona fluid.
These tubes could be introduced into an alcoholic beverage (some individuals choose to combine them with Fizzyglug) or given intravenously.
One might potentially consume the substance by smoking or pulverizing and afterwards insufflating dry granules in a more concentrated & physical form.
The substance was capable of significantly diminishing one's connection to the Force when ingested.

Rehabilitation programs targeting death stick addiction were accessible at medical facilities, with a typical price range of 2,500 to 3,500 credits.
