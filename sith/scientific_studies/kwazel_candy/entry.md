# Overview

A plant found only in the swamps of Rodia; the Kwazel candy were green bioluminescent bulbs that grew deep underneath a swampâ€™s waters.
Because of their natural bioluminescence, it was likely they were an adequate light source to those that swam through the waters of Rodia such as Jar Jar Binks, who swam through these plants to escape from a Separatist attack.
Kwazel Maws, large slug-like animals that inhabit the swamps, typically sleep underwater among the Kwazel candy.
