# Overview

The Spike, built by the Galactic Solutions Industry, was an extremely large pulse hammer used against sub-crustal military bunkers.
Unfortunately, after viewing it at work, it was deemed dangerous and unworthy of its purpose.
This was due to the extreme pressure it released in the wielders when it would fire.
Not only was the machine overly aggressive, but it was also an extremely expensive weapon to make.
This caused curious buyers to quickly turn down offers due to the overwhelming cost of the machine.
One company, however, did find a good use for this product, that being the Hyland Organization for Rakghoul Neutralization.
They learned that the machine did an excellent job when moving soil and allowing a temporary shaft into the subterranean Rakghoul territory.
Upon entering the grounds, a load of markers would release, scanning the tunnels for expeditionary use.
