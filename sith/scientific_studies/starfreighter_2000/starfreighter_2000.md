The Starfreighter 2000 was the first starship manufactured by Suwantek Systems after the Four Hundred Years Darkness.
The Starfreighter was a direct successor of the TL-1800, which shared a very similar design..
The Starfreighter 2000 was two times the size of the TL-1800, and was able to carry twice the total cargo capacity.
The ship itself acted as a home for freighter pilots of the galaxy, and maximized comfort where possible, as well as defense.

The freighter was designed to be more advanced than its predecessor in every way, being dubbed the ‘next generation of the Corellian Engineering Corporation’, however, it only saw a limited production run, not due to the price, but because the manufacturers were able to push their newer TL-2400 freighter model to the public market.

The predecessor, the TL-1800, featured only 2 laser cannons, whereas the Starfreighter 2000 featured 4.
It was able to withstand 1,020 metric tons of cargo capacity, a significant increase in comparison to its predecessor, whilst also containing a Class 2 Hyperdrive.
