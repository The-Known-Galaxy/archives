# Description
The Ebon Hawk was a smuggler and dynamic-class freighter ship which was commanded by the famous Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Revan.
It was originally constructed on the planet of Transel.
Before Revan, it switched many owners, after some time, the ship took a trip to Korriban and was sold to Darth Revan.
Because of Darth Revan, this ship was famous across the Galaxy.
It was the fastest ship in the Unknown Regions.
After Revan abandoned his Sith alignment and joined the Jedi Order, Ebon Hawk was the key to finding the Star Forge.
Revan has used the Hawk to travel to the Unknown Region of the Galaxy to destroy the leavings of formerly his Sith Empire.
Eventually the Hawk was taken by a Jedi Exile, Metra Surik, who used it to stop the Sith Triumvirate.
