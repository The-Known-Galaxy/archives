# Origins

The TIE Lone-Scout A's design process began deep within Sienar Fleet Systems' research labs, where engineers worked tirelessly to create a ship capable of fulfilling the Empire's demanding requirements.
This project represented a departure from the standard TIE design philosophy, which favored mass production of cheap, expendable fighters.
Instead, it aimed at producing a technologically advanced, specialized starfighter that could survive in hostile environments, evade enemy detection, and carry out long-range reconnaissance missions.
Thus, the TIE Lone-Scout A was born, a manifestation of the Empire's evolving needs and the innovative prowess of Sienar Fleet Systems' engineering teams.
Its introduction into the Imperial fleet marked a significant shift in the Empire's strategy, demonstrating their willingness to adapt and respond to the challenges presented by the Galactic Civil War

An interesting aspect of the TIE Lone-Scout A's origins lies in the unprecedented collaboration that took place during its design and development phase.
Recognizing the unique requirements for this starfighter, Sienar Fleet Systems invited top Imperial tacticians and experienced pilots to contribute to the ship's design process.
This step was quite unusual since starship design traditionally remained the exclusive domain of engineers and designers.
By involving tacticians and pilots, Sienar Fleet Systems ensured the ship was not only technically sound but also practical from a military operations perspective.

# Imperial Use

Battle of Hoth:
The TIE Lone-Scout A's contributions to the Battle of Hoth were pivotal.
Scouts penetrated the icy planet's defenses to provide the Empire with essential intelligence for the impending invasion, locating the Rebel base and identifying weaknesses in its defenses.

Battle of Endor:
During the Battle of Endor, the TIE Lone-Scout A was responsible for reconnaissance operations, gathering strategic information about the Rebel fleet's positioning and movements, and relaying this crucial data to the Imperial command center

The specific use of the TIE Lone-Scout A in only two major battles, Hoth and Endor, doesn't imply its limited deployment.
The bulk of its assignments were likely covert, taking place away from the front lines.
These could include surveillance of Rebel installations, tracking Rebel fleet movements, exploring potential paths for surprise attacks, or scouting for new Imperial bases.
These missions, while crucial for the Empire's war efforts, rarely get the same level of attention as large-scale battles.

# Design and Technology

The TIE Lone-Scout A is a radical departure from the standard TIE design template.
It boasts several advanced features designed for prolonged missions in hostile territory, especially scouting and intelligence-gathering tasks.
Its spherical cockpit is reinforced with advanced durasteel and composite alloys for better durability.
The interior is designed for extended deployment, with space for basic amenities necessary for long-duration missions.
A crucial inclusion was an onboard hyperdrive system, an unusual feature for TIE series ships, granting the Lone-Scout an unprecedented operational range.

Length: 21.5 meters
Height: 8.12 meters
Hull: Reinforced durasteel / composite alloys
Cargo Capacity: 150 kilograms
Wingspan: 16.84 meters
Maximum Atmospheric Speed: 850 km/h
Engine: SFS P-sz9.7 Twin Ion Engine
Shields: Sirplex Z-9 deflector

# Ship Armament

The Lone-Scout A is armed with weapons suitable for its role as a scout ship, including light laser cannons for self-defense and proton torpedoes for engagements requiring more punch.
A significant addition to the Lone-Scout A's armament is the pair of SFS M-g-2 General Purpose Warhead Launchers.
These launchers give the Lone-Scout A the ability to carry a variety of warheads, including concussion missiles and proton torpedoes.
This flexibility in payload selection enables the Lone-Scout A to take on more significant threats if needed or to perform surgical strikes on critical targets.

Exact weaponry:
2x SFS L-s1 laser cannons
2x SFS M-g-2 General Purpose Warhead Launcher

# Uses and Role in Ground Assault

The TIE Lone-Scout A excelled in reconnaissance, with a dedicated sensor suite and long-range capabilities.
Its role was to infiltrate enemy space, gather information, and escape without being detected.
The Lone-Scout A contributed valuable intelligence for the Empire's strategic planning, aiding in identifying weak spots and determining the best approach for an assault.
