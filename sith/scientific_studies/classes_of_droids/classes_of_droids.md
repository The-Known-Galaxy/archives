# Overview
Classes, or in some cases degrees, is a set of classifications used for droids, synthetic beings who possess artificial intelligence, that help to give organic beings an understanding of their purposes and what they’re mainly used for.
An example being First Class, Second Class, Third Class, Fourth Class, and Fifth Class classifications and purposes.

# First Class
The First Class specification was given to droids who were built and programmed for the purposes of managing the mathematical, physical, and medical sciences within either a ship or a colony.
A couple examples of such droids include the JN-66 Analysis Droid, the 2-1B-Series Medical Droid, the Midwife Droid, the DD-13 Tripedal Medical Droid, and the GH-7 Medical Assistance Droid.



# Second Class
The Second Class specification was given to droids who were built and programmed  for the purposes of managing engineering and technical sciences.
You’d mostly see such droids in construction, architecture projects, mechanical maintenance of vehicles and other droids, and sometimes helping with navigating space or planets.
Such examples of Second Class droids would be the DUM-Series Pit Droid, the PLNK-Series Power Droid, the WED-15 Septoid Treadwell, and Astromech Droids.



# Third Class
The Third Class specification was given to droids who were built and programmed for the purposes of managing and providing social sciences and service functions, such as retail work, cooking, and serving and attending tables.
Examples of such droids include the CZ Secretary Droid, the LEP-Series Service Droid, the FA-5 Valet Droid, and the BD-3000 Luxury Droid.



# Fourth Class
The Fourth Class specification was given to droids who were built and programmed for the purposes of providing military and security related functions and services to their masters and clientele, such as working as foot soldiers, security detail, or acting as a police force.
Examples of such droids are the GU-Series Guardian Police Droid, the KX-Series Security Droid, and the well-known B1 and B2-Series Battle Droids.



# Fifth Class
The Fifth Class specification was given to droids who were built and programmed for the purposes of manual labor and jobs that either didn’t require a high level of intelligence or were considered too dangerous or hazardous to organics, such as some mining jobs or construction within the vacuum of space.
Examples of such laborious droids include the GNK-Series Power Droid, the MSE-6 Series Repair Droid, the IW-37 Pincer Loader Droid, and the R-H029 Sifter Droid.
