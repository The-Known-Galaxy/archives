# Overview
The Nssis-Class Clawcraft was a starship designed for combat that was originally developed by the Galactic Empire, but was modified by the Chiss.
The Clawcraft ships were originally created by the Empire under the reign of Palpatine, but it was when the Grand Admiral Thrawn began to collaborate with the Chiss Ascendancy.
The Nssis-Class was discovered when the group of Imperials known as the Force Spike, a group mainly composed by Chiss led by Colonel Jagged Fel, began to use these kinds of starfighters during the year 25 ABY.
After the fall of Coruscant, the Nssis-Class was only seen around Chiss space and by forces composed by the Chiss.

# Characteristics
The Nssis-Class Clawcraft fuselage was mainly based on the TIE series ball cockpit, with the difference of having a Sienar ion drive on the rear of the ball cockpit.
Its most notable difference was the change of the wings that a normal TIE fighter would have, but instead replaced with two pairs of curved wings that resemble an X-wing strike foils.
In weaponry, the Nssis-Class had a L-s72 laser cannon on each tip of the wingin its shields, the Nssis-Class had a deflector shield and a thick hull armor to make it more durable.
For their speed in combat, it wasn't very efficient, with its ion engines reaching a maximum speed of 1000 Km/h with an acceleration of 40k m/s, making the Nssis-Class have less speed than other notable starfighters.
However, despite its speed, it had great maneuverability due to its curved wings and mounted jet in each wing that permitted the Clawcraft to adjust its position very efficiently.
The last notable characteristic of the Nssis-Class, was its hyperspace beacon system, allowing the Clawcraft to make light-speed jumps without a navigation computer.
