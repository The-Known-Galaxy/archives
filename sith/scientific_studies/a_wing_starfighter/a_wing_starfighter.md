# Overview

The A-wing, also known as the Aurek-class tactical starfighter, was a starfighter created and used by the Galactic Republic.
These ships would have major roles in wars like the Galactic war and the New Sith Wars, carrying multiple different models throughout.
This ship was 9.2 meters long and was packed with weapons, including torpedo launchers, holding up to six torpedoes, as well as laser cannons on the side tips.
This ship was used for thousands of years, even though the models did change heavily to update with the times.

This ship was created after the Republic Navy requested a new starfighter to replace the dying Star Saber.
Several different models were used from the periods of the Mandalorian Wars all the way to the New Sith Wars.
There were several different squadrons of these ships used by the Galactic Republic, though many of them were used by Jedi Knights as an efficient method of transportation.
