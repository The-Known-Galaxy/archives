# Introduction
A kyber crystal also known as a lightsaber crystal, a living crystal, a kyber, or in ancient times a kaiburr crystal.
This is the main part of the lightsaber.
These were rare crystals that contained the Force within them.
Kyber crystals were scattered on different planets throughout the galaxy.
Most notably, they were used by the Jedi, Sith, and other users who used a Lightsaber.
These crystals were used in order for their lightsabers to emit the glowing blade of the lightsaber.
Depending on the color of the Kyber Crystal, it will emit different colors.
Each lightsaber color has a different meaning or purpose on why one got that Kyber Crystal color.
The Kyber Crystals were mainly found on the icy tundra known as Ilum.
Thousands of Kyber Crystals grew here, this caused the Jedi to claim this as their area for their Crystal Gatherings.
The Crystal Gathering is a ceremony hosted by Jedi Artisans.
Youngling III’s take this once they are ready to try and find a Kyber Crystal, if they find one they will pass.
If they remain inside Ilum and are unable to exit without one, they will be locked inside and left for dead.

# Kyber Crystal Colors
Due to the Kyber Crystal having somewhat of a connection to the Force, it creates a bond to another Force Sensitive.
The Kyber crystal color would rely mainly on what a Jedi’s chosen class would be.
Most Sith do not have lightsabers that are not red.
The reason is because in order to embrace the Dark Side, they are required to bleed a Kyber Crystal.
The process entails infusing the Kyber Crystal with hate and anger, turning the once colorful crystal, a bloody red color.
Although some Sith may have purple lightsabers, some notable users with purple lightsabers are Revan, who dual used red and purple lightsabers, Darth Traya, and a few handful of other Sith.



# Blue Lightsabers
Blue is one of the most common lightsaber colors.
The shade may vary from a deep blue, to a light blue, to a cyan.
Jedi Guardians usually possess this lightsaber color.
They are known to be well skilled lightsaber combatants.
Popular users who possessed blue lightsabers were; Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Luke Skywalker.



# Green Lightsabers
Green is the second most common lightsaber color.
The shade may vary from a forest green, to an emerald green, to a light green.
Jedi Consulars possess this color Kyber Crystal, as they believe that they can solve conflicts through the Force.
Instead of combat, they prefer to meditate and negotiate.
These users have strong force abilities.
Popular users who possessed blue lightsabers were; Qui-Gon Jinn, Yoda, and Ahsoka Tano.



# Yellow Lightsabers
Yellow lightsabers are less common than both the green and blue lightsabers.
Jedi Sentinels and Temple Guards tend to have these lightsaber colors.
Most commonly noted for resembling intrigue and pursuing those who break laws, or oppose the Jedi Order.
They are known as the in-between choice between Consulars and Guardians.
Usually being skilled both in the Force and lightsaber skills.
Popular users who possessed yellow lightsabers were; The Temple Guards, Yarael Poof, and Rey Skywalker.



# Purple Lightsabers
Purple lightsabers are one of the rarest lightsaber colors.
This color resembles Force Sensitives who use both the light and dark side of the Force.
Since Blue and Red create purple, it resembled the mixture of the two.
Popular users who possessed purple lightsabers were; Mace Windu, Mara Jade Skywalker, and Revan.



# White Lightsabers
White lightsabers were only seen by a few Force Users.
These lightsabers were used by those with the purpose of a larger cause before anything else.
Most were neither Jed, nor Sith and resembled the inbetween between them.
In order to have a white Kyber Crystal, one must purify a bleeded and corrupted Kyber Crystal, purifying it of any pain.
This will release the color, not turning it back to the original color, rather making it pure white.
Popular users who possessed white lightsabers were; Ahsoka Tano and  Imperial Knights



# The Darksaber
The Darksaber is a unique weapon, used by Mandalorians.
This weapon was used by those who tended to show signs of arrogance and selfishness.
There is only one known Darksaber in the entire galaxy.
Popular users who possessed the Darksaber were; Pre Vizsla, Darth Maul, and Sabine Wren.



# Synthetic Kyber Crystals
Synthetic Crystals, or Synth-Crystals were crystals that were artificially made, rather than being naturally made.
Due to the method which involved creating these crystals, they would usually be a ruby red color, but these artificial crystals could be made any color depending on the method one uses.
Due to the way the synthetic crystals were made, they were frowned upon by most Jedi.



# Ghostfire Kyber Crystal
The Ghost Fire Crystal was a very rare crystal which grew on rocky mountains.
These extremely rare and unorthodox crystals were found on multiple planets in the Outer Rim Territories.
To even obtain a single crystal in the markets would cost 14,000 credits.
They cost this much, due to their special ability with a lightsaber.
Instead of it emitting a blade of a certain color, the blade would appear invisible to the naked eye.
A lightsaber with this crystal would not even make a sound.
When dueling someone with a ghost fire crystal, it could easily disorient the opponent on where the blade was, which would eventually end in their downfall.
