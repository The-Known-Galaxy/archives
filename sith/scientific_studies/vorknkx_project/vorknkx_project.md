# Overview

The Vorknkx Project was a project taken out by the Galactic Empire before the Battle of Endor to make low-power cloaking machines for freighters.
The Outcomes of the project were kept at Mount Tantiss and were collected by Thrawn in 9 ABY.
The top goal was to use this technology to cloak Imperial starfighters.
The testbed for the task was a Corellian corvette called the Vorknkx, thus the project's name.
The Vorknkx was a CR90 corvette in the service of the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War.
The project was so confidential that only Emperor Palpatine, head of new technology Grand Admiral Demetrius Zaarin, and the project's team knew anything of its presence.
