# Description

Utilized by the Galactic Empire, this Heavy Bomber was primarily designed for penetrating densely armored starships.
It contained modified heavy armor that allowed for decent agility, allowing it to successfully act as a mobile artillery craft.
Shielding was improved upon from the original bomber, and had protection against strong atmospheric conditions like wind.
Power cores were one of the most essential things that this model was efficient at dealing with, as it could bypass heavy tanks and other artillery for a swift blow.

# Technical Specifications

Twin ion engines were employed by this specific model.
Dual weapons pods were added rather than the single payload module that the original TIE bomber possessed.
The TIE Defender’s unique laser cannons were substituted for the Heavy Bomber’s old ones due to less of an overheat.
The two bomb bays contained a variety of weapons and utility for various missions, such as proton bombs, heavy rockets, and concussion missiles.
Besides the missiles, these two forms of weaponry greatly assisted the Empire’s planetary assaults.
Thermal detonators, orbital mines, and proton torpedoes were additional armaments that could be carried on the bomb bays.
These could be used for defense or support, but usually contributed to the assaults carried out.
