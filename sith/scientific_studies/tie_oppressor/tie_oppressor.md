# Introduction

The Sienar Fleet Systems TIE Oppressor Strike Fighter, more commonly known as the TIE Oppressor, was a variant of the TIE starfighter series in the Galactic Empire’s Imperial Navy.
The TIE Oppressor was constructed shortly after the Battle of Yavin for bombing purposes and space domination.

# Characteristics

The Oppressor was similarly structured to the interceptor.
Having the same curved wing design but with an added wing on the top of the TIE to support additional armament.
The Oppressor was equipped with two L-s9.3 Laser Cannons and two Missile Launchers.
This armament allowed the Oppressor to act as both an anti starfighter craft and a light bomber.
Due to the craft getting the same engine as a standard TIE despite the added weight, the Oppressor was slower than most other craft but still considered fairly maneuverable for a bomber.

# Usage

The Empire only allowed the most experienced of pilots to fly the Oppressor due to its cost and the skill required to fly the Oppressor well.
During the Galactic Civil War, the Oppressor served in the vanguard of the Imperial Navy’s fleet as a “Limited Fielding Test Initiative”.
During this time, the Oppressor was used as a bomber against Capital Ships as well as being used in anti Starfighter operations.
Rebel pilots found these ships to be slow and unmaneuverable in the bomber configuration.
Making them easy targets and caused rebel pilots to lower their guard.
When in the anti Starfighter configuration, most Imperial pilots would pretend to move like they were in the bomber configuration and then use an advanced piloting technique known as snap speed changes to become unpredictable and decimate the bewildered rebel pilots.
Due to the small number of Oppressors made, there weren’t many battles where they were the ultimate factor in a victory or loss.
As the Civil War died down and the Imperial funding went with it, Oppressors began to gradually fade away and were no longer constructed.
