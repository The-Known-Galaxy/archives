# Overview
The Starhawk-class battleship was a class of battleship operated by the New Republic, during the late Galactic Civil War and was manufactured at the Nadiri Dockyards.
It consisted of three variants, firstly a prototype of the battleship then came the Mark I Starhawk, and lastly the Mark II.
 Many years later, when the Resistance's U-55 Orbital lifter was killed by the Superiority after escaping Raddus, Leia and General Organa tried to imagine a miracle in which the Inferno Squad returned from a mission which was to find Resistance allies.
Hoping they had brought a fleet of Starhawks.
The Starhawk-class Battleship Mark II was the newest model of a Starhawk-class battleship in use with the New Republic Defense Fleet.
Like all the vessels built at the Nadiri Dockyards, they were constructed from dismantled captured Imperial spacecraft.
It was the beneficiary of the Mark One Starhawk.
