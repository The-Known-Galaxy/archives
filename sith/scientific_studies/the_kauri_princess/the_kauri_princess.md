# Introduction

The Kauri Princess was an M-class luxury liner built by the Mon Calamari and was used by Galaxy Tours during the Galactic Civil War.
It inspired many of the systems that were used during the development of the MC80 Star Cruiser.
Onboard the liner were 850 crew members including the captain, ten officers, 500 droids, and 329 sentient crewers.
The majority of the crew was made up of stewards and engineers and the rest were part of the onboard entertainment.
On top of this, a team of 60 troopers were stationed across the ship as security personnel.
The liner was capable of holding 3,500 passengers with accommodating facilities for 27 species.

# Section One

Standard rooms on the ship had two berths, a suite bathroom, and environmental controls.
Depending on the location of the room the price would range from 50 to 150 credits per night.
The deluxe rooms had a price range of 250 to 450 credits per night.
Lastly, there were two top-tier suites that costed 1,000 credits per night, which were known by their names Emperor and Kauri.
There were some documents that mentioned a royal suite that was supposed to be the most luxurious of them all.
However, many presumed that the Royal Suite was renamed and became the Emperor Suite.

# Section Two

The main area was called the Lido Deck and had standard accommodations.
It was where the Grand Ballroom, Grand Dining Room, and Bistro resided.
The Lido Deck also housed a holovid library with two billion volumes and a nightclub called Xerrol’s place.
A special night club for droids was also available for the crew and passengers’ servants.
Above the Lido Deck was the Recreation Deck which had 15 gyms catering to multiple species.
This deck also had a six-lane multi-gravity running track, zero-g sauna, wall ball courts, and a slafcourse.
There were 212 standard and 46 deluxe rooms on this deck that resided above the two casinos and another dining hall.

# Section Three

The uppermost of the public decks was the Bazaar Deck which included two luxury suites and the Imperial, which was the most prestigious restaurant on board.
This deck also had the Scorp Club, a members-only night club.
Other facilities on the deck included the Estuan Theater, two shopping arcades, meditation chambers, a day care, and a few extra amenities.
Lastly, the Bazaar Deck housed 224 standard and 36 deluxe rooms.
Below the Lido Deck were two credicruise decks that held 448 standard and 86 deluxe rooms.
These two decks each had a small dining room and three snack shops.
Below these decks was the engineering deck that contained the ship’s drive systems and most of the crew areas.
This was also where the hangar bay was located.

# Section Four

The Kauri Princess traveled multiple routes across the galaxy.
Its best-known voyage was a cruise along the Relgim Run, which started at Endoraan and passed through Marmoth, Aris, and Vykos to end up at Mantooine.
However, when the ship passed between Aris and Vykos, it was attacked by the Riders of the Maelstrom.
They were a gang of pirates led by Big Jak Targrim that were rescued by Rebel forces.
Some time passed and the Kauri Princess eventually offered a Grand Galactic Tour that traveled across Tatooine, Endor, Bespin, and the Imperial Center.
The bounty hunter 4-LOM used to be a valet and human-cyborg relations specialist on the ship.
His programming was later corrupted by his observations of the passengers that were under his care.
The fame of the ship grew and a sister ship named Kauri Princess II was launched.
