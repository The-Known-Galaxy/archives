They were designed by notable engineer; Lira Wessex.
They had designed many ships for the Empire before their fall.
This Dreadnought became colloquially known as a Super Star Destroyer.
This specific class of destroyer was particularly favored and utilized by Darth Vader, the hand of Emperor Sheev Palpatine during the reign of the Galactic Empire.

The Super Star Destroyer manned a crew of 280,784 people, and was able to carry 38,000 troops.
The ship came equipped with extremely long-ranged sensors and was able to carry enough consumables for all staff for 6 years.
The Dreadnought possessed a navicomputer with its main hyperdrive being class 1, the best available on the market.
Due to the sheer size and mass of the ship, the Dreadnought contained a backup hyperdrive in the event of an emergency.
This was a Class 10 hyperdrive.
The hull of the ship consisted of a primarily titanium reinforced hull that had been made of alusteel that was purposefully designed to reflect a normal Star Destroyer.
The bridge had a pair of defensive deflector shields and communication arrays in the event of an attack on the Dreadnought.
The bridge itself spanned 285 meters wide, containing shield generators, briefing rooms, and escape pods.
Despite these features, it meant the Dreadnought was susceptible to attack, evidenced during the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY,when the Executor Flagship crashed into the second iteration of the Death Star due to a rogue Rebel-pilot.
These Dreadnoughts also contained one ventral hanger bay.

The Dreadnought contained almost unimaginable amounts of firepower.
The ship’s large length comprised 5,000 total turbolasers across the hull of the ship, including 750 twin heavy turbolaser batteries, and 1000 turret-mounted twin light turbolaser batteries.
The Dreadnought also possessed 125 assault concussion missile launchers, 100 twin battleship ion cannons, and 250 turret-mounted quad lasers resulting in a swift defeat for others that decided to impose this behemoth of a ship.
