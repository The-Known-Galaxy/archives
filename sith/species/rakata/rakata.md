# Overview
The Rakata, known as the Builders to many, were a sentient humanoid species resembling amphibian features native to the planet of Lehon.
These considered founders were few of the most technologically advanced peoples in the galaxy during their height, becoming the progenitors of hyperspace travel and hyperdrive technologies.
Their technology in particular was special yet peculiar, due to its reliance on the Force as a powering capacity drawing from the Dark Side, which would mold its society into a brutal, arrogant, and terrible species.
The Rakata’s Force-driven technology became a fundamental asset in their conquests throughout the galaxy, turning prominent as a warmongering and enslaving sect forming the Infinite Empire as the first sole power of the galaxy.
Hundreds upon hundreds of systems belonged to the Rakata, most were terraformed to meet their ends and hundreds of species were wiped out by their savagery.

# History and Conquests
The Rakata’s roots were humble and primitive, situated in the temperate and luscious planet of Lehon.
These individuals remained in relative primitivity until the arrival and first contact with the Kwa, a strange yet benevolent people.
The Kwa arrived utilizing their Infinite Gate, a technology that allowed them to travel great distances across the galaxy in a mere instant.
The Kwa would become the Rakata’s sponsors granting them access to advanced technologies and more importantly, knowledge about the Force.


By this time before 36,400 BBY, the Celestials would be the preeminent galactic civilization and themselves backs of the Kwa.
They made the Rakata their own slave race, utilizing them to whatever means.
It was not long before the Kwa realized their grave mistake, for the Rakata tapped into the Dark Side of the Force in their innate cannibalistic and savage ways completely ignoring the Kwa principles of moderation and balance with the Force.
With their desire for power and the cravings of conquest boiling Rakata society to the brim, they waged war subsequently, expanding their control over outlying systems conquering from Lehon unto other planets and systems across the Unknown Regions.


The Rakata then established the Infinite Empire, building their conquests upon planets with strong Force signatures, as these planets made their technology viable.
This superpower continued to target planets strong with the Force in their desire to expand, conquering them abruptly and enslaving the local species and races that inhabited them.
Their technology relied on the Dark Side energies that corrupted these peoples enslaved by the Rakata, feeding off their emotions and hatred to power their ships and weaponry.
With their various conquests beginning to reel their relations, the Rakata launched a brutal war against the Kwa, desiring to take their Infinity Gate technology for themselves.
By 33,598 BBY the Rakata became the sole hegemony over the galaxy and by 30,000 BBY, the Celestials, and the Kwa would cease to exist as competition to the Infinite Empire.



# Zenith and Decline
By 25,790 BBY, the Rakata would be at its zenith of power and hegemony over its territories.
They were unmatched, their power indomitable.
Their species advanced, and their slaves plentiful.
There was truly nothing that could match their power.
The Rakata would face multiple threats during its reign over the galaxy, The Esh-Kha were alien nomads who marauded and conquered multiple Rakatan worlds before the Rakata could assemble to meet them, and their savagery would be near equal to that of the Rakata to the point where the Rakata would entirely despise them labeling them as a plague.
The Rakata were able to drive the Esh-Kha to clusters and eventually decimate them to near extinction, the war would be brutal and merciless towards them.
The Rakata would capture and preserve the remnants of the alien species, and a great commemoration of victory would be built on the planet of Hoth, with a monument and a holocron describing the details of their great victory.

	Sometime during their conquests across great swathes of the galaxy, the Rakata would encounter the Sith Purebloods on the planet of Korriban.
They pretended to ally themselves with King Adas, who ruled over the Sith, even as far as to give them the technology in constructing the pyramidal Sith Holocron.
This feigned alliance would not last with Adas as he learned of the Rakata’s desires for expansion, unifying the Sith and sparking a great war against the Rakata driving them from Korriban however at the expense of his own life.

Even as the Rakata have failed in holding Korriban, they succeeded in its decimation, forcing the Sith to relocate to Ziost.
With this cruel act of savagery leaving its mark upon the Sith, they fully embraced the Dark Side of the Force, which resonated throughout the annals as the Sith would become the prominent figures of the Dark Side for millennia.



# Collapse and Legacy
As the Rakata began its far-fetched expeditions unto the Core, they would come into a knowledge of a planet powerfully imbued with the Force, however, it was near-impossible to reach given its location and proximity to black holes and stars along the way.
This planet was known as Tython, home of the Je’daii who practiced a philosophy of balance between Light and Dark, as this reflected upon their planet’s Force storms.
The presence of the Rakata shifted the planet’s storms into a planet-wide surge, which alerted the Je’daii of their presence.
Eventually, the Je’daii came to learn more about the Infinite Empire and its coalesced expansion.

	With generations upon generations and centuries of continued galactic hegemony, the Rakata eventually reached an implode by 25,200 BBY following a great civil war and internal frictions which were caused by their superweapon, the Star Forge’s dark influence.
This further worsened their situation with a great and volatile plague that spread throughout the Rakata species, only infecting them alone and causing a great purge of their kind with nearly all of them exterminated.
This also left the remnants losing greater sensitivity to the Force, even as Rakata scientists attempted to find the cause of the virus and to mend its afflictions to no avail.
In time, the Builders lost their abilities and in turn, their power.
This forced the Rakata remnants to utilize inferior technology which further riled the slave races in open revolt sensing great weakness in their masters.
The Rakata, hopelessly outnumbered and their technology useless, would stem a total collapse of their Empire, forcing them to retreat to Lehon where they remained insignificant till then.
Rakata clusters would exist till 25,100 BBY where the Tion Humans would seize their Force-sensitive technology.


	In time, the Rakata diverged into barbaric warlordism following their retreat to Lehon, which itself was protected by a disruptor field that destroyed communication and navigational systems and prevented foreign ships from entering the system.
In generations of constant infighting and strife, only a few would know their long and grievous history as the cycle of warfare would continue.
The Rakata would be purged from the archives and scripts of their former slave races, as they would be violently ousted from galactic history.
Many liberated worlds opted to destroy their technologies and creations to purge them of their brutal past, and eventually, most memories of the Infinite Empire would come to pass.
Their idle superweapon, the Star Forge, remained unused until the time of Darth Revan who also used it in his bid for great power, producing hundreds of thousands of warships to bring war upon the Republic.
