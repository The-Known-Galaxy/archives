# Overview

The Lepi were a unique sentient species, with some of their unique attributes being their long ears and buck teeth.
They were very tall bipeds that had thin whiskers growing on both sides of their mouth.
Lepis usually had very large families, growing as big as the hundreds.
There are not many notable Lepis, but one of the most popular is the smuggler Jaxxon.
Many Lepis had a place in the Coachelle corporation, with many acting as leaders for it.
Obi-Wan and Anakin once encountered a Lepi on the space station Wheel, where it informed them about Grynask Sanberge.
