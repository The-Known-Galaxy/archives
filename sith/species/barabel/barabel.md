# Overview
The Barabel were a human-like sentient reptilian species that lived in the dark world of Barab I, in the Outer Rim Territories.
During the day, the planet’s red dwarf star, Barab, emitted radiation across the surface, so Barabel and other native nocturnal species sought shelter underground.
Growing up to 2.2 metres, they had a distinct set of two-inch teeth and retractable solid claws.
Their dark-coloured skin was covered in durable scales that could withstand a stun shot from a blaster, inspiring the Barabel microbe armour created by Creshaldyne Industries.
Unique with two stomachs, the Barabel could consume copious amounts of meat, which, coupled with physical features, allowed them to be naturally strong.
Barabels lived in rudimentary districts of up to 10,000 individuals led by a pack leader.
They were renowned for being fiercely loyal and aggressive, while biological adaptations proved helpful in hunting.
All spoke the language of Barabel, but most tried to learn other languages to communicate with the wider galaxy.
They had an unusual sense of virtue, finding other people’s pain funny; in the Barabel language, sounds for sadness and laughter were represented with the same sissing sound.

# Presence in the Galaxy
Sometime before the Imperial Era, an Ithorian named Noga-ta and other Jedi Knights travelled to Barab I to settle a dangerous disagreement between the Barabel clans, which would later be called the Barabel War.
With the dispute pacified, they deeply respected the Jedi.
They told stories of skilled “great warriors from the sky” over the ages, building their trust in the judgement of the Jedi.
To many Barabel, this was the only contact with extraterrestrial species because most stayed on the planet.
Still, some did choose to become mercenaries and brutes, while others left the planet to live on the swampy world of Abraxin at around 67 BBY.
Some centuries later, Barabel began trading with other worlds, especially wildlife, hunters and Barabel commodities for weapons and metal goods, but they were still relatively quiet on the galactic stage.

It wasn’t until the reign of Emperor Palpatine that conflict was introduced.
Planetary Safaris Incorporated, backed by the Galactic Empire, saw an opportunity to use Barab I to illegally host hunting trips.
Captain Osted Alater was tasked to monitor the company’s investment in Barab I, and after discovering the Barabel to be sentient beings, the company was shut down.
The Barabel dubbed their underground capital city after the captain, Alater-ka.
With attitudes of the species slowly changing, some Barabel were taken in by the Jedi Order, such as Saba Sebatyne.
Eventually, at the start of the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Barabel experienced near extinction with the invasion of the extragalactic race; only a few escaped the fires that enveloped their underground districts.
Nothing else is known of the Barabel species after these events.
