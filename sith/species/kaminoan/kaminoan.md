# Overview
The Kaminoan was a tall, thin and pale species, hailing from the extra-galactic watery planet of Kamino, Kaminoans lived in large cities located high up, above the ocean surface, like Tipoca City, one of the most important Kaminoan cities.
The upper echelons of the Kaminoan species often wore a pale collar around their elongated necks.
The Kaminoans were the creators of the technique of cloning, and the founders of the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.
The conflict was named after the clone troopers made by the Kaminoans to fight against the Separatist Droid Army, for the sake of the Galactic Republic.

# Biology And Appearance
Their evolution from aquatic, oceanic creatures was clearly visible: they had a tall shape, glassy eyes and digitigrade slender legs.
The eyes of the Kaminoans had the shape of an almond, and were said to be able to see the colors in the Ultraviolet spectrum.
The white dwellings in their eyes were, in fact, colored with shades that multiple other species were unable to see.
Kaminoans were able to reach adulthood by the age of 11, and their adult physical prime at 40.
They usually started showing signs of aging around 80, but one genetically-modified Kaminoan, Kina Ha, lived for over 3000 years.
Female Kaminoans were bald, while males had headcrests and fin ridges with their skulls.



# History
After a disastrous ice age on Kamino, called the Great Flood, Kaminoan society was pushed to the brink of extinction.
However, through extensive development and mastery of selective breeding, genetics and cloning, the Kaminoans were able to continue existing.
Quickly after, they started offering their cloning services in return for essential imports.
The select few clients that traded with the Kaminoans received the perfect clones to suit their needs.
Though, the Kaminoans didn’t think anything of the clones slaving away outside of their homes, as they only cared about scientific improvement.
Their most infamous work was designing and developing the Galactic Republic’s clone army.
The Kaminoans produced and trained a massive amount of clone troopers for the Republic, using bounty hunter Jango Fett as their template.
Their world would be then targeted by the Separatists to end the supply of clone soldiers.
However, the Kaminoans defeated them.
When they first started experimenting on Jango’s genetics, they produced 12 specimens, now classified as “Null”.
As they were too intelligent and independent to be used by the Republic’s Army, the Kaminoans wanted to terminate them, but Kal Skirata managed to save most of the 6 remaining clones and trained them.
Due to their actions during the Clone Wars, the Kaminoans were awarded a seat in the Galactic Senate, with Senator Halle Burtoni as their representative.
After the First Battle of Kamino, the cloning facilities kept creating more troopers for the Galactic Republic.
However, after Order 66, Kamino’s facilities would be taken over by the Empire.
Tired of the Imperial rule, some Kaminoans tried making a new, more efficient clone army, better than even the Grand Army.
However, Darth Vader became aware of this plot and sent the 501st legion to eliminate the army.
After the destruction of the Galactic Empire, the Kaminoans joined the New Republic.
Their species flourished and even aided in the fight against the Yuuzhan Vong.



# Society And Culture
The Kaminoans saw themselves as superior lifeforms, but still remained polite.
They respected all species bent on self-improvement, and considered those who were not inferior.
There wasn’t much known about inner Kaminoan society, but there was a dance known as Nahra, which would be one of the only ways to see their emotions.
While the Kaminoans put great care into their work, they considered it just a product.
Their castes depended on their eye colors: gray for the upper classes, yellow for the medium classes and blue for the lower classes.
Sometimes Kaminoans were born with green eyes, but they were seen as genetically inferior and a threat to their society.
For this reason, they were eliminated shortly after birth.
There were also different organizations, such as the Kaminoan Ascetics or the Kaminoan Armorsmiths.
The Kaminoans could also be Force-sensitives.
