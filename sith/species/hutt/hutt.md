# Characteristics
Hutts were a large slug-like creature with big mouths and unusual tiny arms.
Their organ arrangement is also different such as they have 3 lungs.
Their skin was tough, thick and leathery and it was wrinkly and slimy.
Hutts Typically had watery eyes and slack facial expressions.
Their tails allowed them to lunge forward and go through muck which legs would sink into.
Even though Hutts have a massive size, when they are babies they are no more than a half meter tall.
Hutts were not known for their health and many of them have genetic defects such as their skin being cracked.
The planet they live on is Val Hutta and was a very hot planet and would rain often which the Hutt found most pleasurable.
Hutts also have a very long life span such as Jabba who lived to be 604 before his death and some could even live to 1000 years old and spoke Huttese since they did not know Galactiv Basic.

# Culture
The Hutt society was divided into families such as the Jabbas who were a part of the kajidics.
Some of the Hutts had tattoos of the family crest.
When a Hutt died they were bandaged and buried.
Architectural Hutt style could be seen on the planet Mataou.
Their buildings had sloping gates and flatter buildings that were red, and white.
Hutts had a choice to wear clothes and some chose not to, such as Jabba.
Hutts liked to dine on gorgs, slime pods, andpaddy froggys.
The Hutts also had a holiday to celebrate Boonta the Hutt who they believed ascended to Godhood.
Most Hutts were known for being crime lords that would oversee all criminal activity in the area.
Some of these crimes were slavery, gambaling, spice smuggling, and bounty hunting in Hutt space.
Not all of them were crime lords and some were even artists.



# History
For a quite long period of time, the Hutts ruled over all organized crime in the galaxy and for several centuries controlled the Twi’leks of Ryloth and the Nikto species.
When the Hutts approached Lord Isamer of the Directorate, They struck a deal with him to destabilize the local government of Eiram and E’rondor so they could control trade and create mass enslavement which most Hutts were fond of.
Although the Hutts wanted to accomplish these goals, their true reasoning was so they could destroy the Directorate so they could move their criminal duties into the region.
Fast forward to The Galactic Empire Era, the Hutts had a very tight grip on the galaxy with crime syndicates all across the galaxy.


    After Jabba's death, who was a crime syndicate leader killed by Leia Skywalker, the Hutts were left to determine who would take his place and for the next few months there was no new crime lord.
Eventually the new republic slowly started to take steps and gave the crime syndicates financial regulations.
Even with all the patrol and regulations the Hutts were still able to keep control over the Nikto species in the republic era.
Even with the Nikto in control the Hutts still lost most of their control over the galaxy.
Even with their best efforts they could not gain power due to the New Republic Factions condemning the Hutts even calling Leia Skywalker “The Huttslayer”.
