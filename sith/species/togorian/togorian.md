# Overview

Togorians were a feline warrior species from the planet Togoria, they were known for often interacting with Mandalorians.
Physically, they were incredibly large bipeds, averaging 2.2 meters tall for females and 3 meters for males.
They were covered in gray-to-black black fur with stripes and had an extremely dense bone structure which allowed them to sustain heavy physical hits.

# History

They first appeared on the planet of Togoria, evolving as nomadic hunters.
Another very widespread species were the winged creatures known as Mosgoths, which  often flew for transportation.
As they developed over time, Togorian society split between males and females: the males choosing to retain their nomadic lifestyle, and the females wishing to settle down and develop.
As both members of the species were too stubborn to come to an agreement, it ended up with tribes of Togorian males continuing as hunter-gatherers, while Togorian females settled down in large cities, the two different worlds only meeting together for about a month every year.
Males rarely left their homeworld, though a few became pirates and mercenaries, or were forced off-world to find their missing mate.
They often despised all outsiders on their planet, especially droids and imperial stormtroopers.
They did return mutual respect though and have honored during their encounters people like Han Solo and Mammon Hoole.
Instead, Togorian females enjoyed conversing and trading with outsiders, and had a common enjoyment for luxury.
They were first discovered as a species when Mandalorians attempted to conquer the planet of Togoria.
The Mandalorian invaders were so impressed by the fierce resistance and fighting proficiency that they instead opted to recruit them, making Togorians the first species to join their ranks outside of humans.
