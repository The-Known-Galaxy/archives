# Overview
The Nekghoul are a sentient species that evolved from a strain of Rakghouls on Taris.
They are classified as a separate species due to being extremely different from their Rakghoul counterparts: They are sentient, stand upright, and are even sensitive to The Force.
Most importantly, Nekghouls do not spread the Rakghoul plague.

# Origins
Nekghouls evolved from the ruins of the planet Taris, following the bombardment of its surface by Darth Malak’s battle fleet.
Over the span of three centuries, they would end up becoming the planet’s only inhabitants.
It is believed that they evolved from Jedi that were transformed into Rakghouls, which would explain why they became force sensitive.
Another common theory is that they evolved this way following some minor radioactive fallout after the damaging of Taris’ reactors.



# Characteristics
While almost completely different under many aspects, one thing this species shares with the Rakghoul is their very violent tendencies and great strength.
Due to this, their alignment with The Force usually leaned more towards the dark side.
Although some Jedi did attempt to bring them towards the light side, the results were mostly minor.
The Nekghoul, being sentient, are capable of speech and thought, although they are completely clueless regarding their origins and history.
