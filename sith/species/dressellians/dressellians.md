# Overview
Dressellians were a sentient species that were natives of the planet Dressel.
They had hairless heads and wrinkled features and craniums.
They peacefully isolated themselves from the Galactic Civil War to avoid any conflicts.
Many Dressellians will eventually join the Rebel Alliance following the Galactic Republic’s demise, which they were very loyal followers of.
Following the conclusion of the Imperial Senate, the Rebel Alliance’s Commander-in-Chief Mon Mothma jotted in a journal entry in the Rebel Files that she considered many of the Dressellians population vulnerable and that they should take in refugees.
A Dressellian resistance fighter by the name of Lokmarcha, was a Major in the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.
Dressel’s isolation ended after the Galactic Empire took control of their system by 10 BBY.
The Imperials would descend on the planet, setting up bases to exploit and steal Dressel’s natural resources.
Despite the Dressellian’s having very little political organization and barely any industrial level technology, they would begin to form a Resistance Movement against the Empire.
At first, the Resistance would have little effect upon the Imperials, but as time went on, the Dressellians would become accustomed to many forms of guerilla warfare, making the Resistance very costly for the Empire.
Later on, the Bothans will support the Dressellian resistance by smuggling equipment, weapons, and even mercenaries to train the Dressellians.
Designed during this period was a Dressellian projectile rifle, that was produced in large numbers and used to great effect.
As tension built up for the Imperials, they would eventually decide it was not worth the cost, abandoning the planet of Dressel.
After liberating their homeworld, the Dressellians will return to their previous form of isolation from the Galaxy, with most of the former underground leaders becoming the most prominent leaders of their loosely held participatory democracies.
