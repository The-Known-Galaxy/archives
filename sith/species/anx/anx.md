# Introduction
The Anx species were a tall reptilian sentient species native from the planet of Gravlex Med.
Their most notable characteristic was their blade-shaped head with a crest, which depending on the individual’s mood changed color.
They had a hunched posture and very low voice due to their atmosphere having higher gravity than what was normal.
They had members in both the Jedi Order and the Galactic Senate.

# Biology and Appearance
Their distinctive appearance had changed throughout the different gravities their planet had had, ending with a very high gravity and what they are now.
Their bodies were dense in musculature, had a tail to help them balance and had a natural stooped and hunched posture.
However, even with the restriction of gravity, they were capable of growing up to 4 meters high and used these heights to harvest food on their native planet.
Their voice was very low but could be heard kilometers away if they desired that and also had their crests to communicate.
Even if it was extremely rare, there were Force sensitives among them.



# Society and culture
Their culture was based on clan lineage and marriages between clans.
Their structure followed a simple rule, there was a principal family with almost all the power and then there were secondary clans that served them.
They all had intense loyalty to one another and were willing to die for them.
They were known to be curious due to them not having fear very often as a result of their huge size.
They developed a very primitive language based on low noises and rumbles but was impossible for any other species to learn.
They also had the peculiar ability of spotting weak spots in any other species, making them even more curious and fearless.
