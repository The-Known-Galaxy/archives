# Introduction

Located on their home planet Geonosis, the Geonosians were a winged semi-insectoid species who created nests in large, spire-like colonies to their homeworld.
Their height was approximately 1.7 meters, or 5ft and 1 inch.
During the Clone Wars, the Geonosians fought in association with the Confederacy of Independent Systems while defending their planet from the Galactic Empire on multiple occasions, and were nearly exterminated by the Galactic Empire after they finished aiding in the construction of the Death Star.
After the near extermination of their species, only one was alive, nicknamed Klik-Klak, who survived the Imperial sterilization of their planet.
However some hope remained when the New Republic Era started, as there were some eggs left which could hatch and create a new Geonosian Hive.

# Society and Culture

The Geonosians were born into hives which were led by a Queen, a caste-based species separated by positions of drones and warriors.
The Queen’s job was to lay eggs for the hive and to provide orders to the public leaders of Geonosis.
Karina the Great, once was a queen who was able to control sentient beings, including her own kind, with parasites called brain worms.
In their society, drones were capable of becoming warriors only if they provided enough evidence by defeating other drones in an arena.
Geonosian Warriors had thick wings and a thick exoskeleton, and were also dedicated to warfare.
Their Alpha was known as the Geonosian Brood Alpha.
The blood of the Geonosians was yellow, and their skin color was dark-orange to green.

# History

Their history wasn’t always peaceful, wherewith many losses and suffering also came happiness and wealth.
In the Pre-Clone Wars, they successfully conquered Geonosis and named it as their home planet.
In the Clone Wars, Geonosis became a part of the Confederation of Independent Systems.
The Separatists only used the Geonosians to create their so-called “Separatist Droid Army”, after the Head of State, Count Dooku came and personally negotiated the agreement.
In theImperial Era, the Geonosians were forced to aid in constructing the Death Star by the Galactic Empire, where they became an enslaved servant species for the Empire and were strictly forbidden from freely breeding.
After the Death Star’s hyperdrive was up and running, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin ordered the Imperial Weapons Division to sterilize Geonosis using  Imperial gas canisters;killing, circa 100 billion of the planet's population-just so the Empire could keep their weapon covert.
At the Post-Sterilization in 2 BBY, the Spectres and Captain Rex found out that the Empire had perpetrated genocide against the Geonosians.
In addition to this, they discovered and helped out Klik-Klak to escape with the last of the queen’s eggs in the depths of Geonosis.
Unfortunately, Klik-Klaks' plans didn’t last very long the egg would hatch concludingly with a new queen, named Karina also known as the last Geonosian Queen.
