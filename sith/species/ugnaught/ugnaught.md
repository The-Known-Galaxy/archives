# Overview

Ugnaughts are labeled by several other species as diligent workers who possess the drive to fulfill any insurmountable task.
These humanoid beings originated on the swampy planet of Gentes and lived as clans.
They also resided in Cloud City, located on the planet Bespin, where they were rewarded with settlements for their immense structural engineering contributions.

# Biology

Sharing the scientific class of porcine with Gamorreans, Ugnaughts somewhat resemble pigs and their skin appears as various shades of pink.
They possessed large nostrils and had a distinguished nose figure, with additional thick flabs of skin surrounding the mouth.
Some species of Ugnaughts were born with tusks, which they would utilize to fight and settle feuds with other clanmates.
These sentient beings encompass the wasteland area of Gentes and may live more than 200 years with a proper diet.
Genteslugs, fungi, and several variations of mold were a common food item depending on the Ugnaught’s primary location.
Ugnaught children and infants were given the nickname “Ugletts” as well.

# History

The societal norm of leadership for the Ugnaughts included a Chief who made a majority of the tribe’s decisions.
Ugnaughts prided themselves on their craftsmanship and adaptability.
Insulting the functionality of their creations with or without malicious intent would greatly upset them.
A common phrase, “I have spoken,” was used at the end of an Ugnaught’s statement symbolizing their unyielding thoughts.
Since Gentes was an Outer Rim Territory, it was susceptible to slaver raids and common Ugnaught citizens were forced into indentured servitude.
Little Ugnaughts remained on Gentes after the attacks and those remaining were often captured and sold across various planets as slaves.
Gentes was located in the Anoat Sector, and only a small number of Ugnaughts remained because of the Galactic Empire’s blockade.
Although these beings were spread across the galaxy, some were able to regroup and create the Ugnaught Surface on Cloud City.
This city was a tibanna (gas used in hyperdrives) mining area, and also had a lower region of houses.
Due to their industrious work, former slaves were able to establish the capital city of Ugnorgrad where they could spread knowledge to future generations.
Some Ugnaughts would also take odd jobs like working in the carbon-freezing chamber, as those not in Cloud City needed to survive through other means.
