# Overview
Although human in shape and behavior, the Nautolans or nada Lloyds are actually far from human.
their home planet, Glee Anselm, was mostly water aside from a few large land masses where their neighboring species, the Anselmi lived.
The Anselmi were not aquatic and as a result fought over the small habitable areas on the planet.
As such, the Anselmi evolved into a warrior species.
 underwater had a much easier time since the option was available to them.hey were not just amphibians in the sense that they spend a lot of time in the water and on land.
 could actually breathe underwater.
Other species seem to have trouble transitioning from air to water, but unlike most amphibians that evolve to lose their gills in favor of lungs, the Nautolans retained both.
It was believed that Nautolans did not have eyelids as they were rarely caught blinking but as we can see with Jedi master Kit Fisto this was simply a myth it's said that they blink in dorer to keep their eyes moist.
As for their society and culture, the Nautolans culture developed around a strong sense of family and civic duty.
The planet's original government consisted of the council of elders which governed each of their settlements, although it should be pointed out that the word elder was used for anyone of good merit that was elected to take a seat on the council, making young faces as common on the council  elder ones.
Their culture promoted staying with a lifelong mate and showing loyalty to said  spouse along with equality with the spouses in the household as their culture also promoted harmony since their land dwelling neighbors, the Anselmi were still relatively primitive and violent.
When the Yuuzhan Vong tore through the galaxy,the Nautolan homeworld was untouched.
