# Introduction
The Kiffar were a human-like species from the worlds Kiffu and Kiffex.
Kiffar were distinguishable by their scarlet blood and facial tattoos, which signified their clan allegiance on their species' homeworlds, despite their human appearance.

# Section 1
Except for their particular facial characteristics, they were visually comparable to any Human.
These marks, known as qukuuf, were placed as tattoos while young and handed down through generations on the mother's side, except in the rare situation where an individual's mother was not a Kiffar, where the father's markings were adopted.
Korto Vos, the son of Kiffar Jedi Master Quinlan Vos and Human mother Khaleen Hentz, was one such example.
Clan membership seems to be passed down from father to son, however, it is unknown what happened when the father was not a Kiffar, as in Ailyn Vel's case.



# Section 2
The tattoos also indicated which clan a Kiffar belonged to, although, for most of Kiffarian history, these clans were at war or in high-stakes alliances.
However, after the Imperial absorption of the Kiffars' homeworlds, this race has declined in numbers, as have the clan chiefs and other instigators of clan feuds.



# Section 3
Jedi Master Quinlan Vos was a male Jedi Master Kiffar who participated in the Clone Wars.
Throughout the High Republic, Vildar Mac was a Jedi Knight as well.
A few species, including Vos, possessed the gift of psychometry, or the capacity to read past experiences of inanimate objects through touch.
