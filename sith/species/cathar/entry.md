# Overview

Cathars are a sentient feline-like species.
Their bodies are covered in golden fur, often with dark stripes, and they are bipedal.
They also have large silky manes, and may use their tough retractable claws as weapons.
They were naturally proficient in melee combat, and their height ranged from 1.5 to 1.9 meters tall.
By nature, they give a lot of importance to moral values such as honor and family.

# History

They first appeared on the planet Cathar, of the Quelii Sector in the Outer Rim.
Despite their hostile nature, the Cathar never got into any conflict with outside species until the Mandalorian Wars.
In this event known as the Battle of Cathar, a stunning 90% of the entire Cathar population was killed by the invading Mandalorians, with the few survivors being caught as slaves or forced to flee their home to survive.
Following the Mandalorian Wars, some Cathars began returning to the planet, which recovered back to its original status in the following decades.
Following the return of the Sith Empire in the Great Galactic War, they chose to side with the Galactic Republic, although over time their alliance with them would falter.
Following the Sith Empire liberating a Cathar political prisoner, many Cathar clans chose instead to be integrated into the Empireâ€™s ranks.

# Culture

Across the galaxy, generally Cathar females were often considered prized as slaves, while males were too aggressive for servitude.
Some famous members of the Cathar species include Juhani, whom aided Darth Revan in the destruction of the Star Forge, and the Cathar Jedi Sylvar and Crado in the Great Sith War, as well as the three Cathar Jedi brothers Rasi, Ahn and Zho-Tuum in the Second Galactic Civil War.

The Cathars present two definite subspecies: the Juhani and the Myr Ro, both being slightly more human-like and having paler fur colors.
Cathars had their own language known as Catharese, and a religion.
In their homeworld, they lived in cities atop giant trees, and they were often led by the Elders of their clans.
