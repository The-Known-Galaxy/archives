# Overview
The Iktotchi species were a horned sentient species native to the moon of Iktotch, a satellite which orbits the planet Iktotchon in the Expansion Region.
Iktotch was known to have very harsh environments and windy days, normal days in Iktotch were, what in many inner circle planets would be considered a natural disaster.

# Biology and Appearance
Iktotchi were known to have very thick and resistant skin due to the windy nature of their place of origin.
Both genders possessed curved cranial horns which from a visitor’s point of view made them seem as aggressive.
The males had bigger horns than the females had and the horns had the capacity to regenerate if damaged.
They had limited dexterity due to the sheer size of their hands and their oversized fingers.
Their hands were said to be 1.5 times bigger than those of humans.
They had an average of 1.80 metres in height and a life expectancy of 90 years.
Surprisingly, they were naturally gifted with precognition, however, this power was extremely related to the moon they inhabited and their power would decrease in direct correlation to their distance from it.
They were also known to have strong telepathic skills and to be very emotional.
These emotions were normally hidden under a mask of stoicism.
They could adapt really easily to other environments and cultures but lacked the will to speak with other species and if done with short conversations.
Their natural gift of precognition made them feared by other species, isolating them and making them easy targets to insult, it even made them banned from almost every casino.
They were capable of speaking the Basic language but preferred to speak their native  Iktotchese language.
