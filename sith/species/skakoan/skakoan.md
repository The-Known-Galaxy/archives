# Appearance

The Skakoan are a humanoid mammal species who best stick out via their dependency on their pressurized suit which was their only way of surviving when not on their home world Skako.
The Skakoans were very xenophobic people who would not leave their planet unless destined death approached them, and even then some Skakoans would not leave their homeworld.
They primarily needed a methane-air supply to breathe when out of their homeworld which in some places, was hard to come by.
The species itself when not in these suits had a grey to white-toned skin that hung over their skeleton in folds.
They lacked any sort of hair and had sunken beady eyes above the slit in their face one may identify as a nose as it served the same purpose.
They also had lipless mouths as they only needed to speak.
However, these creatures did not digest solid foods so the need for teeth never evolved with them resulting in gaping mouths instead.
This paired with the high pressure on their homeworlds meant that despite their looks, the Skakoan were a healthy species with lifespans averaging around ninety to one hundred and ten years old.

# Society

Outsiders very rarely visited their homeworlds of Skako so to many they had only seen the species with their suits on and not the very select few who had seen them without them on.
This had started a rumor that the Skakoan were emotionless and very machine-like as they fit the part very well with not being able to express a lot of emotion while within the suit.
However, the Skakoan were very emotional creatures.
They were very self-developed and self-centered with almost all of their research being how to preserve themselves after the suit was created since their species was able to solve nearly any mathematical, scientific, and technological problems with the minds of just the Skokoans.
The world they lived on was run by highly efficient Skakoans who had meticulously crafted the planet and its systems to better help the Skakoan people.

# History

The Skakoans were not discovered quickly as their nature tended to be them never starving too far from their homeworld unless they were on a great fulfilling quest.
They were originally found during the blazing of the Brentaal–Denon Route of the Hydian Way before the formation of the Galactic Republic had even taken place.
They had established a major ecumenopolis that scaled the cities and population of Coruscant though it did lack the republic’s charm where war was just outside of their reach and they liked it that way as the species more often than not, didn’t want to go to war when they needed to wear their suits for survival in every environment.
Skakoans did manage to have a seat in the Galactic Senate but after leading the Techno Union away from the Republic and towards the confederacy, the Skakoans were promptly kicked out of the Republic as they were making a new enemy in doing so.
This caused the newly formed Galactic Empire to prosecute the Kakoans for partaking in the war.
After these accusations, most of the Skakoans did not venture outwards.
Instead, they stayed on their home planet where they did not interact with the republic or the empire.
