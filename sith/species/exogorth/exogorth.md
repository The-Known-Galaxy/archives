# Overview
The Exogorth were a sentient species made almost entirely from silicone and resided in hollow spaces within asteroids located in the depths of space.
Exogorths were colloquially known as ‘space slugs’.
Exogorths typically reached maturity at 10 meters in length and were able to reproduce by splitting in half.
On the rare occasion an Exogorth was incapable of splitting in half, it was capable of growing up to the size of 900 meters in length.
Space slugs of this capacity were known for swallowing starships whole and house entire ecosystems within their innards due to the space slug’s vast size.

Exogorths were well-known for burying themselves within asteroids of any size until they would burrow themselves within the asteroid until completely hidden.
The space slugs feed off stellar energy emissions, mineral-rich deposits from the asteroid, floating space debris, and other creatures such as mynocks.
Exogorths remained primarily dormant once burrowed due to the lack of available food sources in space.
Due to this, an Exogorth's lifespan could stretch up to a billion years depending on the contents around them.
A notable Exogorth is Sy-O, who resided in the asteroid belt of the former rebel-occupied planet; Hoth.
Sources claim Sy-O has lived for over a billion years, which was considered to be young for an Exogorth.
The space slugs stereotypically would leave their mouths agape to trap victims.
However, on rare occasions they were able to lunge at starships.
This was not their preferred method of attack however, due to being an exhausting method of catching prey, leaving the Exogorth over-exerted for an extensive period of time.
