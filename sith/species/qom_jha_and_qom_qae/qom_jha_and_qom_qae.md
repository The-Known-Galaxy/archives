# Overview
The Qom Jha and Qom Qae species were sentient flying species that lived in the canyons and caves of the planet Nirauan.
Their wings spanned up to a metre long when full-grown and appeared like bats.
Although usually referred to together, Qom Jha and Qom Qae had a few differences; the Qom Qae was apt for nesting on the highest peaks with their smaller size and browner texture, whereas the Qom Jha was naturally larger and darker, giving better adaptation in the cave environment.
Both species were quite intelligent, adventurous and had a social structure where adults would have specific roles within their nestings, led by a Bargainer.
Only after they specialised in jobs for their herd did they obtain an adulthood name.
For example, "Builder With Vines" was an adult, as opposed to the straightforward "Child of [Parent's name]" that was its childhood name.
Whilst the adults of nestings were highly territorial against adults of other nestings, the children were allowed to roam free, often as scouts and ambassadors.

# Presence in the Galaxy
Even though the Qom Jha and Qom Qae were slightly Force-Sensitive sentient species able to communicate via telepathy, the secretive Chiss species viewed them as pests.
The avian species were somewhat aware of the existence of the Empire, New Republic, and the Jedi.
In an encounter with Mara Jade and Luke Skywalker, Hunter of Wind's Qom Qae nesting and Eater of Creepers' Qom Jha nesting aided in investigating the Hand of Thrawn presence on Nirauan.
