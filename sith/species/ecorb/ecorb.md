# Overview
Ecorbs, who inhabited the Destral Pits, were a sentient species that were known to have coiled attachments, which were referred to as hampas, lodged on their mucilaginous heads.
As legend among the ecorbs tells, hampas were not always attached to their heads, as they were said to have gained them through consuming a species of luminescent orange and blue flowers consecutively, regardless of their side effects.
As a result of evolution, this trait is inherited by subsequent generations.

# Biology
Typical characteristics of ecorbs were their dark yellow exteriors, patterned even more darkly down their backs, and a scaly texture across the entirety of their skin.
Along with this, they possessed jelly-like heads topped with hampas.
Hampas were known to be very painful to possess, as their painfully constricting nature made the ecorbs miserable.
Along with hampas, the ecorbs also possessed red blup sacks that undulated when the owner was happy.
They were capable of dreaming while sleeping and were even known to have nightmares occasionally.
Ecorbs sported eyes the color of amber, and sharp teeth encased in their mouths.
They were known to possess at least two sexes, female and male, and were able to speak.



# History
As legend among the ecorbs tells, hampas were not always attached to their heads, as they were said to have gained them during a period known as "the Mercurial and Long Time Away From Here Times." Their life was carefree during this time as they glided ecstatically across the Destral Pits until one fateful night, a luminescent orange and blue flower sprouted from a viscous rock.
The ecorbs, feeling tormented by the flower’s presence, as they have never seen a flower before, gathered around it and were mystified by its presence.
The ecorbs, not knowing what to do about the flower, decided to consume the flower.
An elder ecorb warned the others of its species of the flower's unknown origin.
However, their warnings went to waste, as the other ecorbs insisted on consuming the flower.
The petals were torn off the flower’s stem, divided among the ecorbs, and consumed.
The flower had a psychedelic effect on the ecorbs, causing them to feel giddy at first, however, once they laid their eyes to rest, they were accompanied by horrid nightmares.
When they awoke the next morning, hundreds of the same orange and blue flowers bloomed surrounding the ecorbs.
Due to their arrogance, they decided to consume the flowers once more.
This led to an addiction of the flowers and they soon became extinct.
Due to the overeating, the ecorbs grew hampas atop their heads and began to feel dreadfully ill.
From then on, the ecorbs lived miserably with the constant pain of the hampas reminding them of their mistake.
