# Overview

The Fosh are a sentient avian species originating from an unknown world.
Their quiet and reserved nature has led them to be a rare sight throughout the galaxy.
In some periods of galactic history, they were even believed to be extinct.

# Characteristics

They are elegant bird-like beings with slim torsos and delicate arms.
As hands they have four-fingered talons, and lack wings.
They have an avian digitigrade stance and flay-toed feet which made them great jumpers and overall extremely agile.
Their faces are convex, ending in a whiskered beak.
Atop their head they have two twisting antennae, and a ridge of feathers behind their head.
These feathers shift depending on the Foshâ€™s mood: Green indicates thoughtfulness, orange happiness, blue apathy, and gray anger/disgust.
Most interestingly, their tears have a peculiar chemical composition: for example, Sith apprentice Vergere could alter the composition of his own tears through the force to produce various compounds ranging from powerful poisons to healing fluids.

Psychologically, they are very private and wished to remain unnoticed by most of the galaxy.
Fosh population is thought to be small, although it could just be due to their ability to hide themselves.
They only spoke when necessary, content with just listening most of the time.
They are adept at political intrigue, and a manipulative species.
They viewed themselves superior to other species, finding individuals around them sources of amusement.
They often think of elaborate plots and ploys to arrive at their objectives, and enjoy using riddles and analogies to confuse their interlocutors and feel more clever.
As a result, the Fosh are an extremely self-serving, self-interested species that was only generous when their actions benefited them.
Despite being so egocentric, they were still wise enough to distinguish the dangers that other species may present.
