# Overview

The Talortai were a relatively unknown species with the body of both an avian and a reptilian creature.
They had scales and a jaw in the shape of a beak.
They were immune to aging and possibly could regenerate at a fast pace.
A renowned member of the race was Urai Fen, second-in-command and bodyguard of Tyber Zann, founder of the Zann Consortium.
The Talortai were strongly tied to the Force, being able to see the difference between the Light and Dark side, but they weren’t tied down to either the Sith or the Jedi.
The Force was a vital component of this species’ life, however, Urai Fen does not like to speak about his Force-Sensitivity.
