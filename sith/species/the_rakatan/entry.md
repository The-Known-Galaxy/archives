# Introduction

The Rakatans were a sophisticated species that created the largest empire of its time, known as the Rakatan Infinite Empire.
Over time, the Rakatans accomplished many things but couldn't escape the grasp of nature.

# Description

The Rakatans were born on the planet Lehon, deep in the unknown regions of the galaxy.
They were cannibalistic species that were genetically drawn to the dark side.
They held no galactic significance until the Kwa (a species of Force Sensitives) arrived on the planet.
Kwa were Dathomirian in origin and sought to teach lesser species, such as Rakata, in the ways of their knowledge.

The Kwa would teach the Rakatans everything they knew about the force, such as the light side and the many ways it was used.
However, the Rakatans were unable to stick to this ideology, as their genetic attraction to the Dark Side was too strong.
This struck fear in the hearts of the Kwa, and for a good reason.
When they refused to give the Rakatans the secret to the infinity gates, they were massacred, and those that remained devolved into the Kwi.
The Rakatans then formed the Rakatan Infinite Empire and set out on a massive conquest.
The first thing they did was invent one of the earliest forms of the Hyperdrive system.
However, it was only limited to traveling to force sensitive planets, the only ones that mattered in the eyes of the Rakatan.
They would also be responsible for producing an early type of lightsaber, known as the Forcesaber.
There was a catch, though.
Those who wielded a Forcesaber would force them to shift ever so slightly to the Dark Side.
As you know, the crystal, the blade and the user are all intertwined.
Using these weapons, the Rakatan empire would go on to enslave many of the early species of the galaxy and  enslave the citizens by forcing them to build projects for them.
One of these projects was the Star Forge, a massive space station that could mass produce an endless supply of naval ships, drawing energy from the sun.
Despite the fact that the Rakatan Empire had many conquests, their corruption due to the Dark Side was too strong, even for them.
It caused the civil war to break out amongst the Rakatans.
Along with this, the Rakatands would develop a fatal disease, slowly crippling their connection with the Force.
This would also have devastating effects on their technology, due to most of them relying on force.
Over a very extended period of time, the Rakatans would slowly lose the grip that they once held on the galaxy, and they had no idea what was causing it.
This was made worse by failed attempts to conquer both Tython and Korriban.
In 25,200 BBY, the Infinite Empire would collapse, leaving only small pockets of Rakatans alive.
In the end, the Rakatans devolved, losing their connection to the force, and becoming the laughing stock of the galaxy.
Their physical appearance didn't change much.
The Rakatans were a humanoid species that contained some aquatic-like characteristics.
As much of their homeworld was water, they evolved with a head stalk and a pair of eyes horizontal on their heads.
Their eyes had a wide variety of colors, gray, gold, blue, and brown.
Their skin existed in virtually every color, although the majority had grayish or yellowish shades.
