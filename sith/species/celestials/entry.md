# Introduction

In the vast expanse of the Force, an unfathomable energy field pervading all existence, existed the Celestials, ancient entities whose essence eluded mortal understanding.
Commanding the very fabric of the Force, they took form as the Ones—comprising the Father, the Daughter, and the Son—embodiments of its intricate balance and power.

# Section 1

The Daughter and the Son, embodiments of the Force's light and dark aspects, respectively, were initially balanced by the Father.
However, with the addition of a mortal servant who ascended to become the mother, the father's burden was lessened.
Yet, consumed by fear of abandonment among the eternal Ones, the Mother sought immortality through forbidden means.
This led to her transformation into Abeloth, a fearsome entity embodying chaos and destruction.

To contain Abeloth's malevolent influence, the daughter and the son joined forces as the architects.
Together, they orchestrated the construction of Centerpoint Station by enlisting the assistance of the Killiks, who were temporarily granted access to the Force.
Centerpoint's colossal capabilities were harnessed to create the Corellian system and other celestial phenomena believed to be artifacts of the Celestials.
Additionally, they devised the Maw—a prison encircled by black holes—and Sinkhole Station to confine Abeloth, safeguarding the galaxy from her destructive power.
Amidst the Clone Wars, a pivotal conflict in the eternal struggle between Jedi and Sith, Anakin Skywalker, the prophesied Chosen One destined to restore balance to the Force, found himself drawn to the realm of Mortis.
There, he was tempted to assume the role of the Father, a position crucial for upholding cosmic stability.
Tragically, the mission ended with the demise of the immortal Ones, victims of the lethal Dagger of Mortis—the sole weapon capable of vanquishing them.
With the demise of the Ones and the escalating Jedi-Sith conflicts, the Force is out of balance, paving the way for Abeloth to exploit the ensuing chaos.

The Celestials remained shrouded in mystery, with their existence primarily inferred from the enduring monuments they left scattered across the cosmos.
Regarded as among the earliest and most influential cultures of their era, they were distinguished by the colossal remnants of their craftsmanship.
Despite their mysterious presence, little was definitively known about their identities, fueling speculation and theories regarding their nature.
Some believed them to possess a fluid form, while others suggested that they were spiritual entities, possibly assimilated with the Force ages ago, endlessly shaping the galaxy's destiny.
Yet another perspective posited them as supernatural intermediaries, wielding powers far beyond mortal comprehension.
The Celestials enlisted the aid of the insectoid Killiks from Alderaan, strategically placing them across the Perlemian Trade Route.
Alongside the Killiks, other races such as the Gree, Kwa, and Rakata served as subordinates to the Celestials.
Together, they embarked on ambitious technological projects, ranging from constructing entire star systems to manipulating hyperspace phenomena.

The Celestials were renowned for their numerous projects in the vicinity of Corellia, Kessel, and other locations within the eastern galactic parts.
Among their notable accomplishments were the construction of the Corellian system, the Vultar system, the Hapes Cluster, the Kathol Rift, and the formidable Maw black-hole cluster.

Around 35,000 BBY, the once-dominant Celestials saw their reign challenged as the Rakata slave race revolted.
Despite the Celestials' attempts to contain them, the Rakata broke through their defenses and launched a brutal campaign of extermination.
According to ancient texts from the Gree Enclave, the Rakata, referred to as the "Soul Hunters," unleashed curses upon the Celestials, known as the "Gray Swallowing" and the "Hollowers of Beings." These curses were said to render the Celestials powerless, earning the Rakata ominous nicknames like the "Faceless Mouths" and "Eaters of Worlds."
By 30,000 BBY, the Celestials vanished from the galaxy, with the Rakatan Infinite Empire rising to prominence.
Similarly, the Killiks disappeared, migrating beyond the Unknown Regions, possibly at the command of the Celestials.

The destiny of the Celestials remained shrouded in mystery.
Some suggested they were ensnared within the galaxy by their defensive measures, annihilated in the Rakatan uprising, or departed from this universe altogether.
Darth Plagueis entertained the notion that the Celestials transcended into the Force, manipulating its flow—an idea echoed in both Jedi and Sith lore.

Although all evidence of the Celestials had disappeared by 30,000 BBY, The Ones persisted within the realm of Mortis until 20 BBY.
Their existence came to an end during a mission undertaken by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano.
