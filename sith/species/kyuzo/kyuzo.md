# Appearance

The Kyuzo are a lanky species who are formally sentient and typically a bipedal humanoid if no defects are present and originated on the gravity-heavy Outer Rim world of Phatrong.
Life under these specific circumstances resulted in the Kyuzo to grow dense muscle fibers that were far stronger and more developed compared to other bipedal species’ and adapt to have faster reflexes resulting in the Kyuzo becoming vastly more dangerous opponents to anyone wanting to fight them in relatively normal gravity.
Because of their thin arms and legs they were often seen as easy opponents but they had more muscle mass than anyone knew, making underestimation a great strength they had.
But they were typically not messed around with as their distinctive green skin that would range from a light olive green all the way to a deep -blue-green palette alongside the wrinkled face that donned a pair of yellowish eyes.
Most eyes would vary though as some would have compound eyes while others have eyes with black slit-shaped pupils.
Eyes were also not the only difference.
Their height would fluctuate a lot as some stood at 1.99 meters tall while other stocky types only stood at around 1.2 meters tall.
Though due to the uncommon makeup of their homeworlds' atmosphere, the Kyuzo frequently wore corrective lenses and highly pressurized filter masks and sometimes bandages over their faces to help their sensitive respiratory system work.
Without these the symptoms could vary but weren’t fatal, it would only slow them down.

# Society

The Kyuzo is a species known for its strong sense of justice and honor.
Most Kyuzo regarded oaths and contracts as unbreakable and many other species sought them as mercenaries, law-enforcement personnel, and bounty hunters.
The Kyuzo were a highly political species, developing societies that had spanned a considerable geographical area, and most Kyuzo did identify as being members of a certain country or region and most major islands as well as continents were their own political units they had set up, though they did form a loose confederacy that didn’t really stick.
Though these Kyuzo weren’t all passive.
The Kyuzo warriors traditionally wore wide-brimmed war helmets that served as shields or as a thrown missile.
These headpieces were originally sought after and developed by the inhabitants of the Kwaidan Peaks to protect travelers from torrential rains during monsoon season in southern Phatrong.
But this was not the only headwear the Kyuzo would wear as not all of them were fighters.
It was simply known as a Kyuzo hat from how popular it became.
Many of the Kyuzo didn’t fight compared to the rest of the population though, many lived simple lives as farmers and merchants.
But despite their known honor and oath among the masses the Kyuzo tended to lean more towards thieves and rogues than any notable figure.

Many of their myths had come from outcast heroes who were forced to oppose the social order so the idea of doing so was very common among them.
Because of this the Kyuzo had favored their own language which had consisted of quickly spoken, short words and phrases.
The Kyuzo weren’t limited to it though as they picked up at a very young age the Galactic Basic Standard which is the most common of languages in the galaxy.
Unfortunately the Kyuzo found this language hard to phrase when sentences tended to draw on.
So they preferred their own language with the assistance of translators or interpreter droids to smooth their interaction with outsiders.
But among their culture the Kyuzo had events known as clovocs, fighting orders that maintained law and order in specific regions of Phatrong.
Their purpose is for governments to help maintain peace within sectors or fight species who oppose them.
Though depending on the region the clovocs could range vastly in terms of numbers, expertise, technique, tradition, and structure depending on the time of mission ahead of them.
During peaceful times though, the clovocs tended to be a tournament with their strongest fighters going head to head in mostly non-fatal battles as occasionally the death of a Kyuzo would happen.
Kyuzo who killed another member would typically flee Phatrong, lest they face the wrath of a powerful clovoc held against them.

# History

The ancient history of clovocs lived on through the Kyuzo as the earliest dated days of Phatrong’s recorded history included clovocs but these have proof of dating back towards even ancienter times on other planets not yet discovered.
Though the myths of the Kyuzo were debatable at best, but if found true it is most likely the Kyuzo had began their society with the development of city-states, and the loose confederation that controlled Phatrong had elected the world’s representatives and senators in the Senate of the Galactic Republic as well as the Imperial Senate of the Galactic Empire.
During some point in history not yet documented, the Ekaqume clovoc put down a rebellion on Phatrong’s Kambey Plains in a single day.
Following the Imperial Senate’s dissolution they had replaced the confederation and oversaw Phatrong directly who would then only expend forces if absolutely necessary and only for clovocs.
Because of their reputation though the Empire had become cautious of them but they didn’t care as long as taxes were paid on time.
A resistance had started not soon after in the hopes they could bolster the Alliance to Restore the Republic at large and form the core of a major resistance force on their homeworld.
