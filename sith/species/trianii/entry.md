# Overview

The Trianii were an advanced sentient felinoid species, originating from the world of Trian.
Their average height was around two meters, and they had strong prehensile tails.
They had excellent balance and eyesight, and proficiency in leaping and acrobatics.
They had fur that came in a large variety of colors and patterns.
Trianii females were generally stronger, more dexterous and mindful of artistic values.
For this reason, tribunals of females named yu’nar governed Trianii society.
Their whole culture was strongly intertwined with their spirituality and religions.
While their religions used to be split, religious leaders agreed upon one single code of moral conduct all individuals should base themselves on, which led to religious peace and acceptance.
They usually wore no clothing, although they appreciated wearing ceremonial robes and jewelry.

# History

The Trianii always were a fiercely independent people: they were constantly driven towards exploration and advancement.
Stunningly, they established colonies in six neighboring systems.
Each colony was autonomous and different from the others, for each Trianii seeking for a different way of life.
They ferociously defended all of their settlements, especially in the CSA-Trianii war, where they defended their Fibuli system from the Corporate Sector Authority.
They always remained independent throughout history, surprisingly even during the Galactic Empire period.
They did not wish to join the Galactic Republic following the Empire’s fall, either.
They produced a number of spaceship designs, such as the RX4 Patrol ship.
