# Overview

Mirialans are a sentient and near-human species originating from the planet of Mirial.
They are widely spread across the galaxy and are very agile and flexible, which makes most of them highly proficient in lightsaber combat.

# Origins

Following the Jedi’s fall and the ascending to the power of the Sith Empire, Mirilians either abandoned their home planet Mirial or attempted to fight back the Empire’s forces and help the refugees of the resulting Great Galactic War.
Many of them became Republic Soldiers or joined the Jedi Order.

# Characteristics

While anatomically they are extremely humanlike, their main defining characteristic is the wide range of colors their skin and eyes can have.
They are also highly genetically compatible with humans, which allows for crossbreeding and the birth of Mirialan-human hybrids.

# Culture

Mirialans tended to be very religious, most with primitive views of the Force.
They believed strongly in destiny, viewing each individual they met in their lives as a contribution to fulfilling such destiny.
They often had geometrical and patterned tattoos on their face, to signify the completion of a certain difficult task or the reaching of an achievement.
Most of them were Jedi, but few joined the Sith Empire, one of them being the Seventh Sister.
