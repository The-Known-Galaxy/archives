# Overview

Natives of Zolan, from the Mid Rim, were a sentient species called the Clawdites, otherwise known as Changelings.
They were of the few shape-shifting species in the galaxy.
They had an appearance similar to a reptilian and had evolved from repto mammals.
They had sunken cheeks with narrow noses and a small mouth.
They possessed large eyes with slit-like pupils, in which their iris could be gold, yellow, or blue colored.
Their skin was rough, ranging from green to yellow.
Their overall facial and bodily features almost fully resembled their genetic ancestors, the Zolanders.
Clawdites possess an extremely rare ability that could change their appearance.
They could change the texture and color of their eyes and skin to mimic the appearance of other similarly shaped beings, including Humans.
Unlike most other shape-shifting entities, the Clawdites found changing their shape physically discomforting.
Clawdites relied on their age mainly when developing their shifting ability.
Younglings were only notable for being able to change their color, while babies used different hues and colors to notify their guardians of different needs.
Normally, Clawdites were known as quiet and isolated beings, specifically shunning the accompaniment of others unless it benefited them.
They saw the galaxy in a pragmatic way and were very harsh realists on most occasions, also being very distrustful and suspicious of other people.
It was necessary for many Clawdites to utilize oils on their skin to prevent cracking or tearing because of how difficult it was to maintain their disguises.
In their natural form, they were basically indistinguishable from their Zolander brethren, however, they could be distinguished via genetic examination.
