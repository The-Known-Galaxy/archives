# Introduction

Dathomirian Zabraks, also known as the Dathomiri Zabkraks were a sentient species native to Dathomir.
Their creation was the result of the crossbreeding of females from the Witches of Dathomir and their slaves, young Zabrak males.
This caused the species to have prominent differences that separated the males from the females.
Females had pale gray or white skin, while males had a range of skin tones such as red, orange, and yellow.
A feature that the females possessed that the males could not was the ability to grow hair, which ranged in color.
Such colors were black, brown, silver, silver-blonde, and white.
However, all Dathomirians bore tribal tattoos that symbolize family loyalty, place of birth, or individual personality.

# Section One

During the era of the Galactic Republic, a majority of the Dathomirian females were a part of the Nightsister coven of Dathomir Witches.
In Nightsister society, Dathomirian males were to serve the Nightsisters as warriors and they were known as the Nightbrothers.
Darth Maul was a Nightbrother in his youth until he was handed off to Darth Sidious to become his apprentice.
Another prominent name amongst the ranks of the Dathomirians was Asajj Ventress.
She was given to pirates by the Nightsisters and consequently grew up on the planet of Rattatak.
During the Clone Wars, General Grievous attacked the Nightsisters who had taken refuge in their fortress.
He wiped out all of the Nightsisters except for Mother Talzin and Asajj Ventress, who returned not long before his arrival.
This resulted in the annihilation of the majority of the Dathomirian population.
Around 18 BBY, the Galactic Civil War rolled around, and the Nightsisters were mainly comprised of humans.
During 8 ABY, the Nightsisters were slowly reformed by the only remaining Dathomirian member, Clan Mother Gethzerion.
