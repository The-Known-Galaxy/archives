# Appearance of Klatooinian

Klatooinians were a species of sentient humanoids from a planet known as Klatooine which could be located in the Outer Rim Territories.
Klatooinians were fairly common throughout the galaxy and were found quite distinguishable from other species as they possessed a firm brow and visible teeth.
On top of this Klatooinians had a stronger build which had made most of the species useful when it came to more laboring jobs.
Their skin color was also a defining feature as it ranged from green to brown and their uniquely green blood had also made them quite distinguished.
Most Klatooinians could be found in deserts or wastelands as those locations were their natural habitats.
Another defining feature these creatures posses is their ability to be force sensitive.

# History

Most Klatooinians became bounty hunters as their strong builds allowed them to overpower many foes.
But the occasional few would also become henchmen and bodyguards.
Though these jobs were for the lucky few who didn’t get sold into slavery as their strong prowess and effectiveness in laboring jobs had made them desirable to most.
In the history of Klatooinians there have been a few prominent members.
One of these being Tarados Gon who was force-sensitive and ended up joining the Jedi Order.
More predominant members of this species included Castas, a male Klatooinian bounty-hunter who had seen most of their business during the Clone Wars and had taken out many targets.
Klatooinians had also strived from the path of good and taking out crime and decided to assist in crime under the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure.
More criminal acts include Klatooinian raiders who after the fall of the Galactic Empire in 9 ABY, had created a tribe on the planet of Sorgan.
This tribe had found an AT-ST walker and repurposed it for their own benefit.
This included attacking a remote village on multiple separate occasions until they were found defeated by the hands of Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin and a former rebel shock trooper who went by Cara Dune.
Though the worst criminal act the Klatooinians had committed was done by the Klatooinian Family.
A group of Klatooinians that had resided within the city of Mos Espa on the sand planet Tatooine.
After Jabba the Hutt died during the disastrous defeat in the sail barge disaster, his majordomo and Bib Fortuna had claimed his throne which had caused the Klatooinians to act and split up their family from Jabba’s criminal empire.
Despite this split, the Klatooinians had managed to capture and claim the spaceport and upper sprawl.
During 9 ABY though, the Klatooinians had formed an alliance with the Trandoshan family as well as the Aqualish family who had created an alliance with the well known Daimyo Boba Fett’s gotra.
The Klatooinian family would then go on to betray the gotra as they used their power to force multiple Gamorrean guards off a cliff, killing all who were forced.
