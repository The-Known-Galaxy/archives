# Overview

The Purrgil are a Semi-Sentient species that dwells in the voids between galaxies.
Commonly referred to as Space Whales, these whales can travel between galaxies.
In the new Ahsoka show, it is discovered that these whales can be communicated with through the Force even though they are Semi-Sentient.

The method Purrgil uses to be able to traverse galaxies is unknown, but it is known that the back of their bodies enables them to traverse hyperspace to other galaxies.

Purrgil lived in groups called flocks, pods, or swarms that counted up to a dozen of them.

There was a subspecies of Purrgil called the Purrgil Ultra which was significantly larger than ordinary Purrgil and with a few other differences.
