# Overview

The Gand were an insectoid species native to the planet of Gand that breathed ammonia, forcing many of their species to wear respirators to survive in the oxygen-rich environments that they are not used to.
Gand were sturdy, three-fingered, two-toed insectoid sentient species with brown skin whose heads featured a pair of silver compound eyes.
Gands also possessed earholes, and along with their large compound eyes, they had a large visual range of color spectrum including the ultraviolet spectrum, with excellent night vision; however, they could not perceive color in complete darkness.
Although having three fingers, most Gands were notable for being able to punch through Stormtrooper armor, which would then become known as “Piercing Touch”.
Their eyes were covered with a layer of a keratin substance that protected their eyes from flying debris, most prevalently useful in sandstorms.
They were a species that was closely related to the Kel Dor and Tognath species, who also wore masks off of their homeworlds.
A notable member of this species is a bounty hunter named Zuckuss, one of the original findsman to leave their home planet.
The Findsmen was a mystic tradition that dates back centuries for the people of their planet that were pristine trackers.
They were also known for speaking a language of the same name.
Located in the galaxy’s Outer Rim territories, from the planet of the same name, was a bounty hunter by the name of Rinn who took a job accompanied by Jango Fett before the plot to assassinate Galactic Senate member Padmé Amidala.
