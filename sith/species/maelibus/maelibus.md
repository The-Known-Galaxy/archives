# Overview
The Maelibi (plural of Maelibus), are a mysterious species native to the planet Lego, which are known by the visitors of the planet as Demons.
Those tall creatures which were 2-3 Meters on average live underground, near the core.
They are proficient burrowers and are rarely seen on the surface, instead lurking underneath the ground, ready to feast on unlucky outlanders.
They are the lesser known species inhabiting the planet, greatly overshadowed by the Diathim.

# Biology
It is said that the Maelibi have striking similarities with the Diathim yet do not possess wings.
They have a humanoid body that seems to be formed from actual molten gold.
Just like the Diathim, they are Force Sensitive.
Their skin is incredibly hard to pierce but also reflective, making blaster shots all but useless against them.
Contact with concentrated beams of energy (like Lightsabers) are reflected off of their skin.
They can even survive the vacuum of space.
They have claws on the tip of each of their three fingers, and possess sharp teeth; but the reason why they are labeled as demons, clearly hail from their dual sets of horns.
They are known to be incredibly well versed in the art of burrowing, but also have displayed immense speed and strength while doing so.


It is evident that they are also amazing fighters, being able to fight underground with very poor visibility and lighting, thus making this another proof of their ability to easily navigate while robbed of most of their basic senses.
Their more terrifying ability is their unholy hypnotic singing ability specifically designed to disrupt brainwaves, triggering an hypnotic trance-like state in even the mightiest of sentients.
The very few who managed to survive an encounter with the Maelibi have expressed many things about how their voice is that of an angel, and how their vocal chords can produce sounds akin to the “Embodiment of music”.
It is to be noted that so far, none has been able to resist this cursed siren call, for most people drawn in to those sounds, end up being prey to the demons, who burst out of their burrows and drag them underneath the surface, only to then proceed to feast on their victim alive.



# Society and Culture
As an extremely aggressive species, there isn’t much known about the Maelibi besides the information above.
So far, a handful of contacts have been made, but as a species that is known for its predatory behaviors and its refusal to leave its own planet while being fully sentient and immune to the vacuum of space, they clearly see any outlander as prey to consume.
They seem to be highly intelligent and their underground system of burrows is complex and literally a maze for any outlander.
Even the Diathim aren’t safe, and mostly are tolerated as some sort of forced sharing of the planet.



# Recovered Audio Logs
Below are the recovered logs of two Siths attempting to learn more about this species.

The master and the apprentice remained still after feeling something odd within the force.
They could sense them.
They seemed to be..
Everywhere.
Was it the planet itself that was messing with their senses?
Or was it the fact that they were underneath the ground, near the core, and oh so well aware of the two dark side users that were obviously not native to this land.
As they carefully started to venture towards another location, an unusual sound was suddenly heard through the receiver.
Like that of the ground collapsing in front of them.
This was the entrance of one of the many burrows the Maelibi were known for making in a moment’s notice.

The Master: Careful, my apprentice, for we are dealing with a force that may just feast upon your insides the second you falter.
This shall be a test of will, but also of might.
Ready yourself.

The Apprentice: Yes, my master.

Not even a few meters in, an intricate set of high and low pitches sounds can be heard around them.

The Apprentice: My master, can you hear-

The Master: This song.
What is this?

The Apprentice: It’s..
Beautiful.

The Master: Never would I have thought that such angelic sounds could ever be..

After this, any verbal communication with the two Siths was lost, instead simply hearing the noise getting slightly louder as the two siths approached the source of it.
Not even a minute later, a large burrowing sound was heard, the high and low pitched noises, now labeled as Siren Song, being suddenly much louder, followed by the screams of both Siths before losing contact with the team.
