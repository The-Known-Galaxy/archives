# Tuk'ata

Tuk’ata were a non-sentient species that were presumed to be a myth by most.
Rumors said that these species had four limbs, sharp claws that could rip through enemies, sharp fangs, a spiny back, and a pair of orange eyes which glowed viciously.
They are classified as a Sith warbeast, since they were used by the Sith as hunters.
Most Tuk’ata could be found inhabiting the planet known as Korriban.

There was one tuk’ata that was able to leap twice its height, which not many other tuk'ata could do.
They honed different abilities and skills which allowed them to be good hunters.

# History

Sometime following the Battle of Yavin, Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra, a human female archeologist, and her crew of Shistaven were on the hunt for the ancient artifact known as the Sword of Khashyun which made Sith turn on each other when beholding this relic.
While entering the temple in which the Sword of Khashyun was held, she and her crew stumbled upon a tuk’ata.
She was quite surprised when she encountered this beast, as she believed that these monsters were just myths.

The beast chased Doctor Aphra and her crew, until they were able to trick the tuk’ata into entering a trap set with a laser field.
They lured the beast into the trap while the crew was acting as if they were injured.

The tuk’ata took the bait, entering the trap as it leapt up at the crew, activating the laser field, being killed in the process, which gave the Doctor and the crew the chance to escape, unable to get the Sword of Khashyun.
