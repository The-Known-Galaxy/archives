# Overview

The Ezaraa were a sentient humanoid species that lived on the planet Ezaraa.
Only a little about their warrior race besides their combative and carnivorous tendencies is known.
They were often seen as intimidating due to their stature and wore exoskeleton-like armour, a symbol of war.
All Ezaraa existed within a dominion spanning two continents of their homeworld.
The Ezaraa Dominion exhibited xenophobic ideologies intending to overthrow the Galactic Empire that had invaded their planet.
Their ultimate plan had been to consume the flesh of all the lesser life forms and take over the galaxy.
Steps were taken to prepare for the invasion of their foes.

# Ezaraa in the galaxy

At around 0 BBY, a futile attempt was made by an unidentified Ezaraa to trade with the Queen of Ktath’atn at her citadel, hoping to obtain a gift of power.
A year later, the dominion visited an auction for a rare alien artefact to promote its military capabilities.
Ex-imperial host Dr Chelli Lona Aphra later revealed this item as the Rur crystal, containing the Eternal Rur, the artificial intelligent conscience of former Jedi Rur.
During the auction, the Ezaraa offered 0.00001% of their Imperial revenue for the doctor and her following ten descendants, threatening to torture them should she decline.
Forced to lie, the host said the offer would be considered.
To demonstrate the power of the Eternal Rur, the doctor allowed it to possess a droid of the Cyban Front, which was quickly shot down and sent for repair.
Before the auction could be helpful for the Ezaraa, the doctor’s accompanying Imperial droids, 0-0-0 and BT-1, inserted the Eternal Rur back into the droid and armed it with two lightsabers, all in retaliation against their rogue master.
They also alerted Darth Vader to force the doctor to give them freedom.
The Eternal Rur escaped its container and promised to seek revenge on those who attempted to buy it.
In typical Ezaara fashion, the Ezaara opened fire at the possessed droid to retrieve the crystal.
However, this was all in vain and resulted in the massacre of the Ezaraa, alongside the other buyers, by gunfire and Darth Vader’s hand in the Skirmish aboard the Sorca Retreat.
The leader of the dominion fled.
