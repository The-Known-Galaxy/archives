# Introduction

Weequays were a sentient species from the planet Sriluur that were found across the galaxy.
Weequay had strong, leathery skin that was immune to both desert settings and blaster fire.
Many Weequay worked for the Hutt Clan as mercenaries, pirates, and bodyguards.
Hondo Ohnaka, the leader of the Ohnaka Gang, and the Jedi Sora Bulq were both notable Weequays.

# Section 1

Weequay was a sentient species native to Sriluur's desert world.
Weequays were found all around the galaxy.
Their rough, leathery skin let them tolerate the harsh climate of their homeworld while also giving inherent resistance to blaster fire as they evolved under ruthless conditions.
Weequays were therefore perfect bodyguards and bounty hunters.
Some Weequay developed horns on their lower jaws, while others had rough skin extensions.
Weequays wore their hair long most of the time.
Weequays were able to interact with other adjacent Weequays via pheromones which went undetected to non-Weequays.
Weequays could be Force-sensitive as well.

# Section 2

Many Weequays fought a series of conflicts against the Houk species.
Since the Hutts dominated their homeworld, many Weequays worked as mercenaries, bodyguards, and slaves for the Hutts.
Some managed to escape the hardships and joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic, where they used their skills to save the galaxy.
Hondo Ohnaka and his Ohnaka Gang were involved in various skirmishes with both the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars.
The pirate gang was based in Florrum until it was eradicated by Separatist forces led by General Grievous.
