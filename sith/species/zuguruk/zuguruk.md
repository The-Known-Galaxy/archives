# Overview
The Zuguruks are a subspecies of the Sith race and hail from Korriban, which is a cold and dry location.
The Zuguruks were similar to other castes in the Sith species.
This species of sith had a humanoid shape and their skin can come from either obsidian or crimson red.
Unlike most Sith species they had five-digit fingers like a human.

# History
Around the year 6900 BBY, The inhabitants of Korriban and the Ziost were subdued and captured by a group of people called the Dark Jedi Exiles.
The Zuguruks still did their jobs even under the rule of a former Jedi High Council member.
One of the 12 Dark Jedi saw the potential for the Zurguruks and was convenient due to the Dark Jedi needing a Starfleet and decided to threaten to remove the dark lord if he didn't go through with his agenda.



# Culture
The Zuguruks were a species given the purpose of construction and were master architects.
They would be given tasks to build things such as machines, engines, and buildings.
Before the Dark Jedi arrived, the Zuguruks were focused on making a Tumili but when taken over their efforts were more focused toward starships to help the new Sith Empire.
