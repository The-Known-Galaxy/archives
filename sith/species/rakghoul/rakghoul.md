# Overview
The Rakghoul are a non-sentient, carnivorous species that spawned from Sith Alchemy.
The first Rakghouls were created through the Muur Talisman, an amulet able to convert any non-force sensitive sentient beings into these creatures.
Rakghouls are also able to multiply through the Rakghoul plague: a virus that spreads through their bites and scratches and begins a slow and agonizing transformation process into these creatures.

# Origins
Rakghouls were created by the ancient Sith Lord Karness Muur, as he desired an army to rule over as well as a way to persist after death.
He achieved this by forging the talisman, imbuing it with his spirit and power.
While the Muur Talisman couldn’t transform certain individuals directly, the Rakghoul plague had no limits on the subjects it could infect, making it a near-unstoppable weapon.
Due to the amulet’s concerning power, Karness was killed by his rivals, and the Muur Talisman was stolen.



# History
The talisman would end up being passed upon many Sith, before ending up in Taris’ impoverished Undercity, in which the Rakghoul plague would run rampant for many years.
Despite millions of people infected, the planet eventually managed to remove Rakghoul’s presence completely (following the creation of a Rakghoul serum which interrupted and reverted transformation) which brought to their extinction.
Such extinction was only temporary though, as the talisman would be found and retrieved by Jedi Knight Celeste Morne, before being abandoned for four thousand years and reclaimed by Sith Lord Remulus Dreypa.
She would then proceed to use the Muur Talisman’s powers against the current Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Krayt and attempt to kill him but ended up being overpowered by Muur’s spirit.
She would then be struck down by Cade Skywalker, who resisted the talisman’s influence and destroyed it, finally bringing an end to the Rakghoul.



# Characteristics
Extremely repugnant and with animal-like instincts, these creatures are naturally mindless and feel nothing more than a constant craving for flesh.
They have no hierarchy, although they usually hunt in packs ranging from four to eight.
They are extremely aggressive, hardy, and vicious.

The only occasion in which their personality changed was when they were under the influence of the Muur Talisman, in which the amulet’s holder could control and command any nearby Rakghoul at their will.
Their animal instincts would also subside, and they would be more similar to their personality before transformation, being able to use any former combat knowledge.
