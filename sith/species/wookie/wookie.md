# History
Wookiees have a rich history going back thousands of years.
During the reign of Emperor Palpatine, they were enslaved by the Galactic Empire and used as forced labor to extract resources on their home planet.
Eventually, however, they rebelled against their oppressors and contributed to the Empire's defeat during the Battle of Endor.
During the Clone Wars, the Wookiees fought alongside the Jedi Order and were known for their bravery and fighting abilities.
One of their most famous allies was Jedi Master Yoda, who had close friendships with many Wookiees, including Chewbacca.
Chewbacca himself was a key figure in the rebellion against the Empire, serving as Han Solo's co-pilot and playing a key role in many battles.
