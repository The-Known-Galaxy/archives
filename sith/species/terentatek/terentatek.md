# Overview
The Terentatek are a non-sentient, carnivorous species known for feeding off the blood of Force Sensitives.
They’re widely spread across the galaxy, being present in planets such as Korriban or Kashyyyk.
Extremely related to the dark side of the force, Terentatek presence is oftentimes an indicator of great Sith predominance across the galaxy.

# History
Despite their tendency to the dark side, surprisingly Terentateks were originally a result of Jedi Alchemy.
A predecessor creature known as the Terenta was created by Jedi Master Quan-Jang to track explosives, although due to being fed force-enriched meat, ended up developing a craving for Force Sensitives’ flesh.
Following this, they would be abandoned on one of Tython’s moons, Bogan.


They would be encountered again centuries later on the planet of Dromund Kaas.
Following this, the Sith Lord Exar Kun would start creating Terentateks through Sith Alchemy due to their natural predation of Jedi and force resistance.
These creatures would quickly become known as the most dangerous creature bred by the Sith, earning the name of “Jedi Killers”, and being used to destroy Jedi outposts on Tython, Tatooine, and Kashyyyk.
Due to this, the Jedi would eventually attempt to exterminate the Terentatek in an event known as The Great Hunt, in which groups of Jedi would hunt these creatures across the galaxy.
While the hunt was a modest success, Terentateks still managed to return whenever the Sith’s rule strengthened across the galaxy, such as during the rule of Darth Revan, and Darth Sidious.



# Characteristics
They’re bipedal carnivores, which are quite similar to rancors in appearance, albeit much smaller.
They have two large tusks at the sides of their mouth and long, sharp claws which are both extremely poisonous.
A Terentatek’s hide is also resistant (if not immune) to the effects of the Force.


They are naturally drawn to inhabit locations that have a strong connection to the dark side of the force, such as caves or Sith Tombs.
It is also thought they hibernate and hide when the dark side’s presence in the galaxy is weak, and come out of hibernation repopulating the galaxy when the dark side’s presence was strong.
