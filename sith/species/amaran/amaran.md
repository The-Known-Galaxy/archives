# Overview

Amarans are a peculiar sentient alien species, which present both canine and vulpine characteristics.
Their body is covered in fur, usually orange or white-colored, and they are bipedal.
They have long, silky tails, narrow whiskered muzzles, and pointy ears.
They are small in size and generally lightweight.
They walked digitigrade, with four clawed digits per limb.
They often wore clothing together with earrings or necklaces and favored staffs as weapons of choice.
They had great propension to bargaining and bickering over transactions, and many members of the species often worked in the field of animal taming and trading.

# History

They first appeared on the planet Amar, of the Airon Sector in the Inner Rim.
Such planet would always be part of the Galactic Republic until the rise of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire in 137 ABY, which it fell under.
They often used Hyperspace technology, and by the time of the Clone Wars, they began emigrating en masse and spreading around the galaxy.
In particular, they would greatly spread on the planet of Vulpter, in which they provided a great amount of workforce.
This led to distrust and discrimination between the planetâ€™s natives, the Vulptereens, and the Amarans.
By the time of the creation of the New Republic, some Amarans had even spread as far as Naboo, in which they distinguished themselves as extremely skillful animal tamers.
