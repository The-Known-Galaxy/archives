# Overview
The Slith were a sentient serpentine species that lived on one of three habitable moons of Yavin Prime, named Yavin XIII, in the Outer Rim Territories.
These beings grew to five metres and had scales while frequently displaying patterns of stripes or spots.
Their red eyes were protected by translucent eyelids that guarded their vision against the sandstorms that would occur on the moon.
Using their venomous fangs paired with sidewinding movement, these nocturnal hunters quickly paralyse their soon-to-be food, returning to their tribes with their prey alive.
During the day, they would hide away from the heat in places of shelter, either digging deep into the sand or staying in the shade of large structures, such as giant cacti.
The Slith had limited vocal potential, only producing a few sounds due to moisture evaporation that occurred in their bodies.
Therefore, they resorted to rubbing their jagged scales against the ground, a language called Slithese.
The Slith had a male-dominated structure in nomadic clans of about a dozen individuals.
Tribes were led by an alpha male, assisted by the most senior male and female after the alpha male, aptly titled the “Lieutenant male” and “First Mate”, respectively.
Most females, like Dresk Kist, were carers and hunters, while males protected their traditions and the young.
Several ceremonies took place, including prayer to spirits and worship of gods, confirming that the species was somewhat civilised.

# Presence in the Galaxy
The Slith were largely unknown in the galaxy due to being many thousands of years behind other races.
Still, even when contact was established, they preferred to stay isolated.
Some conditions made them emerge from this segregation, namely with the native Gerb species for trading valuable goods, like twilight lizards.
Eventually, an Imperial scouting team discovered both species in an expedition to the moon, from which numbers of Slith were estimated to be around 19 million.
The Rebel Alliance sent their own exploratory body, the Fernandin Scouting Expedition, to Yavin XIII but accidentally brought a plague, harming the Gerb.
When there was a chance that the disease could mutate to harm humans, the Empire plotted to demolish the moon’s surface to minimise its spread.
The rebels sought to prevent this from happening, and with the crisis averted, the Slith stayed on the moon into the era of the New Galactic Republic.
Only a few knew about their existence; for example, Rodian archaeologist Suz Tanwa in her travels and Jedi Padawans on the neighbouring moon of Yavin IV.
Yet another crisis occurred when the war-mongering Yuuzhan Vong attempted to invade the system to eradicate the New Jedi Order, leading to the extinction of life on the habitable moons of Yavin Prime.
This marked the end of the Slith.
