# Appearance

Snivvian are mammal-like creatures with humanoid features.
They are native to the planet Cadomai Prime and they were often called snaggletooths due to their protruding jaws and short fangs.
They come from a planet that is cold weather based, but have evolved to have thicker skin and less fur.
Because of their long snout, Snivvians are extremely talented at tracking.
Most Snivvians preferred to speak basic but knew quite a few secondary languages for diversity purposes.
Some refused to speak any other language than their native one due to symbolic, subtextual, and fashionable reasons.

# Society and culture

Snivvians were some of the most known in art and writing.
Since the air is extremely cold, Snivvians spend long periods of time inside.
During these times, Snivvians perfected their artistic abilities such as art, painting, and writing.
They produced masterpieces in holography, painting, sculptures, music, and the written word as well as a unique version of art called transnovel.
Even though technology made it where Snivvians didn't have to hibernate they still did this out of tradition and respect of the culture.
Snivvians would not stop for anything to improve their artistic abilities even if it was dangerous.
Snivvians had traits of sociopathic tendencies, when male twins were born, one of them would have psychotic tendencies.
