# Introduction
Native to the planet of Myrkr, the Vornskr were vicious canines that had the ability to sense the Force.
This helped them evolve and over time they started hunting the Ysalamir.
However, there was an adverse effect that caused them to think that Force-sensitives were prey too.
To protect against this, the Ysalamiri experimented and created the ability to project a Force bubble and no Force abilities could be used inside this bubble.
The Vornskr were nocturnal hunters and used their whip-like, venom-filled tails to stun their prey.
They would then seal the deal with their teeth.
Although usually dormant during the day, hunger or a potential danger would cause them to switch to diurnal hunting.

# Section One
Tyber Zann trained such creatures in his consortium, aptly dubbed the Zann Consortium.
He took the younger of the species away from their home and disciplined them to be effective hunters, so no enemy troops would be able to escape.
A smuggler by the name of Talon Karrde had two vornskrs that he named Sturm and Drang.
Sturm and Drang served as pets and guards; however, Karrde thought of selling them as guard animals.
He also discovered that if you cut off their tail, it was similar to castration since it reduced most of their hunting aggression.
He apparently did this by accident when he shot off Sturm’s tail in self defense.
This discovery was even written about in an article of the Galactic Zoology Monthly.
He also mentioned that the Vornskrs were easier to control when removing a frequently used weapon.



# Section Two
During the Peace Brigade attack in the Invasion of Yavin IV, Talon Karrde outsmarted the Peace Brigade by tricking them to Kam and Tionne Solusar.
He did this by ordering two vornskrs to find the Jedi and later letting them follow the trail they had left.
During the hunt, Karrde convinced the Peace Brigade that he was the owner of the last two remaining vornskrs.
The members of the Peace Brigade fell for his lies.
However, the Yuuzhan Vong were informed by a New Republic Senator by the name of Viqi Shesh that plentiful vornskrs originated from Myrkr.
The Yuuzhan Vong proceeded to use the species as a biological template for a new species called the Voxyn.
Vornskrs were also used as guards in the Dark Force Temple on Dromund Kaas.
