# Overview

Cantrosians are a sentient bipedal species very similar to domestic cats.
Their bodies are covered in fur of various colors, and their claws can be used as weapons, and strikes from them cause an illness known as Cantrosian-scratch fever.
Historically they mostly supported the Galactic Republic during conflicts.
They are originally from the planet Cantros 7, hence the name.
They were reasonably advanced as a species, possessing the ability to construct pilot starships, pilot T-65 X-Wings, and handle blasters.

# Culture

They had extremely refined politics despite being non-humans, and were split into many smaller Cantosian factions.
Although rather than actual factions, it was more of a competition on who was able to show the most loyalty to the republic:  to undermine the opposing factions, cantrosians often accused others to be Imperial sympathizers, often ensuing conflicts.
