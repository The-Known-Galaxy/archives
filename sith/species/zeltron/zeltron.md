# Overview
The Zeltron were a sentient human-like species.
Their skin-color were typically different shades of red, but becoming a dark red if they became angry and their hair color was either black or purple.
It was alleged that the Zeltron would give off pheromones to influence people's opinions on them to ensure that they were liked and making sure people felt calm near them.
Due to their nature and pheromones, the Zeltron would feel much stronger for people than others typically would, meaning their emotions would be heightened when near them and heightened even more when near someone they cared about.
