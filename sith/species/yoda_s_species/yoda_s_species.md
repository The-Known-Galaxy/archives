# Overview
Yoda’s species was a mysterious sentient species highly attuned to the Force, native to a secretive planet assumed to be in the far western sectors of the galaxy.
Little is known about them due to their rarity in the galaxy.
Known members of their race were small in stature, covered in rough green skin and appeared with a distinct set of long pointed ears and three-digit appendages.
Females were able to grow much more hair than their male counterparts.

# Culture
These Force-sensitive beings aged extremely slowly, staying infants for at least fifty years, like in the case of Jin Grogu.
After a hundred years, individuals would reach maturity and live for centuries, as seen with the notable figures, Jedi Masters Oteg, Vandar Tokare, Yoda and Yaddle.
While all could speak Galactic Basic, some had an archaic dialect.
Yoda’s species were gifted with a high midi-chlorian count, allowing them to utilise Force abilities from even a young age, such as telekinesis, healing and creating spatial barriers.
They were often underestimated in combat due to their height, but this would be a shortfall for any opponent they duelled.
Despite their power, all species had an affinity to the Light Side of the Force and protecting others.
Yet, there were rare occasions when members showcased the Dark Side, like Force Choke and Lightning, showing that even they battled their emotions.
