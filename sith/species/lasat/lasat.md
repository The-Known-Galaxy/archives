# Appearance
The Lasat are a group of sentient humanoid species who were notable for their impressive height, strength, and agility among most.
With their muscular digitigrade legs it had enabled them to run faster, jump higher, farther, and move more quietly than humans.
They came equipped with large finger pads and prehensile toes which assisted them in climbing.
In addition to their large physical features, they also had larger eyes and ears to give them superior sight and hearing capabilities over humans and with their impressive stature they even had the strength to open a powered-down blast door which could be done easier by taller types but most were typically above two meters tall as anything below that was considered below-average for a Lasat.
Some fur patterns did vary on a Lasat as it seemingly changed from individual to individual with some changing drastically as they aged.
But this was mostly noticed by other Lasat as the odor to humans was considered to be unbearable to be around so most humans and species stayed away from them.

# Society
Within the species, those who had superior fighting skills were the most respected among the general populace, often being members of the Lasan High Honor Guard whom of which were a group of highly trained and intelligent warriors who had sworn to protect their homeworld of Lasan.
Bo-rifles were a long-standing tradition in Lasat culture; these weapons had evolved to become of use exclusively by the Honor Guard of Lasan.
But the weapons could move around in ownership as the way of the Lasat warrior was the Boosahn Keeraw, which deemed when a Lasat was bested by a superior opponent in combat, they would stand down and give them their weapon.
The way they handled weapons was not the only defining feature of the Lasat.
Facial hair was surprisingly an important part of their culture.
Those with green eyes and prominent purple stripes were considered the most attractive of the species.
Juvenile Lasat also had a knack for climbing tree branches for fun and entertainment or in some cases, a challenge.
Of the Lasat that exist they spoke their own language of Lasat.
A language whose r’s were difficult to replicate by most species who would try and even come close to replication.
On their homeworld, time was measured by counting how many dust seasons they had survived through.
The Lasat also had their own religion of sorts as they believed in the Ashla, a Spirit of the Galaxy and a personification of the Force.
Using the Bo-rifle, Lasat were able to channel the force and in doing so could see past and future events that would take place.
The Lasat who had become exceptionally good at this would come to be known as Revered Masters, whom of which often carried Ashla Staffs.
These staffs had a special connection to the Ashla.



# History
Lasat were native to the planet Lira San which could be found beyond a cluster of collapsed stars in Wild Spice.
During an unknown point in time, a group of Lasats had colonized the Outer Rim world of Lasan and over many years their homeworld had only been reduced to a myth among other Lasat.
During the Clone Wars, a galaxy-spanning conflict had formed between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
During this time a Lasat had joined the Jedi Order and participated in the sudden conflict.
This Lasat would go by Jaro Tapal.
This was the only Lasat contribution to the conflict as the species as a whole did not participate in the war.
During the end of the war, the Republic was transformed into the Galactic Empire, whom of which had devastated Lasat, destroying the High Honor Guard, the royal family, and killing most of the species which had made their appearance very rare across the galaxy.
Wookies had tried to stop the empire from purging the Lasat at the cost of their own lives.
None of the Lasat remained on their homeworld as the place they once called home was forgotten and far too dangerous.
Sadly, most of the species had fallen into slavery from the Galactic Empire.
As more and more Lasat died and more and more stopped using their traditional tongue, the Bo-rifle, much like the lightsaber, had become a symbol of a dying age.
Fifteen years after the creation of the Empire, three brave Lasat had gone off in quest to search the wider galaxy on the mission to find Lira San with the help of the rebellion.
