Vultans were a near-human species known to have existed at least five thousand years before the Great Hyperspace War, their homeworld housing on the planet Vulta within the Mid Rim Territories.
They seemed to resemble humans, only leaving out their ethereal pale skin, ligament creases, and ridges.
The male gender of these species seemed to have those ridges located on their head which ensured protection from any injuries on that upper part of the body.
The females, however, had plump strands emitting from there.
Vultans were well versed in their body structure, as it was crucial knowing this information for the preparation of the rituals they held.
Other structures located on their body consisted of two-toed feet, shark-like fins, and white eyes that were mistaken as a blindness attribute as they had no pupils or irises.

They were fluent and well educated in their language, Dromnyr, and the most common language within the Galaxy, Basic.
Over the years, they have grown exceptionally interested in the latest sophisticated technologies and researched their use the greatest which overall proved their intelligence as a species.
