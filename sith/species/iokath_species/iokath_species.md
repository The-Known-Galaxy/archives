# Overview

Before the Eternal Empire, a species constructed an illusive ecosphere in the Unknown Regions using their ingenuity and the elements harvested from a solar system.
The planet was soon dubbed Iokath.
Since the name of said species has been lost to time, they are now called the Iokath species.
They reached a height of two metres and were renowned for having larger heads than other humanoid species.
The Iokath species were a technological race; its social structure comprised scientists, engineers, analysts, and designers who spent centuries developing Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMPs), answering to only the Master Designers Council.
In their endeavours to create power WMPs, they didn't hesitate to test them on live species.
It is said that over 70 worlds were destroyed, and trillions of people lost their lives due to this, despite their non-violent and expansionist nature.
In some cases, they even provided help for survivors of their tests to rebuild what they lost, only to test their WMP on them again several centuries later.
Eventually, in the later era of their species, the Iokath species relied on simulations to carry out tests.

# Technological Demise

Their technology developed exponentially over time.
An example of this was the creation of the Eternal Fleet and GEMINI droid captains, a deadly combination that featured cloaking technology, full automation, and an overwhelming arsenal.
Ironically, the Iokath species were also responsible for creating the Gravestone, a massive combat frigate able to destroy the Eternal Fleet.
In addition to this, they made several droids, such as the Old Gods and SCORPIO.
A civil war broke out on Iokath, which saw the creators unleashing their WMPs upon each other.
In an attempt to save their technology, it was driven away from the conflict into Wild Space.
However, one side of this battle caught hold of and released the Old Gods, which counterproductively led to the ensuing planetary-scale destruction and the conclusion of the Iokath species.
Only a single sentient droid of the Iokath species survived, ARIES, which assumed reign over the demolished ruins to build a world of its image.
