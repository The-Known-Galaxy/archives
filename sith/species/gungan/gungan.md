# Appearance
Gungans, the original inhabitants of the planet Naboo, are slim and tall bipedal amphibians, an adult can measure up to 1.9 meters.
Gungans have beak-like mouths with strong teeth and chameleon-like tongues, and they also have very long ears.
Their eyes and skin color can vary.
Their skeleton is cartilaginous and, like their strong legs with reinforced knees, is adapted for swimming.
Gungans are omnivores, but they mostly eat marine animals, a meaty diet.

# Society
Gungan society consists of many clans and villages.
There are physical differences between the various clans, but the philosophy of life and characteristics remain common to all.
The most prominent forms among the Gungans are the Ankura and the most numerous Otolla.
The Ankur race is more robust, lacking beak-like mouths and long ears, which has caused them to stay longer on solid ground.
They use special domes, protecting the underwater cities from water maintained by hydrostatic fields.
They also use biotechnology to make energy balls, submarines and weapons.



# History
They initially had a hostile relationship with the human colonizers of Naboo, but eventually formed an alliance with Queen Amidala to defend against the Trade Federation's invasion.
After the invasion, the Gungans and humans from planet Naboo established a peaceful coexistence and worked together to rebuild their planet.
One of the Gungans, Jar Jar Binks, has become a representative of the Gungan people in the Galactic Senate.
During the Clone Wars, the Gungans stayed faithful to the Galactic Republic.
