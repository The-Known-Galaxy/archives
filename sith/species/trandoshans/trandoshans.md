# History

Trandoshans are born and come from the planet Trandosha.
Trandoshans are known to be enthusiastic hunters.
All Trandoshans first hunt is a creature called the Frist Wolves.
Trandoshans have a goddess they worship called The Scorekeeper.
The Trandoshans had taken control of the moon Wasskah, which would become the location of game preserves.
A Trandoshan hunter named Garnac had control of an island called Island Four and would run a hunting guild out of the floating fortress that hovered on the island.
Garnac’s scouts would travel to different worlds and kidnap and transport sentient beings dumping them on Island Four in which the newly made prisoners would be hunted for sport.
During the Clone Wars, three young Jedi were captured and brought to Wasskah to be hunted for sport.
For a long time, the young Jedi would evade the Trandoshans.
Eventually, the Trandoshan hunter Lo-Taren would capture Jedi Padawan Ashoka Tano on the planet Felucia and would transport the Padawan to Wasskah and to Island Four.
Trandoshans would turn out to be very good bounty hunters due to the background they have in Hunting on Trandosha.
At least 1 notable Trandoshan bounty hunter was named Bossk.
Bossk would later become the bodyguard of the young up-and-coming bounty hunter Boba Fett along with numerous contracts and become a very well-known bounty Hunter.

Trandoshans had bad relationships with Wookiees as Trandoshans would hunt and kill Wookiees regularly and Trandoshans found Wookiees to be great hunting targets.

# Other Jobs

Not all Trandoshans took to bounty hunting or to do work related to hunting.
Some of them would take on other jobs and tasks that fit them better.
Some Trandoshans would-be traders and scrappers.
One notable Scrapper/Salveger Trandoshan was named Gha Nachkt.
This Trandoshan was a captain of a salvage ship during the Clone Wars.
One of Gha Nachkt’s biggest and most notable hauls was after he was hired by the CIS in which he would be slaving a space battle that was long over and would recover the R2 unit that was in use by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker.
Gha Nachkt would later bring the R2 unit to General Grievous on his secret base.
While on this base Grevious would task Gha Nachkt with opening the R2 unit and extracting the information from it which during this time he found that the R2 unit had all the information of republic ships and battleplans.
Later after finding this information, Gha Nachkt would try to negotiate the price of the R2 unit which would lead to his death at the hands of Grievous.
