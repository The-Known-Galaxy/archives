# Overview
The Abominors were immense droids that were composed of many different tubings as well as complex assorted parts of other droids.
One of the only members of this species that was studied in depth was shown to be filled with bouncing pistons beating in an excruciatingly off putting rhythm, and its arm chopped off.
It didn’t seem to bother the entity in the slightest.
It seems that it also bore an entire droid haven within it, luring them into a false sense of security before feasting upon them from the inside.
Using “oil baths”, as his digestive fluids to add to its own immense structure.

# Biology
An Abominor has massive boilers filled with fuel which often relied on moisture drained away from a planet's life forms to cool its immense internal machinery.
However, this process often plunged the planet into a drought or famine and caused great hardship for the inhabitants.
Abominors also kept organic slaves and used them to fill their massive boilers.
For obvious reasons, they hardly care for such things, given that they can grow to absurdly large proportions, some even reaching the size of actual planets.


Their mouths are filled with enormous grinding blades, and they seem to be assisted by tiny mechanical robots living in its robotic maw, like worms living in a mammal's stomach, feeding off its excess.
 The most interesting part about the Abominor is the fact that, if they eventually get destroyed, one skilled enough can rebuild a highly advanced droid from just a handful of his precious mechanical parts.
It is to be noted that even after advanced programming and further attempts to properly control the recently made droid, they will always return to their more primal Abominorian side and seek to rebuild pieces of themselves before regaining control over their main body.



# Culture and Society
Their culture was based on asymmetry and chaos which conflicted with that of the symmetrical Silentium, another sentient droid species.
Their conflict seemed to be immemorial, and we are unable to find more information on the conflict itself, since they come from the same galaxy the Yuuzhan Vong came from.
The two robotic species fought a massive war that culminated with their very galaxy becoming devastated by the conflict, becoming a cosmic wasteland.


The Abominors were such a dangerous species that they even came close to subduing the Yuuzhan Vong species as a whole.
Eventually, because of how intense the conflict had become and because the Galaxy itself was on the brink of total destruction, the organics of the galaxy, who had been ignored by the machines and only viewed as collateral damage, rose up and waged war on both races.
After centuries of war, both droid civilizations were forced to flee into the Unknown Regions of another galaxy where they re-established their civilizations, keeping out of the affairs of that galaxy most of the time.

It is to be noted that their earlier actions in the Silentium-Abominor War are also indirectly responsible for the Yuuzhan Vong War, as the Vong's technophobia has its roots from this very conflict, and lead to their desperation into using organics to drive out both the Silentium and Abominor species and, eventually, becoming conquerors.


As for their opinion on Organics, Abominors clearly had little to no care for them, and saw organics as cattle, or slaves, at the best.
Being entirely mechanical and having little need for flesh in any way, they mostly ignored organics and would not hesitate to destroy healthy planets with inhabitants on them as bringers of Chaos, according to their ways.
They have no opinion on the Force, since they hail from a galaxy where Midichlorians do not exist.



# Addendum
A handful of Sith engineers managed to exchange with the only Abominor we ever encountered while it was repairing itself.
Note the opinion it has on force users in general, and the Force itself.

As the Five masked Dark Side users approached the gargantuan mechanical beast, the one in front of them all, presumably the leader, raised their hand and seemingly signaled to advance with the utmost care, for the robotic monstrosity was clearly aware of their approach, for its sinister eyes gave out an unnerving glint while following on  every mood of the leader.

Team Leader (Sith #1): What even are you, creature.
We do not come to slay you, but seek more information on you.

Abominor: You could not slay me even if you wanted to, Organic.
I’ve feasted upon many planets that held your kind before, and I’ve never cared in the slightest.
You are like the wind for your own kind: passing and barely noticeable.
You exist, and that’s the extent of my opinion of you, for why would you care for ants yourself.

Team Leader (Sith #1): So you think of us as weaklings?
Not all organics are weak.
Some have quite the uncanny abilities, and you may want to be careful, Droid, for, in the end, you are but a machine, and many abilities of the Dark Side can easily shred robotics parts like the most brittle of stones.

To prove his point, the Squad leader raised an arm and pointed two digits towards the Abominor, only for massive bolts of lightning to erupt from his fingertips, scorching a small portion of the Robot’s arms, before proceeding to tear out an entire finger of it.
As a reaction, a loud crackle could be heard, in successive patterns, for its spike-filled maw was rapidly clashing with each other, making a horrifying clanking noise repeatedly.
Was it… chuckling?

Abominor: IRRELEVANT.
The Esoteric force has no lasting effects on my kind.
You may start to attack one of my species, it’ll end with a planet being consumed.
It is surprising to see an organic use..
Lightning and telepathy, but expected.

Team Leader (Sith #1): Are you mocking the Power of the Dark Side of the Force?

Abominor: Correction.
I do not know what this Force you speak of is.
But I guarantee you it does not exist within the Galaxy our kind comes from, nor would it have been powerful enough to stop us.
If that is the extent of this Dark Side of the Force you speak of, then at our peak, my kind would’ve easily consumed this Galaxy without any effort.

Team Leader (Sith #1): We shall see about that.

Abominor: Rebuttal.
We shall not.
It was interesting talking to you about organics, but as I said, our kind does not care for flesh users.
I humored you to pass the time while my tendrils reached deep within the core of this rock.
I thank you for this knowledge of the Force, even if useless.
I shall not bid you my farewell.

Before the Siths could even react, the planet’s very core shook before the entirety of the globe started to tear itself down, as it began to get consumed by the Abominor.
The record was stopped only after hearing screams and unearthly sounds.
