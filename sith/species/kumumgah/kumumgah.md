The Kumumgaah were a species of sentient beings that lived on the planet Tatooine roughly 30,000 years before the battle of Yavin.
Tatooine at the time was a planet filled with lush jungles and great seas.
It was in this paradise that the Kumumgah cultivated their technology, becoming one of the few species in the galaxy to develop space flight- colonizing surrounding planets and moons in the name of their people.
Their lands were filled with the most beautiful structures that touched the clouds of Tatooine.
Their culture was vibrant and their land bountiful, providing the Kumumgah structure and security.
Unfortunately, this beauty would come crashing down due to the Rakatan Infinite Empire.

The Rakata caught wind of this space-faring species and embarked on a campaign to subjugate the Kumumgah.
The Rakatan Infinite Empire swiftly destroyed many of the great cities that reached the skies, eventually subjugating the Kumumgah and forcing them into slavery; off and onworld.


Over time, the Kumumgah grew tired of the Rakata control of their lands, raising their banners and launching an insurrection against their oppressors.
This would lead to tragedy as the Rakata swiftly put down the rebellion.
Due to the rebellion, the Rakata decided to disband all operations on Tatooine, leading to them leaving the planet.
In the process of leaving, the Rakata would glass the planet- turning the lush jungles and great oceans into the dunes and sands that is modern Tatooine.
The Kumumgah were wary of this and moved most of their population into the caves of Tatooine.


After what seemed to be forever, a devolved half of the Kumumgah population rose out of the caves and started their lives under the Twin Suns, the Dune Sea their new home.
These people would be known as the Ghorfas who would come to be known as the Tuskens or Sand People.
The Kumumgah that remained in the caves would devolve into the dwarf species known as the Jawa- the scavengers of Tatooine-.
Throughout the ages both sub-species would go to war with each other, eventually leading to Ghorfa domination.
These wars would cease to exist after a few millennia, with both peoples living together in loose harmony.
