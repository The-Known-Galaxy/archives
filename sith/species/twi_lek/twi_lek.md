# Overview

Twi’leks are an omnivorous humanoid species originating from the planet Ryloth.
The Twi’lek species have some distinctive features which change their appearance compared to other species.
These features include colorful skin that spans a rainbow of colors and two pairs of tentacles on their head that grew from the base from their skulls called “Lekku”.
Lekku were advanced organs mostly used to communicate among other Twi’leks but were also used for cognitive functions.
Many female Twi’leks were often used as slaves and dancers because of their beauty.

# Appearance

The Twi’lek species have distinctive features on their body which changes their appearance compared to other species.

The most noticeable feature of a Twi’lek is their Lekku.
Lekku, also known as Brain Tails, are the tentacle-like organs which protrude down the back of the skull and connect to some parts of the Twi'lek's brain.
If ever pulled or harmed in any way it would give the Twi’leks immeasurable pain due to the fact that the Brain Tails were highly sensitive, if ever grabbed forcefully, the Twi’leks would go through so much pain it could easily incapacitate them.
Although many adult Twi’leks have Lekku, the newborns aren’t born with it, they grow during childhood.

But if the Twi’leks welcome a group of strangers and guests, the Twi’leks would throw and would dance the Twi’leks traditional dance as a way of entertainment.
This is only one of the acts of kindness and politeness out of many the Twi’leks do to strangers.
