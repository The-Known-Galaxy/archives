# Overview
Described as primitive and violent, the Abyssin were a mammal species that resided on the planet Byss.
This race was discovered during the Kymoodon Era by scouts from the Galactic Republic.

# Information
The anatomy of an Abyssin was excellent, considering they would live naturally for a span of time of 300 standard years of age.
Their body consisted of green skin color and large and muscled limbs.
These mammalian creatures also possessed the ability to heal themselves, which people thought could be useful for an aggressive culture.



# Culture
These creatures struggled to achieve peace as if they found themselves in slight disagreement while trading, they would engage in a brawl known as the Blooding.
In this fight, everyone who was involved had to fight until the opposite team ended up dying or incapacitated.
Those who survived the fatal brawl had the opportunity to join the winning side.
They also had their own language, known as the Abyssin Language, which consisted of grunts and growls to communicate between them.
