# Overview

Squibs are a fascinating and intriguing alien sentient species.
Despite most Squibs not being taller than a single meter, their greatness is instead shown by the astounding depth of their culture, society, and psychology.

# History

They first appeared on Skor II, a small and dense planet within the Squab system of the Outer Rim.
Their homeworld was extremely lush and opulent, allowing early Squib groups to accumulate large amounts of resources.
As a result, over time the hoarding of as many material goods as possible became imprinted into the species’ psyche.

Not only that, but their resource-amassing nature also caused them to often have surplus in their stockpiles, which translated into bargaining, haggling, and trading developing early and at an impressively fast pace.
During this period, most of them were still nomadic with very few Squib tribes settling down to make permanent villages.
They continued developing until they advanced to mass production, past which they decided to unite and form a peaceful, species-wide government called the Squib Polyanarchy.

They first interacted with a member of a sentient species other than their own around 3640 BBY, when a Dorcin trader discovered their world.
The trader would proceed to instruct them on space travel in exchange for minerals.
In the following centuries, they would proceed to spread across the galaxy and gain a fair amount of notoriety.
They became so widely known that they were included in the 1000 BBY Jedi book “The Jedi Path”, under the section “Advanced Cultures and Politics in the Republic”.
They established a stable reputation as the galaxy’s greatest scavengers and hagglers.
Over time, Squib settlers established colonies on other planets, while Squib companies signed contracts with other industrialized and populous planets to gather their rubbish, recycle it, and resell it themselves.
This led to Skor II becoming a prosperous trade world and the establishment of the capital “Metrobig City”.
Around 40 BBY, a Squib named Ebareebaveebeedee would become the King of the Squib Polyanarchy.
In the following years, he would proceed to lead the entire Squib civilization into a period of great prosperity.
He signed contracts with capital ships to sell Squibs as garbage workers.
While it may seem like an enslaving operation, it was instead an extremely clever move as the working Squibs secretly acted as spies and reported back to their home planet all coordinates of found battlefields and garbage deposits for salvaging.
During the Separatist war, he would sternly support the Galactic Republic, which caused their planet to be attacked by Separatist forces.
Shortly after, the Jedi Master Mace Windu and Commander Cody would arrive to attempt to free the planet, in the Battle of Skor II.
The battle would result in a Republic victory, the planet being freed, and a statue of Mace Windu being built on Skor II in his name.
Their territory would remain uncontested for the rest of the war and they would help with cleaning up scrap following battles.
Around the time of the creation of the New Order, Squibs would find themselves challenged by another scrapping species, the Ugors, who would quickly surpass them to the point where most of the galaxy relied upon Ugor waste disposal services.
The Squib king would choose to remain neutral following the Galactic Civil War’s breakout, and continued having commercial relations with both the Republic and the Empire.
They profited off the conflict, being able to recover and sell many military vehicles to civilians following battles, such as many Arakyd 74-Z Speeder bikes.
Despite this, the Ugor salvage fleet had gravely surpassed them thanks to a gravity well projector near their home system, to the point where the Squib King would break his neutrality and make a pact with some Rebel Operatives in exchange for the destruction of the gravity well projector.
After they succeeded, the Squib would establish a long-lasting alliance, until the planet fell under Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire.

# Biology

Overall, Squibs are an extremely developed and evolved species with great survival capabilities, natural proficiency in anything related to dexterity, and many differences from specimen to specimen.
Squibs are humanoid sentient mammals, which present both canine and rodent characteristics.
They are quite small in size and lightweight, with their average height ranging from 1 to 1.2 meters and average weight around 25 kg.
Their skin is naturally pink, although it is covered by fur.
Their coats are usually white, gray, black, brown, blue, violet, or red.
Other than protection, the main function of their coats is the fact it is used by them to smell objects, pick up scents, and identify forgery by brushing items against themselves.
Their eyes were large compared to their skull, and located on the sides of the head.
Their ears were large, adorned with tufts, and able to focus and rotate towards the source of any noises.
Their muzzles were short and whiskered, their mouths full of white sharp teeth, although their cheeks were still flexible enough to store small objects.
They’re bipedal, with the same amount of fingers as humans, albeit much more nimble.
They reach teenhood at about nine years of age, maturity at thirteen, and middle age at thirty-nine.
Their average life expectancy is sixty-five years.
While usually very different physically, what brings together squibs the most is their similarities on a psychiatric level.
Almost all squibs have a natural attraction towards the obtaining of great amounts of material goods - no matter if others view them as garbage - and always attaining more.
They are overconfident, prideful and a perfect symbol of greed.
Such emotions could make them great subjects to the dark side, albeit unfortunately, they tend to rarely be sensitive to the Force.
Their non-threatening figures hide underneath naturally expert hagglers, bargainers and exploiters.
They don’t have a fight or flight response - in front of danger they simply bluff and bluster.

# Culture

Squibs read, write and speak in Squibbian.
Most traditional squib names were rather long.
Their voices are naturally high-pitched, and while many of them learn basic, very few of them speak it fluently, and even fewer can write and read it.
They tend to speak too fast, usually changing subjects even in the middle of sentences for convenience - or as a tactic to confuse their counterpart during haggling - and struggle to convey emotions through the tone of their voice.
Additionally, they often present thick accents and use their own expressions such as “koovy” (meaning good, positive, cool) and ending sentences with the expression “You bet!”.
They express most of their emotion through body language instead, such as droopy ears to convey discomfort and trembling whiskers to display indignation.
Undeniably, the highest form of art for a Squib was haggling.
There was no compliment more prestigious to a Squib than being told that they haggled well.
They also liked to make intricate homemade ion blasters, as well as take garbage and reorganize it into intricate artistic works.
One major example is a large mural celebrating the fall of the Ugurs and the triumph of the Squib people and the Rebel operatives.
Squibs had their own religion which was based upon garbage collecting and scrapping, in which the Ugors were considered literal demons who desecrated their destiny to collect garbage.
The Squib’s home planet Skor II was governed by the Squib Polyanarchy, whose nominal head was a King.
Additionally, from their birth, all Squibs are part of a species-wide corporation known as the Squib Merchandising Consortium.
The Head of the consortium was known as the Illustrious Chieftain of Junkyards.
Most of Squib technology is developed from scrap metal, but despite this the Squib species pride themselves in being the creators of some of the most advanced tractor beam technology in the galaxy- to the point that their ships had no weapons, but instead used tractor beams to quickly move asteroids as defense, or to launch them against enemy ships.
They had their own fleet, called the Suib Reclamation Fleet, composed of fifty needle ships and a flagship called the “Wholesale”, which was later replaced by the Squib momship “Thrifty”.
