# Overview

The Flesh Raiders are mutated subspecies of the Rakata.
They were bred to serve as low-caste soldiers for the Empire.
A few members of the Flesh Raiders species were left on the planet Tython before the Cold War which allowed them to survive past the end of the Rakatan Empire.

# Society & Culture

The Flesh Raiders had no established cities or a government, they had crude shelters on the Ridges of Tythos.
At the shelters, the Flesh Raiders would practice a form of spiritual worship with a Shaman.
Their shelters had idols and rocks placed all around them.
The Flesh Raiders used signal fires to be able to communicate with other Flesh Raiders who were farther away.
They also preferred naked earth so they burnt the grass and trees and replaced them with the bones of their dead prey.
The Flesh Raiders were also scavengers so they used anything they found to use to make clothing and armor.

# Biology & Appearance

Having originally been created as low-caste soldiers in the Rakata species, the Flesh Raiders were extremely violent.
They were a bulky species who had razor-sharp teeth to tear into the bones of their prey.
Eight slits lined their upper lip and two eyes that were located on the side of their somewhat box-shaped heads.
There is little study of the Flesh Raiders but there have been multiple theories about them.
After the colonists left Tython the Flesh Raiders started to become cannibals.
There have been rumors that a few Flesh Raiders were force-sensitive.
