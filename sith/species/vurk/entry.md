# Appearance

Vurk are a sentient reptilian species who were born native to the planet of Sembla.
They were known to have a green, dark green, and in some cases gray skintone.
The most notable portion of the Vurk though was their boney head piece that sat at the top of their head in a crest shape.
This was important to the culture and species as a whole since the crest would continue to grow as the Vurk did, signifying to many species who saw them who the elders were of this species and who were younger if size alone did not do it.

# History

Vurk were believed to be a very primitive species but were highly empathetic and skilled mediators.
Being they were inclined with inner peace and empathetic to all, some would go further and become Jedi such as the notable Jedi Master Coleman Trebor.
Another Vurk by the name of Sweitt Concorkill was accompanying Supreme Chancellor Palpatine at the Galaxies Opera House during the final few days of the Clone Wars.
