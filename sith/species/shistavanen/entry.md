# Overview

Colloquially referred to as Wolfmen due to their lupine appearance, they were a bipedal sentient species.
They were humanoid, with their distinguishing traits being lupine appearance, enhanced senses, and increased speed and strength.

# Characteristics

They first appeared on the planet Uvena Prime, in the Uvena system.
While they evolved naturally, many of their attributes were caused by the intervention of unknown genetic engineers in the past.
Like most canine species, they had pronounced muzzles, sharp claws, long pointed teeth, and pointed ears set on top of their heads.
They had large glowing eyes and could run at incredibly fast speeds, both bipedally and on four limbs.
They had excellent hearing and sight together with night vision, although this made them sensitive to light or piercing noises.
By nature, they were isolationists and preferred not to interact with other species.
Other than that, their technology was on par with  one of other species, and the few that chose to venture into the galaxy were often employed as scouts or soldiers.
A few notable Shistavanen were Jedi Master Voolvif Moon, rebel Lak Sivrak, and Rogue Squadron pilot Riv Shiel.
