The Phindians were human looking reptilians.
They were natives of planet Phindar.
They had dark green or brown skin, yellow eyes and prolonged skulls with arms that reached all the way to their knees.
This species preferred a peaceful lifestyle, yet they maintained caution.
 On average, they would be around 1.7 meters tall.


For the majority of the later stages of the galactic republic, the phindians were ruled by a well-renowned criminal organization known as the Syndicat.
All of the phindar’s imports and exports were seized by them.


In 44 BBY, this species would be freed from Syndicat rule by Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, allowing them to hold democratic elections for the first time in ages.
A technology known as renewal was used by the syndicat prior to this rebellion to wipe the minds of disobedient phindians, however after the successful liberation of the species, they would outlaw the technology.
