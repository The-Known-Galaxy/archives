# Overview

The Dianogas were a species perceived as tremendous and omnivorous, referring to their diet and food preferences - animalistic materials such as flesh or plants.
This species was in a group known for their tentacles growing from their heads, the cephalopods.
They originated from their homeworld, Vodran, sharing it with the Vodrans that usually isolated themselves from the deeper regions.
Vodran was in the Si’Klaata cluster of the Hutt Space.
These species came from an ancient and primal past.
Despite this, they were conscious and self-aware.
Some were even Force-sensitive.

# Biology and appearance

The Dianogas had exactly seven suckered and sharp teeth in their mouth.
They had an eyestalk that grew from the tip of their heads.
They had multiple functioning hearts in their body.
They grew roughly seven to ten meters tall and had blood whose color had a blue tint.
They preyed on smaller animals such as crabs and fish.
In combination with this, they consumed bones and plants that grew around their habitat in the waters.

They were completely reliant on water but could survive for a little period engulfed in air, but they would dry out rapidly.
They were physically hermaphroditic, referring to them being able to be female or male physically.
The female version, which is called Dinagous, is the most common.
To reproduce, they exchanged eggs with each other.
The mature ones, typically seen with deep purple skin, could use camouflage and adapt their skin color to their surroundings.
On top of this, they were capable of regenerating stray limbs.

# Society and culture

These species were more attuned to a primitive and tribal culture where they lived in non-complex routines for survival.
They lived in the same geographical area and assisted each other in gathering essential resources.
When they were not eating, they communicated and made a resonant and complicated humming noise that was difficult to understand to outsiders.
The sound was an overlapping and threatening tune that scared nearby prey.
They respected the water they lived in and referred to it as the “Great Cleanser.” which cleansed each one of them when it was time.
