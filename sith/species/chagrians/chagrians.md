# Overview

Chagrians were a sentient, amphibious lifeform of tall stature with horns and blue skin native to the planet of Champala.
They are most notable for their long, thick tentacles that wrap down from their heads and over their shoulders, as well as horns from their heads.
Mas Amedda was the Vice-Chair of Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum and most recently, Sheev Palpatine.
He was a Chagrian that served in the Galactic Senate, soon becoming the Grand Vizier following the establishment of the Galactic Empire.
Chagrians begin their lives in a tadpole stage, similar to toads or frogs.
Each tadpole measured 30 centimeters long and was initially entirely aquatic.
Chagrians then begin to breathe air after developing lungs after maturing, then growing two arms and two legs.
As the limbs are developed, they would then begin to emerge from the water and the past intermediate physiological stages would no longer be applicable, fading away entirely.
In the adult stages of a Chagrian, they were bipedal humanoids who would remain just as comfortable in the water and out of it.
Many Chagrians could spend months and even years fully submerged underwater without any effect on their bodies.
Their bodies were very powerful and muscular, making them well suited for any kind of swimming or heavily labor-filled tasks.
Chagrians have a very bad sense of taste due to the fact that they are so accustomed to saltwater that they will only usually taste the salt.
All Chagrians possess a set of horns from their head tentacles protruding the tips, but male Chagrians also possess a set of horns straight up from their foreheads or cranium.

# Lifestyle/Culture

Champala was a planet of great wealth, allowing many of its occupants to have many expenses.
Meaning, many Chagrians faced equality in their daily lives, having little want for anything, and having mostly everything they could need, such as medical needs, social equality, and higher education.
Chagrians were rarely motivated by anything, apart from encountering something that they are unknown to, such as poverty, prejudice, or homelessness.
They will attempt to heal this encounter the best they can, whether through actions or less direct methods.
Chagrians will also be notable for rarely speaking Galactic Basic, most Chagrians only speak Chagri, their native tongue.
Due to their lack of taste, many Chagrians resort to carrying food capsules for supplement rather than dealing with meals having no taste.
Although being a generally peaceful species, Chagrians history was very particular with conflicts or unrest.
Due to this, Chagrian conflicts were highly officiated affairs that clung to various rules and codes.
An example of one of these codes is the Color of War, many Chagrians that joined the alliance during the Galactic Civil War chose to wear this color on their uniforms, often in their epaulets, piping, combat webbing, or a combination, therefore making them valid military targets or combatants.
