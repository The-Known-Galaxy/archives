# Overview
The Keeradaks were a species of non-sentient creatures who were natives to the planet of Skako Minor, the homeworld of the sentient natives known as the Poletecs and headquarters of the Techno Union, within the city of Purkoll.

The Keeradaks were known to be tamed and used by the Poletecs for a variety of purposes, however, it is also believed by some that the Poletecs also worship these creatures.

Though reasons as to why they worship them are both unknown and left to theories and speculations from outsiders and non-natives.

Sometime during the Clone Wars, the renowned Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker came to the planet of Skako and was swiftly kidnapped by the leader of the Poletecs, Qin Yazal, by using a herd of Keeradaks.

The reason for the abduction was that Yazal feared that the Clone Wars had been brought to the planet and had brought Skywalker to him for questioning.

Another point of interest during this time was when a group of wild Keeradaks were tamed by Clone Force 99, Captain Rex, and Anakin after they had launched a successful rescue operation of the Clone known as Echo.

The Poletecs were impressed with such a feat, especially since they were outsiders to the planet.
