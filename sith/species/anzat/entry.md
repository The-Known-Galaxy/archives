# Introduction

The Anzat were humanoid, dangerous, Force sensitive species whose unique characteristic was having  two tentacle-like extensions that curled out and extended from their cheeks and which they used to feed on their prey's brains.
They had an extremely long life expectancy and possessed far greater regeneration capabilities than other humanoid species.
They were telepathic and were far more adept in mind controlling than any others.

# Biology and Appearance

Their appearance was very similar to that of a human but with slight changes such as bulbous noses, flared nostrils, and grayish-hued skin.
Their height ranged between 1.5 to 1.7 meters and they had no natural biorhythm which means no pulse and no body heat, therefore they were considered a mystery.
They were far more advanced than any other civilization being capable of exploring the world when the core worlds only had the dream of doing it.
They could live for centuries but if they didn't eat their aging process would fastly accelerate making them die of old age if they dont eat regularly.
Due to them being superior to others, their strength was admirable and their physical capabilities were far greater than those of an ordinary human.
However this was just a little part of their true strength, as they had developed very sensible organs and sensory organs that permitted them to sense the life essence in others and drain it.
Even if they didn’t actually use the Force, they had the capability of using mind tricks such as the Jedi and were experts in it.
The “soup” as they called it, was the life essence they took out of their victims and they were very strict on how they did it.
The truth was they were somehow draining the Force from their prey but it was never understood how they actually did this.

# Society and culture

Their need for “soup” was the central point in which the Anzat life stood upon.
They could be considered as addicts because once the hunt began, nothing else mattered, only feeding with soup.
As Anzati grew older its need for eating increased and their isolation was made even bigger.
The elder Anzati were mentally unstable, many times insane and couldn’t hold themselves back when they were hungry.
These singular needs made them so unstable that in the end they destroyed themselves.
Inside the Anzat there was a group of them that believed the soup gave them eternal youth and energy, a belief that can be traced back to the Silent Voices and that just demonstrates the importance of “soup” in their society.
They didn´t reproduce frequently as it was normal in long living species and didn't even name their children as they didn’t care and only cared about soup and the children once reached puberty, which would be 100 years, left their home in search of soup.
A very common misconception was having them as great scholars and knowledge keepers, when the truth was they only knew things because of how much they lived but weren’t interested in learning anything.
However, they were great hunters as their physical capabilities made them far superior than their prey and easy for them to hunt.
That is one of the reasons most of them were also assassins to presumably earn credits but due to their anonymance it was never known truly why they did.
One of the greatest mysteries about the Anzati’s was their origin as it was never known, not even in myths and old writings; and it was speculated that they were the oldest species that habited the galaxy.
