# Overview
The Yuuzhan Vong are a sentient, humanoid species that were originally from the planet Yuuzhan’tar.
The Yuuzhan Vong are given two nicknames, “Chosen Race” and “Far Outsiders”, with Far Outsiders being more popular to the Chiss and Ferroans.
This species was ruthless, brutal, and most importantly, deadly.

# Biology
Seen as monsters in a humanoid and sentient form, but more monster than human by a long shot.
The Yuuzhan Vong had extremely long life spans, compared to their human counterpart, as much as three times longer.
This is all due to strict and regulated selective breeding, allowing them to adapt over time and increase their lifespan.
The head of a Yuuzhan Vong could be described as a skull, with pointed ears and a very short nose, similar to that of a skull.
Skin tones ranged from, most commonly gray to yellow, anything else is considered rare and lucky.
The most biological characteristic would be their pure black blood.
Some said it’s darker than obsidian, others say it resembles the empty void.



# History
H I S T O R Y
The Yuuzhan Vong have a long, very very long, history that is also full of violence.


E A R L Y   L I F E
The Yuuzhan Vong were on their force-sensitive homeworld, Yuuzhan’tar, when there was a full blown galactic war.
This gave the Yuuzhan Vong reasons to despise both machine and sentient species.
After years upon years, and this war still having its flame at its peak, the Yuuzhan Vong became more and more violent, aggressive, and wanted the war.
Through the war, their homeworld had been giving them tips, advice, and resources to create “living weapons” to use in this war.
These weapons proved their worth, destruction, and usability when they used it on all sides of the war in their galaxy and completely ruined all of their enemies, forcing them to flee their galaxy.
This glorious victory gave them the courage to start their own war..
on the entire galaxy they lived in.
Their goal was to remove all mechanical advances, as the Yuuzhan Vong from their previous war, despised and thought of all machines as evil corruption.
This is where their violence and destruction begins.
As they conquer solar systems in their galaxy they do one of two options: make the species of each planet extinct or enslave them, which slavery is what they forced the Chazrach, a repltilian species, to become their soldiers.
However, this expansion ended with constant internal conflict amongst the Yuuzhan Vong, named the Cremlevian War.

After years of internal conflict, Yuuzhan Vong decided to finally leave their home galaxy and expand even further, and with their living weapons, they thought they could do this.
The first quarter of their new found outside was filled with scouting, exploring, etc.
During this time Yuuzhan Vong probes would reach Exar Kun, another in Wild Space, captured by a prison colony where some of the Yuuzhan Vong met Darth Maul, even getting involved with the Invasion of Naboo all to find the living planet Zonama Sekot.
After finding out that Zonama Sekot was nowhere to be found, and location is no longer known, all Yuuzhan Vong activity died out.
However, their involvement in the Outbound Flight Project, a project to send over fifty-thousand men, women, children along with a few Jedi, to go outside the Unknown Regions in search of life outside of their galaxy but was eventually destroyed as Chancellor Palpatine did not want it to fall into the Yuuzhan Vong’s hands.
The Yuuzhan Vong were in the shadows, all while keeping in tabs with all events going on no matter where, when, or how secretive they were.
Scouts were at the Battle of Hoth, all regions of the galaxy, and even infiltrating the new Galactic Empire.

After years of hiding, lurking in the shadows, watching and learning, the Yuuzhan Vong finally decide to strike and strike hard.
After infiltrating the Galactic Empire's Imperial Interim Council and causing chaos, death, and distrust amongst them, the leader of the infiltration being Yuuzhan Vong Executor Nom Anor, and his final action in this infiltration spread disease, amongst the Empire and soon into the New Republic, after the Empire.
 While disease is spreading, Praetorite Vong, a secret Yuuzhan combative battalion, invaded the world of Helska IV and brought down Sernpidal’s moon onto the planet, killing millions.
Soon Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa Solo, and Lando Calrissian would show and defeat the Praetorite Vong.
However, soon after the defeat of the Praetorite Vong, the Yuuzhan Vong’s main fleet arrived and devastated many worlds, killing trillions.
The New Republic could not ignore the Yuuzhan Vong any longer.
As war and terror continue, Warmaster Tsavong Lah send the New Republic an offer, this offer stated the Yuuzhan Vong will end their conquests, wars, and violence.., as long as all Jedi in the galaxy were given to the Yuuzhan Vong.
This caused all Jedi to be despised, and hated as the common folk were willing to give them up to protect themselves.
Soon a new living weapon would be created called voxyn, with the sole purpose of hunting Jedi down.
After years of war, the destruction of the New Republic was done, but the creation of the Galactic-Federation of Free Alliance was done.

After a final push of the Galactic-Federation of Free Alliance, lead by Luke Skywalker on Coruscant, the Yuuzhan Vong was not able to recover fast enough, finalizing the war in favor of the Galactic-Federation of Free Alliance.
With the end of one of the most devastating, destructive, and deadly wars in all of the galaxy's history, worlds would need to be restored, repopulation would need to be conducted.
Apart of the peace terms, the Yuuzhan Vong would be forced to rebuild Coruscant until the leadership of the Free Alliance sought suitable.
Multiple attempts to force the Yuuzhan Vong into extinction were made, all stopped by the Free Alliance, who needed their help to rebuild their capital.
The great rise and fall of the Yuuzhan Vong, from dominant force within the galaxy to forced tabor, and on the brink of extinction.
