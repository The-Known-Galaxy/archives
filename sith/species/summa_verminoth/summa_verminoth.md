Very few people in the history of the galaxy have been known to survive encounters with these fearsome creatures.
However, In 10 BBY, famous smuggler and rebel general Han Solo, along with Tobias Beckett's gang, accidentally awakened a summa-verminoth in the Maelstrom.
Whilst aboard the Millennium Falcon, Han Solo encountered and entered a chase with the colossal creature until he lured it into the Maw’s gravity well using the Falcon's escape pod.
The Maw's gravitational pull destroyed the Summa-Verminoth as a result.

An unidentified sub-species of Summa-Verminoth was located within the Red Honeycomb Zone, a location found within the Unknown Regions.
The creature had a singular eye, a cavernous mouth, and numerous tentacles.
In order to hunt, this subspecies of Summa-Verminoth adapted the ability to perform psychic attacks on its opponents.
Sometime between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, Darth Vader and Sith assassin Ochi of Bestoon encountered this subspecies while attempting to travel to the Sith planet Exegol, to which Lord Vader tamed the beast and rode it to Exegol.
