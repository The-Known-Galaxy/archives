# Appearance

Verpine are typically found to be bipedal insectoids standing at a towering 1.9 meters tall with few members of this species even growing wings to accommodate them.
Their heads were mostly filled with their larger compound eyes which came in shades of black or red.
Located behind them were two antennae, one per each eye.
They were adorned with a hardened green carapace that had a green substance known as carahide.
It was flexible and as flimsy as any normal skin would typically be but it was dense enough that it could easily deflect a blade or even a blast bolt that just so happened to graze by the area.
They were known to have an increased survivability during injuries as no scientists could determine if the Verpine circulatory system had one, at least nothing they could identify as one.
however, this was not their most impressive trait.
The Verpine eye could easily detect microscopic details while their antennae could pick up radio waves which could allow them to transmit messages to others of their species or language to receive the message from as far as one hundred kilometers away.
Though as they came to rely on them, a damaged antennae would cause real mental distress with almost all Verpine criminals having damaged antennae.
Verpine came in two types, the intelligent ones and what is now referred to as drones.
When they Verpine originally made their mark into the galaxy only around five percent of the total population was intelligent but with the demands for new technology surfacing the Verpine needed an entire restructure of their society.
So development began and scientists were able to put a gene into the Verpine eggs to make sure all of them came out intelligent.
Verpine who are not intelligent are now a result from cloning and are given the title drone.
And while most are typically the same in terms of looks, the hive mother has stated that male warriors helped the Jedi meaning a select few have genders.

# Society

The Verpine had a naming culture for their off-spring.
Most were given a single first name while a select few were given first and last names depending on the family who had them from the egg-laying Verpine.
Because of their vast intellect, the Verpine made very highly sought after weaponry and shields which could earn anyone who could make one very wealthy in a matter of a few days.
On top of this, the Verpine used six as their way of counting instead of the human ten.

# History

Many believed that the Verpine evolved from asteroids when in fact the only reason any of the Verpine could survive on these asteroids was from their technological advances making it possible to live in such a place.
Many believed that the Verpine homeworld was destroyed whether it be from natural causes or from an all out civil war.
Though unfortunately, there is no evidence or history of their home-planet if there is one as most records either haven’t been released or have been destroyed.
But for whatever the reason may be, the Verpine were a peaceful race.
They tried to solve conflicts before they were started and had created colonizations within numerous asteroid belts long before even the Old Republic was formed.
With these vastly spanning populations the more notable members of this species began making their mark.
Such as one individual who went by the name of Lyns Skutroo, who had reversed engineered the Sif-Alulan process with waymancy weapons, resulting in a product known as the squintpipe process which had caused many rapid-firing blasters to outperform any shield on the market, entirely revamping the weapons industry with just a single invention until the year 7500 BBY where the technology had become so common that stronger shields were invented to prevent these blasters from taking over.
Verpine technology was so popular that during the Jedi Civil War, Ion blasters and cardio-regulators were widely used on both sides of the war with their medical supplies falling just short of their weaponry’s threshold.
This would not be the only war the Verpine took part in though.
Their technology was wildly popular by the time of the Galactic Civil War where they still remained peaceful but quietly opted to support the Rebel Alliance more than other consumers partly because of their pacifistic ideals.
After the rebellion sadly failed, the Verpine were very close with the New Republic, more specifically their military as they were advancing weaponry even further past the new republic.
During the Second Galactic Civil War the Verpine took a slightly different approach.
Accusing the people of Murkhana of breaking their trade agreements by producing weapons similar to theirs.
As a result, they opted to sign a non-agression pact with the Mandalorians who were rapidly expanding their boarders in which the Verpine thought they might try to obtain Verpine territory.
This act stated that Mandalorians would send their best fighters, and exports while the Verpine would reciprocate the offer by sending them their newly advanced weaponry along with any medical supplies the Mandalorians needed, that way both sides could have a neutral standing in the entire war that would soon be upon them in the case of Darth Sidious attacking the Verpine’s home with the added help of the Imperial Remnant forces.
In this instance, the Mandalorians along with the help of Jedi Jaina Solo defended the Verpine and their territory successfully from the attack.
Finally, to prepare themselves for war in a way that wouldn’t mean relying on other people the Verpine developed the IX-6 Heavy combat droid to help assist them in their asteroid settlements.
Though under new federations it was ordered that the Verpine destroy all factories and currently running models of the IX-6.
The Verpine refused, resulting in asteroids with well-known factories of this droid being turned to dust and causing mass casualties as these were among the more populated locations for Verpine.
This did not stop the Verpine from producing them though as they began building the factories deep within the asteroids where no one would find them, resulting in the effective battle droid to become a prized possession for any Verpine to have, costing a fortune to anyone who wanted one.
