# Overview

The Selonians were a bipedal sentient race with cat-like features.
Their bodies were covered in fur which would typically be either a chestnut brown, beige, or white and accompanied by stripes.
Selonians were approximately 2 meters tall and had a long and thick tail.
The species also had very light-sensitive eyes, this was typically exploited by using a weapon called flashsticks.
The flashsticks would send out a quick bright light which would stun the Selonians and would give an opening for an attack.
Selonians also had a rare ability to smell others' pheromones and link it to their emotion, meaning since they cannot talk or give bodily expressions they would be able to sense their emotions by their pheromones.
