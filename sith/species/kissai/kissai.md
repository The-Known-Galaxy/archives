# Introduction
The Kissai were yet another form of sentient subspecies of Sith that existed during ancient times within history.
It is presumed that these beings also originated from the planet Korriban just like many other native Sith that were also thought to exist during 100,000 BBY.
This species of Sith would be well accustomed to the practices of Sith magic, alchemy, and studied the Dark Side of The Force to their fullest extent, also holding a great deal of force sensitivity attuned to the Dark Side.
With their observant and intelligent nature, it is easily perceived that the Kissai resided within the priest class of Sith social hierarchy.
Just like their warrior Massassi counterparts, these priests would adhere more to their instincts regarding The Force, though they did not possess the same physical traits of Massassi and what they lacked for that, they made up with their superior intelligence.
Like the rest of the Sith species that existed, these sorcerers would experience a mass amount of change among their society, culture, and even beliefs throughout history.

# Appearance/Biology
Average Kissai would stand 1.8 meters tall.
In relation to sentients in Sith classification as a whole, these Sith would have humanoid appearance and also display crimson-like skin tone ranging from the darkest of red shades to the lighter shades of pink.
Unlike the Massassi, this priest counterpart would possess a pair of yellow eyes.
They also had tendrils that would hang from their cheekbones, predacious facial features, but also possessed human-like noses, mouths, and ears with bone spurs that would cover a good portion of the different parts of their bodies.
These philosophical and intelligent beings averagely lived up to 60 years.
Some did in fact live to be much older and would be considered the wisest of their species for such a superior life span.
With all the time that progressed, the Kissai never met newer biological changes that altered the species as a whole, instead, interbreeding with the Dark Jedi during the Hundred Year Darkness gave rise to more notable half-bred Sith Lords like Naga Sadow and Marka Ragnos, two beings that would accomplish great feats among the Sith.



# Culture/Tradition
Kissai put significant trust into the Dark Side of The Force, attempting to follow their instincts that would act as guidance.
Being a species of Sith, Kissai would adopt a ruthless nature but composed themselves as insightful and intelligent.
They did not go as far as demanding sacrifice as a part of their tradition, instead, they engaged in practices of Sith Magic and alchemy which assisted the Dark Jedi in building their Empire by the time the Kissai were enslaved.
Opposed to falling towards biological change like the Massassi, these priests saw changes to their tradition, philosophy, and culture as a whole.
A new set of principles were introduced to this species during their slavery that entailed utter loyalty towards those that commanded them, specifically the Dark Jedi.
Principles such as these were established and made mandatory as a result of their slavery.
The slavery they underwent was not the only event that would alter the beliefs of Kissai, as their new beliefs that abandoned the Dark Side was founded by the Sorcerers of Tund.



# History (Invasion of Korriban)
The Rakata that governed the Infinite Empire would invade Korriban in 27,700 BBY seeking to enslave the Sith to use them for their Rakatan projects.
Sith King Adas would lead his people into battle with the Rakata eventually pushing them off the planet of Korriban.
Adas would meet his death in battle, as a result, the Sith retreated off the planet due to concerns of other another possible invasion.
Kissai, along with their other relative species, would make their way to the planet Ziost.
On this planet, the Kissai would engage in conflict to fight for the position of Sith’ari to establish order within the society of the Sith once more.
Nonetheless, oversight of reconstruction to benefit the Sith would fall to the hands of the Kissai.
Some of these priests would refuse to remain loyal to their tradition and principles as a result of their former Sith King meeting his demise.
Instead of rebuilding, some of these Kissai chose to halt their traditional practices towards the Dark Side of The Force.
They would be deemed as heretical leading to their exile from their homeworld, choosing to cohere with those that also held their instincts that guided them to the planet Tund.



# History (Hundred-Year Darkness)
Upon entering the world of Korriban in 6900 BBY, the Dark Jedi led by Ajunta Pall and a select few others posed extreme prowess in their usage of The Force towards the native species.
Due to this, the majority of the native Sith praised these exiles as Gods.
Pall’s status as the new Sith’ari coaxed the Kissai away from Ziost to join his Sith Empire as his loyal servants.
Studies were conducted on the species in order to formulate a better army to eventually seek conquest over the galaxy.
Kissai were well involved in the acts of interbreeding and because of this, produced powerful half-breeds such as Naga Sadow and Marka Ragnos.
Stature that was provided to these soon-to-rise Sith Lords came from their priest nature given to them from their interbreeding with the Kissai and is presumed to be a reason as to how they paved their way into God status that would be followed for the rest of near eternity.



# History (Sorcerers of Tund)
The Kissai that chose to drop their beliefs regarding the Dark Side of The Force were exiled from Ziost so that they may follow their instinct that led them to Tund.
Upon arriving in the world of Tund, this society created the Sorcerers of Tund, a group of Sith Sorcerers most known for their skills in the arts of deception, alchemy, illusion, shapeshifting, and other magic.
Followers of this new society, specifically the Kissai, no longer turned to the Dark Side to provide strength and enlightenment despite the attunement they expressed towards it.
Their tradition stressed that life should be speculated with great harmony and that opposites only existed in illusions.
Foreigners were not accepted into this new philosophy formed by the Kissai, but these philosophers integrated the Missassi and Kissai into their practices that were cast aside as a result of the conflicts amongst the galaxy.
These sorcerers would continue to thrive for generations to come until Rokur Gepta, a force sensitive croke and Sorcerer of Tund sought to deceive the Kissai for their knowledge.
After learning all he could, Rokur Gepta used a biological agent to destroy the world of Tund and its life forms along with the Kissai that resided within.
There prevails no records of Kissai extinction but those that appeared to remain alive from the series of wars and destruction across the galaxy lived out the rest of their life as they pleased.
