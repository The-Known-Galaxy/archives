# Overview

The Talz were a sentient species native to the homeworld of Orto Plutonia and Alzoc III, on which they were an undiscovered species until the Clone Wars.
Talz were large bipeds covered in a thick, shaggy, white fur with sharp talons covering the tips of their five-fingered hands.
They possess four black eyes, of which the small ones were used as day vision, the larger ones for night vision, and a small proboscis for feeding and communication.
They were a very primitive civilization with few tools and lived a simple life in a cruel environment.
Their shaggy fur coats protected them against the freezing temperatures of their icy planet.
The Talz spoke a native language called Talzzi; however, they were unable to speak Galactic Basic.
The Talz were tribal, meaning that they organized themselves into villages or tribes that followed a Chieftain, and also utilized the Narglatches as mounts and even protection.
After their discovery, a fleeting war began between a Talz Village and the Pantoran Assembly, of which the Chairman, Chi Cho of Pantora, believed they were an aggressive, hostile force.
Following the death of Cho, Senator Riyo Chuchi of Pantora talked with and ended the war with the Chieftain of the village, Thi-Sen.
After this short war, the Talz were recognized as a free and equal people, allowing them to live peacefully on their home planet.
