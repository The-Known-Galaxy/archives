# Overview

Standing nearly 5-10 meters, Rancors were semi-sentient reptilian creatures native to the planet Dathomir, but could also be found on other planets such as Felucia and Corulag.
However, it should be noted that Rancors from Dathomir were said to be stronger and more intelligent.
Known for their violent nature and short temper, many rancors were kept as pets for crime lords, including Jabba the Hutt, and used for entertainment while others found Rancors to be capable mounts or even sources of food.

# Appearance

Rancors weighed an average of 1,650 kilograms and had long arms equipped with razor-sharp claws as well as two rather stubby legs and a short tail.
Rancors also had flat faces with exceptionally large jaws and sharp teeth which were rather useful for a carnivorous creature like itself.
Furthermore, the skin of a Rancor was usually brown colored and heavily armored, capable of withstanding large amounts of blaster fire.

# Biology

In contrast to what many believe, Rancors are inherently gentle and can be very loyal and loving to those who treat them well or whom they view as family.
They hatched from eggs and rode their mother until they reached maturity.
Rancors also adhered to social hierarchies with the alphas being the most dominant of the Rancors.

# Subspecies

There are at least 8 known subspecies of Rancors differentiating in both color and size from the original rancors.
These are the Bull Rancor, the Felucian Rancor, the Tyrant Rancor, the Gnarled Rancor, the Jungle Rancor, the Rancor pygmy, the Chrysalide Rancor, and the Rancor-Dragon.
Most of these subspecies were very similar to the Dathomirian Rancor in terms of their long arms and large jaws; however, each subspecies had its own distinct features.
