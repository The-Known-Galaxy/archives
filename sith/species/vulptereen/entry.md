# Appearance

The average Vulptereen had a total of six tusks that would protrude outward from their snout.
They had a feeler on the very end of their snout with their head adorned with two pointy ears.
Their eyes were a shade of yellow-green, centered with black pupils.
They had extraordinarily good sight when seeing in the dark but it fell short as the members of this species had poor depth perception.
This resulted in the Vulptereen to develop more of an echolocation.
They were a singular meter in height on average and had two clawed arms that when dismembered from them, would result in aphasia since they lacked a central brain.
They did however make up for it with their resistance to toxic conditions.

# History

Vulptereen get their name after their home planet of Vulpter.
This planet once had a thriving ecosystem with numerous different plants and animals but the Vulptereen decimated their homeworld with their heavy industrialization.
Though somewhere between the years 20,000 BBY and 15,000 BBY they were discovered by the Galactic Republic and joined the rest of the galactic community.
However, this would soon take a turn for the worse as the Vulptereen people would be taken advantage of for slave labor while all the unusable materials people couldnâ€™t use would be dumped onto their home planet.
