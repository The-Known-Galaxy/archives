# Overview
Mechu-deru was uncovered by Sith sorcerers thousands of years before the Great Sith War.
Using this Force ability, Sith created part machine, part organic hybrids known as techno beasts.
In battle, Belia Darzu infected other living beings with a nano gene virus and turned them into her cyborg army.
The techno beasts were used against the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order during the Sictis Wars.
Technobeasts were described by an infection from the nano gene spore, a techno virus capable of transmuting live tissue into metallic components.
Once completely altered, most remains of living tissue on the creatures would have eroded away, leaving only small strands of skin and ligaments surrounded by metallic scraps, rods, and wires.
Some of the creatures possessed zigzags of scarred tissue caused by the virus formation upon its own metallic chunks, while others had numerous heads or crab-like pincers.

# History
A few thousand years before the Great Sith War, a small amount of Sith sorcerers uncovered mechu-deru, a Force ability allowing them influence over computerized systems.
Using this ability, the Sith created part machine, part organic hybrids learned as techno beasts.
The ability of mechu-deru was practiced by merely a few Sith during this period, driving its mysteries to fade into anonymity.
In a later time called the New Sith Wars, a Dark Lord of the Sith by the name of Belia Darzu studied mechu-deru alongside Sith alchemy.
With her insight into both, Lord Darzu derived a new technique understood as mechu-deru vitae, using it to convert living beings into technobeasts operating a nano gene virus.


Bound to Darzu's intention and infused with the power of the dark side, the technobeasts were developed and accommodated inside a hidden fortress on the planet Tython.
Within this fortress, living beings from several other humanoid and non-humanoid races were changed into technobeasts themselves, assembling an army of beasts known as the Metanecrons.
In addition, Darzu made a Holocron including her understanding of the techniques used to make the Sithspawn beasts.
The techno beasts of Belia Darzu were used against the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order, becoming identified as the signature monstrosity of a two-decade battle known as the Sictis Wars.
In battle, the mutated hybrids contaminated other living beings with the nano gene virus, incorporating Darzu's fallen foes into her cyborg army.



# Characterization
Technobeasts were described by an infection from the nano gene spore, a techno virus capable of transmuting live tissue into metallic components.
Consisting of infinitesimal nano gene droids, the techno virus instinctively pushes toward the brain of the target, lobotomizing their frontal lobe and causing them to be incapable of higher thinking.
Once completely altered, most remains of living tissue on the creatures would have eroded away, leaving only small strands of skin and ligament surrounded by metallic scraps, rods, and wires.
The conversion also deteriorated the target's vocal cords, causing the techno beasts unable to speak.
Due to the inherently experimental nature of the nano gene spore, the form in which the subjects were transformed held varying outcomes, causing all techno beasts to be unique.
Some of the creatures possessed zigzags of scarred tissue caused by the virus formation upon its own metallic chunks.
In other cases, victims ended up with numerous heads or crab-like pincers.
By this point, the subject's transformation into a Sithspawn hybrid was irreversible.
Before the lobotomy took place, nevertheless, it was possible to stop the transformation via the control of the Force, or by purifying the nano gene droids with extreme heat.
While they were initially considered intelligent beings, techno beasts with long-term frontage to the nano gene spore would experience severe cognitive degradation, altering their motor functions and decreasing the creatures to clumsy, shambling robots.
