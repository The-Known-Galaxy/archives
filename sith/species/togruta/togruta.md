# Introduction
The Togruta were a humanoid-like species known for their many physical traits, such as their large montrals, head tails, and the white coloring upon their faces.
Their home planet would be known as planet Shii, a forest-like planet located within the Ehosiq Sector.

# Section 1
The Togruta species normally lived in mountain-like areas throughout multiple colonies.
Most Togruta who were originally from planet Shii would be excessively protective of their planet(s), and would consider the ground to be sacred, and would respect the ground by walking barefoot, only to put on boots for off-world missions.
The Togruta were a civilized species, with many colonies across the galaxy.
Togruta’s would even have a queen, at least on their home planet, where a majority of their government would operate.
They would have militaries, royal guards, and even galactic fleets with multiple warships.



# Section 2
The Togruta were also known to be excellent candidates for the Jedi Order, featuring many well known Togruta such as Master Shaak Ti, Initiate Ashla, and the well known Padawan Ahsoka Tano.
Not all Togruta would meet the fate of the selected candidates, some would simply live in peace and neutrality, including the Artisan colony founded upon the planet Kiros.
The colony would be known for being a peaceful community that had no intention of any negatively impacting war or battle, they simply wished to live in peace.
The colony was later on a target for the Zygerrian Slave Empire, which would be bolstered with forces from the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
