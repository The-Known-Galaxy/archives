# Overview
Kel Dor, also referred to as Kel Dorians, were a sentient type species that originated from the planet Dorin.
This planet was so oxygen rich that citizens on this planet would need to wear masks on the most oxygen filled areas.
Kel Dorians were also known for having a differentiable style of force usage that was brought down from the Baran Do Sages.

Kel Dore were a human-like species that were usually above average in terms of height.
They only had three fingers as well as a thumb on each hand.
Due to their location, Kel Dorians were forced to adapt to the vacuum of space, causing them to develop abnormally thick skin.
Kel Dore wore goggles to prevent their eye fluids from evaporating and wore breath masks when leaving the planet.
Kel Dorians each had unique Antiox Masks that represented their clan.
They were also a direct representative in the Galactic Senate, and within the Senate Building they withheld a numerous amount of rooms so that they did not need Antiox Masks.
