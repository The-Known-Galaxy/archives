# Overview
The Kindalo were a sentient species of tall, tree-like creatures who were known to live underground on the planet of Aleen, located within the Mid Rim Territories.
The Kindalo were known to guard the passageways leading to the surface of Aleen since the air was toxic to those who dwelt underground.

# Biology and Appearance
The Kindalo were much taller than the average human height, at around 3.1 meters, or 10 foot, 2 inches.
Unlike most vegetation lifeforms who grew on a permanent spot, the Kindalo were mobile, using their lower growth roots as legs.
They had feet with four toe-like appendages on them in the same fashion as the Fftssfft, the Kindalo’s near-sentient relatives.
They also had two roots on their upper torso that acted as the Kindalo’s arms, with four finger-like appendages at the end of them.
Their arms were also longer than their legs.

Much like other plant life that resided in Aleens underground, the Kindalo were bioluminescent, producing dim white lights that illuminated the caverns that they resided in.
They also had stern faces, pouting and lipless mouths, glowing white eyes, and branches protruding from their heads that resembled horns.
Kindalo’s had dark plant bark for skin with gray-ish white luminescent stripes all over them, along with organs to help them with their deep, echoing voices.
However, like most of the underground life on Aleen, the Kindalo’s were deathly allergic to the surface air, which was poisonous to them.
They survived only because the ground on Aleen was able to keep the surface and underground separate, which naturally filtered the air making it harmless and breathable to those in the underground.
The Kindalo were able to produce groundquakes as a way to seal any holes that appeared and jeopardized the underground ecosystem; However, it was dangerous and sometimes harmful for the Aleena, the surface-dwelling sentient natives of the planet.



# Society and Culture
When the Kindalo had no need for mobility, they would remain stationary in one place, making themselves indistinguishable from other non-sentient and immovable trees and plants.
Since the air on the surface presented a deadly hazard to them, the Kindalo would have little to no dealings with beings from the surface.
There did, however, exist a type of covenant between the Kindalo and the Aleena, a sentient species of small, wide-mouthed reptilians who lived on the planet's surface.
The surface and underground worlds were separated for the betterment of both species.
The Kindalo were open to communication but they were distrustful of strangers, especially those who were from the surface, and wouldn’t hesitate to kill anyone they deemed to have broken the covenant.
They had their own means of communication, however, as some were able to speak in Galactic Basic Standard.



# History
The first Kindalo’s can be traced to the underground of Aleen, where they’ve evolved to be more suited to their living conditions and whatnot.
The planet of Aleen is a temperate yet rocky world with a hollow interior acting as an underground of the planet, located within the Mid Rim Territories of the known galaxy.
They shared the planet with the reptilian Aleena, whom they had little interaction or communication with.
The Aleenas joined with the Galactic Republic during what was known as the Great Manifest Period, which lasted from 20,000 to 17,018 BBY.

The underground residents remained independent and isolated from the wider galactic community; However, they did have enough contact with the outside galaxy to learn about Galactic Basic Standard, the lingua franca of the galaxy.
Long before the Clone Wars had begun, the Kindalo and the Aleena had made a pact together, stating that the passages between the surface and the underground remain sealed as a way to ensure that the surface air doesn’t enter the underground and kill them.
