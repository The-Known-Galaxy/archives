# Appearance
Mynocks are silicon based lifeforms that can be found attaching themselves to spacecraft to leech the power from within them, across the entirety of the galaxy.
These creatures could also absorb physical material from ships, resulting in a breach in the hull that could lead to catastrophic damage if not tended to in a timely manner.
Mynock had a pair of bat-like wings with which they used to fly through the vacuum of space, something only very few creatures could do.
However, they were limited in their travel as the species naturally had an allergy to helium, resulting in many planets not being able to support Mynock life.
The consequence of this was the helium grenade being invented so pilots could successfully stop Mynocks from eating their power cables.
They would feed on the electrical, stellar, and electromagnetic energies using their sucker-like mouth to latch onto and drain.
Mynock had different strengths of holding onto ships as some had legs while others did not.
Yet, this was not a result from two genders or variants, instead from the fact that the Mynock would reproduce via mitosis as they possessed no major organs.
This process could only happen after enough material had been consumed.
Their small size in nature made them perfect prey for other silicon based lifeforms such as the Exogorth.
They were also a popular last resort meal for shelters and colonists, who would convert their flesh to bioplasma.

# Culture
As Mynocks were usually considered pests by most, the word quickly became a common insult used throughout the galaxy.
Since the Mynock were able to avoid most attacks with swift efficiency, the Jedi had named an entire lightsaber combat form after it, Form III.
Mynocks had little charisma being non-sentient so people found irritating would be considered Mynocks by nature.
