# Appearance
The average Starweird was an incorporeal humanoid with the ability of the force in every single one of them and are only found in the vacuum of space.
They were a lengthy and gaunt creature so much so one could describe them as being skeletal.
They wore ephemeral rags that would hang from their two arms.
Beyond this look, they also had long, white hair that was always in a state of wildness as they had no gravity around them.
Their skin was as equally pale but no two Starweirds were the same as they varied slightly from creature to creature.
A Starweird’s face however was desiccated with reports varying from person to person as victims have stated the face looked like their own face.
Though beyond these outer appearances, the Starweird would usually have a large toothy mouth with glowing eyes and would best be described as eerie.
Other parts of their body like their arms were bony with three elongated and sharp talons at the end of their hands.
Being they were incorporeal by nature most physical attacks did nothing to them as well as physical objects as they would fly right through the hull of a ship.
However, with force fields and the force itself, these creatures could be impacted and stopped effectively until they moved on to other prey.
These creatures did not walk though, rather they floated and hovered at a speed ever so slightly faster than any bipedal humanoid could run.
These creatures did not talk or communicate, they had no known language and most importantly, when killed they left no trace of their existence as if they were never real in the first place.

# Behavior
Starweirds have most commonly been sighted attacking crews who were repairing their ship in deep space or in rare cases they would instantaneously manifest aboard ships that were traveling through hyperspace.
When spotted by any other creature though, it would quickly become enraged and release a telepathic shriek to their prey.
Most would cower in fear or even try to fight back but their attacks wouldn’t connect.
Even in the vacuum of space the shriek could be heard as was the nature of how it was delivered.
When they got close enough though, they would take their talons and shred them to pieces in a matter of moments before continuing their selective hunting of picking one target before moving on.
Though if there was a force-sensitive among a group, they would specifically target them and no one else until the force-sensitive had defeated the Starweird or was slain by the Starweird.



# History
Starweirds were found singularly in deep space and nowhere else which warranted them being classified as a mysterious species.
Some Jedi believed they were physical manifestations of the dark side of the force yet there were no claims to back these statements up.
During the First War between the Reconstituted Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, the Starweird Queen was considered to be of legendary status among the Galactic Republic as it was reported to have attacked many padawans and the Jedi Council.
This beast was eventually fought off but not killed by Jedi Master Wyellet which had resulted in his capture from the Imperial Forces
