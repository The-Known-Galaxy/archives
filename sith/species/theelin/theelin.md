# Overview
The Theelin were a sentient humanoid species with an unknown origin, renowned for their vibrant hair and patterned skin.
The species consisted of pure-blooded individuals like most other species but also included genetic hybrids.
The possibility of breeding between Theelin and other near-human species gave every single Theelin unique characteristics, such as different numbers of fingers/toes and differently shaped horns, a reason for their diversity.
The only consistent features were that they grew to about 1.7 metres as adults and that most spoke the Galactic Basic Standard.
Adaptability was also in their nature, demonstrated by their widespread presence in the galaxy.

# Presence in the Galaxy
During the Galactic Empire, their colourful appearance and notable sense of fashion allowed Theelin to be ideal performers, like in the case of the female religious singing group, the Divas.
There was even a beauty pageant hosted every winter named “Miss Theelin”.
However, Theelin hybrids faced discrimination even if their loyalty to the Empire was high, and as a result, they often stopped working with the Empire and chose more precarious jobs like bounty hunting.
In the subsequent years of the Empire, mutations in Theelin’s gene pool arose, which caused individuals to become infertile.
To crimelords like Ingoda the Hutt, this unique race became more prized as commodities than individuals, leading to further Theelin enslavement.
Even after several methods to revive the species through breeding with other near-human species, more and more were unable to have children as time passed.
Eventually, the infant death rate was so high that the population couldn’t recover its numbers; it was predicted that pure-blooded Theelin all died out by 10 ABY.
