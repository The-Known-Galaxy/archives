# Overview
The Ystervark were Ancient warriors capable of massacres.
Power so strong they were one of the most respected warriors, despite a massive drop in numbers after the Blood Monarch fell among them all.
They were giant creatures, packed with natural defenses like toxic spines and heavy plating that left others in fear as they passed.
The Ystervark were very respected not just for their warriorship, but also for their weapon crafting.
Unfortunately, though, as time passed, these beasts became less seeked out as technology advanced, leaving them behind with the rise of the Galactic Empire.
This led to their diminish by the time of the Galactic Civil War.
