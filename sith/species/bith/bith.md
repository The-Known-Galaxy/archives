# Introduction
The Bith species were a peaceful and intelligent Craniopod species from the planet of Clak'dor VII.
They were used to a civilized, highly technological lifestyle and were known to be musicians, scientists, engineers and in a few cases Force sensitives.

# Biology and Appearance
Their distinctive characteristics were their big eyes, large heads, lack of nasal organs and large fingers.

They only had 1 lung and exhaled through their skin, which was due to their lack of nose.
Their large eyes were capable of receiving a wide range of waves which permitted them to see objects in high detail and have remarkable eyesight but couldn't see from long distances.
Instead of having olfactory and auditory normal organs, they had other specialized organs that permitted smell and hearing and they were extremely sensitive.
They didn’t have the need to sleep, as they had evolved past that, however they did need to rest and they did through a meditation trance.
They weren’t incapable of copulating, as their brain had evolved to the point in which they could control those impulses, nevertheless they were capable of reproducing artificially using a computer.
