# Introduction

The Devaronia species were horned humanoids native to the planet of  Devaron.
They were believed to be descendants of primitive primates that inhabited the mountains of Devaron and their horns were an evolution in response to the birds that hunted them.

# Biology and Appearance

They were bipedal mammals that evolved as hunters and gatherers in the dense jungles on Devaron.
Their body had more muscle and as a result, weighed more than other humanoid species.
Surprisingly their blood was silver colored but appeared black and thick in the sun.
In addition, they had two livers that cleanse and filter blood in a very unique way which also granted them a natural resistance to venom.
Sulfur was used by them as a stimulant however they couldn't abuse it as their livers struggled in eliminating it.

This species was extremely unique as the gender dimorphism was extreme.
Males were very aggressive, had red skin and a pair of horns which were their pride.
In addition, they had teeth that were extremely sharp.
Females on the other side, were peaceful, didn't have horns, and were covered in fur that ranged in various colors.
Their teeth were similar to the male ones but also counted with molars and canines.
They used their teeth to speak and some male individuals were born with both pairs of teeth which made them live a life of solitude as scouts.
Males were known to have extremely long tongues but it was never known if females shared this trait.

# Society and culture

They were one of the first civilizations to discover interstellar travel and were commonly seen since eons back.
Their culture was based on two different roles.
The male role, which were the raiders and often traveled the galaxy in search of treasure and fights and the female role, who preferred to stay in the same place and therefore raised the future generations and governed them.
The males sent as much resources and money as they could while the females were happy with these roles.
The number of Force-sensitives was much higher in Devaronian than in many other species; however, not a strong Force wielder ever appeared.
The Jedi Order, knowing this, established a temple there and almost all students were females as men only desired to explore.
