# Introduction
Rodians were humanoid green-skinned creatures that resembled reptilians.
They were residents of the planet ‘’Rodia’’.
During the clone wars, their homeland was led by Senator Onaconda Farr.
He made a pact with the Trade Federation for food and protection.
They were betrayed shortly after, and they fell back into the hands of the republic.
Some roadians were dedicated to bounty hunting and informants for the galactic empire.

# Description
The rodians possessed large eyes that lacked pupils, meaning they could see the infrared spectrum.
They also had antennae that had a weird twin-saucer shape that could detect vibrations.
Their antennae were located at the top of their head.
Rodians also used to have relatively small snouts, pointy ears, and a spine-shaped ridge surrounding their skulls.
They mostly had scales resembling green but could also be red, yellow or turquoise.
Their skin had a pebble-like texture and a rough texture on top of it.
Their hands had five strong and long fingers with suction-like cups at the end of the fingers.
The pads assisted them with the diverse conditions they had to go through by living in swamps and they used it for climbing.
The shape of their hands was rather bizarre as if it would be an object that a human would feel uncomfortable using.
Their toes were also similar to their fingers.
Normally they also use oxygen breathers, but they could also breathe air mixed with Clouzon-36 without a respirator.
Their smell was also similar to a human.
