# Appearance

The Kaleesh originate from the planet of Kalee located in Wild Space.
They are a species of red-skinned and humanoid reptilians with two yellow eyes and slit pupils.
Both of them have a different perception of color.
Though the facial features of the Kaleesh had more bat-like features as they had elongated ears and flat noses, most of them would wear masks to hide them as a result.
They come equipped with a pair of tusks protruding out of their lower jaw with a shorter one located on their chin.
Apart from the face, they had elongated and thinner arms that would normally end with four-fingered claws that would have a pair of two opposable thumbs.
Because of this amount of appendages on the hand, they were digitigrades who would walk on their toes rather than their entire foot.

# Society

The Kaleesh are a species of low-tech civilization who were mostly known for their lack of mercy towards enemies.
They would usually approach the spoils of war and would take what they needed and wanted from who they conquered before returning back to their home.
Not all were fighters though so to distinguish these fighters from among the rest they appropriate masks that were coated in karabbac blood as warpaint, usually painted above their eyes.
These masks were more commonly than not carved from the skulls and bones of predatory animals that occupied their world, most commonly being Mumuu or Erkush.
Though these masks were not for decoration.
Any Kaleesh found wearing the mask for even just effect would meet punishment from others.
Being they were on the less technologically advanced they were also given limited choice for covering.
Because of this, most were seen in cloaks and headwraps among other things.
The reason they were more feared upon despite not having the means of natural or artificial armor was because of the weaponry they used.
The weapons they use include swords, shields, and slugthrowers though the occasional Czerka Arms Outland Rifle was used but those were reserved for the best who could make the most out of such a precious weapon.

# History

The Kaleesh have thousands of years worth of history.
The Kaleesh were subject to the crimes of the Old Republic as the corrupt and overburdened forces grew tired.
The result being crime had risen all across the galaxy and the Kaleesh were not immune to this crime.
Yam’rii or as the Kaleesh would refer to them as Huk would invade their homeworld, they would strip their resources away from them resulting in most of their population being sold into the slave trade.
Their lack of technology and Senate representation resulted in any wishes they pleaded for to go unanswered.
The result of these unanswered pleas was a devastating war between the Kaleesh and Yam’rii which is a constant rivalry even to the present date.
Not too long after the start of this war though a warrior by the name of Qymaen jai Sheelal had learned brutal and determined strategy, battle tactics, and warfare during the war.
Because of this, he was looked upon as a sort of deity and legend.
His reputation earned him the moniker “Grievous”.
Grievous had made such an impact that the Yam’rii had called for republic assistance during the war which had caused Jedi to join in.
The result was the Yam’rii had stopped worrying about the war as much as they used to, which had devastating effects on the warriors of Yam’rii as they weren’t as heavily supplied as they once were, leading to the starvation of hundreds and thousands of them.
Eventually, the battle had reached a stalemate as the Jedi slowly began putting less resources into the fight.
Resulting in Grievous having free time to be called off to Izvoshra.
But his transportation pod had been trapped by a conspiracy from Poggle the Lesser, Count Dooku, and Darth Sidious.
The result had left Grievous badly injured.
The Empire would then take him in and rebuild him into a cyborg general who would go on to lead numerous droid armies and gain the new title of “General Grievous”, thus creating one of the most iconic members of the Sith Order.
