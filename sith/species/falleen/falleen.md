# Appearance of Falleen
The Falleen were a repto-mammalian species in which they had a combination of features from both reptiles and mammals, typically humanoid.
They had a distinctive appearance compared to other species.
The most common appearance of these creatures were mottled green skin, ridged skulls, and long black hair which were typically worn in pony tails.
But variations of their appearance would occur causing brown hair color and variants in their eyes causing a blue, green, orange, purple, or yellow coloring to take place.
These people would normally be wearing gowns or robes colored to complement the color of their skin.

# History
Falleen themselves are native to the planet Falleen which they are named after.
But they migrated and adapted to eventually dominate many worlds, one of the more notable of these being Ord Mantell alongside the human population.
During the Clone Wars though, a cabal of Falleen nobles had led a criminal organization known as the Black Sun criminal syndicate which had the perfect opportunity to grow as the Jedi were focused on battling the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
Black Sun had evolved to become notorious in the lawless Outer Rim Territories and elsewhere around nearby systems.
The Black Sun had grown so much in the time with no Jedi that they had established a well-defended fortress on Mustafar where most of their operations were planned and acted on.
This had led the Falleen to invest into more serious personnel for their syndicate.
Xomit Grunseit who was the lead of the syndicate had enlisted the help of Lieutenant Ziton Moj to assist and lead the criminal organization.
During the reign of the Galactic Empire though, Falleen much like other alien species like Umbarans and Neimoidians had become the butt end of jokes within academies and even most notably the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant.
This in return had led the syndicate and the Falleen people in general to resent the empire.
In return, this would cause the Falleen people to strike back at them when they had a good chance, such as taking over slave trades the Empire had owned.
