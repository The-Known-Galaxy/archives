# Overview

Sarlacc, one of the most feared creatures in the galaxy, known for its behemoth size and horrifying way they use to sustain themselves.
Mysterious in origin, these ancient organisms spread through the cosmos, rooted under the sand and soil of worlds.
They can be found in different places, ranging from the dune sea of Tatooine to the swamp of Dathomir.

# Anatomy and Physiology

Sarlacc are omnivorous plant-like organism with an appearance of a hybrid between giant worm and tree with tan color bark-like skin.
They can grow up to 100 meters in length.
Sarlacc have 4 main body parts ; a head, 8 appendages , 3 roots and a worm-like body.
Juvenile Sarlaccs are more agile and smaller than adults due to size and their roots yet to anchor themselves permanently to the sand or soil.

Head
Sarlacc head has 3 different organs ; a beak, fangs and tentacles, though beaks are only found in adults.

```
Beak : The beak of a Sarlacc is positioned at the middle of their maw.
```

This beak is in fact, the tongue of the creature.
Inside the beak there is another tongue like muscle, helping in swallowing prey.
Inside the beak there are many nerve endings.
Sarlacc determined which stomachs they would send their food in with their inner tissue inside the beak.
There are also microscopic pore openings inside them to help with sorting off undesirable objects such as sand and mud.

```
Fangs : Sarlacc has many rolls of fangs.
```

Its fangs are slightly curving inward and coated with mucus to prevent prey from escaping.
In juvenile, these fangs are being used to chew prey.
Tentacles : Tentacles are the sensory organ of Sarlacc.
Detecting vibration from the sand.
Sarlacc uses tentacles to catch prey and send them down its beak/throat.

Appendages
Sarlacc has 8 appendages, 4 each side of its body.
They use these flipper shape appendages to bury themselves in sand as an adult.
As a juvenile, these appendages were used to move around, synergized with the different hunting methods of juveniles.

Roots
Sarlacc has 3 roots at the bottom end of their body.
These roots absorb nutrients and water to keep the Sarlacc hydrated.
Roots have the same function in adults and juveniles.
However, in adult form these roots also function as anchors, holding Sarlacc in place.

Body
Sarlaccs have their body grow downward toward gravitational force.
Make their body look like a pitfall trap.
Their outer membranes of the body are bark/leather-like.

Sarlacc’s lifespan is incredibly long, estimated around 20,000 - 50,000 years.
With such a long lifespan, Sarlacc has time to grow to the truly enormous size, up to a hundred meters in length.
With such size, it is safe from most predators.
Only Great Krayt dragon and Gouka dragon have been known to prey upon them.

```
It has been thought of as desert dweller organisms, in truth they prefer a more damped environment.
```

However, they can do just fine in the desert due to their efficient roots.

# Predation

With physiology different between adult and juvenile Sarlacc, the predation method of them are different.
Juveniles, while not possessing enormous size, are much more agile.
Their hunting method is a simple one.
Chase their prey through sand, cough them, then eat them like typical carnivorous animals do.
As an adult, Sarlacc is an ambush predator.
Using their odors to lure prey close enough to their maw for their tentacles to grab them.Their special shape fangs and mucus prevent prey from climbing up.
Lastly, with a slightly moveable beak for more flexibility in feeding.
Misconception about adult Sarlacc’s predation is that they primarily rely on their tentacles to grab prey into their pseudo-mouth(beak).In reality, Sarlacc uses odors to lure their preferred prey to them, not just waiting for their prey to accidentally stumble upon them.

# Digestion

Sarlacc has 2 different stomachs to digest different kinds of prey, primary stomach and secondary stomach.
Sarlacc can determine the size of prey through nerve endings inside their throat.
Smaller prey would be sent to the primary stomach.
The primary stomach is a big sack in which all of the non-dangerous animals would be held.
For larger or more volatile prey, Sarlacc would send them to their secondary stomach.
Secondary stomachs are private chambers, only for those specific prey.

```
The most disturbing part about Sarlacc’s digestion is how slow it is.
```

Prey can be trapped inside the stomach and be kept alive for thousands of years.
Normally, prey will be punctured by tentacles inside the stomach.
These tentacles inject digestive enzymes and acid to slowly digest prey from the inside while its prey is also being soaked in mild acid.
Pain from acid burn is not the only thing its prey would be subjected to.
Sarlacc known to deliberately inject neurotoxins to its prey, made them suffer in agony.
It does this to make its prey suffocate with pain and not attempt to escape.
Prey suffered all of these while also being kept alive by Sarlacc.
Through the same tentacles which inject acid and poisons into prey, they also inject nutrients back.

# Reproduction

Their species females are normally much larger than their male counterparts.
When they meet each other, the male would attach itself to the female in a parasitic fashion.
After the reproduction, Sarlacc’s spore called “Sarlacci” will be released.
These spores can travel through the void of space.
This is the reason why finding Sarlacc’s origin is impossible to do.

These Sarlacci are also incredibly resilient.
If not digested well enough, Sarlacc larva can hatch from Sarlacci.
It will then digest its predator from inside out.
