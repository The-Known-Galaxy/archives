The Chiss were a tall, blue-skinned near-human species hailing from their home planet of Csilla within the Unknown Regions.
The Chiss are distinguishable by their blue skin, red eyes and black hair; the Chiss’ red eyes would grow darker depending on the amount of oxygen surrounding them.
The Chiss were unknown to the rest of the galaxy; only a few would know about their existence or refer to them as the people of better known Chiss, such as Thrawn.


The Chiss were an offshoot of humanity from early expansions into the Galaxy; it is believed that their physical form changed because of living underground and being exposed to glacial minerals.
Their appearance was easy to identify and usually made them stand out in larger crowds of humanoids; full-grown Chiss would grow between 1.6 and 2.1 meters with 1.7 meters, later 1.85 meters being the average.
Chiss had a higher metabolism, and this was noticeable in their physical shape; they were next to the physical features almost similar to humans, Chiss had a more pliant vocal system which was noticeable in their native language of Cheunh.


Yet, the Chiss had an accelerated growth rate compared to humans, allowing them to reach maturity much faster.
Chiss at the age of 10 would be physically comparable to a human at the age of 20, in turn, this became part of their emotional and cultural imprint; this, resulted in the Chiss usually being more mature and intellectually advanced than their human counterpart.
After the age of 10, the Chiss would have a growth spurt, after which they would be considered full adults by Chiss society.
The Chiss middle-age was 51-62, and those aged 63-x were considered old.

It is believed, however uncertain, that the Chiss might have been a long-forgotten human colony; According to Chiss legends, the planet of Csilla where the original Chiss settled used to be a warm and tropical planet.
Csilla would later become locked in an ice age with glacial terrains forming on the planet, this would be the same condition on many of the Chiss planets, and for their survival, they would move underground and form most of their society there.
Whilst underground they created technology to stay alive, and eventually, they would turn into a technologically advanced society, the moving underground and exposure to the glacial mineral content of the planet(s) would result in their now known physical shape.

The Chiss survived by using geothermal energy for power sources, they used the energy to build populous cities and develop a global government for the Chiss people, known as The Chiss Ascendancy.
The Chiss species mastered star travel independently, allowing them to expand to planets within Chiss space.
Due to the Chiss their expansion, the Chiss Ascendancy became a global government along with the formation of the Chiss Expansionary Defence force; the mission of the Chiss Expansionary Defence Force at that point was primarily exploration.
The Chiss would remain an isolated, yet technologically and culturally advanced society located in Chiss space and united under the banner of the Chiss Ascendancy.
There would be some outside connection with the Chiss, as they chose to ally or hold connections only with those they considered strong enough, such as the Sith Empire or Galactic Empire; this would result in Chiss being incorporated in their ranks.
