# Introduction
The Zabraks were species that look similar to humans, besides for a few major body features that identified them as a separate species.
They were native to the planet Iridonia which was located in the Mid Rim.
Their main distinctive features were their heads perstruting from the top of their heads.
The size, length, and placement varies vastly.
They had two hearts, and a greater tolerance for pain.
Even though most of the Zabrak species presided over Iridonia.
These species were Force Sensitive, which means they had the potential to hone the Force.
During a Rite of Passage to adulthood, Zabraks would get facial tattoos which would often indicate their region or family.
Or, it could represent something personal to them.

# Sub-Species
Depending on what type of Zabrak they were, their skin tone could vary from gray, to black, to brown or even blue.
Some settled on the planet Dathomir, where the females were in charge.
They were known as the Nightsisters.
They were feared by those who preceded Dathomir.
They performed power dark side magick.
They were led by Mother Talzin, an extremely powerful Zabrak witch.
In Dathomir, male Zabrak were treated as slaves and servants to the Nightsisters.
Their skin could vary from red, to orange, or even yellow.
Female Iradonian Zabraks usually had smaller horns than those that males would have.
Dathomirian Zabracks lacked the horns that the rest of their species had.



# Allegiances
Many of the Zabrak species were loyal to the Galactic Republic, but were soon opposed by the Galactic Empire.
Most of the Zabraks joined the Rebel Alliance, hoping to bring back the Republic.
Although, not all Zabraks showed their loyalty to the Republic.
Individual Zabraks could be found across the galaxy from having jobs such as bounty hunters to mercenaries.
Most of the Force-sensitive Zabraks joined the Jedi Order during the Galactic Republic.



# Notable Zabraks
Some of the notable members who joined the Jedi Order were, Eeth Koth, Zubain Ankoni and Agan Kolar.
Eeth Koth and Agan Kolar eventually had the chance to join the Jedi High Council, which they accepted during the later years of the Jedi Order.
Agam Kolar would eventually join Mace Windu and the other Jedi High Council in order to arrest the Supreme Chancellor, who was actually the Sith Lord named Darth Sidious.
He died trying to arrest him.
Two Zabrak brothers named Maul and Savage Opress served the Sith during the Clone Wars, helping out Count Dooku and the Nightsisters.
The Nightsisters used their magic in order to make Savage Opress a strong warrior, which they hoped to use to take down Count Dooku.
Savage Opress would later be killed by Darth Sidious after finding out that Darth Maul did not follow through with the Right of Two.
