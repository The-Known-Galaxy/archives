# Overview

Muuns were a tall and thin humanoid species, characterized by having three hearts and especially elongated skulls, which is the most commonly known part about them.
Physically, they had hairless and smooth craniums, tiny ears, long arms and legs and humped noses, which gave them a sort of nasal voice.
On average, they lived around 100 years (most likely thanks to their better blood flow - a perk of having three hearts) and were around 1.9 meters tall.
They hail from Scipio, a frozen planet with a snow and ice-covered surface, where the temperatures were low.
However, since the Muuns had two hearts that they could control at will, they could easily manage their blood flow to resist the cold temperatures of Scipio.

# History

Being born on a planet with no actual natural resources, they had to resort to exploiting the economic system: they formed the InterGalactic Banking Clan, the largest and most important banking organization in the galaxy.
Not long after, they colonized the planet of Muunilinst, and made it one of their major activity hubs.
Muunilinst was used for the creation of the most used monetary source in the galaxy, Credits.
During the age of the Galactic Republic, the Muuns were often privates who invested in whatever seemed the most profitable and useful to them at the moment.
Important trade guilds founded colonies, trade guilds and corporations, and at some point, they even colonized the planet of Mygeeto, which would become a financial center for Muuns.
After the end of the Republic, with the emergence of the Galactic Empire, Muunilinst was used as a financial center.
Emperor Palpatine disliked all of the non-humans, but he still recognized how important Muuns were for the economic stability of the galaxy.
Although heavily hampered, their financial institutions still remained, and they were exempt from Palpatineâ€™s persecution of non-humans.
After the fall of the Empire and the rise of the New Republic, the Muuns stayed as part of the Imperial Remnant.
During the Yuuzhan Vong War, the planet of Muunilinst was destroyed, and the survivors were enslaved.
By 40 ABY, the planet had recovered.
