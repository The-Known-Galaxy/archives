# Introduction

Killiks are strong, intelligent creatures that vary greatly in size.
However, they share an almost equal genetic code
that warranted a diverse genetic population of insects.
Their society was mainly composed of hives that homed these creatures with their name being locally  known as nests.

# Nests

Each nest had members share an equal amount of physical strength between them.
In addition to this, they had numerous special communication techniques.
Such as: pheromones, electromagnetic transmissions, and long distance telepathy.

Most of the Killiks were females, with only a few males remaining when a new nest had been created.
More importantly, females could lay thousands of eggs a month, resulting in the hive becoming battle-ready for any wars they may have within a year.
Furthermore, within two years the hatchlings would be able to produce their own eggs.

# Abilities

They possessed a very strong chitinous exoskeleton that had a greenish and glossy hue.
Resulting in their natural resistance to any types of erosion, or physical damage from their environment.

Their exoskeleton had a number of spiracles which served the purpose of letting them breathe.
However, this could easily be countered using insecticide grenades that would forcefully close their spiracles, suffocating them.
