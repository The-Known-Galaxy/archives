# Overview

The Tognath species are sentient species that originated from the planet Yar Togna.
Their unique appearance is a result of their insectoid and mammalian characteristics, which possess both an endo- and exoskeleton.
Additionally, their primitive nervous system provides them with immunity to most pain, making them well-suited for combat situations.

# Biology and appearance

The Tognath are a humanoid species that evolved on the high-gravity volcanic planet Yar Togna.
They have tall, gaunt bodies with a fleshy and pallid skin covered by a hairless exoskeleton, which helps them resist the atmospheric pressure of their homeworld.
Their eyes are compound and do not have lids, and their vocal cords produce a deep, low voice that is nearly impossible for other species to hear without assistance.
The Tognath have both insectoid and mammalian characteristics, which makes them a unique species.
They are genetically related to the Kel Dor and Gand, although it is unclear whether this relation is due to experimentation or evolution.
Tognath larvae are hatched from eggs nurtured in a suspension jelly, where two or more eggs can be grafted together to create a bond that lasts throughout their lives.
After the parasitic larvae emerge, they latch onto one of their parents to feed directly from their bloodstream for six months.
Then, they are taken to a nursery tree where they spin a cocoon, undergo metamorphosis, and grow an endoskeleton and exoskeleton within the safety of their cocoon.
When they emerge from their cocoon, they look like a smaller version of their adult form.
Tognath almost universally opt to enhance their biological functions with cybernetic modifications, which is an easy process due to their dulled pain receptors.
They often add special lenses to their eyes, breathing apparatus to process the oxygen content in a planet's atmosphere, and other technology to augment their poor hearing and balance.

# Society and culture

Tognath lived on the high-gravity planet Yar Togna.
They constructed their homes on stilts over the lava channels that covered their world, coalescing around the main mountain range to access natural springs.
Their environment was tumultuous, and they lived and worked in challenging conditions.
The exact date of these events is unknown.
