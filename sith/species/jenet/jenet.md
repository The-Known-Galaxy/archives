# Appearance

The Jenet are a species of humanoid rodents who were often not liked by humans because of their features, causing them to adopt a more scavenger-like nature.

Despite being shunned away from one of the largest species, the Jenet have a remarkable memory and can remember events, words and movements from events they had witnessed weeks and even months into the past.
Notable features regarding them include their pink skin, red-tinted eyes, and their wiry fur that came in hues of white, grey, and red which could be seen more abundantly on their heads rather than the rest of their body.
Whiskers could also be seen on their face and would twitch when they spoke as well as aiding in their scavenging.
They are located on the side of their muzzle right above their cleft top lip, which hid their sharp, yellow teeth from all who viewed them.
Their digestive tract is rather impressive, being able to consume and digest almost all living organic matter.
Additionally, the Jenet have marvelous eyesight, hearing, and smell.
More marveled feats included their strength, resulting in their enhanced ability during running, climbing, and swimming.
Lastly, the Jenet are very flexible creatures, capable of squeezing through gaps as small as twelve centimeters via dislocating their lengthier limbs and some of their cranial plates.

The Jenet are originally from the planet Garban within the Tau Sakar system.
They evolved into impressive survivalists as they systematically drove their largest predators to extinction, an important part of their history they refer to as “The Great Conquest”.
They accomplished this with their average height of 1.4 - 1.6 meters, which accompanied well with their strengths.
The Jenet were seen to walk on their toes rather than their whole wedge-shaped foot.
Each of their limbs ended in four elongated fingers or toes with the hands having the exception of opposable thumbs.
Each one of their digits lined with sharp claws.
However, this did not impact their preferred transportation method of scurrying around.

# Society

Jenets are temperamental and obsessed with any form of trivialities, which caused many species to recognize them as obnoxious with their urge to be right in every instance.
Despite their technological advances on their homeworld and elsewhere, the Jenet are still heavy scavengers.
Nothing they came across ever left them though, with all items either being kept in their homes or within a community warren, also known as a Community Heap.
These heaps were filled with broken tools, empty containers and food.
They were all common ground for the other Jenet, which had grown accustomed to digging through the more likely than not gargantuan pile of items to find anything that could be of use to them.
The Jenet were also omnivores, though they did not raise or slaughter animals; they continued their scavenging ways and would only consume the flesh of an already dead animal.
This meant the predators they did not kill in the Great Conquest had free rein over them more often than not, resulting in Jenet accustoming to fleeing at the first sight of these predators.

The Jenet memory is so impressive that they will remember the thing that attacked them in exact detail so as to tell other Jenet what they were coming up against.
This did not just work with their natural predators though; a Jenet could remember an insult told to them and hold a grudge for a lifetime.
Having this ability, rumors about other Jenet could be told while members voted treason against their own from just a rumor they heard a month ago in perfect detail.
They also had a habit of not caring what other species thought about their opinions, usually spouting nonsense and their beliefs whenever they felt like it.
This even extended to their families and friends, with it becoming so popular among them that it formed into their most common form of greeting each other.
This was possible as the Jenet took pride in others needing to take the time and power to be remembered in the first place.
This unfortunately began a chain of people believing the Jenet would make false memories in order to trick the people around them, but no Jenet entertained this idea as no Jenet had a tolerance for ignorance and duplicity.

Despite these strifes back and forth, the galaxy shared with them most of the technology available at the time, leading to most Jenet being better off than many other species on average.
Regardless, most Jenet did not work technology-focused jobs, instead opting for manual labor and places where their memory could be of use.

# History

The Jenets evolved from rodent prey animals on Garban.
Using the ancient trash piles the Jenet had cultivated in the past, archaeologists hypothesized that the species had developed sentience rather than starting out with it.
Early Jenets lived in caves underground.
They stayed within numerous cramped confines and locations for most of their day with some reaching full days within these places, only stepping out to the surface to scavenge for food.

People agreed that thousands of years before the Battle of Yavin, ancient Jenets organized against their predators and began an extinction event against all the species of their home world that would be an immediate threat to the Jenet.
Jenet legend revered and respected this period, which they called the Great Conquest.
It immortalized the numerous heros and the warriors of this time in poetry.
According to such tales from this time, the Danchaf of Garban were once a sophisticated and cunning species for their planet that tried effortlessly to stop the Jenet from penetrating their destruction into the forests.
The Jenet rulers, Chirr't Ferr and Rhet H'rrr, formed countless armies to drive back these Danchaf hordes far further than any of them dared to expand outwards.
H'rrr, according to the legends of the past, specifically targeted the Camale Danchaf, one of the species' four genders.
Consequently, this disturbed the tree goblins' reproductive abilities and slowing their efforts in pushing the Jenet back.
An epic titled The Ballad of Shan'Gredor told of the Jenet Ch'irrk Felt, who created numerous giant traps made out of pots, pans, and bright phospowder.
The noise and blinding lights dazzled the Danchaf, which had allowed the Jenet soldiers waiting to ambush them an opportunity to slaughter all caught within their radius.
In the end, such wars were unsuccessful in eradicating the Danchaf from the planet entirely despite the best efforts from the Jenet over the course of many years; legend claimed that the Jenet attacks forced the Danchaf to devolve into such a primitive state that the Jenet had free reign over the planet, becoming one of the apex predators of the time on the planet Garban.
With the help of a xenobiologist named Xemlorn, scientists dismissed any information of a more sophisticated past for the Danchaf, thus doubting the truth and longevity of the Jenets' heroic tales.

To the Jenets however, the legends were key elements of their history and was their main reasoning for continuing outwards to other planets as they did not fear the creatures lurking on them.
Jenet society had eventually fallen into clans after the battle was faught.
During this period, the Jenet bureaucracy developed, as did the positions of premier and the Council of 127.
Jenets learned to manage the numerous other species on their world without resorting to widespread eradication to keep their food supply high for generations of the species to come.
The Jenet advanced their technological prowess soon after the control of their planet, eventually reaching spaceflight by their own innovation; this was likely done from stray ship crashes on their planet rather than any form of their own developed work.

Over time, Jenet fecundity and lack of predators caused the species to overpopulate Garban.
As a result, Jenets sent settlers to the other worlds of the Tau Sakar system in hopes of finding a new planet to call their home in a more sustainable location.
Their attempts proved beneficial as they were successfully able to find conditions very similar to those on Garban, a fact that led scholars to postulate that an unknown intelligence once terraformed the planets to make these conditions so similar.
The Jenets eventually founded colonies outside the Tau Sakar system as well, and over time they reached a technological standpoint that was on par or better than other advanced worlds in the galaxy.
Their system became part of the Abrion sector in the Outer Rim Territories as their official home.

The Jenets' spread to other worlds inevitably brought them into contact with pan-galactic government.
During the Galactic Civil War, the Galactic Empire took over the Tau Sakar system for their own goals and benefits.
Imperial sentientologist and propagandist Obo Rin included the Jenets in his Catalog of Intelligent Life in the Galaxy, a project commissioned by Sith Lord Darth Vader to detail sentient species of most interest to the Empire so they may be used to help their own war effort.
Rin claimed that the galactic regime protected the Jenets from marauding members of the Rebel Alliance who were out to exterminate all intelligent life.
In exchange, the Jenets gladly served the Emperor as laborers while preferring their working ideals of manual labor.
Contrary to this, they did see themselves as slaves to the Empire, as most of the population was forced to live in labor camps and undertake a task that they collectively hated because their own self-right and personality conflicted with the type of work they were being forced to partake in.
The Empire found the Jenets to be useful workers on other planets as well due to their high reproductive rate, which rendered any worries about mortality levels to a microscopic degree.
Enslaved Jenets often operated in perilous work conditions as their increased abilities in almost all physical situations resulted in them being the best in most scenarios for The Empire.
As a result, the Empire set up breeding facilities for the species in an effort to select traits that would increase their pacifist nature while lowering their overall intellect of the species.

Jenets willing to fight back against the Empire were rare as their entire species was under their control by this point, except for a select few survivors, with some even joining the Jedi Order upon escape.
After the collapse of the Empire in 4 ABY, the Jenet had to recover from the generations of selective breeding that had taken place, resulting in a far more primitive state than the Jenet ever imagined they would be taken back to.
The species never joined the New Republic, the successor state of the Rebel Alliance, due to their preference for being among only their own kind after the horrid events that had taken place.
Yet, a few individual Jenets did serve in various capacities in the new government and its successor, the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances.
