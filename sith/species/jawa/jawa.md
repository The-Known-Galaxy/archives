# Introduction
A Jawa is about a single meter tall, dressed in heavy brown cloaks, with bright yellow or orange eyes.
They speak in a language understood by very few other species.
Colonists that settled on the Jawa’s home planet, Tatooine, rumored they were giant rodents or devolved humans.
Very few people still know what is beneath a Jawa’s cloak, so only mystery surrounds these little creatures.

# Culture
Jawa’s spend the majority of their days searching the entire desert for droids, ship parts, scrap metal, and other scrap to sell to locals and visiting merchants.
Jawa’s are also often found around pod races, stealing the metal from the crashed pods.
They make themselves a great living fixing up what they find and bargaining with moisture farmers.
The Jawa’s have quite the reputation for being dishonest and scamming locals and travelers.
They are often caught selling dangerous stolen equipment and broken droids for full price.
Even though they have this reputation, the lack of retail options keep them in business.

Their native language, Jawaese, uses scent as well as spoken words.
This makes it almost impossible to understand by outsiders, yet a variation of the language allows them to talk with traders and customers using a version of Jawaese called Jawa Trade Talk.



# Tools
The Jawa’s use their special tools to capture and fix droids.
Once they have a new droid in their possession, they fit it with restraining bolts.
They can summon it using a Jawa Droid Caller.

Droids are not the only things they use their tools on.
They love working on their form of transport, Sandcrawler.
They are equipped with magnetic cranes all over and use these to collect all kinds of scrap from the desert floor.
It is also equipped with a suction tube that perfectly transports droids and other parts to the cargo hold.



# Transport
Sandcrawlers were originally used for mining on Tatooine, but are now abandoned.
Jawa’s use them for transporting their wares across the desert but also as mobile headquarters.
These moving monstrous fortresses give protection from the Tatooine climate and terrain.
The armor is strong enough to sustain attacks from many of their enemies.
