# Overview
Nelvaanians are a race of blue-furred lupine humanoids originating from the planet of Nelvaan.
They call their planet “Great Mother”, and have Nelvaan as the main focus of their religion.
They usually formed simple, tribalistic societies in which males became warriors and scouts while females were builders, gatherers, and mothers.
Each tribe was governed by one Shaman and one Chieftain respectively.

# History
During the Clone Wars, a Separatist Base on Nelvaan was run by scientists of the Techno Union.
Once General Grievous had come to visit the base, he asked about the nature of its inhabitants.
Fascinated by their strength and culture, he convinced himself to turn them into his own personal elite.
Grievous then proceeded to lure Nelvaanian warriors into the base under the promise of being a prophet, before proceeding to capture them in order to physically alter them with cybernetic implantations.
Although this attempt was sabotaged by the notorious Jedi Anakin Skywalker, who would free the Nelvaanian warriors and return them to their village safely before any irreversible damage could be done.
