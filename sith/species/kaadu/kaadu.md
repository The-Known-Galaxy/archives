# Overview
The Kaadu are 2-legged reptavians that operate on land and water.
These creatures are amazingly fast runners and very strong swimmers with a large lung capacity.
They can breathe underwater for a total of 2 hours which helps them go across the water easier.
They can outrun most creatures with a speed that can reach up to 49 MPH.


Kaadu came in many different colors, mainly orange and yellow but could also come in blue, green, and red.
The Kaadu were quite a tall animal with an average height of 7’3 inches, 2 feet taller than the average horse.
Kaadu have an extremely heightened sense of smell and hearing.
They are without upper incisors, which makes it difficult to chew.
It is so difficult to chew that they rely on snails and seaweed so it can go down smoothly, making them omnivores.


The Kaadu normally travels in separate groups of 20-100, although in one case they were reported to be in a group of 3.4 million.
Male and female Kaadu are separated by flocks, these flocks only come together in mating season and separate once done.
When in mating the male Kaadu is yellow with outlined purple spots.
To lay their eggs they would find an area near water and would lay 6-12 at a time.

# History
Kaadu are fearless creatures, making the gungans attracted to using them for battle.
These animals would be used to charge into battle and as patrol animals for the police of Gungan City.
Kaadu is an extremely loyal animal.
Some even say that once they make a bond, it is near impossible to separate them from their owner/partner.
These steeds were given feathers as a cosmetic piece during the finding of Plo Koon.
