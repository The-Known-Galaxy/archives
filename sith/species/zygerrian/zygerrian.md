# Overview

The Zygerrian were a sentient humanoid species that lived on the planet Zygerria.
They evolved from an unidentified sentient canine species with horns, leading to their feline appearance.
Their iconic ears inspired a hairstyle known to be worn by a Kanjiklubber, Razoo Qin-Fee, at Nar Kanji’s underground fighting circuit.
Their society was split into classes of clans, ruled by a queen with an idealism towards slavery, holding the Royal Slave Auction to instigate a slave market boom.
Those in higher classes were distinguished by bright, distinct clothing instead of the regular dark-coloured commonly worn.
They were known as notorious slavers in the galaxy, often equipped with shock whips, electrostaffs and Zygerrian blaster rifles to control their assets of all kinds.
Zygerrian traders and royal guards wore armour, reflecting their warlike nature.

# History

In times of the first Galactic Republic, the Zygerrian Slave Empire flourished, benefiting both the Zygerrian and their buyers.
Access to the Triellus Trade Route allowed business and distribution of the Twi’lek people.
Eventually, the empire received opposition from the growing Jedi Order presence and was forced into the shadows, which commenced Zygerrian hatred towards the self-righteous knights.
Although outlawed by the Jedi, Zygerrian slaving traditions were continued through the Zygerrian Alliance of the High Republic.
During the Clone Wars, there was a futile attempt to revive its former status in a plot by the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
However, it was halted again by the Jedi, who managed to liberate the enslaved people, and a betrayal was enacted by Count Dooku, who killed the Zygerrian queen, Miraj Scintel.
Following Scintel’s death, Zygerrian King Molec was crowned and led a comeback for the Zygerrians in the Imperial Era after brokering a deal with Galactic Emperor Palpatine for freedom in return for restricting their slaving operations to the Outer Rim.
This led to the increase of Zygerrian significance in the galaxy.
MaDall led a small slave empire on Oon, while Raney led a similar group on Ord Mantell.
The Zygerrian Slavers Guild was later established on their homeworld upon favourable imperial law reforms.
Furthermore, the activity grew with the advent of the New Republic.
