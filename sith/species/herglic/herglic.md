# Overview

The Herglic were a race of mammalian creatures native to the planet of Giju, located in the Colonies Region and what would become known as Herglic Space.
This species was a sentient race and often adopted a peaceful disposition yet due to their large stature they sparingly found work as bodyguards.
Their main sources of employment consisted of being Traders, Workmen and High-Quality Engineers.

# Physiology

Herglics were a bipedal race, with evolutionary origins tracing back to aquatic mammals, as such they retained a few traits from their aquatic ancestors.
One such was their most prominent feature; their blow-holes.
These holes were situated at the peak of their cranium and were used for breathing.
The sound of such was so associated with the Herglic that it formed the basis for a common Herglese word, which was used to express the significance of a remark.

Another of the features of the Herglics’ physiology was their stature.
This stature was a leftover trait from their large aquatic ancestors which carried over to the Herglic Race.
As a result of this, the average male Herglic measured in size from 1.7 - 2.2 meters tall.
However, This height did not solely compromise the Herglics’ stature, additionally the Herglic were incredibly well-built, featuring broad shoulders and thighs accompanied by dense muscles and thick skin.

Such skin was another highlighting physical feature of the Herglic, akin to their aquatic ancestors the Herglic possessed thick, blubbery skin.
Upon this, the skin was usually light blue in colour yet ranged all the way darker to fully black.
Exceptions to this rule existed, however, such as was the case with Hamar-Chatak, a Herglic merchant who had pale pink skin.

# Galactic Reach

Some time prior to 27,500 BBY the Herglics developed hyperdrive technology, using this they would go on to colonise surrounding worlds and form trading networks along the newly christened Herglic Empire which resided in the aptly named Herglic Space.
\[See the Article on the Planet Giju for more information regarding these events\].
Due to the great reach of the Herglic Empire prior to the unification with the Republic, vast amounts of Herglics would make residence within the planets along the Rinma Trade Route.
These Herglics would make up a minority of the population on these planets and would usually live separated from other races due to the different needs of the Herglics when compared to other bipedal species.
As such, Herglics tended to form communities on the outskirts of towns and cities known as Pakks, however despite disadvantageous to themselves the Herglics did not abstain from contact with other races, Herglics were effective traders and technical workmen, their skills as engineers so great that even Hutt Cartel associated groups would seek out Herglic engineers.
