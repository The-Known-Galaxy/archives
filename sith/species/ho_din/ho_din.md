# Appearance
Ho’Din are a lengthy, humanoid species with numerous colored skins.
They are native to the planet of Moltok where they had developed elongated suction-like fingertips which they used for climbing trees.
More notable features include the snake-like hair on their person which were more like tubes covered in scales rather than any living animal.
This had the bonus of being a thermal sensor for the Ho’Din.
These creatures have claimed their original form was a plant from which they evolved from while also possessing two hearts but scientists have classified them more as a reptilian than any plant relative.

# History
During the year 300 BBY the Ho’Din began their decision of progressing forwards instead of living their low-technology lifestyle.
Once they had migrated to the first floors they began mining, farming, and manufacturing goods.
Sadly, their ideals of ecology were slim to none, resulting in them underestimating the power of deforestation where organisms that would enhance the speed of decaying plantlife would prosper, resulting in them evolving into a parasite type creature that would latch onto a Ho’Din, bringing diseases and malnourishment as it sat.
This pushed the Ho’Din back into the trees where they refocused all of their time and research into botanical research rather than ecological research.
With this advancement, the Ho’Din had developed herbal therapies which could rid them of the parasites within them.
Their pharmacological techniques as well as attempts to restore the Moltok ecological system resulted in the species safe and prosperous life as a civilization.
However, this didn’t come without a cost.
Some technologies were outlawed within Moltok and were under strict rule not to be developed there but when it came to planets outside of Moltok, the Ho’Din took it as a necessary evil they had to deal with on what they themselves considered to be unhealthy and damaged planets.
This resulted in trades of medicines from the Ho’Din people of Moltok as they knew more about preserving life and planets than most species in which they gained their wealth vastly where it was used to help rebuild the ecosystem of their planet as well as repair damaged planets that needed it, many becoming garden planets where species could go to and commune with nature.
Numerous years later during the year 5000 BBY, a female Ho’Din who went by the name of Lohjoy worked with the Sith Empire as a Starship Engineer, one of many different jobs a Ho’Din would achieve but certainly an uncommon one as the Ho’Din’ had their charming looks where they would make their own personal wealthy when not on Moltok as dancers or models.
