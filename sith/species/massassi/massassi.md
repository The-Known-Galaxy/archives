# Introduction

The Massassi were a form of primitive sentient Sith species, most notable for their fearless, intimidating, and warrior-like demeanors.
Being a species of the Sith race, the Massassi were native to the planet Korriban and posed extreme loyalty to their superior Sith master beings.
Based on appearance alone, Massassi were fearsome and highly skilled combatants.
Massassi, just like other species of Sith, possessed a natural force sensitivity mostly attuned to the Dark Side of The Force.
This would further advance the skill sets that the Massassi already possessed as they were able to feed on the Dark Side of The Force like any other native organism that resided on Korriban.

# Appearance

Average Massassi would stand 2-3 meters tall and had an average weight of 150kg.
Just like other species of Sith, the Massassi would appear with skin tones such as red, dark red, light pink, crimson, and anything else related to said colors.
Though dissimilar to other Sith species, Massassi would naturally have glowing yellow eyes.
These pairs of glowing eyes would not contain pupils or eye whites of any sort, rather the yellow portion would be the dominant color within the eye of a Massassi.
The facial features of Massassi consisted of tendrils that would dangle from their cheekbones, eyebrow stalks that would shield their eyes--a mouth, nose, and ears like that of any human species.

# Biology

Massassi had an average lifespan of up to 50 years but this was likely due to the harsh conditions they faced within their history.
There were quite a few Massassi that would live for over 200 years and at such an age, wielded plenty of wisdom and were highly respected by other Massassi.
Childhood times were considered 0-20 years where at the age of 20, Massassi would be considered to be in their adolescent stages.
It wouldn’t be until the age of 30 that a Massassi would finally reach adulthood.
Just like some of their other relative species, the Massassi possessed a thick hide and tough skin, this would result in higher quality medicine being used among the species in order to care for them such as cyanogen silicate which would provide proper healing to account for their thick hide and their durable skin.
In time, the Massassi would see more biological changes during their service and loyalty towards Naga Sadow on Yavin IV.
The result of which caused them to become more monstrous, mindless, and savage as they would undergo biological experimentation in the hope that Naga Sadow would continue to increase his power.
Eventually, these monstrosities would descend into large brutes containing a set of serrated claws and malformed fin-like features on their back leading up to their head.
During this time is when these beasts would finally be considered a subspecies of the Sith due to the mass amount of alteration they faced as a result of biological experimentation.

# Culture/Tradition

With the warrior, fearsome, and ruthless nature of the Massassi, they held a variety of principles and traditions that put those traits into the spotlight.
Their brutal standards would hold a very primitive nature going as far as sacrificing other sentient beings out of acts of mere tradition.
War, battle, and violence as a whole were considered the natural order of things within the lifestyle of these warriors.
While this rather brute species of the Sith were a form of sentient species, they weren’t the most intelligent but still possessed good engineering skills as well as the ability to wield weapons and be trained to use weapons that may be unfamiliar to them.
This group of Sith in particular would use armor enhanced by alchemy along with their primitive battle ax called the Massassi lanvarok.
Masters who commanded these fearsome beings would act as the enforcers within the battlefield to ensure that the Massassi could be led into proper strategy.
Similar to their other Sith relatives, the Massassi also had a language of their own known as the “Massassi language.” It’s very much believed that this language of theirs that they adopted was fairly similar to the Sith language as a whole.
Not only that, but the usage of this language and its markings complimented the Sith language since they would also engage in the use of hieroglyphs which would be written on the structures, tombs, and other artifacts that they constructed and carried.
The obedient, mindless, slave-like nature of the Massassi comes from the times when they were enslaved or forced to work under the command of many notable individuals such as Ajunta Pall, Naga Sadow, and Exar Kun.
Due to their admiration of the masters that they served under, this warrior race would eventually take their own responsibility of formulating a tradition and belief in order to also gain that same admiration they had for their leaders.

# History (The Hundred-Year Darkness):

It is widely believed that the Massassi first would originate on Korriban considering the planet of Korriban was the very location where most Sith had come from.
The ancient history of this warrior race is unknown, it can also be presumed that they were around during the first Rakata invasions on Korriban and fled the planet with the Sith King.
Around 7000 BBY began the period in which this primitive species would start its descent into utter loyalty and obedience.
During this time, the Dark Jedi would make their arrival on the planet Korriban where the native Sith congregated within.
With the extreme prowess in The Force that these new arrivals demonstrated to the Sith, all of its natives praised the Dark Jedi and would commit themselves to serving Ajunta Pall along with the rest of his exiled fellows that practiced the Dark Side.
As interbreeding became more common among the Sith with the help of biotechnology and alchemy, the Massassi also were involved in this process which could provide an explanation as to why they started to lose some of their warrior nature.
Ajunta Pall and his followers would rule over the Sith and would make great use of the Massassi–making them the bulk of the Sith Empire’s military forces.

# History (The Great Hyperspace War)

In 5000 BBY, the Sith Lord Naga Sadow would utilize the Massassi in a series of battles to fight the Galactic Republic.
Despite the extreme prowess of Naga Sadow and his loyal sect of warriors, he had lost the Second Battle on Korriban which resulted in him exiling himself to Yavin.
Some Massassi would remain on Korriban in order to provide cover for Naga Sadow’s escape.
Those that were the most loyal to Naga Sadow would flee the planet alongside him to congregate on Yavin.
Upon the moon of Yavin 4, Sadow sought to extend the lengths of his power by conducting a series of cruel experiments on his own gathering of loyal Massassi followers.
This time period would mark the point in history where this species would begin their transformation into the abominations that gave them their witless behavior.
Even after all the pain, suffering, and complications they faced as a result of the brutal experiments they underwent, the Massassi would still choose to follow and praise Naga Sadow as a God.
Temples and other constructions such as the Massassi Temples from these primitive beings were still erected regardless of their unintelligent status as abominations due to the inspiration they had from the examples set by their masters.

# History (Sith War):

During 3997 BBY, Exar Kun would make himself known on Yavin and would enslave the Massassi just as many have done previously.
Knowing that these atrocities held good engineering and construction skills, he would order these beasts to build a multitude of temples that would be used for Sith tradition, principles, and other forms of enlightenment of dark knowledge.
Just like Naga Sadow, Exar Kun also did experiments on the Massassi slaves to produce a Golden Globe that would allow him to trap the children of these slaves into this artifact in order to drain their life essence.
Sometime within the Sith War, Exar Kun had evaporated the life of the majority of the Massassi to allow himself to pull his spirit from his body as an escape tactic to flee from the Jedi.
As a result, this would lead to the near extinction of these warrior Sith.
The ones that survived would continue to live a normal life, unguided, doing as they please.
Though, there remained others that would seek revenge against the Jedi, Republic, and even the Sith that used them as weapons of destruction for their own benefits.
