# Appearance
The Sando aqua monster was a monstrous creature with a body length reaching anywhere from 160 - 200 meters long; anything larger or shorter was rather uncommon for the species.
This species was not sentient, yet despite all of these factors, they managed to stay hidden within the traditional oceanic territories they preferred to be in.
Being this large meant they were muscular by nature with most survivors who have seen one stating they had a feline figure and four limbs ending with long, sharp claws.
Of these limbs, the front two arms of the creature ended with hands that the creature could use to grasp any prey they deemed fit.
The size of their mouths were capable of swallowing most creatures in a single bite.
Their teeth were also razor-sharp, resulting in them being the only predators that could physically break an opee sea killer’s shell.
These monstrous creatures had the capability of living for 100 standard galactic years.

# History
Sando aqua monsters originated from the planet Naboo, where the interconnected core of water tunnels made the perfect spot for the Sando aqua monsters to live and as a result, the monsters did not float up to shallower waters very often.
This had been proven by natives of Naboo such as the Gungans, many have never even seen a living Sando aqua monster, only spotting ones that have died and washed up to shore.
Consequently, the Sando aqua monster was more of a horrific myth than an actual threat to any of the residents.
A more notable point in history for these creatures was when Sith Lord Darth Vader single-handedly killed one that a group of rebels had summoned after they had tricked him into going into an underwater tunnel.
This event was the first-ever recorded instance of someone killing one of these beasts.
This single kill had a theorized 83% chance of causing the species’ extinction as the rarity in these creatures was slim to none.
