# Overview
Since The Sith Order’s foundation on the 6th August of 2021, an astonishing plethora of changes have occurred throughout this first year together.
The following section is a timeline encompassing the history of our order going from the August of 2021, when the group itself was founded, to the August of 2022, when Dathomir’s release has now opened a new chapter in our glorious story.

# The timeline
Before The Foundation - Origins
The Sith Order group belonged to the roblox user Bakyl before being bought by Fedlz.
Afterwards, Fedlz proceeded to give the group ownership to TiberiusMalvern, the original TKG’s founder and, to this day, the group’s owner.
Fedlz would be the Order’s Dark Lord of the Sith until the future ascension of Vermened.


August 6, 2021 - The Sith Order is Founded
Founded by the then named TiberiusHerminius (now called TiberiusMalvern) and led by Fedlz, the Sith Order’s group itself is opened.
Meanwhile, the Jedi Order group had already been founded by Tiberius in April of 2020, with Ossus acting as their home.
During this time, the Sith Order was still in its first stages and barely organized: its only function being the creation of a raiding team on Ossus.
Fedlz’s second-in-command would be the user KentuckySquid, who held the rank of “Wrath of the Dark Lord”, which is the equivalent of Powerbase today.

August 28, 2021 - The Sith Order’s Discord server is created
Made by the then Wrath of the Dark Lord, KentuckySquid, all TSO operations were moved from just a 10-member discord groupchat to a proper server.


August 29, 2021 - The Dark Council is formed and the first sphere is created
This sphere would be known as the “Sphere of Technology”, a sphere without any actual functions in-game, but instead made to house and coach any aspiring developers for the Order: it would be overseen by Darth Falskaar, Jensennix, who officially became the first Dark Council member.


August 30, 2021 - The Dark Honor Guard and Laws & Justice are created
The Dark Honor Guard is first created, with SanctusTenebris as its Commandant.
Additionally, the Sphere of Laws & Justice is made, with PerseusMalvern as its first Overseer.
On the same day, the first ever Sith uniforms were released by KaiJustiss, which would be Darth Maul Cloak, Sith Raider, and the original DHG Uniform.


September 4, 2021 - The sphere of Technology is dissolved
After a big enough roster of developers was found for TKG, it was deemed appropriate to dissolve the Sphere of Technology.
Its Overseer, Darth Falskaar, transferred to Laws & Justice and changed his name to Darth Mortis.


September 5, 2021 - The sphere of Sith Doctrine is created
This rather short-lived sphere focused on the creation and enforcement of a Doctrine of the Sith would have JosephAlzeratus, known as Darth Etreum, as its first Overseer.
 

September 8, 2021 - First Sphere Reformation
The Sith Order started using a five-sphere system, bringing the Dark Council’s seats to seven (five Overseers, the Dark Lord Fedlz, and the Wrath of the Dark Lord KentuckySquid): 
Laws & Justice - Jensennix 
Sith Philosophy - JosephAlzeratus
Military Command - Adolobe
Ancient Knowledge and Expansion & Diplomacy were left vacant for the time being.


October 26, 2021 - Vermened becomes the new Dark Lord of the Sith
On that day, Vermened would ascend to the throne as our new Dark Lord.
This marked a new era of organization and stability for our Order - as Vermened has been our Dark Lord ever since.
The day after, he would begin to seek for worthy Overlords to fill each sphere of influence.
Many view this as the day on which The Sith Order was reborn as a whole.

October 27, 2021 - The original spheres are established
All the old spheres and their leaders were cleared, as well as the Wrath of the Dark Lord.
The following four spheres would then be made, the new Overlords joining the ranks of the Dark Council:
1 Expansion & Diplomacy - KannaexMalvern 
2 Ancient Knowledge - Notom
3 Sith Philosophy - xLiamint
4 Laws & Justice - ArgusOtto
Together with the presence of a separate Dark Honor Guard division, with LucifersWrath as Commandant.


November 12, 2021 - The Sith Enclave is released
As the Sith finally get a place to call home, our Order becomes closer and closer to how we know it today.
On that same day, TSO’s Notion was also released.


November 30, 2021 - The Rite of the Kaggath is created
Over the course of the following months, Kaggaths would become a vital tradition for the Sith, and a way of rising to power for many individuals: some notable examples will be CeasarTemenos obtaining a place in the Dark Lord’s Powerbase by defeating KennaexMalvern, and SlenderMalvern earning a Dark Council seat following the forfeit of xLiamint.


December 16, 2021 - LucifersWrath retires from Commandant
LucifersWrath leaves the order, ending up being the last Dark Honor Guard’s commandant.
From there on, the highest rank achievable by a DHG member would become the equivalent of Darth, therefore removing DHG from the Dark Council.


December 17, 2021 - The first Dark Lord’s Powerbase member is chosen
The rank of Powerbase is created, with KennaexMalvern going down in history as its first member, taking the role of “Hand of the Dark Lord”.
One of his duties was to also oversee the Dark Honor Guard and give them a voice in the Dark Council.


December 18, 2021 - The Sphere of Defense & Security is introduced
The D&S sphere is introduced, being one of the first spheres that was not taken from Star Wars canon.
With reyrosky as its Overlord, this widely liked and creative sphere quickly became prominent within the Order.


January 14, 2021 - The Sphere of Mysteries is introduced
The Sphere of Mysteries is first introduced: this highly secretive and discreet small sphere would have Morsaki as its Overlord for almost the duration of the whole sphere.


January 16, 2022 - The second Dark Lord’s Powerbase member is chosen
The second Powerbase spot is occupied by Notom, who advances from being the Ancient Knowledge’s first Overlord to becoming the first “Will of the Dark Lord”.


January 17, 2022 - The Sphere of Ancient Knowledge is dissolved
Following the ascension of Notom to the rank of Powerbase and the vacancy of the seat of Ancient Knowledge’s Overlord, it was deemed appropriate to dissolve the sphere and instead assign their duties to the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.

February 27, 2022 - CaesarTemenos successfully kaggaths KennaexMalvern
After a stunning rank kaggath between the then Sith Lord CaesarTemenos and the Hand of the Dark Lord KennaexMalvern, Caesar would triumph and secure a place in the Dark Lord’s Powerbase as the new Hand of the Dark Lord.


March 5, 2022 - The Order of the Loremaster is opened
The Sith Order’s first ever division is opened under the oversight of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.
They would take on the past Ancient Knowledge’s duties, allowing the Sphere of Sith Philosophy to focus more on the hosting of trainings.


April 10, 2022 - The Sphere of Mysteries is dissolved
The Sphere of Mysteries follows the fate of AK, being dissolved while its duties are reorganized.



April 17, 2022 - The sphere of Defense & Security is decommissioned
On what went down in History as a very, very dark day for the Sith Order, the sphere of Defense & Security was decommissioned as a whole.
Some of its members transferred to the sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy, while others left the order as a whole.
Regardless, the disband of D&S was still an unfortunate event for all those who were fond of the sphere, and the possibility of its return is still fiercely debated and discussed to this day.


April 18, 2022 - The Order of the Oracle is opened
The Sith Order’s second division opens under the oversight of the Sphere of Laws & Justice, known as The Order of the Oracle, taking on SoM’s duties.
As a result, many former SoM members transferred over to L&J.

April 19, 2022 - The Order of the Immortal is opened
The Sith Order’s third division opens under the oversight of the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy, known as The Order of the Oracle.
This elite fighting division housed the greatest of TSO’s duelists for a brief time.

May 8, 2022 - The removal of Orders, and the great return of SoM and AK
With a large rank reform, the Order of the Immortal, Order of the Loremaster, and Order of the Oracle are removed, Inner Circle seats reduced, Lord ranks in spheres removed, but most importantly, the Sphere of Mysteries and the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge make their return.
As a result all spheres return to the original roster of the start of Vermened’s era, except with the addition of Mysteries.
This five-sphere system was considered highly efficient, and remains the same to this day.

May 12, 2022 - Sith Academy is opened under SoP
The Sith Academy opens, allowing those not part of SoP to contribute to training hosting, to better face the great amount of new members the Order was getting on a daily basis.
As of today, it’s currently the only division outside of DHG that hasn’t been disbanded and still stands strongly.


June 1, 2022 - Notom, the Will of the Dark Lord, retires from the Order
He would proceed to become a Sith Wraith, and retire from the Sith Order after a great age of contribution and leadership.
On the same day, OmeqaVanquished, known as Darth Havok, would proceed to become the new Will of the Dark Lord, leaving vacant the seat of Overlord of L&J.




June 13, 2022 - CaesarTemenos, the Hand of the Dark lord, retires 
Following Notom, Caesar would also retire from his position as a member of the Dark Lord’s Powerbase.
On the same day, KennaexMalvern proceeded to return to his original rank of Hand of the Dark Lord.
No further changes to the Powerbase happened afterwards.


Epilogue - What the future holds 
It would be untrue to claim that our Order has reached its current point without many sacrifices, challenges and defeats: and yet here we are.
Despite many hardships, our Order currently has 21k members and counting, a stable leadership and organization, and a new temple to call home with much more content on the way.
