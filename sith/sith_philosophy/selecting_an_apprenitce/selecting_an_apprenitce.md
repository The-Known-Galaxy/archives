# Overview

A Sith must know this: Their Apprentice will kill them.
If this fact frightens a Sith, then the Sith Order has already suffered a fatal infection.
The existence of those Sith in the Order is not needed.
Their battle has already been lost.

# Details

A Sith Apprentice must grow in strength and skill until they can surpass the Master.
Anything else is regression.
Would you rather the Sith to  become like the kings of Shawken, whose dominion crumbled into ruin.
Or do you believe you will live forever?
You are not wrong to cover that secret, as Darth Bane himself has sought to prolong his own life.
But in the extreme, this leads to narcissism and a lack of focus on the Rule of Two.
To be a Sith is to outthink your enemies and to plan for any eventuality.
A proper Apprentice will ensure that the Sith endure, no matter what fate may come upon the Master’s head.

Many Force Sensitive beings exist among the stars.
The Sith must seek out those who have not yet been discovered or subjected to Jedi corruption.
It’s easier to mold the young, for their bodies and minds are still in flux.
It is better to train several candidates at once.
Their rivalries will force their essential natures to the surface, making it unlikely they will join forces against their Master.
A Master should always tell them that only one will survive to become their Apprentice.
Let them defeat one another in combat, betray one another in their sleep, or play with one’s suspicions and tensions.
All are admirable skills for a future Sith Lord.
Then watch as they destroy one another.
The talented and ambitious will receive their reward, the rest will taste only ashes.
