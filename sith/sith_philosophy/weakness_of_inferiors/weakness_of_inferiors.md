# Overview
The Sith Empire has only begun to be built.
But its foundation is the anger of the Dark Side.
Although the mindless subjects know nothing of this shadowy majesty, the true power of the Empire originates with its Emperor.
The promises laid out by the Rule of Two have been fulfilled.
The Sith have been brought to glory and the Jedi to destruction.

# Details
As Darth Bane and Mother Talzin (head of the Nightsisters) knew, the weakness of inferiors is self-evident.
The weak do not understand the Force.
They are ignorant and lack power, but they may still be exploited for gain.
No ruler can manage an entity as complex as the populated galaxy without knowing how to manipulate others.

Fear is the spark that drove every Darth’s march to power.
Even now it fuels the engine of this Empire.
The weak must be trained to fear the consequences of betrayal.
They must dread that their neighbor’s loyalty is greater than their own.
The anxious will whip themselves into hysterical nationalism, without further prompting.
For fear is self perpetuating.
The weak live in terror that they will be judged for their failings and be put on display, that they will be punished.
It is a belief that should not be discouraged.
