# Introduction
The ritualistic duel dubbed the ‘Kaggath’ is a ceremonial form of battle to the death that dates back to the time of Sith tribes waging cruel warfare over the territory of Korriban.
The practice would be maintained by the Sith as one of their oldest traditions and would make for devastating appearances throughout galactic history.

# Part I: Rules
The rules behind a Kaggath are quite vague, allowing each participant a wide variety of methods to succeed.
Despite the tradition of the Kaggath being ancient, it is one of the few traditions taken very seriously by all Sith.
The rules of the Kaggath can never be broken.


Participants may not request aid from outside of their resources.
This would mean that a Sith could not approach another Sith outside of their network of associates for assistance.
However, Sith could utilize any resource they did have.
Such as fleets, armies, apprentices, fellow Sith who serve them, and more.
This would often result in destructive Kaggaths and could run the risk of sabotaging Sith activities by infighting, hence why the challenge of a Kaggath was rarely issued.


Kaggaths must be approved by the Dark Council.
This rule only applied during the existence of the Reconstituted Sith Empire.
This was likely to prevent large-scale infighting amongst the Sith Order that would likely involve large amounts of Imperial resources.



On the rare occasion that an individual would find themselves in breach of the rules, they would typically be executed for doing so by Sith not involved in the Kaggath to ensure the purity of the tradition.


Sith who win by forcing their opponent to surrender can choose to spare them or let them live in humiliation, though to prevent the possibility of their opponent taking any revenge, Sith would almost always execute their opponent.


Sith may also absorb the resources of their deceased or humiliated opponent, in the case of a lower ranked Sith being declared the victor, they would traditionally absorb their opponent’s rank as well.

The arguably worst condition a Sith may decide to use against their defeated opponent is the choice to completely wipe the records of their defeated opponents' existence.
This would often destroy the legacy of the Sith who lost.



# Part II: Notable Kaggaths
During the time of the Reconstituted Sith Empire, two Dark Councillors by the names of Darth Qalar and Darth Victun would fight a Kaggath against each other in the Imperial Citadel upon Dromund Kaas.
The damage caused to the Imperial Citadel was so horrendous that the remaining members of the Dark Council chose to execute both participants of the Kaggath.
The resources held by both Dark Councillors would be used in the reconstruction effort of the Imperial Citadel and the Dark Council would decide to wipe the records of both of their ex-colleagues.


Once again during the time of the Reconstituted Sith Empire, Darth Thanaton would challenge Lord Kallig to a Kaggath and would be defeated on Corellia.
As a result of this defeat, Darth Thanaton would flee Corellia and seek help from the Dark Council on Korriban.
Knowing this to be in direct violation of the Kaggath’s rules, Darth Thanaton was then promptly executed by Darth Mortis, his fellow on the Dark Council.
Lord Kallig would then assume Darth Thanaton’s place upon the Dark Council and all of his resources.
