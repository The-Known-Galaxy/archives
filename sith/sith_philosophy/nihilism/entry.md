# Overview

Nihilism, is the belief that nothing has true existence and believing that everything is meaningless.
This philosophy would be cherished by one particular Sith Lord going by the name of Darth Nihilus.
The philosophy essentially focuses on being above all life believing that those below you had no meaning or purpose.
Most Sith however did not approve of nihilism as it turned out to have bad side effects and would be quite damaging to a sane and normal mind.

Darth Nihilus was considered to be one of the most powerful Sith Lords throughout history with endless hunger making him constantly hungry and incredibly dangerous to others.
While the actual belief in nihilism didn't give the Sith Lord such great power the philosophy would only motivate and encourage him to consume more and more beings even going as far as consuming whole planets.
