# Overview

Other groups, like those of the Jedi and the Sith, use strange cold terms to describe the work of the spirits.
They talk of the unifying Force and the living Force of the Light Side and the Dark Side.
Nightsisters must forgive their ignorance, for they are not Shamans of Dathomir.
Their leaders cannot understand such concepts without enduring a trial such as theirs.

# Details

There is no need to separate what they call the living Force from the unifying Force.
Both are manifestations of the Twin Deities and both are vibrantly, overwhelmingly alive.
This classification of the Light Side and the Dark Side is also misguided.
Is it evil to kill?
Would those who answer yes be satisfied if predators starved so grazers could strip the land unopposed only to die amid famine?
Is this the bloodless utopia envisioned by the moralistic Jedi?
What the Jedi call the Dark Side, Nightsisters know to be the essence of life.
Even some of their witch clans have the same error as the Jedi, ignoring those spirits’ voices that call for blood and labeling them as evil.
Nightsisters should not concern themselves with the Dark Side or the Light Side.

The Nightsisters’ abilities were bestowed by the spirits.
The Winged Goddess and the Fanged God bestow the passive and aggressive energies that animate every creature and allow each to draw breath.

Do not limit your scope by obeying artificial rules.
