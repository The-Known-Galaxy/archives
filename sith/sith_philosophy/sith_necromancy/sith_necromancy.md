# Overview

Sith Necromancy is the act of reanimating the dead through the use of various ancient Sith rituals and magical spells that typically involves the use of Sith Alchemy.
Perhaps one of the rarest disciplines of Sith Magic; Sith Necromancy is considered one of the most dangerous practices to study and has often been outlawed even amongst the Sith throughout galactic history.

The most notable example of Sith Necromancy is that of the Korriban Zombies.
These undead creatures were created before 7000 BBY by the then Sith King of Korriban, Dathka Graush.
The Korriban Zombies would prove to be capable guardians of the many Sith tombs on Korriban and would lay dormant for many centuries unless disturbed.

Tsaiwinokka Hoyakut, or ‘’Reanimated Dead’’ as it is translated from ancient Sith, is the most common spell and method of raising the dead known to the Sith.
The spell would be created by Dathka Graush and would live on through the Chronicles of Sorzus Syn.
The spell would remain a part of Sith studies for thousands of years, with its most recent citing dating towards the start of the Clone Wars in 21 BBY.
