The Sith Chalice is a metallic incense burner used by the ancient Sith during initiation ceremonies and meditation rituals.
It was large and adorned red markings, a spiked lid, and four fin-like appendages protruding from the sides of the cup.
One of the rituals it was known for being used for was the Sith Fire Ritual.
The artifact was discovered during the Wolhanian expedition going to the Massassi ruins of Yavin 4.
It later fell into the hands of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, also known as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of the Republic.
The artifact was discovered during the Wolhanian expedition headed to the Massassi ruins of Yavin 4.
During the expedition they also found artifacts such as the Great Hyperspace War Bas-Relief.
The Chalice was said to have housed rare Korribanian incense.
Anyone with knowledge of the Dark Side of the Force would be able to identify the artifact.
In an act of mockery, Darth Sidious put the artifact on display in the Chancellor’s Suite on Coruscant.
