# Introduction

The Betrayal Philosophy refers to one who influences a person by controlling them.
They attack the victim or the victimâ€™s subordinate while using their advantage to protect those who are not expecting it, just like Anakin Skywalker, those who trusted him grew afraid of him.
This philosophy shows the intentions of those who were innocent and became those who were guilty.

Another historical character who used the betrayal philosophy was Lumiya.
Her philosophy resided around the dark side of the Force for the good of themselves.
Will it work in the end or will it destroy?
She said this so-called Darth Vectivus studied the dark side of the Force while maintaining a very human life by all standards: he had friends, family, a job, etc.
She also mentioned he used the Force in a very human manner.
But isn't that one of the pitfalls of the dark side?
They only do that which will benefit themselves, in other words, personal gain.
I mean, using Force to predict rival company's marketing strategies or influencing other people isn't ethical, is it?
With such great capabilities comes responsibility.
In any case, there's another mystery: Vergere.
Sure, her actions always seem justified in the end.
Practically everything she does has some type of justification attached to it.
So: if anyone were to disprove Lumiya's theory about the Sith being "good", one would have to attribute some of Vergere's actions to malevolent intent.
