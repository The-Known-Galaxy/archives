# Overview

Sith tattoos are an ancient ritualistic tradition dating back to the days of the early Massassi warriors on Korriban.
The tattoos themselves will mark an individual as a member of the Sith though they can be applied for a variety of reasons.

Made famous throughout galactic history by the legendary Darth Maul, Sith tattoos are an intimidating sight that often marks a tattooed Sith as particularly dangerous.

# The ritual

A Sith will typically be required to achieve some form of feat in their Master’s eyes before being granted the right to don Sith tattoos.
In the case of Darth Talon, she had fought her master in single combat and was deemed competent enough to receive the honour of Sith tattoos.
During earlier eras when Sith numbered in the thousands, it was often Sith Warriors and Academy graduates who would don the tattoos as a sign of power and capability.

The methods of applying Sith tattoos are all varied, though all are just as cruel as the next.
Poisons, chemicals, lightning, carving, dyes and even Sith bugs and creatures could all be used in the application of the tattoo.
This was often perceived as a way of proving one’s loyalty to the Sith as receiving the tattoos could be considered worse than torture and could take a considerable amount of time.

Darth Talon would have her tattoos applied via lightning by Darth Krayt, which caused her immeasurable pain in a short amount of time.
Darth Maul would spend days hanging from chains as his Master, Darth Sidious, would poke and prod him with needles to apply his tattoos.
Only two examples of a tradition dating back through thousands of years of Sith creativity.
