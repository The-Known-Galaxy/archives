Sith holocrons contained knowledge and lore of the Sith from generations of great and powerful Sith Lords.
Ancient Sith Holocrons were voraciously hunted by the Jedi and kept for their own protection against Sith learning even greater power.
The construction of a Sith holocron differed from Jedi holocrons in their innate necessity to capture and feed of off Dark Side energy, and the fact that each holocron had a Gatekeeper which contained a high amount of sentience and personality akin to the creator of the holocron itself.
Such as the case with Darth Revan’s holocron, Freedon Nadd’s Holocron, and Darth Bane’s holocron, only when one was deemed worthy by the Gatekeeper could one access the ancient knowledge and near-sentient teachings of the Sith.
The unworthy or determinations of heresy resulted in cold refusal and insults from the Holocron’s keeper.

The Rite of Commencement was a key factor in the construction of a Sith holocron, and was the process by which one’s cognitive essence was bound to the capstone and fueled with Dark Side energy to last for many millennia.
Only the most powerful Sith Lords imbued and in tune with dark energies could manage to navigate the web of the cognitive network that was designed to house and preserve the knowledge of the holocron’s creator.
Once the Rite was invoked and completed, one simply had to close the holocron and lock it in place to complete the long and arduous process.
While the inner networks and mechanics of the holocron are much the same as Jedi counterparts, the amount of Dark Side mastery and energy required to operate it was significant and therefore was able to corrupt even the most steadfast Jedi who may have become curious as to its contents.
