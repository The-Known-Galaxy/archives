# Introduction
The Dark Side has at times been described as a roaring fire, wicked to behold and seductive to harness.
It is the untapped potential of all things which crave power and is the pathway by which the Sith Order posits itself as powerful warriors and cunning strategists.
The Light teaches those who follow it to serve as docile golems - to submit to the Force and allow it to flow like the strong current of a river.
The Dark Side is anathema to this in requiring one to dominate it and take hold of it as one would a tool of combat to allow the Force to fuel your power without allowing it to overwhelm you.
This is the fundamental difference in the natures of the Force - one must break their chains and take their destiny into their own hands to truly grasp why the Sith follow the Dark Side, and why the Light holds you back.

# Nature of the Dark Side
What many in the Jedi Order fail to understand of the Sith is that use of the Dark Side is a means to an end; each Sith likely has goals and ambitions of their own that they seek to fulfill within the Order, and the power to do so lies in their own hands.
Many are simply drawn to it naturally as emotional and idealistic beings.
There is nothing inherently ‘evil’ about the Sith, it is simply that those who seek to repress emotion, passion, and craving naturally see those who encourage these traits as an enemy.
The Jedi believe that the Force is a power in and of itself, with a will and morality, while the Sith view it as a means to power and glory.
There can be no peace without action, and the peace of the Jedi is therefore a lie.



# Fear of the Dark Side
The Jedi fear the Dark Side as a child fears the dark and silent places of their home -  it is an unknown variable that cannot be controlled without either overcoming one's own innate aversion or by assistance of an outside force - a light for example.
The same can be said of the Force: Jedi fear that they will lose control over those who they allow to explore all aspects of the Force.
They fear the freedom that comes with breaking one’s chains and seeking victory at all costs, for this victory deprives them of their artificial peace and perverse necessity for unearned respect to the Masters of the Order.

The Jedi profess equality but strip it from those who deviate from a chosen and set path, they offer harmony yet sow discord through deprivation of attachment and emotion - of the central aspect of sentience.
They claim a higher understanding of the Force while refusing to study every aspect of what it has to offer the individual, opting rather for cowardice and inaction in the face of new discoveries.
The Jedi fear knowledge of these realities as they lead to individuality and competition, which is in conflict with their Code.
The Sith have no such reservations, and this fear simply serves the will of the Order as a motivator and a pathway to anger at one’s own lack of ability.
