# Introduction
Hatred is commonly asserted with the Sith, and moreover, with the dark side of the Force.
Hatred is a mixture of passion, anger, and aggression that the Sith play upon as a form of fuel.
The Force can be used as a source of power that is operated by the emotional state of the user.
When a Force user taps into their hatred and allows it to consume their emotions, they can access a quick and powerful form of the Force that allows them to use their hatred to their advantage.
This is why the dark side is often easier to grasp in contrast to the light side of the Force.

Sith, strive for “ultimate power” no matter the cost; therefore, they use hatred as a philosophy.
However, there is no denying that most who seek it do not achieve it due to them being overtaken by their hatred, which ultimately leads to their downfall; hence why the Jedi believe hatred leads to suffering.
Nevertheless, there is a way to achieve ultimate power through hatred.

In simple terms, Force users must master their hatred rather than make hatred their master.
