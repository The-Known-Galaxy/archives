# Overview
The Grand Plan was a plot started by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Bane, after the Seventh Battle of Ruusan.
This scheme was created to eradicate the Jedi and the Galactic Republic from the galaxy so the Dark Side would govern it.
The Grand Plan was successful after the Great Jedi Purge occurred as they left the galaxy with no members of the Jedi Order.

# History
Following the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, the recent Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Bane, thought about a new plan to take revenge against the Jedi Order for almost exterminating the Sith.
This plan wouldn’t be executed instantly because the Sith were weak, and new technology was needed to reach his goal; eradicate the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic.
Due to the Sith being only two because of Darth Bane’s Rule of Two, he and the next generation of Sith had to work in secret.

This plan was already in danger because a Sith known as Darth Gravid almost turned to the Light Side of the Force, but was stopped and killed by Darth Gean, his Sith Apprentice.
As well, Darth Tenebrous’ Sith Master made the Jedi Order feel the Dark Side of the Force by opening a hole in the Force, letting them know the Sith were still alive.

One of the most important events from this plan was the ascent of the Sith Apprentice known as Darth Sidious to Supreme Chancellor of the Republic.
This allowed the Sith to work on a political level in the order.
In 22 BBY, the Clone Wars started with the Battle of Geonosis.
The start of this war came along with great benefits for the Sith Empire, as many Jedi left their order because of a philosophical impact on them.
This happened because instead of keeping the peace, they did the opposite.

Two years after the Battle of Geonosis, the Order 66 was executed by Darth Sidious.
This protocol made the Clones turn against the Jedi Order because Darth Sidious activated their inhibitor chips.
Along with this, the Supreme Chancellor known as Palpatine or Darth Sidious was going to get arrested by 4 Jedi Masters.
These Jedi Masters went to his office, but all of them were killed by the Emperor.
During this showdown, a Jedi Knight known as Anakin Skywalker turned to the Dark Side to become the Emperor’s Sith Apprentice, being named as Darth Vader.
Darth Sidious then ordered Darth Vader to command the 501st legion in an attack on the Jedi Temple.
Following this event, the Jedi were purged from the galaxy.
What was remaining was conquering the Galactic Republic.
In 19 BBY, Darth Sidious announced the New Order and declared himself the Galactic Emperor.
Darth Sidious had completed Darth Bane’s plan, as the Jedi Order was eliminated.
