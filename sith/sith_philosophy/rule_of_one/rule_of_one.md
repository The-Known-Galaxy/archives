# Introduction
The Rule of One was one of the most dangerous Philosophies of the Sith Order, this Rule was known to be ruled by the One Sith a Dark Lord of the Sith who all of the Sith must obey and gain their undying loyalty or be eliminated from the face of the galaxy.
This Rule was created by the great Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Krayt and would be well deserved of the title as he was so powerful he could attempt to cheat death.

# The Rule of One
The system was very interesting compared to the Rule of Two but the many Hopefuls, Acolytes, Knights and Lords would have to prove their worth by showcasing loyalty to the Dark Lord of the Sith and do as he says at all times or be eliminated by his Lightsaber.
Many Apprentices would attend their Trials and once completed they would be assigned to finish their ascension by striking down their former master resulting in their true and final allegiance to the Dark Side.



# The Fall
The final days of the Rule of One was unfortunately not found in the History of the Galaxy however the fall was ended by the Sith of the Rule of One who would go into hiding again due to the defeat of Darth Krayt.
However this Sith Order was never confirmed to be defeated and would eventually be known as the strongest Sith Order due to their rising numbers and their powerful Dark Lord of the Sith.
The Fall happened at the Battle of Coruscant and would be a legendary battle, Darth Krayt would eventually be eliminated and his body taken out from the power of the sun.
