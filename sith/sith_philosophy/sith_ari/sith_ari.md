# Introduction
Much like the Jedi Order, the Sith are beings of prophecy and belief and hold a variety of titles, relics and prophecies as sacred.
One title held in this manner is that of the ‘Sith’ari’.
The title would be used to denote the leader of Sith society during the days of ancient Sith tribes fighting over territory on Korriban.
Though for many thousands of years the title would never come into use.

# Prophecy
The prophecy surrounding the title is based upon the belief that a ‘perfect’ Sith would one day emerge to not only rule, but to destroy and later rebuild the Sith under an image of perfection.
A being who is truly free and unrestricted in their power and capable enough to rise through the ranks of the Sith and prove formidable enough to destroy them.


The prophecy is fairly comparable to that of the ‘Chosen One’ believed by members and associates of the Jedi Order, though the fact that both organisations have such a prophecy is where the similarities end.



# Mantra of the Sith'ari
The Sith’ari Prophecy

‘’The Sith’ari will be free of limits.’’
‘’The Sith’ari will lead the Sith and destroy them.’’
‘’The Sith’ari will raise the Sith from death and make them stronger than before.’’

- Recorded by Sorzus Syn

The title would achieve religious significance through the Kissai; Sith Priests who would ensure the prophecy would survive the ages by telling the tale verbally, refusing to write it down due to its sacred background.
It would not be until the arrival of Sorzus Syn and the Dark Jedi Exiles that the prophecy would first be documented and sealed as part of the future of the Sith.



# The 'Worthy'
Very few individuals would ever gain enough power to claim the title of Sith’ari, though many would try.
In galactic history there are only three known Sith who would believe themselves to be the Sith of prophecy.



# Legacy of the Title
Despite widespread belief in the Sith’ari prophecy during the early days of the Sith Empire, by 4980 BBY, during the rise of the Reconstituted Sith Empire, the title and its mythology would all but diminish.
The title of Sith’ari by definition implies that the Sith must be destroyed in order to be reborn again, however, very few Sith would like to be the ones involved in this Sith Purge, and so it would overtime become more apparent to Sith Lords that the worship or dictation of the Sith’ari might in fact be very dangerous for them.


The title and prophecy would remain well known throughout all of Sith history, however it would rarely be claimed or play any significant role beyond the era of King Adas.
