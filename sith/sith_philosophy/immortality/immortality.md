# Overview
Immortality, or also known as eternal life, is a way of living forever without ever dying.
Darth Plagueis, who was a Sith Lord in the couple years before the Clone Wars that would happen, had been lusting for immortality.
His apprentice, Darth Sidious, had manipulated the midichlorians so they could create both life and immortality.
The ones who followed the light side of the Force and the ones who had appropriate training could get a form of immortality by retaining their own consciousness after their physical deaths.
The Jedi Master known as Qui-Gon Jinn, had discovered this immortality ability; he in turn, taught Jedi Master Yoda and his apprentice that time, Obi-Wan Kenobi, how to attain this ability.
Anakin Skywalker had also done and accomplished this state of immortality, with his children, Luke Skywalker and Leia Skywalker Organa Solo, having done the same many years later.

# Part I
Darth Sidious had been able to cheat his death when he died by transferring his soul and spirit into a clone human body while he fell into the reactor core of the second Death Star.
Sidious had longed to extend his existence with an unsuccess attempt of controlling his granddaughter, Rey, into killing him so he could live on by possessing Rey’s body.
