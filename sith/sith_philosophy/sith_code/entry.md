# Introduction

The code of the Sith has remained largely unchanged for the entirety of the history of the Sith, starting with Sorzus Syn and the Hundred-Year Darkness and continuing through the Rule of Two.
The direct contrast and conflict with the Jedi code is evident in the first line: Peace is a lie.
The Jedi serve the Force, while the Sith dominate it and use it to fuel their ambitions.
This is the essential truth of the Sith Code, and should be known and understood by every member of the Order.

# 'Peace is a lie, there is only passion.'

‘Peace is a lie, there is only passion.’
Conflict is the truth of existence, and this conflict stems from the passions of living things.
Peace is stagnation and apathy towards the universe; strife and struggle is the source of progress for every being and civilization throughout recorded history.
The deepest nature of the Sith is that of craving, and this craving cannot exist with peace.

# 'Through passion I gain strength'

‘Through passion, I gain strength.’
Lust for power and the passion to guide one’s journey towards it is an essential tenet of being Sith.
Nature is a story of predation on the weak; only those with strength may survive to fight another day.
Every creature has passions, and to be devoid of these passions is to rob oneself of strength.

# 'Through strength, I gain power'

‘Through strength, I gain power.’
To be strong is to be at the pinnacle of your potential.
Power is a natural byproduct of this state, and when individual Sith are strong, they may draw on power to break through barriers and subdue their opposition.
Strength is a means to an end, and the strength of the individual contributes to the overall power of the Sith Order and the goals of the Council.

# 'Through power, I gain victory'

‘Through power, I gain victory.’
There is no defeat for a Sith, there is only humiliation and a loss of power.
All Sith seek to earn victory, and it is vital to obtain the immense quantity of respect and obedience required from those under them.
To be powerful is to inherently be at the highest of positions, and therefore worthy of victory and respect.
To lose is to let these qualities slip away, which is a fate worse than death should one be unable to overcome its sting.

# 'Through victory, my chains are broken.

The Force shall free me.'
‘Through victory, my chains are broken.’
‘The Force shall free me’
The Dark Side is what defines a Sith.
Their mastery of their emotions to control the Force, their power and strength to subdue their enemies and to seek glory and victory, all of these ends are a result of their channeling of the Dark Side.
There is no opposition from equals at the very top, only those under you may levy a challenge.
You are released from the chains of the hierarchy and may forge your own path.
The Dark Side is a path to freedom and control; your potential is limitless and your power unequaled.
