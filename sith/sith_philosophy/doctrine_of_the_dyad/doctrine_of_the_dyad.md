The Doctrine of the Dyad was a prophecy based around a rare everlasting Force-bond between two Force-Sensitives also known as a Force dyad, a stronger version (both physically and mentally) of a Force bond.
This prophecy was the ancestor of the Sith philosophy Darth Bane’s Rule of Two.
Although the Rule Of Two’s philosophy defended the Sith for a while, it was later declared by Darth Sidious that the Rule of Two was nothing more than a fake, a counterfeit of Doctrine of the Dyad.


Sidious wasn’t the only one who thought that this is a great prophecy, the Sith Eternal’s ideals of the Doctrine of the Dyad was that it was significant and would lead the Sith order to flourish and thrive in the dark side of the Force.

The Sith tried to create a dyad through their determination but failed multiple times; Darth Plagueis tried to form one with his apprentice, Sidious, who also tried to have a force dyad too later on with his apprentice, Vader.

It took an enormous amount of time before a dyad that was known appeared and was formed between Kylo Ren and Rey, the descendants of Sidious and his apprentice.
Their strong dyad allowed them to communicate through the force at any given time, passing objects to one another, and the ability to use force heal instinctually while also healing each other as an alternative, at a cost of the user’s health.
Sidious heard about the occurrence between the pair and drained their force dyads to nourish his unstable body that was cloned during the battle on Exegol.

(Note: It was also important to note that Kreia and Meetra Surik might be able to be force dyads instead of force bonds, an example of this was during their events in the Sith Triumvirate ages, they were able to perceive each other's senses and thoughts.
In the game Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II, you were able to have Kreia in your party.
There was also a certain gameplay mechanic meaning that even if you didn’t have Kreia in your party she would happen to see through your choices every time and deem them.
It might be that way since the term of a force dyad wasn’t known during those times.)
