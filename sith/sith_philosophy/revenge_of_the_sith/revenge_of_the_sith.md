# Overview

Under the Rule of Two, the Sith will concentrate power in one Master and one apprentice so that one day they will reveal themselves to the Jedi.
Eventually, we will have our revenge.

Galactic civilization is an empty term when that civilization lacks leadership.
Given a clear vision and the means to enact it, a Sith regime could build great wonders in defiance of the natural laws of silence, stillness and ruin.
Kaan was a fool, but he was right in one thing: the laws of the old republic only abet these chaotic forces and only the Sith way leads to mastery over entropy.

The Jedi path teaches harmony and peace.
But if all we aspired to was harmony, then intelligent beings would still be scratching for food from rotted tree stumps.
The Dark Side of the Force is both an enabler and a guide.
To advance the cause of the Sith, you must fight those who hold back progress.
The Sith and those who succeed them, are building an arsenal of Dark Side potency.
One day it will contain the power to destroy the Jedi and bring purpose to the Force.

Remember the Code of the Sith: “Peace is a lie, there is only passion”.
In creating a new regime, the Sith will defeat the complacency of the Jedi and what they will create will be glorious.
