# Overview
The Rite of Blood and Bone was an ancient rite that was performed in the Sith Academy located on Korriban.
To complete the rite, an acolyte would enter a secret room and grab a skull out of a pile of bones.
Then, acolytes would bathe it in a pool of blood, summoning a mysterious creature known as “The Bloodfiend”.
Finally, for the acolyte to complete the rite successfully, they would have to prove their worth by defeating the monster.

# History
Throughout history, several Dark Lords performed the ritual of blood and bone.
Although at the time of the Galactic Cold War, Overseer Ragate was the keeper and administrator of the old ritual.
Additionally, both the heirs of Aloysius Kallig and Empire’s Wrath were thought to have completed the ritual under Ragate’s administration.
