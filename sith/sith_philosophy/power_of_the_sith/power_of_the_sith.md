The Force is not fire.
It cannot be passed from one user’s lit torch to another’s and another’s.
until an entire hemisphere is illuminated with a blaze of a million lights.
This is what Kaan foolishly believed and all Sith Lords before him for the past thousand years.

One Master must decide how that power shall be used.
Sharing power is an act of weakness and a violation of the Sith Code.
