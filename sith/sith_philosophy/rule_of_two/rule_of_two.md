# The Rule of Two
The Rule of Two is the name given to a Sith philosophy created by Darth Bane after conflict with the Jedi killed all the Sith Lords except for him.
Bane had seen how the infighting amongst the Sith had caused their defeat, so he developed the philosophy to prevent those factors in the future.


Darth Bane declared that there could only be two Sith Lords at any given time, a master and an apprentice.
The master was supposed to “embody” the power of the Dark Side, while the apprentice would “covet” that power.
The apprentice would train until he was strong enough to kill his master, at which point he would become even more powerful and take on an apprentice of his own.
Alternatively, a master could take on a new apprentice and have them kill the old one, taking the former apprentice’s place.
Through this process, each generation of Sith would be more powerful than the last, and the infighting that had previously plagued the Sith Order would hopefully cease to exist.

# Order of Sith Lords
Bane took on an apprentice named Darth Zannah and rebuilt the Sith while following the Rule of Two.
By following this rule, he deceived the Jedi and kept the Sith hidden, even after his death (possibly at the hands of Darth Zannah).
The Sith would continue to exist in secret for years until a Sith Master grew strong enough to take control of the Galaxy.
This master was Darth Sidious, apprentice of Darth Plagueis.



# Darth Sidious
Darth Plagueis and Darth Sidious worked tirelessly to learn everything there is to know about the force.
They were able to harness even more of the power of the Dark Side, including the power to triumph over death.
Later, Sidious took on a pupil named Darth Maul and killed Darth Plagueis, taking his place as master.
Darth Maul became Darth Sidious’s apprentice but was replaced by Darth Tyranus after a fatal duel with a Jedi Knight.

After decades of being followed, the Rule of Two was broken by Darth Tyranus, who took on an apprentice of his own without killing Darth Sidious.
Sidious had Tyranus kill his apprentice, only for him to take on yet another one.
After the death of the second apprentice, things were further complicated when Darth Maul reappeared, alive, and took on an apprentice of his own, creating two rivaling pairs of Sith Lords.
Sidious hunted this pair down and killed them, restoring the Rule of Two.
Later, Darth Tyranus was killed by Anakin Skywalker who became Darth Sidious’s new apprentice: Darth Vader.



# Darth Vader
In the years that followed this, the Sith finally came out of hiding.
Darth Vader became powerful and respected as the Galactic Empire grew.
Darth Sidious, taking the role of Emperor, continued to mentor Vader and used him to help conquer the Galaxy.
When Vader learned of the existence of his son, Luke Skywalker, he began plotting to turn Luke to the Dark Side and replace Darth Sidious as master with Luke as his apprentice.
Eventually, Luke was brought before Darth Sidious who caused them to fight, trying to have Luke replace Vader as his apprentice, however, this fight ended with Vader killing Sidious and then dying.
With no more Sith Lords left alive, the Sith were presumed extinct once more.
However, Darth Sidious was not dead.



# Snoke, Ren, and Rey
Using the powers gained from Darth Plagueis, Darth Sidious revived himself into a new body and set about trying to find an apprentice once more.
This time he used a clone, Snoke, to coax Ben Solo towards the dark side.
Snoke took on Ben Solo as an apprentice who took the name, Kylo Ren.
Ren would eventually kill Snoke, ascending to master, however, because he did not kill Sidious, Sidious remained master as well.
Darth Sidious had used a loophole in the Rule of Two to allow Ren to ascend to master without Sidious having to be killed.
Sidious would eventually try to recruit his granddaughter Rey Palpatine as his new apprentice, but she rejected his offer and destroyed him.
During this battle, Kylo Ren gave up his life to heal Rey, redeeming his soul and supposedly ending the Sith once and for all.
