# Introduction
Sith was the name of the language originated and used by the native species of the Sith on Ziost and Korriban.
Opposed to many other languages, the Sith language formed words through the integration of words or phrases to construct sentences with great meaning.
Many other dialects existed within this form of communication such as Massassi and Balc speech as well as other forms of writing.
In spite of the more common languages such as Galactic Basic Standard, this ancient tongue is speculated to have remained in use since the post-imperial era, yet there remain the many possibilities that it may have been used for even longer periods of time.

# History
Since all of its time, the Sith language was spoken only by the Sith Purebloods that resided within the Sith Worlds.
It remained unchanged for quite some time, that is until the Dark Jedi exiles arrived on the planet Korriban and chose to enslave the Sith species for their own benefit.
The verbilization was able to keep its primitive nature, yet was altered by Ajunta Pall and his followers in order to represent a founded Sith Order.
In order for the Dark Jedi to understand and translate the form of speaking of the Sith, they forged translation talismans which allowed them to more fluently decipher the writing and words of the Sith language as if it was their nature.
Sorzus Syn, a Dark Jedi that studied the Sith devised a series of different philosophies and writings in Sith Language such as the Code of the Sith, also known as Qotsisajak entirely written in Basic.


Thousands of years later in 5000 BBY, the Sith Dreadnaught known as Omen crash-landed on the planet Kresh.
The red Sith on board at the time made desperate attempts to repair the ship for flight into space but were unsuccessful.
Despite their failure, they were forced to influence the native Kreshiri species who, just like the Sith did with the Dark Jedi, looked up to them as their gods.
Realizing that they could not return, the Sith formed the Lost Tribe of the Sith and constructed a temple on Kresh to further establish their dominance.
Due to this event, the Sith language saw few adjustments and would be known as the “Old Tongue” to the Lost Tribe of the Sith.


The writings and dialect of the Sith language were preserved in holocrons throughout history, yet many failed to translate its contents.
Only a select few had been capable of translation and even pronunciation of the different phrases and words that were present in this ancient form of speaking.
Darth Bane, a notable Sith Lord that founded the Rule of Two, learned from these holocrons during his time in the Sith Academy so that he could enlighten himself with Sith knowledge in order to grow his strength also going as far as learning from the dead Sith Lords before him, bounded within the tombs.



# Massassi Language
Massassi was a primitive dialect of the Sith language used by the warrior caste known as the Massassi, which was later replaced by Sith especially seen within the Books of Massassi.
Symbols and other forms of writing did not always translate to the usual Galactic alphabets.



# Accent
This tongue consisted of 23 different speech sounds, the majority of which were obstruents.
The obstruents would be known as:
 [  /t/, /d/, /k/, /q/, /m/, /n/, /ts/, /dz/, /s/, /z/, /h/, /t??/,/j/ /?/, [?/l], /w/, /?/.
] 

Graphemic system represented these terms as: 
[ t, d, k, q, m, n, ts, dz, s, z, h, ch, j, sh, r/l, w, y.]

Just like plenty of other forms of speech in the galaxy, the Sith language expressed a total of 6 clear vowels:

[ â, i, û, o, a, u, ]

Examples of Pronunciation:

â = Crash

i = Fleet

û = Pub

o = Erode

a = Kumumgah 

u = Pursuit
