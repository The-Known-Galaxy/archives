# Introduction

Sith magic, also referred to as Sith sorcery, was the arcane usage and channeling of dark Force abilities which were first developed and practiced by the Sith people of Korriban.
The Dark Jedi exiles who enslaved the species millenia ago and founded the Sith Orders combined these alchemical and magical rituals with their own mastery of the Force to bring forth advanced techniques which had scant been touched since the time of the Rakata.
Force lightning, dark-side healing, necromancy, and the imbuement of weapons and artifacts with immense power were all domains of Sith magic and alchemy, and have been discovered, lost, and rediscovered countless times spanning the history of every Sith Order to have ever existed.
Notable practitioners, such as Darth Sidious, Naga Sadow, Freedon Nadd, and Exar Kun were able to use these ancient rites and spells to enhance their own biotic sciences and dark side Force abilities to varying degrees of effect.

# The Nature of Sith Magic

The strength of Sith magic is derived from many of the same forces that empowered the Dark Side of Force powers, and in many ways were one and the same.
The Dark Jedi Exiles of the Hundred-Year Darkness incorporated many of the rites and magics of the Kissai priests into their own mastery of the dark side.
Sith sorcerers in subsequent eras and Orders also gained the knowledge to combine these spells with traditional Sith powers in the midst of battle to devastating effect.
These powers were especially effective at penetrating and warping a beings mind and perception of reality, making them far harder to defend against without full and unbridled concentration in combating the effects.
As such, in the heat of battle, many of those who fell to Sith magic were powerful Jedi and Force wielders, but simply did not have the mental fortitude to withstand such attacks.
The caveat being that such concentrated resistance also required equal concentration from the user, making them vulnerable to interruption or distraction.

# The Application of Sith Magic

The practitioners of Sith magic were focused on using its abilities to bring their ambitions to reality.
Some wielders focused on the mind-altering effects to turn the tides of major battles, while others used it to look inward and attempt to control life and death itself.
The applications were wildly varied, but the unifying reason for seeking out and controlling this power was to enhance one’s connection to the Dark Side and to pursue ever-growing power over others.
Many of the masters of the Sith, including Darth Bane and King Ommin of Onderon believed that Sith magic was the ultimate and maximum effect of dark side Force expression, and one could only attain such mastery through the breaking of an internal barrier and letting the Dark consume the individual - hatred of all things, even the Dark Side itself, were necessary to unlocking the true potential of Sith magic.
Sacrifice of control over the self to become a conduit of fel powers and abilities was a slim price for the most advanced of Masters, who had long ago pledged themselves fully to the secrets of the Dark Side of the Force.

# Artifacts and Rituals

Much of the strength that lay in the practice and innate ability of Sith magic were the rituals and incantations which made possible the powers used by its practicioners.
Monuments and obelisks, amulets and talismans, and even entire moons have been erected, crafted, and repurposed by the Sith sorcerers through the ages in order to act as a lodestone and focal center for their power and necessary rituals.
The Talisman of Muur, designed and crafted by Sorzus Syn for Lord Karness Muur held the ability to turn the minds of weaker beings into thralls of the amulet’s holder.
The first of many Great Amulets, it is among the most well known artifacts of Sith magic and alchemical practice at their zenith and point of combination.

# Temple on Yavin IV

The temple on Yavin IV was erected by Naga Sadow and his Massassi slaves to serve as a fortress and a centering point for the dark side energy by which he turned the Massassi into bestial slaves and predators.
Here he encased himself in a sarcophagus and waited nearly 600 years for a  worthy dark side practitioner to awaken him and renew the legacy of the Sith.
This power and longevity were the result of Sadow’s knowledge of Sith sorcery and alchemy, and served to illustrate the immense power of the dark side to Freedon Nadd, who awoke Sadow and slew him after learning all he could.
