# Overview
The Rule by the Strong was the name given to a Sith philosophy created by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Skere Kaan, following the events of the Sith Civil War.
This rule was adopted by Lord Skere Kaan’s Brotherhood of Darkness and Darth Millenial’s Dark Force religion.

# Information
This rule gave more power to the higher ranks within a Sith Order, making this philosophy a dictatorship for the lower ranks, who were weaker.
Every Dark Lord in the Sith Order had the same power, making it an equal rule for the governors.



# History
The Brotherhood of Darkness was the first Sith organization to adopt this new rule.
Skere Kaan tried to fix the mistakes of Darth Ruin’s Sith Empire by giving the Brotherhood of Darkness’ Sith Council an equal power.
Although every Sith Lord in Kaan’s Brotherhood of Darkness was powerful on their own, they couldn’t become stronger than the other because everyone was equal in the Brotherhood of Darkness, making the Dark Lords weaker.
Dark Lord of the Sith Skere Kaan’s point wasn’t proven successfully, as he and his Brotherhood of Darkness perished in the Seventh Battle of Ruusan after the projection of the Thought Bomb.
The Army of Light had defeated the Brotherhood of Darkness, however, there was one Sith left; Dessel.
Dessel, who would be known later as Darth Bane, saw the mistakes in Skere Kaan’s Brotherhood of Darkness, saying he turned his back on the teachings of the ancient Sith.
Due to Darth Revan’s teachings through his own Holocron, Darth Bane decided to create a new rule or philosophy called the Rule of Two.
This philosophy created by Darth Bane through Revan’s teachings allowed the Sith to work in secret, as they wouldn’t defeat the Republic and the Jedi Order through thousands of wars.
Bane’s new system allowed only two Sith at a time, a master and an apprentice.
The Sith Master was in charge of embodying the power, while the Sith Apprentice had to crave it.
Whenever the Sith Apprentice thought he was ready to become the Dark Lord, they would attempt to kill their master.
Kaan’s rule wouldn’t come to an end at all, because Darth Millennial followed his legacy after leaving his master, Darth Cognus, aside.
Millennial decided to follow the philosophy of the Rule by the Strong in his new Sith organization, known as the Dark Force cult.
