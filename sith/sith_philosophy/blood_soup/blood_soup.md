# Overview

Blood Soup is a traditional soup which was drunk by Sith.
They found this tradition when they encountered the dangerous Anzati species who would drink the soup from their prey to boost their strength in the Force.
Sith then believed that by drinking the blood of a force-sensitive species they would become more powerful with the Force.
Another reason they drank it was to honour the death of their enemies.
This tradition was especially used within the Brotherhood of Darkness during the New Sith Wars.
An example is when Githany offers the famous Darth Bane some Blood Soup after trying to poison him.
