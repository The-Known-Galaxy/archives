# Overview

A Master of the Sith is a Sith that has trained an apprentice.
The apprentice is expected to kill their master once they surpass their might and power.

# Description

Throughout the history of the Sith, this title has served as a testament to the power of a Sith, training their successor in the ways of the Dark Side.
During the time of Darth Revan, Sith Masters held the title of Sith Lord, although the strongest among them could rule as Dark Lord of the Sith.
Under Darth Bane’s “Rule of Two”, there was a principle in the Order of Sith Lords that the master and their apprentice held the same title.
This title of Master stood in complete parallel to its Jedi equivalent of Jedi Master, the light side counterparts of Sith Masters.
