# Introduction
Sith Overseers were an important title in the Sith Order.
As an Overseer, you were assigned to run the Sith Academy and manage the training and studies of the Acolytes looking to become powerful Sith and rise to the ranks of power.
Some Overseers were assigned with their Apprentices which they were the most helpful for, as they are mostly informed with the most knowledge of the Sith ways and were very helpful in becoming a future Sith Knight.

# Duties
Overseers were mostly assigned through the Sith Academy.
Many served to be Sith Lords but this was not a direct requirement.
Sith Overseers also had assistants known as the Assistant Overseers that helped them carry out their core duties.
The duties of a Sith Overseer consisted of running academic protocol and the training of the Academy’s Acolytes.
To do this, most of the Overseers assigned various tasks to the students at the academy to prove their worth.
Some of these included obtaining an ancient war blade, killing a beast as a Rite of Passage, or recovering an artifact of some sort.
As a reward, the Sith Overseers instructed the Acolytes for their efforts.
