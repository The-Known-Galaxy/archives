# Overview
Battlemaster was a title given to the combat instructor at the Sith Academy of Korriban.
The title was held by Kas’im at the end of the New Sith Wars.
The Sith’s Battlemaster knew every lightsaber form with skill beyond their years.
The Battlemasters of the Sith and the Battlemasters of the Jedi were on par and were equal enemies.
The Sith Battlemasters were the main instructors of lightsaber combat, as they can instruct their pupils to the best of their abilities to shine a light for the next Sith era.
The lessons the Battlemaster would hold would start in the morning, and near the end, apprentices would be able to spar with each other to further hone their abilities.
