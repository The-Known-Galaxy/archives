# Introduction

The position of Shadow Hand was a formal position within the ranks of the ancient Sith Empires that would denote an individual as being the second-in-command to their Sith master.
There is no official date or records suggesting an era in which it was formed, but we do know that the role of Shadow Hand predates the arrival of the Jedi Exiles to Korriban in 6900 BBY.

# Duties and Definition

The duties of a Shadow Hand were as varied as the master they served.
On many occasions the Shadow Hand would serve their master in the area(s) of assassination, intelligence gathering, close protection, warfare and even governingship.

The earliest Shadow Hands would often be sent out as assassins or champions for their master’s benefit though the role would also typically envelope an apprenticeship.
As the Shadow Hand would more often than not serve as the apprentice to their master.
And so the duties of a Shadow Hand can often incorporate learning and education of various Sith practices.

# History of the Title

The title began originally to denote an advisor or second-in-command to the dominant Sith ruler on Korriban during the ancient days of the first Sith Empires and potentially centuries prior to the unification of Korriban under one ruler.

However, over many centuries of conflict the title would become more of a statement of apprenticeship and servitude than of one’s political position.
Modern Sith would come to refer to their apprentices and trusted acolytes as their Shadow Hand, a dilution of the original meaning.
