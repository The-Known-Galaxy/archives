# Overview
Sith Battlelords were warriors handpicked by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Rivan.
Battlelords acted as leaders for Rivan’s forces during the New Sith Wars, a conflict between the Galactic Republic and the New Sith Empire.
People who held this rank were very devoted and powerful Sith that would die for the Empire.
Those who were chosen to become Sith Battlelords would have to go under deadly rituals that decided if they were strong enough to lead armies against the Jedi Order.
Aspiring Battlelords were brought to the verge of death through Dark Force and Sith Magic.
Although few died during the process, those who survived the fatal rituals created a Force Bond between them and their soldiers.
Those Force Bonded soldiers couldn’t go any further than fifteen kilometers away from their commander, as they would experience abdominal pain and a painful headache.
