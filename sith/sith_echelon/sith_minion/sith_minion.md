# Description
Before the Rule of Two that was established by Darth Bane, the Sith Order had a rank known as Sith minions.
This rank was one of the lowest ranks within the Sith Order.
Sith minions are often not even Force Sensitive, and they consistently exalted Sith Lords as gods.
Sith Cultists are one of the prime examples of the sith minions within the Sith Order.
