# Overview

Sith spies were hidden observers throughout the Empire and beyond.
Sith Spies would answer to one Sith Lord and would be high ranks within the Imperial navy and/or corporate agents within The Corporate Sector.
Spies were required never to reveal identities, however, they were not necessary to keep as many secrets such as their lifestyles, occupations, etc.
They were taught by the Brotherhood of Darkness within the Ryloth Academy, Umbara Academy, and Nar Shaddaa Academy as Umbaran Shadow Spies were a variant of Sith Spies.
The rank itself Sith Spy existed during the New Sith Wars which lasted approximately 2000 to 1000 BBY.

Sith spies were required to be in secret as their prize.
Punishments for not doing so would resolve in certain death.
Sith spies would receive plenty of rewards for their service to the Empire, however, only those who enjoyed wealthy or prestigious positions had permission to flaunt it.
Though several Sith spies served their masters due to greed, a few spies had served their masters for different motives.
Sith Spies would often seek out revenge against their masterâ€™s rivals, whilst others would simply believe that all Sith are good for the Empire.
