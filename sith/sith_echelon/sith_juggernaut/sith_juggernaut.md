# Overview

Sith Juggernauts were Sith Warriors during the Reconstituted Sith Empire and fought during the Great Galactic War and Cold War.
Sith Juggernauts specialize in combat endurance and were well known because of the armor they wore on battlefields.
They relied on the Force to boost their stamina and willpower in the heat of battle.
Juggernauts received their titles due to charging into battle head-on with the full force of their power and allowing themselves to be struck by and attacked by their enemy, most of the time only shrugging off the damage that would normally destroy others.
Juggernauts were capable of using Force Drain to rid their enemies of their Force and stamina in order to strengthen themselves in return by leeching off of their enemiesâ€™ power.
The rank itself embodies that of Marka Ragnos, who would charge his enemies with heavy armor and pure rage.
