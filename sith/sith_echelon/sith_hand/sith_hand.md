# Introduction
The rank of Sith Hand was a title given to Darth Krayt’s personal executioners of his will in his One Sith or New Sith Order.
The Sith given this title were extremely skilled in both lightsaber combat and the use of the Dark Side.
There were only three Sith known to hold this title.
Darth Nihl, a Sith only known as Darth Nihl’s Predecessor that died in the Massacre of Ossus, Darth Talon, and Darth Stryfe.
The title of Sith Hand was created by Darth Krayt when he founded the One Sith in approximately 27 ABY (After the Battle of Yavin) and stood as a title until Darth Krayt’s death in 138 ABY during the Battle of Coruscant (Second Imperial Civil War).

# Events caused by Hands
The most notable of the known Sith Hands are Darth Talon and Darth Nihl.
Holding the position for the longest known time, the two were often sent on Darth Krayt’s most important missions.
One of the most important missions given was for Darth Talon to capture and present Cade Skywalker to Darth Krayt.
Darth Talon, after a long chase, finally captured Cade and his companions.
Once they returned to Darth Krayt, however briefly, Cade was converted to the Dark Side and trained in the ways of the One Sith by Darth Talon.
During a meeting with Darth Krayt, Cade was ordered to slay one of his captive friends, Cade refused and caused Darth Krayt to become enraged.
In his rage, Krayt struck down Cade’s companion himself.
This caused Cade to also become enraged.
Using the force, Cade summoned his fathers lightsaber that Krayt kept as a trophy for killing the late Jedi Master.
Talon, being the first to realize what was happening, leapt at Cade.
The Master and Apprentice dueled for a bit until Cade got the better of Talon and impaled her through the stomach.
Talon was confined to a bacta tank for multiple months due to the injuries she sustained.
