# Overview
In its purest sense, powerbases are a system of people and resources upon which Sith can call to pursue their own interests, such as the conquest of a world or the uncovering of ancient artifacts.
A powerbase typically consists of Sith or members of the Imperial military who have sworn their loyalty to the leader of the powerbase or assets such as armies and estates.

In the Reconstituted Sith Empire, powerbases could be used to fight in the ancient Sith rite of the Kaggath by both parties.
The winner of the Kaggath could absorb the losing powerbase to their own, with all its assets and items of interest, or dissolve it completely.
An example of a Sith using their powerbase for their intentions would be Lord Kallig, who used his powerbase to recover artifacts, destroy those who opposed him, and most significantly, defeat Darth Thanaton in a kaggath and ascend to the seats of the Dark Council, gaining the name Darth Nox and becoming the Overlord of Ancient Knowledge.
