The term Sith Assassin was utilized for an order of unknown Force-Sensitives who specialized in assassinations, constituted by Darth Revan during the Jedi Civil War.
They are very much separate from other Sith, as the vast majority of their battle tactics depended on an opening; their target would drop their guard, which would immediately result in a flank coordinated by the Assassins.

They were widely known for their accomplishment in the First Jedi Purge, their assignment being killing Jedi, or capturing them.
When the Jedi were caught, they were given the decision of death or forced to aid and commit to the Sith Assassins.

They were able to absorb force energy from their target; the more potent their prey would be in the force, the more potent Sith Assassins would be.


In their duties, they applied Stealth field generators, a tool for camouflage, which made the wearer exceptionally hard to recognize both visually but didn’t make them thoroughly invisible; there would also stand out certain visual flaws.
Alongside Stealth field generators, they utilized force camouflage, a force ability that takes a hefty amount of energy but practically renders the user invisible to visual and audio detection, even to living beings.
Most of the assassins preferred exploiting force pikes in combat, while the rest utilized lightsabers.

During the Sith Civil War, they were trained at Trayus Academy on the planet Malachor V.
Throughout the New Sith Wars, they were trained under 3 different academies; Ryloth Academy, Umbara Academy, and Nar Shaddaa Academy.

After the New Sith Wars, they were accepted to be truly wiped from existence regarding the New Sith Empire’s collapse, who they aided during the war.
