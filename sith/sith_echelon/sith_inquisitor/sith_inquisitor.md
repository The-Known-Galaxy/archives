# Introduction
Sith Inquisitors were a known part of the political and usually training of the Sith and would showcase immense amounts of force abilities, Inquisitors would use this power in combat more so than dueling as it was a very strong part of their arsenal.
Sith Inquisitors would also be exquisite at the art of manipulation, a strong part of their formal work and usually a trait they would use to get easy and worked eliminations of enemies and allies, all for their personal growth.

# Equipment
Sith Inquisitors would obtain a very unique style of armor, mostly full of soft material they would use very little armor as they would become less active with the force armor, Inquisitors would make sinister clothes however to showcase fear and formality in their rivals, this is so Inquisitors can still use the force to its ultimate potential but also look like a sith your opponent will not look lightly on.
Inquisitors would mostly use double-bladed lightsabers as it was a common lightsaber for the best combat to use.
Inquisitors would not be the worst combat users however, some would also be just as good at dueling as a warrior, but would still showcase the force as the force is their true ally in the end.



# Combat Tactics
The Sith Inquisitors showcased an unlimited amount of Dark powers, using a lot of force lightning, and usually would create a barrage of lightning towards the opponents creating a panic while they battle as they would either have to flee early or the usual case fight back unprepared and in total disarray.
The Inquisitors were so powerful with the Dark Side of the force that they were usually known to be dangerous ranged type Knights.
These powerful force users would mostly use the dark side from a distance but when it came to combat, they would still use their great combat training as well, and of course, strike with the immense power of force to showcase that they are also a threat up close, sometimes enhancing their lightsaber blows with force lightning.



# History
The Sith were very manipulative and showcased whatever it took to gain what they needed to get power.
The most manipulative and political were known to hold the title of Inquisitor, however, one of the first inquisitors was not known as an Inquisitor, instead, was known as a Sorcerer, and the mantle was held by none other than Naga Sadow, a powerful Sith that held great power of the Darkside at the time.
The Sith Sorcerer would be eventually grown into a specialization inside the new title known as the Inquisitor.
The Inquisitor would be known as a powerful force of nature across the galaxy, both in war and in missions, and in the very Order itself.
One of the infamous Sith Inquisitors was Exar Kun, who was known to study the ways of Sith Alchemy and used this knowledge to gather Sith Spirits, led by Marka Ragnos.
later down in Exar Kun's life, Exar would lead a raid on the Jedi training world on Ossus, and later be eliminated after the battle, but would be eliminated dealing a heavy blow to the Training of the Jedi.
 Another Inquisitor was known as Darth Vindican who showcased a powerful contribution to the rise of Darth Malgus and showed a huge amount of dueling prowess, he would be eliminated quickly though due to a raid on an orbital space station run by the Jedi above Korriban, this Station would be taken out and leave behind a deadly battle between Darth Malgus and Darth Vindican versing the Jedi known as Kao Cen Darach and Satele Shan.
This would lead to Satele escaping from the battle and leaving Ken to fight the two legendary Sith by himself.
He would take out Darth Vindican by impaling him, however, he would be eliminated by his Apprentice, Darth Malgus, proving that Vindicans training was formidable and well earned.
Darth Malgus would eliminate Darth Vindican and place his spot on Vindicans rank of leadership.
later in history, the Rule of Two would take out any known sith as Darth Bane was a creator of a new order.
Darth Bane would make the Inquisitor rank a weak title and only be known as the type of sith you were.
Bane's Apprentice, Darth Zanna was the first known Inquisitor of the Rule of Two and would be the first of many to hold this secret title.
The final Rule of Two Inquisitor was none other than Darth Sidious and a well-earned title it was, as his manipulation and political knowledge was otherworldly compared to previous mantles of the title.
Darth Sidious would take out the entire Jedi without laying a single finger on no more than 5 Jedi for the remainder of the entire Clone Wars.
Sidious would also become an Emperor and showcase a true and well-ordered galaxy.
The last known Inquisitor was of the new Order known as the Rule of One, This Sith was none other than Darth Havok and would later be the One Sith at the end.
however, no more has been explained about Darth Havok's life.
