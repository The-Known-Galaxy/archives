# Overview
The Emperor’s Wrath, otherwise known as the Empire’s Wrath, was a rank belonging to the Reconstituted Sith Empire and was created by the Sith Emperor, Darth Vitiate.
The rank was established in 3950 BBY.
This rank was solely created for Scourge, a Sith humanoid male who would bring Jedi Masters to be destroyed by his master, Darth Vitiate.
The Wrath was the main enforcer and executioner of the Dark Council and Emperor.
It was said that Scourge felt immense pain at all times.
The Emperor’s Wrath answered only to the Emperor and unlike the Emperor’s Servants, was bound to a ritual that forced full autonomy over Scourge.
This ritual made it so Scourge would unleash the full force of his power through the dark side.
The Emperor’s Wrath was made immortal by Darth Vitiate and was forced to serve a lifetime as an immortal servant.
The Wrath also had complete immunity from all transgressions made against him during his servitude in the Sith Empire.
