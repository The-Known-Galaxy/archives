# Overview

Sith Master is a title earned by the Sith Lord+ in the Sith Empire who has trained at least one Apprentice in the ways of the Dark Side of The Force and eventually into becoming a Dark Lord of the Sith.
Traditionally, a Sith apprentice would have to kill their mentor to obtain the rank of Sith Master.
It was the duty of a Sith Master to learn and gain knowledge about the whole galaxy, including the Jedi, and pass their knowledge to their Apprentice.

Throughout history, the title Sith Master would hold the titles Sith Lord and/or the Dark Lord of the Sith.
In the era of Darth Revan's Sith Empire, the Sith Masters would also hold the title Sith Lord, but only the strongest of the Sith Masters ruled as the Dark Lord of the Sith.

The knowledge of the Sith Master was to be passed to the Sith Masterâ€™s Apprentice with the sole purpose of becoming as great if not even better than the Sith Master themself.
