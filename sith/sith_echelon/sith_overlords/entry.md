# Overview

Sith Overlords, traditional leaders of the Sith species or tribes, held immense power and influence before 25,000 BBY.
They vied for the prestigious title of Sith'ari through wars and duels, aspiring to become the ultimate authority over the Sith species and gain invincibility.
Notable figures such as "King" Adas and Dathka Graush achieved this title, wielding it to assert dominance and combat threats like the Infinite Empire.

# Section 1

Sith Overlords were traditional leaders of the Sith species or tribes before 25,000 BBY.
They would wage wars and duels against other tribes and overlords to gain the greater title of Sith’ari, which gave them the privilege to be Overlord or King of the entire Sith Species as well as to be highly respected, as it was thought that the title gave you everlasting reign and invincibility.

# Section 2

During a time before the Infinite Empire invaded, a Sith known as “King” Adas would gain this title.
Through the use of this title, they would be able to lead through the ways of defeating anyone who dares be a threat.
(e.g infinite empire)
Another Sith would also gain this title around 7,000 BBY.
Dathka Graush would be a “sorcerer” who practices the arts of  “sith magic”.
Through his gruesome ways, he defeated his rivals in a civil war, after which he was able to become King of Sith as well as gain the title of Sith’ari.

# Section 3

Notable holders of the title of Sith Overlords came from the Massassi caste, who were famed for being a sub-species of the Sith species as well as being fearsome, loyal, and powerful warriors.
Sith Overlords also came from a sub-species of the Sith species, the Kissai, famous for being priests and known to be able to interpret and see the future.

# Section 4

From small areas of land to the entire star system, a small percentage of overlords controlled several planets or star systems from 100,000 BBY until the death of King Adas.
Most controlled territories on the main worlds, or Korriban and Ziost, do not stray too far from them.
Even though the Sith species would go extinct, the name “Overlord” wouldn’t die out and would still be used to this day to recognize leaders of certain areas of the Sith Order and will continue to.
