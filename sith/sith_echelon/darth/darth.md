# Introduction
The Darth title was a huge honor among the Sith Order.
The title of Darth was a symbol of your final ascent to the Dark Side and showcased your official undying loyalty to the Sith Order.
The many Darths who gained the title were one of the most powerful and fierce Dark Lords of the Sith and made many victories during galactic history.

# How the name is Chosen
The name of the Darth is the most important part of the title.
It is what your new identity will be and how the galaxy will perceive you as a Dark Lord.
The name is decided based on your unique personality towards the Sith and is then changed into either added or removed words to create the name for your title.
For example, Darth Vader was known to be a planet invader so the word invader was replaced with Vader creating the Sith Lord known as Darth Vader.



# The Meaning of a Darth
To hold the title of a Darth a Sith must showcase an undying loyalty to the Dark Side of the Force and bring forth order across the galaxy.
A Darth must always strive to gain power and look to achieve an unbreakable power of the force and break their chains limiting them from the full potential of the Dark Side.
Some of these chains can be through unlocking more powers of the force such as the most common Darth power force lightning a very useful Force move that can bring great pain and suffering towards their opponents.
A Darth must also showcase his Power across the Galaxy and inflict Order should the galaxy decide to oppose the Sith Order.

But there were also other Variants of the meaning through the changes of the rules, an example is the Rule of Two, The title of Darth was very different in this Rule since there was only two Sith a Master and an Apprentice the Title of Darth was more of a secret initiation into the Sith, you were officially a new person and would do anything it took to keep the Sith in power without the interruption of the Jedi.
another example is the Rule of One, Similar to the Old republic Order, it was full of armies of Sith however the title of Darth still was different, As a Darth for the Rule of One you were officially the minion of the Dark Lord of the Sith the Leader of the Sith and the one that enforced the rules.
