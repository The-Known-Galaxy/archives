The term Inquisitor was utilized for a position inside the Galactic Empire's secret Inquisitorius Program.
When converted into an inquisitor, you are scrapped of your title and granted new ones named Brother/Sister depending on your gender.
Their specifications were to track down and eliminate any Jedi in hiding that survived Order 66, while also dealing with other dangers such as rebel factions or any other sort of threat to the Galactic Empire.
Having no problem with authority, they were able to request and be gifted any resources that would help them accomplish their mission.
Their attire consisted of bodysuits made of armor that were black and gray, while they wielded the double-bladed spinning lightsabers, lightsabers that were able to pull off defensive and offensive styles with ease because of their spinning mechanism.

The division was led by Darth Vader while managing to keep the secrecy of their purposes within the Empire, even leading a subdivision named Purge Troopers.
The Inquisitors training was supervised by Darth Vader, a training that consisted of increasing their offensive and defensive techniques to a greater level, being able to exploit their custom lightsaber properly.
Because of their motivation and harsh training they were able to increase their skill and unlock new levels of potency.
Their masters, Darth Sidious and Darth Vader also made sure that their strength wouldn’t be able to reach the power level a Dark Lord has, as they wouldn’t want to deal with betrayal.
Some of the Inquisitors were known to be past Jedi, such as the Second Sister.
