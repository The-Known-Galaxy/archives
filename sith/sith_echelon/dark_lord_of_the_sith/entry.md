# Introduction

Dark Lord of the Sith, also known as “Jen’ari” in the language of the Sith was the title used to refer to the sole supreme ruler of the Sith Empire first established by Ajunta Pall and his followers in 6900 BBY during the Hundred-Year Darkness.
The title remained reserved for only the most powerful beings among the Sith; however, the purpose and usage of the title altered many times throughout history.
Dark Lady of the Sith was also another adaptation of the title created by Lumiya, but still revolved around the same purpose.

# History

Following the Hundred-Year Darkness in 6900 BBY, Ajunta Pall and a few other Dark Jedi followers enslaved the Sith species upon their arrival on Korriban after killing their Sith King.
With enough study and praise, Ajunta Pall ascended took the Sith Language for his own will, created the Sith Empire, and further enforced his rule; proclaimed himself the first and new “Jen’ari” translating to Dark Lord of the Sith.
The title continued to be passed down throughout the generations, one of the most notable wielders of such being Marka Ragnos who later was succeeded by Naga Sadow.

Following the destruction of the Sith Empire and nearly the entirety of the Sith and their tradition, Sadow bestowed the position of Dark Lord of the Sith to his Apprentice Freedon Nadd.
After Nadd also met his demise, the spirit of Marka Ragnos deemed Exar Kun as the new Dark Lord of the Sith.
Whilst it was believed that Dark Lord of the Sith could only be held by one sole ruler at a time, that was proven to be false with the rise of Vitiates Sith Empire around the same time in 3980 BBY.
Under Emperor Vitiate's rule in the reconstituted Sith Empire, the title of Dark Lord of the Sith was also given to his twelve Dark Council members.

Thousands of years later in 1010 BBY, Lord Kaan, leader of the Brotherhood of Darkness allowed his fellow Sith Lords to also hold the title of Dark Lord of the Sith, providing further showcase that this role could be fulfilled by multiple individuals at a time.
In addition, with the establishment of the Rule of Two, the Master and the Apprentice both were considered Dark Lord of the Sith.
It wasn’t until the rise of the One Sith in 27 ABY that the concept of a sole Dark Lord of the Sith returned.
