# Overview
Sith King was a title granted to rulers of the Sith species before the Dark Jedi Exiles arrived after the Hundred-Year Darkness.
Due to the Sith seizing style of commandment, Sith Kings were usually the most powerful of the Sith species.
Despite this, many Kings were still granted protection from Sithspawn in life and death.
Kings were only buried in important locations such as the Valley of Golg and the Valley of Sleeping Kings.
The title of Sith King was abolished around the time the Sith Empire was established.
Some notable Kings were Adas, Dathka Graush, and Hakagram Graush.
