# Introduction

The Sith had many abilities to obtain, the main part of Sith Sorcerers was the usage of the Sith Alchemy, the ability to deal with a very necromantic style of force abilities, being able to obtain the spirits of the Sith, and many more forms of Sith Magic.
Sith Sorcerers were a formidable part of the Sith Order and would later be powerful users of the Dark Side.

# History

One of the more common Sith Sorcerers was the great Naga Sadow, a powerful user of Sith Sorcery at his time, and nearly brought an early end to the Jedi, however, his Apprentice would intervene and the battle would be lost.
Naga Sadow was known to train the Dark Lord, Freedon Nadd, a newly appointed Sith Sorcerer, and was known to take over the planet Onderon and infused it with the dark side, using his Sith Sorcery abilities that he learned from Naga Sadow.
Later the history of Freedon Nadd would be lost and only through his Sith Spirit would he train the future of his generation, he found a new apprentice by the name of Exar Kun and showcased a huge amount of potential towards the Darkside and Sith Sorcery.
Exar Kun would be one to destroy an entire Jedi Training world and eventually be defeated but not without his mission being successful.
the final use of Sith sorcery was obtained by the newly formed rule of two which was a big deal at the time, Darth Bane who made the rule of two allowed his apprentice Darth Zannah to continue the usage of Sith sorcery and die with the knowledge, the usage of Sith sorcery would only be used again by Darth Sidious and that was only on rare occasions.
