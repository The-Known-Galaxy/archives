# The Beginning
The Emperor's Hand was a dark side organization that served the needs of the Sith Emperor Vitiate directly, autonomous of the reconstituted Sith Empire's rule.
Following its abandonment by the previous Sith Emperor, it was reformed by the new Emperor Vowrawn because of the Hand of the Empire, or The Hand.
The Servants, core members of the organization, remained loyal to the fallen Vitiate and rose against the Empire's will in the commission of their master until their eventual demise aboard Kira Carsen's ship.
During the Galactic War, the Hand became aware of Darth Baras's act of silencing the Voice of the Emperor and his motivation in becoming the ruling force of the Sith Empire.
In order to end this, they sought out an agent that would act on behalf of the Emperor.
Normally, the Emperor's Wrath, Lord Scourge, would deal with the usurper, but as he had deserted his post to ally with the Hero of Tython, Servant One and Servant Two searched the Empire for a replacement in his stead.
Out of the countless Sith they found, they chose Darth Baras's former Sith apprentice, whom the Darth chose to betray.
This Sith was awarded the position of Emperor's Wrath and worked with the Hand to weaken Baras's powerbase so as to ultimately eliminate the threat posed by him.

# The Middle
After the Emperor's defeat at the hands of the Hero of Tython on Dromund Kaas, the Hand ordered the Imperial Guard to recover their master's true body and conceal it in a safe place while his weakened spirit recovered from the fight.
The Hand maintained instant communication with the Wrath tasking them with unifying the Empire.
The Hand was targeted by Dark Councilor Vowrawn, who went as far as interrogating a Servant, when the Sith discovered his friend; the Emperor's Wrath was being spied on.
After the Wrath destroyed the Opticron droids, Servant One came personally to capture Darth Vowrawn and question the Wrath's loyalty.
The Wrath wasn't fascinated by Servant One's ramblings therefore they severed their connection to the Hand and ultimately the Sith Emperor.



# The End
After the Invasion of Ziost, when the previous Sith Emperor shed his Sith identity and resumed his mantle of Valkorion (leader of the Eternal Empire) he decided that he had transcended his previous limitations and now did not require his Hand, Voice or Children.
During the renewed galactic conflict, after the Meridian Complex battle, the now Emperor Vowrawn announced the reformation of the Emperor's Hand into the Hand of the Empire without the Dark Council's knowledge, finding the Hand best suited to house wartime activities by working autonomously rather than serving under individual Sith Lords.
With the new development, Darth Rivix was appointed to the Hand of the Empire.
