# Introduction

The Sith had many young eager students of the Dark Side, these students were known to be called Acolytes and were a priority to teach during the many wars of the galaxy.
An Acolyte would be known to proceed into a set of trials before finishing off with a task to obtain their lightsaber, the Acolyte would do anything it took to achieve their goals, and strive to become a powerful sith.
Once finished the trials of the acolyte, they would become an Apprentice to their new Lord and show their loyalty to them, as they now progress to accomplish a mission to showcase the new knowledge they learned as an Acolyte.

# Known Acolytes

There have been many Acolytes throughout the history of the galaxy, a very well known one, was Darth Revan who was both a Darth and a Jedi, however, Revan would become an Acolyte as a Jedi Knight, learning the ways of the Sith for a mere prize which was the star force map.
Another known acolyte was none other than a Sith Hutt, known as Gamblor he was only revealed in history being well known as a holovid and was known to be a deadly Sith.
last we have the most secret Acolyte, Galen Merek who was under the training of Darth Vader, known to the world as Starkiller he was a very dangerous Jedi hunter, however, his time was cut short due to him turning to the light and sacrificing himself for the rebel alliance, a very bold move as it created an undying war against the Rebels and the Galactic Empire.
