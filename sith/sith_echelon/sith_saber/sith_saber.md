# Overview

Sith Sabers was a nickname for Sith Knights who were in the Lost Tribe of Sith located on planet Kesh.
Sith apprentices could obtain this rank once they have completed their training with their master, officially obtaining the rank equivalent to the Jedi Order known as “Jedi Knight”.
When obtained, a once known apprentice to now be a Sith Saber would have the privileges unavailable to lower ranks such as customizing robes, acquiring possessions, etc.

# History

25 years after the Tribe’s arrival on the planet Kesh, all Sith Sabers were eliminated due to Jariad Korsin, a High Lord of the Tribe, gathering all Sith Sabers to assist him and his mother on the assassination of the Grand Lord.
However, doing so, they failed and were all killed by Nida Korsin and Gloyd.

Sith Sabers were a part of the Tribe’s military and security forces under Grand Lord Varner Hilts, utilized in battle against Force-sensitive enemies and rival Sith Factions of the Tribe.
Members of the Keshiri, purple-skinned humanoid species indigenous to Kesh, were granted permission to enlist in the Sith Sabers under Hilt’s reforms.
Throughout the Siege of Tahv, multiple Sith Sabers led by Grand Consort Iliana Hilts participated in the defense of the capital Tahv.

A member of the Tribe who was promoted to a Sith Saber was Vestara Khai.
Vestara Khai was promoted to a Sith Saber, just like her dad Gavar Khai, during the Battle of Coruscant by High Lord Sashal.
