# Overview

A Sith Cultist refers to any Sith who was in a cult but mainly referred to members of the Tavion Axmis's Sith cult, and the Disciples of Ragnos.
Members of these cults wore different colored outfits based on the abilities they carried.
Artificial Lightsabers were mass produced for members of these cults, and they were not considered good duelists.
As a matter of fact, it is said that an average Jedi could defeat two of these Cultists.
Cultists mainly operated in small bunches and used a 2:1 ratio of Force wielders to Lightsaber wielders.
The most powerful members of the Tavion cultist group were titled New Reborn, and were recruited from Desannâ€™s army of Reborn.
The Cultists and New Reborn would often team up to fight Jedi in different Sith and Jedi temples.
