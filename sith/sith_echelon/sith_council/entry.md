# Introduction

The Sith Council, not to be confused with the Dark Council, was the governing body of the Old Sith Empire.
This council consisted of a total of ten Sith Lords that served as advisors to the Dark Lord of the Sith, reinforcing his will and establishing order among the Old Sith Empire.
Each respective member of the Sith Council held influence over many different worlds within the galaxy but as a collective, they congregated to discuss matters pertaining to the Empire’s welfare.

# History

This system within the Sith Empire was devised by the Dark Jedi that enslaved the Sith species during the Hundred Year Darkness in 6900 BBY.
Part of their alterations to Sith tradition and society involved introducing the Sith Council to advise the Dark Lord of the Sith.
The concept of the Shadow Hand, which was the second-in-command and usually the apprentice to the Dark Lord of the Sith continued to exist but the Sith Council took priority.

Marka Ragnos and his Sith Council are the most notable individuals that partook in this form of government within the Sith Empire.
Ludo Kressh, Simus, Naga Sadow, Horak-mul, and Dor Gal-ram were five of the ten vital Sith Lords serving on the Sith Council.
Following the death of Marka Ragnos, Ludo Kressh and Naga Sadow sought to succeed him.
Kressh and Sadow would engage in many battles and other conflicts to determine the next Dark Lord of the Sith.
Sadow eventually deceived the Sith Council by telling them the Galactic Republic intended to launch small-scale hit and run attacks on the Sith Empire.
In respect to Sadow’s provided information, the majority of the Sith Council nominated him for the position of Dark Lord of the Sith.
Ludo Kressh saw through the lies of Naga Sadow and invaded his fortress with two other Sith Lords to put a halt to his plans but failed miserably, granting Naga Sadow the title he desired.

A few years after the Galactic Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY that resulted in the near decimation of the Sith Empire and the Sith as a whole, Lord Vitiate emerged to reform the Sith and establish a new Sith Empire.
Vitiate managed to gather thousands of other Sith Lords on the world of Nathema through deception where he would then partake in a ritual known as the Ritual of Nathema to absorb the life essence of the planet and the other Lords to grant him immense power.
After discovering the dark and ancient world of Dromund Kaas, the now proclaimed Emperor Vitiate created the Reconstituted Sith Empire, abolishing the Sith Council entirely.
Given his title as Sith Emperor, he created the Dark Council to replace the Sith Council.
Both concepts presented similarity, though the Dark Council consisted of a twelve-member council of Dark Lords of the Sith.
Instead of confining specific duties to the organization as the Sith Council did, members of the Dark Council held control over different aspects of the Sith Empire by acting as overlords of their own powerbases known as the Spheres of Influence.
