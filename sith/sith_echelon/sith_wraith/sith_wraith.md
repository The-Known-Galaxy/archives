# Overview

Sith Wraith is a rank that is gifted to a retired member of the Sith Order that has shown a lot of conduct, dedication and hard work to the Sith Order and its community.
The baseline requirement to become a Sith Wraith is reaching the rank of Dark Council and showing constant hard work and conduct to the Sith Order and its community.
Normally, to become a Sith Wraith, it is needed to reach the rank of Powerbase; we could say that when reaching the rank of Powerbase, the retirement rank is guaranteed, but as said before, to achieve that rank, it is needed to be a very good Dark Councilor, or Powerbase.
The Sith Wraith rank in-game grants its holder a red and transparent appearance of a Force ghost.
An example of a Sith Wraith is Fedlz - he was the Dark Lord of the Sith before Vermened, also known as Darth Validus.
He has shown constant hard work and dedication to the community and was rewarded with the rank.
