# Introduction
Sith Lord is a rank of the Sith Order held by the most powerful lords of the Dark Side, somewhat equivalent to the titles of Jedi Master and Jedi Lord.
While the elite of their Order, the Lords were also the aristocracy of the Sith Empires, where they ruled their domains and commanded entire personal armies in the wars with the Galactic Republic and the struggle with each other for the mantle of the Dark Lord.

# Section 1
The title Dark Lord of the Sith was originally designated the ruler of the Sith Empire; it was later used by the leaders of the Dark Order.
Before Lord Kaan, there was only one Dark Lord at a time the head of the Order; however, in the Brotherhood of Darkness, this title was held by several Sith at once.
It was this form that was applied to both sexes; however, Lumiya called herself the Dark Lady.
It is often believed that this title is synonymous with Darth, but this is only a hypothesis that does not have worthy confirmation.
Many Lords used the word Darth, but there is no evidence of equality between the two titles.
The first Dark Lord was the leader of the exiled Dark Jedi, who, after defeat in the War of the Hundred Years of Darkness, conquered the Sith race and became gods for them.
Xendor is considered the very first Dark Jedi; he is the predecessor of the Dark Lords, but never held the title himself.
The mechanism of title inheritance is not simple.
In the Empire, he was accepted by the one who became ruler after the death of the previous Dark Lord.
But after the fall of the Naga Empire, Sadow transferred the title to his student Freedon Nadd; and centuries later, the ghost of Marka Ragnos crowned Exar Kun.
Three thousand years later, Kaan began to give this title to all members of the Order; this is the first time that a title of this level has been held by many people at once.
