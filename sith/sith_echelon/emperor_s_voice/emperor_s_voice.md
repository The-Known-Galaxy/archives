# Introduction
The Emperor’s Voice, also known as the Voice of the Emperor, was a position within the reconstituted Sith Empire, and was created by the Sith Emperor Vitiate.
The Emperor’s Voice held supreme authority within the Sith Empire, as a command from the Voice, was a command from the Emperor himself.

While some may think that the title “Voice of the Emperor” is simply that, a title, it is in fact so much more.
Becoming the Voice of the Emperor allowed Vitiate to interact with the world as more than just his state as a being of pure Force energy.
The host who would take in the Emperor’s spirit, would be completely suppressed, crushed beneath the weight of the Emperor's mind with their body literally becoming the Sith Emperor’s own body to do with as he pleased.

# History
The role of the Emperor’s Voice was created in 3950 BBY after a failed assassination attempt was commited by Jedi Masters Revan and Jedi Exile Meetra Surik.
Terrified by the close brush with death the Sith Emperor sought an answer in the Dark Side of the Force and after much research, the Sith Emperor discovered how to transfer his consciousness, life-force, and powers in the Force into the bodies of others.
Thus the Sith Emperor took his first host and named the individual the Voice of the Emperor, the literal embodiment of the Emperor's absolute will and his mouthpiece to the Dark Council.

Upon the death of a Voice, the Emperor's essence is released from the host body and returns to the care of his Hand, the twelve Servants who carry out the Emperor’s will across the galaxy.
Servant Two, a member of the Emperor's Hand, was mentally linked to the Emperor more so than all of his other agents, and as a result, the prophetic Servant of the Hand was always aware of the Voice's presence and location, even when the Emperor was dormant.
Upon receiving their master's essence, the Hand would procure a new Voice for the Emperor and aid him in establishing control of the host’s body.
