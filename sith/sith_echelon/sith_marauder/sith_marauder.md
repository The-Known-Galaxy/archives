# The Beginning
Sith Marauders were Sith Warriors who fought for the Sith Empire during the Great Sith War, Great Galactic War and therefore the conflict that followed it circa 3653 BBY.
They specialized in dual lightsaber combat and dealing high amounts of injury to enemies through melee combat.
Sith Marauders were fueled by hatred, rage, and cruelty; the Marauders would typically use Force Rage when entering a battle, entering a battle-fury fueled by the dark side.
Thus, most Sith Marauders could duel any average Jedi, toe-to-toe and win.

# The Middle
Sith Marauders first appeared during the Sith War.
They reached their climax in strength during the time of Darth Traya, Darth Nihilus, and Darth Sion.
Hidden within the Trayus Academy on Malachor V, these warriors were trained in great numbers together with other Dark Jedi trained there.
However, most of the Sith Marauders were defeated, together with the Sith assassins and Masters after Meetra Surik fought through the academy to confront Darth Traya.



# The End
Sith Marauders participated in the Sacking of Coruscant during the Great Galactic War, engaging with many Jedi on the planet.
During the New Sith Wars, the Brotherhood of Darkness trained Marauders in academies on Honoghr, Gentes, and Gamorr.
