# Introduction
Sith had many great duelists during the wars, The Sith had these duelists become a rank known as Sith Warriors, a very powerful rank and was known to showcase deadly combat prowess and eliminate many enemies of the Sith.
Warriors were known to showcase a will to eliminate all that stood in their way, without any choice of patience, They would charge in with no questions and strike with them unprepared for war.
Warriors showcased a great number of fears with their intentions to not only show fear to the many enemies but also keep as many numbers as possible which was a very great advantage to obtain during the Jedi and Sith wars.

# Equipment
Sith Warriors were notorious for obtaining many armored items that helped them in battle, Warriors were holders of armor that was forged in steel and would place almost every main weak point with armor which allowed for a higher chance of no weakness in the wars they faced.
Warriors would have armor usually on the face, shoulders, thighs, shins, feet, arms, and sometimes on rare occasions everywhere but that required a strong connection to the Darkside as it usually would be pushing the weight of a Sith in battle.
Warriors also usually had cybernetic enhancements to allow for increased potential on the battlefield and allowed for skills that overpowered the Jedi.
to top it off a Warrior's lightsaber would also contain armor as even the blade was made sure it was kept intact during the wars.



# Combat Tactics
The Sith Warriors were also known for their brute combat tactics during the wars.
The warriors would also showcase a strong use of the Darkside to send the enemies on the defensive just before the enemies would be struck down from the face of the galaxy.
These tactics would be shown as a deadly use of brute strength towards the enemy, always showing that the enemy will need to watch every corner of the warrior's positions to make sure they are not being backstabbed or taken out with a sheer force of usually lightning or objects being thrown at them.



# History
The Sith were known to be a war-oriented Order, therefore they made use of many combat-ready Sith duelists that would later down the line be made into the first Sith Warriors, also known as Sith Marauders at the time, later down the history the Marauders would be its subtitle outside of the Warrior rank and the rank would just be a Warrior, however, have many subtitles such as “Marauder and Juggernaut”.
throughout history there were many great Sith Warriors that showcased many talents with the Darkside, Darth Trayus would be the first-ever Sith Lord to start an Academy towards the training of combat, however, this academy would be laid to waste once a Jedi Knight by the name of Meetra Surik would eliminate most of the acolytes in search of Darth Traya.
The Sith were not yet ready to give up, however, because later down the course of history, We had the infamous Darth Malgus, a prodigy of the time, and showcased the tremendous power of the Darkside and eliminated many enemies of the Sith empire.
Another great day of the Sith was not officially a known Warrior but was worthy of the title, this Sith was none other than Darth Vader and was known to lay waste to many Jedi, rebels, and any enemy that stood in Vaders way.
He was known to bring an end to the Jedi for a good 20 years and was able to show a massive amount of fear whenever the opponents heard his presence.
