# Introduction
Sith Hopeful, also called Prospective Sith, was a common term used by the inhabitants of Korriban to refer to those that desired to join the Sith Academy to be further enlightened in the teachings of the Dark Side.
Many Hopefuls aspired to join the Sith Academy to escape their potentially poor lifestyle whilst others were Jedi that aspired to join after their fall to the Dark Side.
For a Sith Hopeful to enroll in the Sith Academy, they first had to obtain a Sith Medallion.

# History
The Sith Academy was established on Korriban during the Jedi Civil War.
This allowed for an influx of Sith Hopefuls wishing to eventually craft their own journey throughout the galaxy as a Sith.
For a Hopeful to be accepted into the Sith Academy, a Sith Medallion had to be bestowed upon them as a result of their outstanding performance.
Many prospects would be deceived into doing the dirty work for other Sith in hopes of obtaining one of these displays of nobility.
In other cases, prospective Sith were simply assigned a task as a mere spectacle of amusement for those that promised them a medallion.
Even if a Hopeful had been accepted to finally partake in the many lessons offered by the Sith Academy, quite an abundance died as punishment for their inadequate performance.
Revan was also one of the many in history to receive a Sith Medallion to be granted entry into the Sith Academy.
Upon obtaining the reward for all of his efforts, a few Sith Hopefuls approached him showing interest in getting one themselves.
