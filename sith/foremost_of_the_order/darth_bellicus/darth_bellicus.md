# History
Before turning to the Dark Side, FerrumCaesar was the Padawan of Jedi Knight TaitusMydrek during April.
Caesar’s padawanship didn’t last long, as his quick understanding of the philosophy of the Light Side of the Force granted him the rank of Jedi Knight in the same month.
A few days after being ascended to Knight of the Jedi Order, FerrumCaesar attended a tryout to join the Temple Guard division.
The skill he showcased in the tryout got him the entry to join the Temple Guard commanded by joelbloxx, however, his time in the Temple Guard didn’t last long, as he was kicked from it in June because of his ‘inactivity’.
From this event on, FerrumCaesar went through a large period of inactivity until in October 2021, his former Jedi master, TaitusMydrek, offered Caesar to learn the ways of the Dark Side along him.
As expected, Caesar accepted, and was given the rank of Sith Lord.

After joining the Sith Order ruled by Dark Lord of the Sith, Fedlz, and Wrath of the Dark Lord, KentuckySquid, the now Sith Lord FerrumCaesar was in charge of leading attacks against the Jedi Temple on Ossus alongside Sith Lord TaitusMydrek.
Although he always managed to be successful in his raids, his efforts were not seen by the Overlord of his sphere, VexillumUsh.
Caesar, thinking he was not being appreciated for his job, considered leaving the order, but was stopped and convinced not to by his comrade, TaitusMydrek.
This decision taken by FerrumCaesar was the one that made him keep going and work hard to achieve higher goals.
A long time after this event, on January 1st, 2022, Caesar ascended to Grand Sorcerer, thus achieving the rank of Darth and being named Darth Bellicus.
Seven days after the demotion of reyrosky on January 1st from the Dark Council spot as the Overlord of the Sphere of Defense and Security, Darth Bellicus was granted reyrosky’s spot and took over the Dark Council seat to serve as the Overlord of the Sphere of Defense and Security.

From this moment on, a new journey for Darth Bellicus started as the Overlord of one of the most loved spheres of all time.
His job was tedious, but he knew the Sphere would eventually flourish.
After forming the Sphere and getting new members, it was time to start ascending people to leadership positions.
The first batch of Sith Lord+ within was made up of only two members of the sphere: Purposei and ChampaaiTemenos.
Purposei (Darth Xenion) was the Chief of Defense within Defense & Security, while ChampaaiTemenos (Darth Hyvar) was the Overseer of Sith Shamans.
The second batch of Lords and above was formed by: Sith Lord Levithegamer92, Sith Lord KingOfDeaths0, and Sith Lord brolion1.
Not much was known of Darth Bellicus during his time in Defense & Security other than him supporting his own sphere, but he was working in the shadows, thinking and planning something else; a Kaggath.

Darth Bellicus had gathered all the Advanced Sith Knights and above into something that many called a crazy plan.
Bellicus knew what he was doing, and informed all his trusted peers about the Kaggath he had in mind against Darth Kennaex, the current Hand of the Dark Lord.
He announced the Kaggath on February 20, 2022, and contained in his Powerbase werepeople like Darth Hyvar, Darth Xenion, KingOfDeaths0, etc.
On the other hand, Darth Kennaex had on his side the Dark Honor Guard and Darth Havok.
The Kaggath took place in the Sith Enclave, specifically on February 27, 2022.
Everyone who rallied in the Kaggath pit was in that place either to see the rise of Darth Bellicus or his fall.
Most of the Sith present in the Kaggath were united to see the triumph of Caesar and the fall of KennaexMalvern, though those who didn’t were aware of the fate of Darth Kennaex.
When Bellicus and Kennaex’s forces arrived, the rite of the Kaggath started.
On the first set of the Kaggath, Caesar dominated KennaexMalvern by beating him 2-0 in the 1v1 section, and 3-0 in the powerbase against powerbase section.
The Kaggath ended in the Battle of Wits, where CaesarTemenos eliminated KennaexMalvern by beating him 3-0 in the Sith Order-related questions.
After this Kaggath was finished, KennaexMalvern retired from the Sith Order as a Sith Wraith, while CaesarTemenos ascended to Hand of the Dark Lord.


Not much was known about Darth Bellicus during his time as the overseer of the Dark Honor Guard, but he was more than an overseer in the eyes of his teammates; someone who wanted everyone to have a good time instead of always doing the same.
Sadly, after four months of work as Hand of the Dark Lord, CaesarTemenos retired from the Sith Order as a Sith Wraith.
What we thought would be a permanent retirement to focus on other things didn’t happen, as CaesarTemenos came back from his retirement on August 10, 2022.
Caesar unretired as a Sith Lord and joined the Dark Honor Guard as a Sergeant.

Around two weeks after serving as a Sergeant within the Guard, CaesarTemenos decided to discharge from the Dark Honor Guard and serve as the Sith Loremaster Overseer within Ancient Knowledge, thus being granted the rank of Darth once again.
After his ascension to Darth, a new chapter starts in Darth Bellicus’ life; a journey of knowledge.
