# Overview:

TaitusTemenos, formerly known as Darth Lividus, is remembered as an Overlord of the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy, the first Overlord of the reopened Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, and former Captain of the Dark Honor Guard.
A common theme among these groups was how Taitus successfully brought about change and laid a resilient foundation for others to thrive on, which continues today.
Taitus currently plays The Known Galaxy as a Sith Raider in Expansion & Diplomacy and continues to be a figure in the community that people look up to.
He is praised by many for the reformations he brang to the Sith Order, being an important piece of its history to have made the Order what it is today.

# Biography:

Prologue: The introduction of TaitusMydrek.
Taitus was in the Jedi Order in a time where there was no Sith Order, there were just Hostiles instead.
Back then, he was called TaitusMydrek.
He was a Jedi Knight in around March 2021 and joined the Jedi Assault Team by passing a tryout, specialising as a Jedi Sage a few weeks after and becoming the first ever Sage in it.
In that time, he defended the Jedi Sanctum and raided other Sith Orders in different genres with the Jedi Assault Team.
While in the Assault Team, he was also a member of the Librarian’s Assembly and made articles for it.
It should be noted that one of his padawans in the Jedi was someone named FerrumCaesar, this is important for later.

Taitus continued to contribute to the Jedi Order as a Sage until the 30th of August 2021 when Taitus, along with several other former Jedi joined the new Sith Order led and owned by Fedlz.
By then, the Sith Order was a few weeks old and was a window of opportunity for those that seeked it, which Taitus eagerly took.
He formed a connection with KentuckySquid, the Wrath of the Dark Lord, which would be equivalent to a Powerbase today and was given Sith Knight, becoming one of the first people to lead the Sphere of Military Command, a predecessor to the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy.
He was one of the most active members then, frequently leading raids against the Jedi Order.

Act I: The dawn of a new Sphere.
According to him, the Sith Order wasn’t officially integrated into what would become the Known Galaxy yet, so it acted more as an unofficial and highly skilled raiding group.
In late October, the Sith Order was slowly transitioning into an official group and Vermened replaced Fedlz as Dark Lord of the Sith.
In this new era with vacant positions and new spheres of influence, Taitus would find himself having become a Lord of the new Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy and encouraged his former padawan FerrumCaesar to join as well.
They would both become the first ever Sith to be Warlords with Taitus leading Juggernauts and Caesar leading Sorcerers.
They worked under the first Overlord of the Sphere, VexillumUsh, who would later become KennaexMalvern.

Both Caesar and Taitus put an abundance of effort and work into making E&D, but Taitus was the only one of the pair to quickly be promoted and bear the name of Darth Lividus, quickly becoming one of the first ever Darths in the Sith Order in Vermened’s era.
Unfortunately, despite putting in as much work as his friend, Caesar was less recognised and faced more hardships compared to Taitus, he would have eventually left the Sith Order had he not been persuaded by Taitus not to again and again.
This would be a key point in Caesar’s future.

In November, Taitus was the first Sith to have an Apprentice, keys14, and he would eventually have more to follow, the most notable of which being ChampaaiTemenos and TalonTemenos (now known as ZaynGravidus).
Later in the month, Taitus, along with several other Sith were the first to receive the newly made Dark Council Accolades, him receiving one that recognised his leadership and in the middle of December, he was the first to have received the prestigious recognition of Defender of the Order and became the Overlord of Expansion & Diplomacy shortly after his superior ascended to Powerbase on the 17th of December.
His Inner Circle consisted of Caesar, Esociety, and EscanorTemenos.
According to ZaynGradivus, Taitus got the job done and kept both his IC and Warlords satisfied.

Caesar soon left to become the Overlord of Defense & Security on the 9th of January 2022 while Taitus and his sphere continued to flourish.
E&D began to reach its first peak and become a force to be reckoned with, especially against the Jedi Assault Team.
In this time, Taitus discovered a conspiracy against him and how his subordinate ChampaaiTemenos planned to kaggath him in early February due to conflicts shared between the two regarding the former being promoted to Darth, which the latter ultimately responded to by removing from him the sphere.
Champaai found a place in D&S instead and it all worked out in the best possible future instead, with him easily getting Darth and eventually becoming Overlord after the huge kaggath between Caesar and Kennaex.
Champ has stated himself in his interview how he no longer holds any resentment on the topic towards Taitus and that they continue to be good friends.

On the 20th of February, Overlord of Defense & Security, Darth Bellicus declared a rank kaggath against the Hand of the Dark Lord, Darth Kennaex.
A contest of mutual annihilation pitting powerbase against powerbase, where bloodshed would determine victor.
This was not just any kaggath, it would be the first rank kaggath in the Sith Order actually fought and won.
It was a display of power, dominance, and authority.
People bought shirts in support of Caesar, and many spectated the battles between the powerbase of Caesar and the Dark Honor Guard that so valiantly fought in support of the Hand.
This was an event that would shake the foundations of the Sith Order as many members new and old knew it and indeed, it was a battle for the history books.
It showed how truly impressive Temenos was and how they could unite under one person.
It was a kaggath that Taitus had a very large part in as he pledged to Caesar’s powerbase and helped him become the new and rightful Hand of the Dark Lord.
After the kaggath, E&D grew into becoming one of the most recognisable groups within the Sith Order and went through reforms to become more of an effective force than it already was.
As the Sphere grew, Taitus felt that he had already set it on a path of greatness and success, and after 7 months of building E&D from the ground, he stepped down on March 12th and passed the mantle of Overlord to Esociety, who gave himself the name of Darth Surge.

Act II: Salvation in authority and knowledge.
Taitus saw how the Dark Honor Guard, a group considered separate from the rest of the Sith Order, was dying and had a lack of leadership.
Much like E&D, Taitus joined it to pave a path of greatness and build stability in it and went from Dark Councilor to Lieutenant, the first ever Sith to do so.
While people questioned his choice regarding the controversial move, he didn’t care and instead worked on the Guard with MartinTLincoln, UnforceTemenos, and ValorisAshen to rebuild and reform, which saw success as they improved the Guard and its standards.
Taitus soon earned the rank of Captain, directly below the Commander and overseeing the continued progress of the Guard.

Around a month after joining the Dark Honor Guard and reforming it into a disciplined powerhouse, on the 9th of May, Taitus stepped down from the Dark Honor Guard like he did with the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy, as Vermened was bringing back a few Spheres that were originally decommissioned.
With the encouragement of Caesar, Taitus applied to become Overlord of the renewed Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, reborn from the ashes of the Order of the Loremaster and due to his reputation, experience, and Vermened favouring him, he sat on the Dark Council again.
Now a member of the Dark Council once more, Taitus and his new Inner Circle formed from his loyal comrades from the Dark Honor Guard brought Ancient Knowledge to a state of glory and renown with the help of propaganda promoting the sphere.
Within Ancient Knowledge, they made documents to lay the groundwork for the future of the Sphere and taught new members how to properly format articles.
They were the forefathers that truly set up what Ancient Knowledge is now at the time of this article.

What Taitus did next was a controversial response to a controversial action done by Project Management and set the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge back for some time due to these actions.
On the 13th of June, KennaexMalvern was called to Vermened’s powerbase to become the Hand of the Dark Lord after CaesarTemenos retired, to the dismay of a few veterans of the Sith Order which included Taitus.
He felt that the choice of someone who was already Hand and kaggathed out of it for good reason was one of the worst possible choices, rather than picking the Commander of the Dark Honor Guard or a competent member of the Dark Council.
So, Taitus left his position hours after Kennaex was announced as Hand without notice or requesting to retire in pure defiance, taking the documents he made for the Sphere and destroying them by permanently changing the language they were in out of the dread that Kennaex would take credit for his work like he claimed that he did with Expansion & Diplomacy.
Many thought that he left because he wasn’t given the role of Powerbase himself, but according to him, it was purely because of who actually was chosen.
He was content with being Ancient Knowledge’s Overlord and building it up, but he would not continue being in the Sith Order with Kennaex as Hand.
So he left the Sith Order, and ard1974 became Overlord due to the fact that the Inner Circle had left with Taitus.

Act III: A clean slate.
On the 11th of August, Taitus rejoined the Sith Order after spending some time in the Jedi, his return being welcomed by many that recognised who he was.
On the 14th, he was already an Adept and became Cyrotica’s Apprentice, attaining Knighthood on the 20th.
TaitusTemenos remains as a leader of the Temenos bloodline, an incredibly remarkable bloodline rich with history especially in the Sith Order, due to many members being high ranking and powerful within the Order.
He continues being a respected member of the community and like all futures, his is unknown but he has no choice other than to move forward in anticipation of a bright one.
