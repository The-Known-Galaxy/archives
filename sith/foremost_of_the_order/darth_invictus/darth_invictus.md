# Introduction:
Darth Invictus, also known as kophhii and now LuciferTemenos, is a Darth and Inner Circle member for the sphere of Ancient Knowledge, acting as our Keeper of Records.
Invictus has had a past in many spheres, including the Sphere of Sith Philosophy, Defense and Security, and Ancient Knowledge.
Lucifer is a leader to almost everyone in Ancient Knowledge, and will always be a beloved and remembered figure.

# Biography:
Lucifer and his friends originally joined TSO as a joke, though he found himself enjoying it much more than he originally considered.
He would go on to be the only member out of his friends to move forward in the Order.
After achieving Adept, he would be taken under the wing of thekingdog19, who is no longer a part of the Order.
Invictus’s Knight Trial was hosted by Trofyz, also known as Darth Heisen, and after achieving Knight, he would quickly surpass his master and become a Sentry in the Sphere of Defense and Security.
Unfortunately, with the disbanding of D&S, Lucifer would leave the Sith Order as a whole and begin a new path with the Jedi.
This would be short-lived after he achieved Padawan, as he quickly grew bored and reverted back to the Sith.
With his return, he would be taken in by Darth Audex (Renjaal), and he would grow extremely active in the Sphere of Sith Philosophy (SoP), where he would quickly rise to Overseer after achieving the rank of Sith Harbinger.
As an Overseer, Lucifer would go on to host many KTs, even some for notable figures like Darth Mortiferum (itsthebaker43).
Due to his leadership and effort, he would end up achieving Assistant Headmaster.
His title as the Assistant would be short-lived as he decided to transfer to Ancient Knowledge and begin a new journey there.
Almost immediately after his transfer, on the 26th of June 2022, he would ascend to the rank of Darth due to his leadership and proven dedication.
Since then, he has put non-stop dedication and activity into the sphere and has quite literally been carrying it since his ascension.
I speak for the sphere when I say that we appreciate your hard work.
