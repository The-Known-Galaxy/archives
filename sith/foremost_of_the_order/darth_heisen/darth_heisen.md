# Overview:
Trofyz, formerly known as Darth Heisen, was an Inner Circle member of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and acted as oversight of the Sith Praefects.
Trofyz is remembered as a cherished and respected member of the Sith Order for his activity and likeable personality.
Although retired as a Sith Elder, people continue to speak of him with admiration.

# Biography:
Trofyz joined the Sith Order on the 27th of February, he attended and quickly passed a Rite of Passage hosted by Vesparum and was inducted into the place he would come to leave a legacy for himself.
He passed trainings with ease until he became an Adept on the 2nd of March, 2022.
Afterwards, Vesparum made him an apprentice and on the 19th of March, Trofyz joined the Pyramid of Knighthood as a fully fledged member of the Sith Order, under the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.
He had potential and skill, both of which he would make others recognise he possessed.

On the 31st of March, Trofyz was granted the rank and responsibility of Sith Overseer, now able to host Knight Trials and given authority just below that of a Sith Lord’s.
According to Chilimeni, Trofyz had never done his Advanced Knight Trials prior to becoming an Overseer.
Trofyz worked earnestly as a Sith Overseer, being a main component to bringing the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and its teachers into shape as it had been suffering with inconsistent trainings being hosted.
He began to make a name for himself as he quickly became the most active and reliable Overseer that people could depend on for trainings and trials.
His progression through the ranks stagnated on Overseer.
While people he trained went on to become Lords and even Darths, Trofyz remained an Overseer for a considerable amount of time but he still remained active and a role model within the community for people to look up to.

Eventually, Trofyz was given the rank of Sith Lord which he had put in so much effort for on the 19th of May, to which many celebrated for him as they recognised how much work he had put into the Sith Order.
He had also become the assistant Headmaster of the Sith Academy and managed in the affairs that required his expertise.
It should be noted that before his promotion, the Dark Council reformed Spheres to only hold 3 Inner Circle seats and that Lords would now be a veteran of a specialisation rather than a separate sphere-specific rank.
Trofyz chose to be a Sith Praefect Lord due to the fact he hadn’t been an Advanced Sith Knight before becoming Overseer.
Because of the Sphere reforms, the Inner Circle seats of the sphere of Sith Philosophy were vacant and waiting to be occupied by capable leadership, which Trofyz was overqualified for.
Exactly a month after he had become a Sith Lord, Trofyz ascended to the rank of Darth and gave himself the name of Darth Heisen, a reference to the avatar he usually wears being a cosplay of Walter White from Breaking Bad, who worked under the alias of Heisenberg.

Trofyz lead the Sith Praefects into an age of activity and improvement as he continued to be respected by many in the Sith Order, either hanging out on Dathomir and conversing with other Sith or raiding Ossus.
Trofyz was loved by most, if not all the Sith and even Jedi that knew him as a friendly and casual guy.
He continued to be an active and esteemed member of the Sith Order for a few months until he retired on the 5th of September.
He showed loyalty, commitment, and bravery to the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and the entire Order.
He was succeeded by itsthebaker43, also known as Darth Mortiferum who lost his rank in a kaggath by forfeit.
Trofyz is still remembered and loved by the community.
