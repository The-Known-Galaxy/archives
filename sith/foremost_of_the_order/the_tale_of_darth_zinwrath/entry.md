# Section 1

Prior to Darth Zinwrath’s ascension, Zinwrath progressed through the ranks like any other Sith, however he was the first attendee of the first Right of Passage hosted within the Sith Order, marking a monumental occasion.
Zinwrath continues to diligently serve the Sith Order to this day, almost three years after his original initiation into the Sith Order.

Zinwrath had intended from when he was initiated into the Sith Order, that he would alter the Sphere of Sith Philosophy for the better, and make significant changes to the sphere itself, due to his love for teaching.
This passion within Zinwrath arguably fueled the spark that would allow him to eventually go on to become the Overlord of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy in due time.
His contributions thus far had not gone unnoticed by nor the Dark Council or the Inner Circle of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy, as after reaching the rank of Sith Knight, the Inner Circle agreed to promote him to Sith Inquisitor for his valiant efforts.
However, there was more to this than Zinwrath first initially thought.

Eventually, it would come to pass that Zinwrath would be promoted to Sith Lord by the Inner Circle for his valiant and colossal efforts in reshaping and assisting in leading the Sphere of Sith Philosophy, which marked a monumental occasion for both the Order and Zinwrath himself, as few, including himself, were yet to witness just how monumental Zinwrath’s impact in leadership would ultimately be on the Sith Order.
Not only was he granted the rank of Lord, but also a leadership accolade as recognition for his capabilities in the area.

Some time had passed within the sphere, and Zinwrath continued to do his duties diligently, to which he was then granted the ascension to Darth by the Dark Council for his notable contributions thus far.
The Dark Council had taken note of his contributions, to the extent where Zinwrath was approached by the Dark Lord Valius, and was invited to take a seat upon the Dark Council as the new Overlord of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.
The Sith Order gathered that fateful day in anticipation of the newest member, and they were not disappointed.
Darth Zinwrath continues to serve with rigorous dedication to this day.

Darth Zinwrath once again became the revered Overlord of Sith Philosophy after being re-shifted back to the Sphere of Sith Philosophy after serving as the Overlord of Ancient Knowledge for an extended period of time.
Cheers ensued upon his re-arrival once more as the leader of the sphere which he had progressed in so long ago.
Zinwrath had returned to his home, where he belonged.

# Additional Information

Zinwrath has made many notable contributions toward the Sith Order, which will go down in history and will never be forgotten, such as the opening of the Sith Academy, and winning the Wrath of the Dark Lord tournament.
His many contributions and expertise in the leadership area prompted the valiant Darth to return to the Sphere of Sith Philosophy once more, however this time as the new Overlord, personally invited by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Validus.

His Lordship, Darth Zinwrath, had also spent an abundance of time creating detailed article entries for the Sith Archives under the Sphere of Sith Philosophy, as the Chief Archivist, enriching the archives for the future generations of Sith, whilst simultaneously taking initiative over the oversight of the sphere, as the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge was shut down at the time and merged into Philosophy, However, the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge had no Overlord when it was re-established, which prompted the Dark Council to shift his area of focus to the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, becoming the Overlord until he was prompted to return to Sith Philosophy.
