# Overview
Darth Kaderim, known as AuthenticPurpose, is the current Overlord of the Sphere of Mysteries, and member of the Dark Council.

He became the first Overlord of the reconstituted Sphere of Mysteries after its shutdown back in April 10 2022.
He’s the 2nd ever Sphere of Mysteries’  Overlord, preceded by Morsaki.

# Early days
He became part of The Known Galaxy on the 25th of October 2020 by joining the Jedi Order.
On the 1st of November, he would join the prestigious Temple Guard: it would be there that he’d make plenty of future connections and friendships.
By the 12th of November, he was already a Jedi Knight.
On the 20th of November, he became an Advanced Jedi Knight, specifically a Jedi Guardian.
He would continue serving in the Temple Guard until the 7th of May 2021.



# Brief return
He would return to the Jedi Order on the 28th of August to rejoin the Temple Guard, where he would once again become a Guardian.
His stay would be considerably long until he chose to leave the Jedi Order in the early days of January 2022.
As you may tell, short retirements followed by returns characterize Kaderim's history in the group.
He spent in total about a full year worth of time in The Jedi Order, though he never chose to go further than Jedi Guardian as it wasn’t his desire.

Regardless, during his time in The Jedi Order he'd make plenty of friendships and obtained lots of achievements: such as the two Jedi High Council Accolades of Activity and Kindness.
During the small time spans between rejoining the Jedi Order and entering the temple guard again he covered many roles in the Council of Reconciliation, such as Jedi Investigator, Jedi Peacekeeper and Jedi Watchman.
He'd also reach the fourth place of the second edition of the Duelist Of The Order tournament.



# Becoming a Sith
He turned to the dark side on the 24th of January 2022, joining The Sith Order.

He joined the Sphere of Mysteries on the 29th of January after being taken as an apprentice by Morsaki and has barely changed spheres since.

On the 3rd of February he passed his Knights trials, with his Overseer being xLiamint, defining his ability as “above average”.
Two days later, he received the prized Dark Council Activity Accolade.

On the 6th of February he became a Sith Lord right away, and shortly after he achieved the status of Darth on the 16th of February.
This was due to his stunning contributions to his sphere, thus allowing him to be the first person to enter the Sphere of Mysteries’ Inner Circle.

It is important to mention that during this time, The Sith Order was still fairly small and growing, so large promotions were more frequent.
Having been a former member of the Temple Guard, he had some acquaintances who had also transferred to the Sith, such as his former Chief of Security Vermened, and EscanorTemenos.
It is also important to note that the Sphere of Mysteries was still in its first stages when he joined, as it had been introduced just a few weeks ago, on the 18th of January.
Nevertheless, he did earn all his promotions rightfully with outstanding activity and participation.

He would keep his status as Darth until he briefly retired to Sith Elder on the 7th of March.
He’d return a few weeks later on the 31st of March as an Advanced Sith Knight of the sphere of Defense and Security.



# After the dissolution
On the 10th of April, the dissolution of the Sphere of Mysteries meant for Kaderim the loss of plenty of things: his old sphere of influence, his home, as well as many of the friends he had made in Mysteries… and yet he kept going forward, showing TSO a great example of how perseverance and strong-will lead to greatness.

He would join Laws & Justice’s Interrogators for a brief period in order to join its division - the newly formed "Order of the Oracle" - on the 18th of April 2022.
The leader of the Order of the Oracle would also just so happen to be Morsaki, his past Overlord.

Just when things were seeming to improve again though, his division leader, former Overlord, and former master Morsaki would cease being a part of the Order on the 24th of April.
As a result, his division leader would be replaced by PurposeMalvern, who would remain the highest rank of the Order of the Oracle until its dissolution.



# His time in the Order of the Oracle
While his time in the Order of the Oracle was short as it would be shut down briefly after, he still describes it as a fantastic division with a very great ambience.
To quote his own words, he has been briefly interviewed about the Order of the Oracles.

> “It was quite..
united at times.
However, the general feeling I understood from my time as assisted lead in Oracles, the high ranks and low ranks were very divided and there really wasn't enough communication at times.
The high command was definitely more active than the entry-level ranks of the division, which led to some activity issues.
I believe as of today, Mysteries is more functional, although Oracles’ job was a lot more hands-on and present in-game, which was something I appreciated.”



# The return of Mysteries
On the 8th of May the Sphere of Mysteries was reintroduced (the Order of the Oracle was shut down on the same day), and Authentic was appointed as its Overlord by the Dark Council itself.
As of today, 18th of September 2022, he has no intentions to retire anytime soon, and continues to serve as the Sphere of Mysteries’ widely supported Overlord.
And all his Inner Circle members and operatives find him to be a fantastic leader, who may even hold his position for the years to come.

As for what exactly he does in his sphere that makes him such an efficient, skilled and beloved by his subordinates Overlord… 

Well, it's a Mystery.
