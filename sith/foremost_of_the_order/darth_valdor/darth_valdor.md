# Biography:
ValorisMalvern, currently known as BriceHavelock at the time, began his journey in TJO after his friend iArchangel showed it to him.
Brice was already fond of the genre and was quick to join.
He didn't put a lot of effort into TJO originally, though he still had a passion to rank up.
This changed when he discovered that the TSO was opening and they were opening a division for the Dark Honor Guard.
This immediately piqued his interest and he spoke to the current Commandant at the time, LucifersWrath, about securing a spot in it.
He was ranked Initiate almost instantly and received the rank of Guardsmen after assisting with the original DHG tryouts.

Valdor has only participated in one Kaggath during his tenure in TSO, that being KennaexMalvern vs CaesarTemenos.
He was the commander at the time, and led the DHG into battle against Defence and Security.
The DHG lost 0-3, and Valdor takes partial blame for this, though he did put a lot more focus on team fighting within the DHG after this.
Valdor has made many friends, and despite having a rocky relationship with TKG, he is happy with all of the friends he has made along the way.



# Community Words:
EscanorTemenos - Valoris, is more than just an amazing Leader, he's a really good friend, he has always been helping me when I needed help, and though I must say the lad did lead the guard for a long while before I became his successor he had seen great and bad times within the order.
Overall, he is a great friend, an amazing leader, and a person you can always rely on when needed.


AstarothTemenos - He’s a very good friend to those who have befriended him.
He is an excellent and very helpful leader, and he’s been a role model to me and ray.
There isn’t very much for me to say except that he calls the shots in DHG and they’re very well made

Bobdavejimmy - Valoris is an amazing leader, he has served in the Dark Honor Guard for an extensive amount of time and currently is the oldest member within the Guard.
He continues to do great things and helps improves the guard to the best of his ability, ever since I joined the Dark Honor Guard he had been such an amazing leader, he was kind and nice no matter what rank or status you held, he was always chill and not getting angry or mad at others, he knows how and when to be strict which allows people to respect his orders that he hands out.
Valoris is one of the reasons why the Dark Honor Guard is currently at its greatest moments in time here in The Sith Order.
He has earned my utmost respect and I am proud that I served under him from his time as Commander all the way to Hand of the Dark Lord.
Even now he has not changed and continues to improve both Dark Honor Guard and The Sith Order, he is one of TSOs best leaders.
