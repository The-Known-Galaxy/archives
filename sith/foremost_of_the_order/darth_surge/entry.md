# Biography Overview

Darth Surge, formerly called “Darth Sorg” was the first Sith Knight under Darth Validus and one of the founding fathers of the Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy.
He began training near the Jedi Sanctum, taken unofficially as WieldingDesire’s, otherwise known as the butcher of the Jedi’s apprentice.
They laid siege together to the famous Jedi Academy, along with the raiding party “Ventarri”, forming a connection to the Dark Side.
He’s currently one of the most feared and ruthless Dark Councilors, renowned for his dashing quick strikes and his devastating, powerful blows in lightsaber combat.
To the Jedi, he’s one of the most dangerous adversaries there can be.
A machine replaces half of his face, giving him a more terrifying look.

# History

Before the birth of the Sith Order in the community, Darth Surge came across The Known Galaxy by joining SilverStallions, a veteran of the Jedi Temple Guard.
As an hostile in the game, he began an unofficial apprenticeship under WieldingDesire after meeting the first time.
Together they caused a lot of trouble to the Jedi, and had fun in the process, using the Jedi Sanctum to its full extent to ambush from the shadows, using chandeliers in the archives or any other structure found inside the temple.
They fought in every possible location in the Sanctum, along with a small raiding party known as “Ventarri”, always yearning for the existence of a Sith Order.
After some time, Surge stumbled upon the first version of the Sith Order, before it was truly put into use, joining it under the reign of Fedlz, raiding the Jedi alongside Sith Wraith KentuckySquid, TaitusMydrek \[TaitusTemenos\] and FerrumCaesar \[CaesarTemenos\].

# From entering the Order to IC of E&D

Once Darth Surge joined the Sith Order as a Hopeful, he enjoyed the increasing strength and power the Sith were having during raids.
He knew where he was headed: The Sphere of Sith Philosophy.
However, he was denied entry there, so on 11/11/2021 he chose to join a private tryout hosted by Darth Kennaex.
After a well-fought battle, he won a 3v1 fight in the process during gladiator duels, with one of his opponents being the former Dark Honor Guard commander, SanctusTenebris.
Kennaex handed Surge an invitation to the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy, which then earned him the rank of Sith Knight in the Order, and Raider of Expansion & Diplomacy.
The first few days in the Sphere were almost completely combat-based, if not 100% combat-based.
He tried his best to remain at the top of his game, defeating the majority of contestants and acquiring both the Combat Prowess accolade and the Wrath of the Dark Lord title.
He had a bit of a hard time ascending to Juggernaut, as the rank required leadership, which he was taught after countless raids together with Kennaex, along with Caesar and Taitus.
After earning the rank of Warrior, and soon after Juggernaut, he continued to work well for E&D.
This time is referred to as the golden age of the Sphere, as it was more of a group and family than an actual Sphere.
Every time he went on a raid, he became better and better, and after a long time of promised seats inside of the IC, he was eventually on the day 11/27/2021 appointed alongside Caesar as Sith Lord, and Inner Circle member of the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy, overseeing recruitment, propaganda and tryouts.
Shortly after, on the day 12/11/2021 he earned the rank of Darth and became Darth Sorg, now known as Darth Surge.
Around this time Darth Kennaex became Hand of the Dark Lord, with Taitus as his successor and Overlord of E&D.
