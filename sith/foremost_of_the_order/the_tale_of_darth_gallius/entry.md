# Overview:

The loud yelling and banter of crowds gathered among the sacred throneroom of Darth Validus, a space nobody was normally allowed in.
The Dark Honour Guardsmen stood solemnly at each corner and each entrance, it was a time of merit and honour.
Members of each Sphere were given accolades for their efforts and contributions, some recognised for their combat prowess, others for their involvement in events.
But that time had passed.
Now, lines of Sith stood shoulder to shoulder, in anxiety, in anticipation, and in excitement.
There would be new Sith Lords announced, new leaders of the Order who would lead it into greatness and victory, who would bring the enemies of the Sith to their knees and execute them as was their right.
Among the crowd, members of Ancient Knowledge gathered.
Few in numbers, yet united, all the same, one of them was pessimistic about the ceremony.
He had already been denied the recognition of an accolade yet again, his chances slim and hopes draining.
He was Overseer ShokuMatsu, a Curator of Ancient Knowledge and someone recognised throughout the Sphere as active and the assistant of Darth Invictus.
But, Darth Invictus was no longer present throughout the ranks of the Sith; having vanished in what he called a pursuit of artefacts and undiscovered secrets, he was essentially a dead man.

Shoku stood among those familiar and unfamiliar, people he personally knighted and people he had shared just a few words with.
As Darth Validus sat on the throne, peering down on the masses with his single eye, the members of the Dark Council stood in front of the throne, all exuding their power.
The eight most powerful Sith in the galaxy were all gathered.
The Dark Lord cleared his throat and began to speak, every Sith went silent in both fear, reverence, and respect.

“It is now time for the promotion of members to be announced.
I believe Darth Nödt should be the first to share the news.”

Darth Validus peered down at the hooded Dark Councilor, his arms crossed and his stare over the lines of people intent.
His eyes met Shoku’s, once a new Curator taken under Darth Invictus’ now an experienced member of the Sith who others confided in for guidance.
A true successor for the lost Keeper of Records.
Darth Nödt spoke loudly and clearly for all to hear, to listen in on who would be promoted in Ancient Knowledge.

“It is indeed an honour and a pleasure for me to announce not a new Lord, but a new Darth of Ancient Knowledge.
He has shown resilience, he has taken initiative, and he has proven himself to be a worthy replacement for his predecessor.
ShokuMatsu, I hereby grant you the title of Darth and name you Darth Gallius.
Go forth and preserve the secrets of the Sith, destroy our enemies, and bring glory to the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge as the new Keeper of Records.”

Silence still filled the room for a few seconds, until thunderous cheering and applause was made in honour of the new Darth.
Members of other Spheres, people who appreciated him, his comrades, and his supporters all celebrated in support.
