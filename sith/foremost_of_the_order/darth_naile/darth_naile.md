# The Jedi Order:
Darth Naile, also known as VenificusTemenos or Rav, began his journey long ago in another Sith Order outside of this one.
On his journey, he discovered a peculiar group of hostilities infiltrating the homeworld of this Order.
The sheer skill of this team led Rav to seek out this team, which he would soon learn was the Jedi Assault team of TiberiusMalverns TJO.
Rav quickly swept through the youngling ranks of TJO with one goal in mind, which was to join the Jedi Assault team.
Rav was brought under a close friend's wing as a Padawan, and Rav quickly fell in love with The Jedi Order, between the beautiful Sanctum map and the excellent R5 saber mechanics, he quickly became an active part of the Order.
Rav was unable to join the JAT as a Padawan due to being focused on becoming a Knight and having no time.
His trials were hosted by none other than Darth Havok (OmegaVanquished), during the time he was a Jedi Master.
After achieving Knight, he became focused on joining the JAT, which would be harder for him than you would expect.
After finally getting a tryout, he had to leave halfway through due to an exam, where he then had to answer multiple questions in DM’s.
Though, he did end up making it.

Ravs first of many advanced Knight specializations fell under the Jedi Paladins, where he quickly grew bored due to an endless cycle of fighting, fighting, and fighting.
Master SanctusTenebris saw Ravs lack of motivation, and decided to take advantage of it.
He quickly recruited Rav into the Lightsaber Instructor team, where Rav would once again lose motivation due to a lack of participation from Skaxon after the retirement of Sanctus.
Rav was promoted to Instructor after voicing his complaints, though he soon hit another roadblock after Skaxons ascension to High Council brought more poor leadership to the LI’s.

Due to the time and effort Rav had put forward into TJO, he did not wish to leave, so he once again switched specs and became a Jedi Peacekeeper.
Unfortunately, Peacekeepers became a Temple Security Force rank, leaving them to be replaced by Jedi Praecepters.
These were a group of Jedi that focused primarily on Leadership classes in the Jedi Service Corps.
Rav was granted the opportunity to teach many prominent members as a Praecepter, some of which include Nov_Kalazar, ValiantPrice, ValiosNix, and other modern-day members.

Ravs leadership and competency showed.
On October 3rd, 2021, Rav was invited into a VC by Skaxon, where he was offered the position of Head Watchmen, where he would be tasked with reviving the specialization left in ruins by the incompetent ShadowNevix.
Rav jumped at the opportunity, and Rav would end up making many huge changes for the Watchmen that eventually led to its revival.
It was Ravs idea to split the Watchmen into Two: Watchmen Trialers and Archivists.
Trialers prioritized hosting Mock Knight Trials on the I2's, while the Archivists focused on a big spreadsheet dedicated to track all I2 and Instructor activity.
This led to a flow of steady and active Watchmen.

As expected, Ravs amazing leadership abilities paid off.
On the 29th of November, 2021, Rav was brought into a VC by the Master of the Order, WolfSupport, where he was then offered a position on the High Council due to his excellent work with the Watchmen.
As a High Councillor, Rav oversaw the entirety of the Council of Reassignment.


While many saw Rav as a great leader, he was unfortunately exiled on April 9, 2022, after rumors of a toxic workplace arised.
This broke Ravs heart, he was extremely sad to be brought down from the position he worked so hard in for months, but luckily was convinced by some friends like BladedTemenos and Kelub_Zero to begin a new journey in TSO.

# The Sith Order:
Due to words of encouragement from his friends, Rav decided to start a new path in The Sith Order.
Rav wanted to prove that he could still be a good person and leader, and he never had any malicious intent.
Upon entering the Order, he was greeted with pure love, even from those who had shown disdain in the past.
This was the opposite of what Rav expected, though he was pleasantly surprised.
Ravs journey from an Acolyte to Knight is mainly irrelevant as he just focused on progressing in the Order rather than making an image at the time.

Rav has spent the entirety of his TSO journey in the Sphere of Laws and Justice, joining as soon as he achieved Apprenticeship from AdhesiveMaple.
Ravs goal in L&J was to prevent others from having the same downfall as him.
Pretty much as soon as he could, he took his ASK trials with the current Interrogator Overseer, Kelub_Zero.
Rav has made a huge mark within Interrogators, working on multiple cases while also juggling consistent law seminars, and Interrogators at the time could vouch that he was doing an amazing job.

Ravs activity also expanded into Order of the Loremaster, where he would recieve the Dark Knowledge accolade due to some excellent pieces written by him.
Some examples include First Jedi Purge, Ritual of Nathema, and the Dread Wars.
Inevitably, some members of the Order were unhappy with Ravs appearance and planned to handicap him on his way up.
This only motivated Rav further, and with the retirement of the Interrogator Overseer, Rav took the opportunity to assist the Overlord in any way possible.
This would lead to Ravs eventual ascension to Sith Lord on July 10, next to UnholyPurpose and ShokuMatsu.

After months of hard work, Ravs dedication to the Interrogators finally paid off.
On August 14, 2022, Rav was crowned Interrogator Overseer and took the title of Darth Naile.
He immediately began updating Interrogator documents, assisting with Interrogator needs, and creating scripts to assist with their duties.
Nailes excellent leadership and activity showed, and every Interrogator loves him and appreciates him for all he has done.
At this point, Naile had obviously proven that he had changed, and this paid off when he was brought into a VC and announced the newest L&J Overlord.
Naile has certainly proven his ability, and he is now a community favorite.
