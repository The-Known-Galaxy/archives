# A Rapid Ascension

Darth Penumbra was a Dark Councillor and Overlord of the Sphere of Law & Justice (L&J).
She started off as a Hopeful, just like all Sith, she then ascended her way through the ranking system of the Sith.
Before that, she had to achieve the rank of Adept.
She completed all of her training and she quickly ascended to the rank of Adept, within three days.
As an Adept, she quickly became an Apprentice as well.
She was on a good path so far, ascending really quickly.
As an Apprentice she served her Master, who was Sith Warrior AdhesiveMaple, to the best of her abilities and she finished her Knight Trials within four days on her first attempt.
However, after becoming a Sith Knight, Penumbra decided to remain there for a while.
She joined the L&J a little while earlier and she would remain there for the rest of her time within the Order.

# Dedication to Laws and Justice:

Once she became Sith Knight, Penumbra dedicated a lot of her time to the Sphere of Law & Justice.
She desired to become an Inquisitor but remained a Sith Knight for a while longer.
After waiting a long time, Penumbra decided it was time to ascend to Inquisitor.
She served as an Inquisitor for less than a month before getting promoted to Sith Lord.
As a Sith Lord, Penumbra continued to dedicate her time to her Sphere and would achieve the rank of Darth not long after.
When she got Lord, she was also given the title of Chief Interrogator due to her knowledge in the area.
She was Lord for about a month and one week and then she ascended to Darth.
She was later given the rank of Keeper of Records a month after receiving Darth.
All in all, she was rapidly ascending and spending a lot of time serving L&J.
During her time in L&J she made some great contributions, she assisted in stabilizing the Warden implementation within L&J.
Before, Wardens used to be Enforcers and had different duties but that changed with the help of Penumbra.
Not only this, but Penumbra also is the reason why Interrogators get the right to prosecute, it used to just be Ravagers.
Penumbra achieved the rank of Dark Councillor not long after getting the Keeper of Records.
As Dark Councillor, Penumbra hosted a lot of L&J events like Lord of the Drip.
She also had a lot of apprentices during her time in the Sith Order.
The ones that passed were Erelil, ORN_Xarr95, KelubPanik, Yamota_Kaminishi, Konstyentyn, and Aryajaal, She taught each to the best of her abilities and helped them ascend to Sith Knight.
Now, Penumbra recently retired and is a Sith Elder, not long after being challenged to a humiliation Kaggath.
She was very busy so she had to forfeit the Kaggathand retire as Dark Councillor and Overlord.
She also didnâ€™t believe the reasoning behind the Kaggath was acceptable.
During her time in the Order, she also achieved many accolades, such as Activity Accolade, Leadership Accolade, and Defender of the Order.
