# Overview
In the Sith order, Darth Hestiva, also known as ZedaliosTemenos, is regarded as the Commander of the Dark Honour Guard.
She has performed incredible responsibilities for the Honour Guard, demonstrating strength, loyalty, and—most importantly—activity in both the Dark Honour Guards and the Sith communication server.
As a result, she is one of the most well-known Darths in the Sith order.

# Beginnings
Like everyone else, Darth Hestiva began as a hopeful and has worked hard for days and weeks to advance.
Eventually, after much searching, she has located a Master who is known as an Elder, Daedima.
Darth Hestiva has finally joined a sphere that was a presently Deleted Sphere Defense and Security after her search for a Master came to an end.
Darth Hestiva determined the Sphere of Defense and Security was not for her after rising to the rank of Sith Knight, which is why she chose to depart from it and start her journey in the Sphere of Laws and Justice.



# Journey in L&J
She worked very hard to rise to her ideal rank at the moment, the rank of Sith Warden, shortly after joining the Sphere of Laws and Justice.
She was successful in this endeavor as she reached that rank in less than a month and started on her true voyage.
Darth Hestiva encountered several helpful persons throughout her stay at Laws and Justice, one of which was a former overlord of the Sphere named Darth Pnumbera, who has assisted Darth Hestiva with all of her inquiries since day one.
Continuing on, when Darth Hestiva served the Sphere of Laws and Justice, she became close friends with Darth Raithon, and Darth Kelevomer, the current Overlord of L&J .
She first met both of them when they were still newly minted Sith Knights.
   

Darth Hestiva performed admirably for her Sphere since she adhered to the Sith Doctrine nearly perfectly and made sure that no crime went unpunished.Darth Hestiva was previously removed as a teacher due to inactivity in the past, but she was persuaded to rejoin the teaching programme.
Darth Hestiva was offered an Assistant Overseer programme not long after receiving her Sith Order Academy certificate, allowing her to further develop her teaching skills.
After several acolyte training sessions and Knighthood trials, Darth Hestiva has finally been raised to the position of Sith Overseer.
When things draw to a close, she made the decision to depart Laws and Justice since her desire to educate upcoming Sith generations had won out.



# Entering SoP
Darth Hestiva has finally joined the Sphere of Philosophy, where she may now pursue her passion for teaching, which at the time was her favorite activity.
She has found that joining SoP has opened up a variety of opportunities for her because soon after joining, she was promoted to the level of Sith Preafect, which allowed her to conduct Korriban excursions for Acolytes 3.
 Darth Hestiva wasn't the only one who decided to switch to SoP; her friend Darth Cervisa had to do the same.
This was the beginning of Darth Hestiva and Darth Cervisa's race to Lord.
 Darth Cervisa won after a long battle with those two, which fueled Darth Hestiva's determination to completely flip the script.



# Entering DHG
After being in SoP for a month, Darth Hestiva was finally persuaded by her good friend Commander Aracnum to join the Dark Honour Guards.
 Darth Hestiva passed her Dark Honour Guard tryout the first time, indicating that she is now a Dark Honour Guard Initiate.
Darth Hestiva knew the guard was a place for her after being promoted to a Dark Honour Guard Guardsman, as she had settled down there quite quickly.
 Darth Hestiva has made very good friends with Captain ValiosNix after being in the guard for a few weeks, as he was generally a mentor for her and he is the one who taught Darth Hestiva what to do while being a Dark Honour Guard.
 


When she was promoted to Senior Guardsman, she was generally noticed by our Powerbase Darth Valdor, as the two began having many friendly DHG-related conversations.
 She was promoted to corporal not long after being promoted to Senior Guardsman, allowing her to demonstrate her abilities.
After numerous rank advancements, she had finally attained the rank of Dark Honour Captain following the retirement of her mentor ValiosNix.
She had demonstrated numerous leadership skills, bravery, and loyalty to the guard as a Captain.
As time passed, the current Commander of the Guard retired, allowing Darth Hestiva to be promoted to her current position.
