# A Juggernaut in the Making:
Darth Strages was a powerful Sith Lord.
His combat skills were impeccable and he defeated anyone that opposed him.
He wasn’t always a Sith Lord, however.
He started his journey as a Hopeful and made his way to Adept.
He excelled in combat and would find himself joining the Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy (E&D).
Firstly, he had to pass his other training and achieve the rank of Adept.
He did this efficiently and would soon become a Sith Adept.
As an Adept he already knew who his master would be, the legendary Darth Surge, the oldest Dark Councillor in the Order.
Surge taught Strages to the best of his ability and Strages did his Knight Trials within 4 days of being an apprentice, he passed on his first try.
Strages’ next goal was to become a Sith Juggernaut and so he practised for his Warrior trials.
Strages easily ascended to the rank of Warrior, he became a Warrior within the minimum amount of time as well, which is two weeks.
As a Sith Warrior, Strages showed a lot of combat skills and dedicated his time to E&D.
In exactly a month later, Strages was given the title of Sith Lord.

# The Inner Circle:
During his time within the Order, Strages successfully trained 4 apprentices, KingOfDeaths0, Pyramidial, DragonFluffy, and EternalCodite.
He taught them all to the best of his abilities, just like his Master taught him well.
After becoming a Sith Lord, Strages dedicated even more time to E&D.
He was given the titles of Warlord and Assistant Blade Master.
These titles were given to those who led the Juggernauts and made sure that no E&D members were falling behind in their combat abilities.
He excelled in these tasks and four months later he would be rewarded.
After serving as a Sith Lord for four months, Strages was finally promoted to Darth and remained in the Inner Circle.
As Darth, Strages would become the Keeper of Records and did a lot of behind the scenes work for E&D.
As Keeper of Records, Strages was given the privilege of hosting E&D tryouts every Wednesday.
With this privilege, he was also given the opportunity to supervise all Neophyte Instructors, a rank given to lower rank individuals who would host E&D tryouts whenever Strages was busy.
The most important thing Strages does is he takes care of the Sith Order notion page.
Strages makes sure that all rules, strategic information, the archives, and logging activity are  up to date.
Strages does his best to help the Order and he excels in combat, hence why he was given the legendary Dark Council Combat Prowess Accolade.
Strages continues to serve E&D and the Order to the best of his ability and still exceeds  his duty as Keep of Records.
