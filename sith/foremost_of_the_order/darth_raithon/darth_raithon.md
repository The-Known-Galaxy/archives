# One-time-Guard
Darth Raithon is a member of the Sphere of Law and Justice’s Inner Circle.
He’s dedicated most of his time in the Sith Order to serving the Sphere of Law and Justice.
However, he started his career in the Sith Order by serving the Dark Lord of the Sith as one of the Dark Honor Guards.
Raithon spent a little while with the Guards, but he didn’t always want to serve the Guards.
Not long after, Raithon joined the Sphere of Law and Justice after spending some time in the Dark Honor Guards.
Raithon always believed that laws should be obeyed because of their benefits to the Order.

# Law Enforcer:
At first, Raithon needed to find someone who was willing to train him in the Dark Side of the Force so he could grow powerful.
Eventually, he went through two masters, AlexanderPurpose and PhantomPurpose, before becoming a Sith Knight of the Order on July 9.
He served the Sphere of Law and Justice as a Sith Knight and continued to ascend within the Sphere.
Eventually, he achieved the rank of Advanced Sith Knight on July 30 and became a Sith Warden.
During his time in the Sphere of Law and Justice, Raithon achieved the most arrests in the entire Sith Order history, which goes to show he was very dedicated.
Around two months after achieving the rank of Warrior, Raithon was bestowed with an even bigger role in the Sith Order.
After all his hard work and dedication towards his Sphere, Raithon finally ascended to Sith Lord.
He was Lord for a few months and tried his best to help Enforcers reach the rank of Sith Warrior/Wardens.
During his time he also attended a few leadership meetings and remained active in the Sith order community.
Not long after, Raithon finally achieved the rank of Darth and serves as an Inner Circle member of the Sphere Law and Justice.
He is the Overseer of Wardens and his goal is to inspire Enforcers to become Wardens.
During his time he was also known in his Sphere for creating a few regulations and forms for the Sphere and the order as a whole.
He works with his Overlord, Darth Naile, to make new rules for the betterment of the Order’s community.
He never focussed on training any apprentices, he only ever trained them so he could achieve Warrior.
However, due to his incredible activity and leadership skills within his respected Sphere, Raithon achieved the Dark Council Leadership and Activity Accolades for his hard work.
Raithon still serves the Order as an Inner Circle member of his Sphere and he promotes activity within Law and Justice.
