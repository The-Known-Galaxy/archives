# Lore of Darth Tacitus
With a legendary obsession with knowledge and power, Darth Tacitus had established himself as one of the most prominent Darths in his time.
Rising through the ranks to become a Loremaster Of Ancient Knowledge, he was even selected for the inner circle of Sphere of Philosophy  - yet all too soon disappeared mysteriously before the Sith Empire's Great Galactic War broke out, leaving behind an aura of mystery that has never been solved.
In pursuit for answers hidden within The Force itself which nobody else had discovered priorly; it seemed like no obstacle could stand against this powerful being ...
until suddenly: He vanished from sight without warning or explanation.

He was a renowned scholar, unlocking secrets of Force abilities thought to have been lost forever.
But his name soon became synonymous with domination and tyranny, as he used powerful manipulation techniques to bend those around him to their knees in submission - no matter the cost.
Tales spread throughout the galaxy told dark stories of this figure who seemed capable of controlling any mind that crossed his path; tales which even today still remain embedded deep into history’s narrative.

Tacitus was a brilliant and powerful Darth, nurturing his apprentices Cheifzac, Sincerespirit, Samsungcharger, Worlock365, Renjaal, Lil_ninjy, Revjaal, Aappamo3757, Malgorr.
Into becoming mighty Sith warriors and infamous inquisitors.
With their terrifying strength they banded together to form a fanatical cult devoted exclusively to furthering Tacitus' teachings - an unstoppable force loyally dedicated only towards attaining more power for him.

Darth Tacitus was a formidable foe against anyone brave enough to cross blades with him.
His superior knowledge of lightsaber techniques combined with his instinctive understanding of the Force made for an unbeatable combination on any battlefield, so much so some claimed it seemed almost magical.
He disappeared without warning leading up to The Great Galactic War and remained lost during its duration, leaving as deep a mystery surrounding his fate as there had been when he first mastered combat arts that defied expectation.
