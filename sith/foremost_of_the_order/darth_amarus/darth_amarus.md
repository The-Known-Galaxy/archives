# History
Darth Amarus started out as a Hopeful, just like everyone does.
She worked hard to climb through the ranks, finding a master, SamuelFederov, who would then drop her when she failed her Knight Trials.
She would then be taken by Brolion1, who finally got her through the Trials, and thus she became a Sith Knight.
While she was an Adept, Amarus first joined the Sphere of Laws and Justice, but then switched to Defense and Security after being recommended by her master and levithegamer.
Once the Sphere shut down, she, along with her master, instead joined the Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy, where she’d spend a lot of time along with other prominent E&D members, becoming a Sorcerer in 2 months.
After a while, she decided to join the Dark Honor Guard, thinking it would be an interesting experience.
This was her favorite time in The Sith Order, as the Guard was a much more fitting place for her and she generally felt way better back then.
However, when people started leaving and it started to drop in activity, Amarus decided to change again and progress in rank somewhere else, so she went back to the Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy.
Sadly, the Sphere just wasn’t the same as it was before, so after staying as an Inquisitor for a long while, she decided to leave and join the Sphere of Mysteries.
She felt really welcomed in it, and she met people like Darth Tythen, Darth Vederium, bekon, jason and GoldenFreddyy (who also hosted her Knight Trials).
Throughout her time in the Sphere, she worked really hard, executing her tasks very quickly and thus earning the rank of Sith Lord after some time.
Once Darth Vederium suddenly retired, she had to take over, becoming the new Savant Overseer and Inner Circle member of the Sphere.
In her 2 weeks as part of the SoM Inner Circle, she’s taken over the Savants and recruited three new ones, all being great and active members of the Sphere, whom she often talks to.
