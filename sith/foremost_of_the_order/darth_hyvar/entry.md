# Overview

ChampaaiTemenos  joined in late November and attended the first ever E&D tryout.
He passed alongside Nov_Kalazar and BasilieusTemenos.
Champaai had a successful and enjoyable time in E&D, and eventually became a Lord.
He worked under CaesarTemenos for quite some time until he got the opportunity to build D&S.
After Caesar took this opportunity he became the Grand Sorcerer.
After Champaai had a falling out with TaitusTemenos (my master / overlord of e&d), he transferred to D&S.
Shortly after Caesar granted him the title of Darth.
D&S was in shambles and it was doomed from the beginning due to the lack of people in leadership positions.
I helped fix that problem and shortly after it prospered.

Caesar wanted to kaggath KennaexMalvern for Hand of the Dark Lord as he was not doing his job properly.
He was one of his loyal men that helped him through thick and thin.
(Fun fact: if we lost the kaggath Kennaex would have demoted everyone that was Lord+ to ASK for 2 weeks as a punishment.) Champaai became the Overlord when Caesar won the Kaggath and wanted to increase D&S their value within our community.
This was not liked by other spheres and a mutiny was being orchestrated.
Darth Hyvar wanted to retire after the sphere he helped grow turnt against him.
But Caesar gave me an offer to give the Dark Honor Guard a try and Champaai  accepted.
DHG was doing really well since a lot of veterans were in the high ranks: UnforceTemenos, MartinTLincoln, TaitusTemenos, and eventually Champaai became a Sergeant.
One month after becoming a Sergeant he did not enjoy DHG as much, since I love communicating with our beloved community and the only way he could really do it was by utilizing our discord.
I received an Inner Circle position in SoM and Darth Hyvar was back again, but  ended up retiring 2 weeks after.
Champaai had a really good run as a Lord/Darth and he served the Sith Order for around 5 months.
ChampaaiTemenos made a lot of good friends and it was time for me to leave.
But, he unretired 3 months after a lot of his old friends came back and he found a will to try again.
ChampaaiTemenos currently serves as an Interrogator under the Sphere of Law and Justice.
