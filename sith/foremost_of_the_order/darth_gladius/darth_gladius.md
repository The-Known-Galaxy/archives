# History
Darth Gladius has done many cases in his interrogator era within L&J.
He went onto D&S to host many training sessions and lead shamans alongside reworking old handbooks for shamans.
In L&J, he went on to host a LOTD event and he was also in the process of renewing the old executioner handbook and then he got kicked out due to some issues.
He has participated in the first kaggath ever on champaign's side.
He was also going to participate in CaesarTemenos vs KannaexMalvern kaggath.
Darth Gladius resigned his pledge to prevent rumors from spreading at the time.
He was joining D&S and leaving L&J.
Darth Gladius also participated in OmegaVanquished vs ChampaaiTemenos humiliation kaggath as well as, ManlyLavaMan kaggath him for his rank, but all of his pledges resigned due to him having IC on his side alongside with many other supporters with him.
Darth Gladius ended up dominating the kaggath.
To join L&J the whole reason for the prosecution process and DiabolusTenebris being his master encouraged him into joining it and then to D&S because he had enough with L&J.
It's a poor system as he did most stuff within the spheres when others were inactive and yet it took him so long to get Lord and he also had to teach an interrogator how to prosecute even though the one hosting the tribunal.
Being the overseer of the sphere didn’t teach the said person anything about her job so it was only him having a grudge.
