# Humble Beginnings:

Just like all Sith, Darth Nödt started his journey as a Hopeful.
As a new Known Galaxy player, Darth Nödt only spent a little amount of time playing the game, and only ever really played when there was a training so he could rank up.
He ascended to the rank of Adept within a few days, but from there his Known Galaxy path came to a short halt.
Roughly 21 days later, which was 02/24/2022, Darth Nödt joined his first Sphere, it was none other than the Sphere of Defense & Security (D&S).
Before joining D&S, Darth Nödt hadn’t a clue of what Sphere he was going to join, it was only when D&S tryouts happened and he was bored and online, he decided.
Sadly, he faced internet difficulties and struggled to join tryouts causing him to fail his first attempt.
Fortunately, ChampaaiTemenos kindly offered Darth Nödt a special D&S tryout on a private server.
Champaai saw the potential the young Sith Adept had and he succeeded in the tryout.
He was an official member of the ancient D&S.

# A Test of Loyalty

Darth Nödt served as the apprentice of Champaai and was determined to become a Knight and Centurion.
He was inspired by Champaai to accomplish the goal of freedom as a Knight and only served as an apprentice for a 7-day period of time.
After serving Champaai, his ambition was put aside because along came a new threat, one that would change Darth Nödt’s path and end Champaai’s reign as D&S Overlord.
The Kaggath arrived.
Brolion challenged Champaai to a Kaggath, and Darth Nödt already knew what side to join.
Nödt, as a gift to his former master for his support in both passing tryouts and ascending, was to pledge allegiance in this kaggath.
Champaai was defeated.
Brolion was titled Overlord of D&S.
What about Nödt?
Het continued to serve D&S for a while and noticed they were in need of Shamans.
He quickly ascended to the rank of Inquisitor to help out the Sphere.
This choice would forever change his views and lead him to a more difficult path.

# Change in Paths:

Nödt had a very powerful ally, an ally that changed his path.
This ally was none other than the Dark Councillor and Overlord of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy, Darth Zinwrath the wise.
The connection he had with such a powerful being would allow him to join the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and obtain a prestigious role.
Nödt joined the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and was a part of the Order of the Loremaster, which was how he formed the connection with Zin.
Nödt’s literature skills are quite impressive and that’s why he joined the Order of the Loremaster.
Nödt started to provide more literary skills rather than combative skills.
He ended up becoming a Harbinger, which made him more mature and changed his personality.
As a Harbinger, Nödt became more mature, he acted more professionally and he learned how to act towards the lower ranks of the community.
Once again, Nödt was faced with a difficult path.
The Dark Council saw Nödt’s abilities and on 05/08/2022 the Spheres were reformed.
The Dark Council had allowed Nödt to choose between remaining in the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and obtaining a prestigious rank or to remain in the division he served as the oldest member and one in which he already attained a secondary leadership position, the reformed Sphere of Ancient Knowledge.
Nödt contemplated this difficult decision for a while, but we all know how it turns out.
Nödt chose to remain in the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge because of his familiarity with how the system works and his intellectual skills.
Nödt was a very helpful person and chose to pursue another path, the Sith Academy.
He taught at the Academy for a while and quickly ascended to the rank of Overseer.
Unfortunately, Nödt faced a few unexpected circumstances and wasn’t able to perform at his best sometimes.
However, he also ascended to the rank of Lord and had to give up his position as Overseer.
Luckily for me, Nödt, before he became Lord, was able to host what would be his final Knight Trials.
Nödt hosted my Knight Trials and that would be the last Knight Trial he would ever host, I am ever thankful for that.

# Rise of Darth Nödt:

Something unexpected happened, Darth Lividus, the Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, left the Order not long after his Inner Circle member, Darth Audax.
All that was left was Martin, Unforce and Darth Nödt.
Sadly, Martin and Unforce also left the Order, which led the Sphere into chaos.
The Dark Council set up Overlord applications and Nödt applied to become Overlord.
Luckily, Nödt became the new Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and Dark Councillor.
This was odd because Nödt was a mere Lord, but his skills and dedication to the Sphere benefitted him very well and he was rewarded with the rank of Overlord.
Nödt rose to become a great Overlord of our Sphere and has served Ancient Knowledge to the best of his abilities.
Nödt changed a few rules in the Sphere that benefitted us and has been trying his best as Overlord.
Nödt still serves as the Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge to this day and has done many things for us, such as introducing accolades and purges that motivate us to do our required tasks.
Nödt currently serves as the third oldest Dark Councillor and is very experienced.
He has taught the Sphere well.
