# The Honor Guard:

Darth Carmesi was an influential and respected Sith Lord.
He was an Inner Circle member of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and served the Sphere for months, dedicating every bit of free time to the Sphere.
He started his journey off as every Sith, a Hopeful during October 2021.
He found himself joining the Dark Honor Guards and he worked his way through the rank of the Guards.
Carmesi was well-known within the Order because he served the Guards for three months until becoming Captain of the Dark Honor Guards.
Carmesi was a part of the first generation of Dark Honor Guards and, although it took him a while to ascend to Captain, he still contributed a lot during his time there.
Carmesi invented the Initiate Trials and  hosted a lot of events for the Guards.
as per usual Carmesi was extremely dedicated and active within the Sith order.
Unfortunately, Carmesi only served as the Captain for a week before getting exiled from the Order.
Carmesi went to the Jedi Order for around two months before returning to the Sith Order.

# The Return:

After spending two months in the Jedi Order, Carmesi knew it was time for him to return.
He came back to the Sith Order and started from scratch.
Carmesi had to start from the bottom of the ranking system and worked his way back up.
After completing the required trainings again, Carmesi served as the apprentice of the famous Escanor, who is now known as Commander Arcanum of the Dark Honor Guard.
As the apprentice of Escanor, Carmesi found himself joining the combative Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy (E&D).
He wasn’t in E&D for as long as he was in the Dark Honor Guards and the main reason he joined was because of the connections he had within the Sphere.
He served E&D for a period of one month and a week until requesting a demotion to Adept.
He remained Sphere-less for a little while until he joined his last Sphere, the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge.
As an Adept, Carmesi joined the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and got highly respected within the community.
Not long after joining the Sphere, Carmesi served as the apprentice to MartinTLincoln, a Darth of Ancient Knowledge.

# Ancient Knowledge's Finest:

Carmesi served the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge with the best of his abilities, making a total of fifty-six articles during his time there, and was a part of the first generation of the Sphere.
Carmesi served as a Sith Knight in the Sphere for quite some time, sadly there was one thing Carmesi lacked: a good apprentice.
Every apprentice Carmesi had failed him and to become an Advanced Sith Knight, Carmesi had to request a waiver so he didn’t have to spend another several months looking for an apprentice.
Luckily, the waiver was approved by the Dark Council and Carmesi would become a Sith Inquisitor and Sith Curator.
As a Sith Curator, Carmesi worked side by side with ShokuMatsu and together they marked and made some of the best articles in the Sphere.
In fact because of their contributions to the Sphere they were both granted the rank of Sith Lord.
Both of them served as fantastic Lords and made the Curator assembly even better than before.
The Dark Council started to learn of Carmesi’s abilities and were quick to promote him to Darth.
As a Darth, Carmesi served the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge as an Inner Circle member and Curator Overseer.
This meant that he oversaw all of the Curator’s work and he eventually made his own Holocron to teach new Curators to become the best.
Not long after serving as Curator Overseer, Carmesi requested to switch positions with Darth Invictus, allowing Carmesi to become Keeper of Records.
Invictus approved the switch and Carmesi served as the new Keeper of Records, his dream job.
He served the Sphere for a long time and eventually earned the Dark Knowledge and Activity Accolades.
After serving as Inner Circle for a while, Carmesi decided it was time to step down from his position and became a Sith Elder.
Carmesi’s Holocron is still used by Sith Curators to this day and his service to the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and the Dark Honor Guards was to the best of his abilities, he will always be remembered.
