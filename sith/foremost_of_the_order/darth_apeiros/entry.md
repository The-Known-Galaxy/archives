# Philosopher in the Making:

Apeiros was the Headmaster of the Sith Academy and served as an Inner Circle member of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.
He started his journey as a Hopeful and made his way to Darth.
Apeiros passed all of his Sith training at a fast pace and quickly became an apprentice of Youngboyboosie, who taught Apeiros everything he needed to know.
He tried not to be an apprentice for very long because he desired to ascend within the Sphere of Sith Philosophy, which he joined as an apprentice as well.
After serving as an apprentice, Apeiros quite rapidly ascended through the ranks of the Sith Order and the Sith Academy.
He spent most of his free time hosting Sith training for new members, he loved to teach.
He also tried his best to get his fellow teachers to host as many training sessions as they could.
Unfortunately, a lot of teachers had too much work to focus on the Academy and they just remained there.

# The Legacy:

Apeiros, as a beginner Sith, saw that there was a major flaw within the Order.
There was a lack of training sessions being hosted for newer generations of Sith.
How could we all ascend if there were no classes?
Apeiros sought to fix this flaw by joining the Academy.
This is why he tried his best to ascend to the rank of Overseer.
Before getting Overseer, Apeiros desired to become a Warrior.
He hosted as many classes as he could and did all his trials.
He found himself ascending to the rank of Warrior about three weeks after being a Sith Knight, he failed his trials because he did it three days too early.
He still got there, however.
As a Warrior, Apeiros tried to become a Sith Praefect, which is the equivalent of a Warrior in the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.
He achieved the rank of Praefect and was granted the privilege of hosting Korriban Excursions, which is how Acolyte III ascended to Adepts.
He continued to strive his best in hosting and was soon given the rank of Overseer, after two weeks of being a Warrior.
Apeiros was an Overseer for a very long time.
He hosted countless Sith Knight trials during his time and he also found the time to continue hosting classes for newer Siths.
Therefore, Apeiros was given the rank of Sith Lord or in the Academy’s case, Assistant Headmaster, less than two months after ascending to Overseer.
Apeiros was now the Assistant Headmaster and a Sith Lord of the Order.
Firstly, he needed to improve the activity of teachers.
Apeiros brought in the well-known Sith Academy event, in which the person who had the most Academy credits by the end of the month got in-game credits for lightsabers.
This is an event still used to this day so the Academy’s activity rates can be boosted.
Apeiros spent a lot of hard work on this, he talked to Darth Zinwrath and Zinwrath did his best to convince the Dark Council and the dev team, and he was successful.
Together, Zinwrath and Apeiros made it an official Academy event.
After being a Sith lord and Assistant Headmaster for only nine days, Apeiros was rapidly given the title of Headmaster and was an official Darth of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.
He did his best to serve his Sphere, but his main focus was still the Academy.
As keeper of Records, Apeiros tasked himself with removing inactive members and looking through Sphere interest forms.
He also had to log people into the database and before the Sith Academy became a sub-Sphere, Apeiros was tasked with revising some of the google docs.
He was very busy.
Sadly, Apeiros’ time within the Order had to come to an end.
Apeiros retired from the Sith Order and his respected Sphere, he stepped down as Headmaster a while before his retirement, however, and was given the rank of Elder once he retired.
