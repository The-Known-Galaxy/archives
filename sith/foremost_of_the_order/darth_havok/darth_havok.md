# Overview
OmegaVanquished, otherwise known as Darth Havok, currently serves as the Will of the Dark Lord and a member of Vermened’s Powerbase.
Havok is a notable member of The Known Galaxy, having originally served within The Jedi Order’s Temple Guard.
He is a beloved and well-liked member of the community, garnering respect from all.
His hard work during his previous tenure as Overlord of the Sphere of Laws and Justice laid the foundations of the sphere and made it what it is today.

# History
Before Havok was a member of The Sith Order, he originally joined The Jedi Order in October of 2020.
Focused and determined with the singular goal of joining the prestigious Temple Guard, he achieved knighthood not long after and went on to become a Captain within it.
His work within the Temple Guard shaped the division as a whole, with the Temple Guards being seen as highly skilled, disciplined and role models of the community.
Havok then proceeded to serve a tenure as Commandant furthering both the discipline and reputation of the Temple Guard.

After some time however, Havok sought a change of both pace and scenery.
In October of 2021, not long after Vermened had become the Dark Lord of the Sith, he joined The Sith Order and was initially granted a place within the Sphere of Laws and Justice as both a Darth and a member of the Inner Council.
Serving under ArgusOtto, Havok went on to lay the foundations of the sphere alongside him until ArgusOtto’s unfortunate retirement.
But with this came opportunity, as Havok then ascended to the Dark Council and became the new Overlord of the sphere.

Havok built the sphere from the ground up, drafting the Doctrine of The Sith and creating the laws of our order which are still very much in use today.
He carried on with his duties, shaping the Doctrine as time went on at the behest of the Dark Council.
Havok worked tirelessly thereon to make the sphere an example to all others and to ensure that the laws of the Sith were not neglected.

Following the resignation of Darth Reavion, otherwise known as Notom and the previous Will of the Dark Lord,  the Dark Lord Validus had deemed Havok fit to serve as his replacement.
His ascension to the Powerbase had all but cemented his legacy within the order, and to this day, he continues to serve the Dark Lord faithfully.
Havok continues to work hard, as he has always done, and it is doubtless that he will go down as one of the order’s greatest leaders.
