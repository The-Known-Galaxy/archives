# Lieutenant of the Guard and Chief of the Academy:

Darth Nurrix, also known as MartinTLincoln was an Inner Circle member within the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and a Lieutenant of the Dark Honor Guards.
Nurrix finished his training as quickly as he could and then joined the Sphere of Mysteries followed by the Dark Honor Guards.
Upon joining the Sith Order, Nurrix already knew that he’d find himself serving the Dark Honor Guards so he ascended to Adept as fast as he could and he became an apprentice to PaulTLincoln.
Paul taught Nurrix everything he could and he learned a lot, then he joined the Dark Honor Guards for two weeks and found himself joining the Sphere of Mysteries when the Kaggath between Caeser and Kennaex occurred.
He was handpicked by the Overlord of the Sphere of Mysteries to become the Chief of the Sphere’s academy.
He dedicated time to the Sphere of Mysteries and he made the academy for them so that they could teach the new generations their ways.
He served the Sphere of Mysteries for three weeks then returned to the Guards.
Nurrix served as Lieutenant of the Guards and during this time he was most notably known for hosting the majority of the tryouts.
Unfortunately, some of Nurrix’s fellow officers were busy so Nurrix decided to host most of the tryouts for them.
He also hosted a few trainings so that the new Guards could excel in combat even more.
Nurrix served the Guards for about half a year and the majority of that time he spent devoting himself to bettering the division.
He was very respected among the Guards but he eventually decided it was time to retire.
He retired from the Guards and was given the rank of Sith Knight, however, because he was a HICOM member within the Guards he was promoted to Sith Warrior a few hours later.

# Journey to Darth:

Once Captain TaitusTemenos moved to the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, Darth Nurrix approached the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Validus about the aftermath of the Captain leaving.
This resulted in Darth Nurrix asking Darth Validus about the newly restarted Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, which he recommended to him.
Nurrix listened to Validus’ advice and joined the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge.
He joined the Sphere as a Loremaster and wrote a lot of articles for them.
Nurrix was never a fan of training apprentices, but he did have one apprentice who he successfully trained to the rank of Sith Knight during this time, this apprentice was none other than ValenTemenos, later known as Darth Carmesi, who also became an Ancient Knowledge Inner Circle member and Darth.
Nurrix spent most of his time now helping his Sphere grow stronger.
He did a lot for the Sphere, but his most notable acts were that he made the entire Ancient Knowledge itinerary, which is what they used as inspiration for article choices, he also assisted with making all the documents and was the caretaker of these documents and the Sith Order’s archive notion page.
Nurrix became a Sith Lord during his time in the order and not long after he became an Inner Circle member of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and Darth of the Sith Order.
He scrapped the old itinerary for the Sphere and replaced it with a new system and he made sure everything on the Notion page was up to date.
Nurrix, after the departure of Ancient Knowledge’s Overlord, Darth Lividus, left the Sphere and the Sith Order as a whole.
