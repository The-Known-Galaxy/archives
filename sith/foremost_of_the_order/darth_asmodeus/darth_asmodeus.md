# Biography:
Disk’s journey began in TSO on July 9, 2022, and has stayed there ever since.
Ever since reaching Adept, he has made many friends and has had a great time here.
Disk first joined L&J, as he assumed it would be a perfect fit as he had been in Law Enforcement schooling and served in the military in real life.
He had a fun time here and made many friends, most notably GiannaVanquished, AzraelTrinity, and Unitnetic.
After reaching Advanced Knight, Disk decided to begin a new journey in the Sphere of Mysteries as a Sith Marauder, contrary to his previous position in Laws and Justice as a Sith Interrogator.
Disk has worked tirelessly in SoM, while also having a great time and enjoying the jobs he has.
He was quick to receive Lord due to his outstanding performance as a Marauder, and achieved Darth almost as soon as the Marauder Overseer position opened.
Disks Marauders appreciate him very much and all of his hard work does not go unnoticed.
