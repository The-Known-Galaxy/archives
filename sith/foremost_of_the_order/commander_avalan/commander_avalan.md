# The Dark Guard

Commander Avalan serves as the current Commander of the glorious Dark Honor Guard division.
Avalan has proven to be skillful in the ways of combat and a talented leader.
Avalan has always been a part of the Dark Honor Guards.
He became a Hopeful of the Sith order on April 18th and quickly ascended to the rank of Adept so he could join a Sphere, however, at first Avalan wanted to join the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy and serve them in their cause of eradicating the Jedi Order.
But right before trying out for the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy, Avalan decided it wasn’t the right Sphere for him and because he was so intrigued by the Dark Honor guard he decided it was best that he joined them to serve and protect the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Validus.
Starting as an Initiate of the Guards, Avalan decided he wanted to become a fully trained Guardsman and he wanted to become the best combative version of himself.
On the 29th of May, he achieved his goal of becoming a Guardsman and aimed to complete his new one, becoming a Corporal and improving his combat skills.
After a month of training and proving himself he became worthy of the rank of Corporal.
Over time, Avalan became a Sergeant of the Dark Honor Guards and proved that he was very active by doing his duties on Dathomir every day.
As a Sergeant Avalan was considered an Officer of the Guards and was able to host events, which he did very often so he could make sure that the Guards were running efficiently and were doing their proper duties.
Soon Avalan was promoted to Lieutenant of the Guards and strived to do his best and continue hosting as much as he could.
During his time as a Guard, he defended many important events within the Order, such as Kaggaths.
One day, The Commander of the Guards, Valdor, was promoted to the Dark Lord’s Powerbase and served as the Hand of the Dark Lord, which would mean that the rank of Commander wasn’t filled until Escanor Temenos became the newest Commander of the Guard.
However, Escanor was only the Commander for a brief period of time and once he stepped down from Commander the spot was given to Avalan.
Avalan now serves as the Commander of the Dark Honor Guards and has become very powerful in combat, but he gets even stronger every day and has achieved the Dark Council’s Combat Prowess Accolade along with the Activity Accolade and the Leadership Accolade for leading the Guards very efficiently.
Avalan still does his best to keep the Guard running and leads them to the best of his abilities.
