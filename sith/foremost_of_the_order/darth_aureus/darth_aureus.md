# History

Darth Aureus' master was Renjaal, a Scribe, then Curator in Ancient Knowledge.
Very cool guy, but his love for CS:GO heavily outweighs his love for TKG these days, so he's not the most active these days.
He is currently training two apprentices!
LolenRoyal and zibi126 but none of them passed their KT yet, as for the one that passed, it's Theo_Leva756.

When it comes to the Sphere of Mysteries, the activities done within it are classified.
His lips were sealed..

Darth Aureus has never directly participated in a Kaggath, but he saw a Humiliation Kaggath recently.
It was the one involving Lord Serpent and Darth Ugwae.
He joined Ancient Knowledge because he really enjoys Star Wars lore and wanted to contribute to the sith archives.
The idea of players being able to put their own stone in the Grand Scheme of things was a marvelous idea, but he got burnt out quickly, he thought the quota simply didn't work for him, perhaps he wasn't built to be a curator like he hoped to.
As for Mysteries, he was looking around on the notion and was looking for Inquisitor paths that could be interesting and immediately was interesting.
Darth Aureus firmly believes that SoM is one of the most important spheres of influence within the order.
It could even be argued that it's the most important one on many levels.

# Quote from Darth Aureus

“.You know the Definition of Insanity?
It's doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.
People say Albert Einstein said that.
He actually never did.
It was a line said by a character named Jane Austen, in a book made by Rite Mae Brown.
There's many different sources on its origin, some even talking about Confucius or some old Chinese proverb.
The term Insanity has been defined, yet it's author remains a Mystery.”

-Darth Aureus
