# Rising Fire

Darth Ignis was an Inner Circle member, Darth, and Curator Overseer in the Sith Order.
He served his Sphere to the best of his ability.
He started as a Hopeful and attempted the Rite of Passage twice, he then became an Acolyte and eventually an Adept.
Ignis always wanted to join the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and as soon as he became an Adept, he applied for the Sphere.
Ignis then looked for a Master, it took him a while and he had two Masters.
His final Master was Darth Xenion, who worked in the Sphere of Mysteries.
Ignis was an Apprentice for quite a while and was very eager to ascend to Sith Knight.
Once he reached this rank, Ignis was even more determined to become an Inquisitor.
Due to his Apprenticeship with Darth Xenion, Ignis decided to join his Master in the Sphere of Mysteries for a while.
He left Ancient Knowledge and join the Sphere of Mysteries for around three weeks.
He quickly became an Inquisitor there and joined the Sith Savants.
His Sphere of Mysteries career was all classified but it was enjoyable.
He returned to the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and started to help more.
He wrote a lot of articles, eventually reaching the most ever articles written for the Sphere in its history.
Ignis would soon earn the rank of Sith Lord, where he’d perform a lot more duties and become even more active.
Ignis at that point earned the DC Activity Accolade and was promoted to Sith Lord for his dedication to the Sphere.
Upon earning the rank of Sith Lord, Ignis was the only leader in the Curator specialization.
He guided young Curators and those aspiring to become Curators.
On top of this, Ignis also had to fill in for the lack of Loremasters, he took it upon himself to start writing more Lore of the Order articles so he could help the Loremasters, due to their lack of members.
He worked hard to support his Sphere and all the specializations within it.
Ignis truly proved himself as dedicated to the Sphere.
This time Ignis wouldn’t leave until he accomplished all of his goals.

# Finding the Light

The beloved Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, Darth Nodt, decided to retire from the Sphere.
Nodt had taught Ignis many things about leadership roles and had guided Ignis throughout his time in the Sphere.
Luckily, Nodt had a dedicated replacement.
Darth Zinwrath became the Sphere’s new Overlord.
Darth Zinwrath had been in the Dark Council for a very long time and was the second oldest member, he originally served the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.
Darth Zinwrath’s first goal was to fill up the Inner Circle roles as best as possible.
Darth Gallius had been promoted to Darth a while ago and Ignis would be next.
Darth Zinwrath decided to promote Ignis to Darth and bestow the Dark Knowledge Accolade upon him.
Ignis had earned the accolade through his hard work and dedication to the Sphere, he was still leading the Sphere’s article production.
Ignis was the Curator Overseer then and had a few changes in mind.
He worked very closely with Darth Gallius and they both came up with some ideas for Curators.
Gallius was once a Curator and so he and Ignis changed the specialization.
Curators had more ways to work, they had access to the Inspiration channel and would guide the Neophytes and Scribes of the Sphere with unfinished or unclaimed articles.
Ignis still worked on articles but he stopped marking them, he wanted his Curators to be more active and so he tried to boost their productivity.
He wrote as many articles as he could so the Curators could mark and complete their quotas.
Eventually, Ignis began to realize he had done everything he possibly could for the Sphere and there wasn’t much left.
He remembered meeting a Jedi Master when he was a Sith Lord, a wise Jedi Master who had changed his views.
This Master offered Ignis a spot as his Padawan when Ignis was to join the Jedi.
Ignis had finally completed all of his goals; he’d made the most articles for the Sphere in its history, he had earned the Dark Knowledge and Activity Accolade, he had successfully trained a few Apprentices, he had served his Sphere to the best of his abilities, and he had finally earned Darth and was one for a little while until he left the Order and joined the Jedi.
