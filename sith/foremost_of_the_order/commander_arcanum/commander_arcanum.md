# Biography:
Prologue: Eseray, Master of the Jedi Order.
On the 6th of May 2021, Eseray joined the Jedi Order and passed his first training on the very same day.
After passing the necessary classes, he became the padawan of AuthenticArtifact and was knighted on the 19th of May.
He walked the path of the Guardian, joining the Jedi Paladins, a specialisation under the Council of First Knowledge.
He was promoted to Instructor and assistant head of the specialisation on the 3rd of July for a few weeks before Paladins were disbanded due to a lack of purpose.
Ray instead became a Peacekeeper under the Council of Reconciliation for 4 weeks before becoming bored of the job and instead pursuing the path of the Sentinel and transferring to the Jedi Investigators, remaining an Instructor until he eventually ascended to the rank of Jedi Master, succeeding Unite5000 as the Chief Investigator.
During his time as a normal Investigator, Eseray joined the Jedi Assault Team and quickly made his way through the ranks before becoming a Warrior in it, actively hosting and interacting with its members.
His time in the Jedi Order would continue this way until he retired on October 1st, 2021, and eventually outright left the community for some time.

Act I: The first Overseer.
Eseray joined the Sith Order on the 26th of November after seeing his friend SlenderMalvern in it and became the first Sith Overseer on the very same day by Vermened, being exempt from the trials of Knighthood like many early members of the Order.
This was unofficial due to the fact he, Slender, and xLiamint were working on documents for the Sphere of Sith Philosophy in the background.
On the 4th of November, he was officially a member of the Sith Order and sat on the Inner Circle of Philosophy as Chairman of the Assembly, managing the Sith Overseers and raising the first generation of actual Sith Knights.
It continued on like this, with him even being awarded an accolade of activity from the Dark Council as recognition for his work on the 4th of December.
20 days later, EscanorTemenos would join the Inner Circle of the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy as the Darth that would be in control of the Juggernauts, the elite Warriors of the Sphere.
Along with Esociety, CaesarTemenos, and TaitusTemenos, they would lead the Sphere to glory and prominence.
In February 2022, Escanor earnt the Dark Council’s Leadership Accolade and on the 8th of March, he eventually retired from Darth and would be succeeded by Darth Vican.

Act II: Destiny in solidarity.
On the 29th of March 2022, EscanorTemenos would step out of retirement into Lordship after being asked to by the Dark Lord Vermened himself for the Sith Training Corps, a division of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and a parallel to the Jedi Service Corps that would ultimately never be taken out of its thinking stage.
Escanor instead joined the Sith Honor Guard on the 24th of April and worked hard until he finally became a Sergeant on the 10th of May.
This was around the time most of the notable members of the High Command left, including TaitusTemenos, UnforceTemenos, ChampaaiTemenos, and MartinTLincoln.
The only members of the High Command left, excluding Escanor, were HitMan9124 and ValorisAshen.
HitMan was generally inactive and Commander Valdor was busy with real life, so if the Dark Honor Guard were to maintain its discipline, standards, and principles, Escanor alone would need to do so until more competent people could come along and become High Command.
It was like this for some time, as Escanor would train the new generations of Dark Honor Guardsmen and those most worthy remained loyal to the purpose they served as the Emperor’s Guard, while the unfit were cast out.
Through his efforts, Escanor was given the rank of Lieutenant on the 25th of May with his subordinates soon becoming a member of the High Command, the most notable of which being Dabroos and Bobdavejimmy and on the 1st of June, Escanor became a senior officer, a Captain of the Dark Honor Guard as Commander Valdor would recognise his efforts in demonstrating his capabilities, competences, and leadership.
He was second only to Valdor in terms of guiding the Dark Honor Guard as a whole.

Act III: Commander Arcanum, the Harbinger.
Almost four months after becoming Captain, on the 29th of September, EscanorTemenos would ascend to the rank of Commander.
Having free reign over controlling and changing the Dark Honor Guard, he began directly serving under the new Hand of the Dark Lord, Darth Valdor, who succeeded Darth Kennaex.
Whether he shall continue serving as a Commander or change once more is uncertain, but Escanor has expressed how much he enjoys the Dark Honor Guard and how proud they make him.
He continues to be a respected figure within the Sith Order and the Known Galaxy, being recognised by most active Jedi and Sith as an incredible leader and inspiring person.
