# Biography:
Eternal’s journey in The Known Galaxy long ago, sometime in 2020.
This was so early, TiberusMalvern hadn't even become Grandmaster at this point.
Eternal spent his early time here as a Sentinel, where he would take some noteworthy Apprentices like AuthenticVanquished.
Eternal would join TSO close to release and join the Sphere of Sith Philosophy as his first-ever sphere.
His time here would be somewhat short lived as he would go inactive to focus on school.
After his return, he would join Laws and Justice and be taken in by ManuelDopePrice.
He would quickly rise the ranks and achieve the Knight rank of Enforcer.
Eventually, Eternal’s interest peaked after looking into the Sphere of Mysteries, and due to having connections there already, he decided to transfer and begin a new chapter.
Eternal would rise to the rank of Savant under PurposeMalvern and HadesNeil before switching to Ancient Knowledge out of pure boredom.
Despite enjoying himself there, he would go on to return to SoM as the state of it was awful and he felt a need to help.
Eternal was focused on progressing past Advanced Knight, and did this by working closely with the Savant Overseer, FoxupPurpose, and assisting in rebuilding SoM to its former glory.
Eternal has been vital in keeping SoM active and working firsthand with intelligence gathering and other classified operations.
His Savants have a lot of respect for him, with one of his Savants, NeverDecay, even saying “Darth Vederium is a capable, hard working individual, who ultimately cares about the health of his sphere more than his subordinates.
He is very forgiving of mistakes, allowing those under him to learn over time so that they may do their job more proficiently.
Overall he is a very strong leader who will continue to lead Savants into the future of TSO.” And he is constantly working to watch the sphere grow.
