During a time when the Sith were powerful, Darth Atrius owned a pair of crossguard lightsabers, Atrius used the sabers to slay many opponents and claim the victories that resulted from their deaths.
However, over time, the sabers began to become corrupted by the Sith Lord’s rage, causing any individual who wielded the sabers to fall into a frenzy.
Upon the Sith Lord’s death, the sabers were lost.
After the Battle of Yavin, the Galactic Empire would hire a smuggler named Sana Starros to attain the crossguards.
She tracked down the sabers and retrieved them, however, she was a double agent who was hired by a crime boss named Hradreek to fulfill the same task.
She attempted to deceive each of the two, handing one of the two sabers to each of them to hopefully receive the credits from both buyers.
The Empire fell for the trick, but Hradreek called her out.
Hradreek ignited the blade and began to fall into a frenzy, killing all of his men as a result.
Around the same time, an Imperial Officer retrieved the crossguard from the smuggler and gave the saber to Darth Vader, Vader then gave the saber to his master, Darth Sidious.
However, once Vader learned of the missing saber, he executed the Officer and set out to attain the missing crossguard.
