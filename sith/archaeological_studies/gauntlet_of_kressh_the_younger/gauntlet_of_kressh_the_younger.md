# Overview
The Gauntlet of Kressh the Younger was a Sith Artifact created by Ludo Kressh during the old Sith Empire era to make his son, Elcho Kressh, invincible.
This Gauntlet would only be useful if the user was attacked without his consent.

# Information
This Gauntlet was composed of five oval plates that were made of an unknown black material.
The middle three plates had gold tassels hanging from the ends.
The Gauntlet was worn on the user’s forearm and it had the power of preventing anything from attacking the wearer without their consent, blasting aside everything that attempted to do with a surge of Dark Side energy.
To have such protection, the user had to wear the Gauntlet for it to work, as holding it would be useless.



# History
By 3963 BBY, the Gauntlet was retrieved by the Jedi Covenant.
After this, it was taken away from them by Sith Acolyte Haazen, who worked with the Jedi Covenant previously.
He hid it in a case in his office on the Draay Estate along with other Sith Artifacts.

After Haazen obtained the Gauntlet, a turn of events occurred that led him to engage in a battle against Lucien Draay and Zayne Carrick, where he lost after Draay used the Vanjervalis device to shoot them.
He and his teammate survived because Zayne equipped the Gauntlet after getting it off Haazen with a lightsaber attack while distracted.

Said Gauntlet was found by the Jedi during the Clone Wars era and was thrown away into a river
