# Overview
The Books of Massassi were engraved tablets written by the Massassi that recounted their history and beliefs.
It was said these books were recorded orally by educated Massassi slaves.

After the establishment of the Jedi Academy on Yavin IV in 14 ABY, Jedi Master Streen began the task of translating the Books of Massassi.
It was an arduous process, as he only translated 16 texts by 16 ABY.
In these chronicles, Streen found the Massassi looked for perfection and power after they dominated Yavin IV, leading them to the Dark Side.
