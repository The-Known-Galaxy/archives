# Description

The Dagger of Mortis, also known as the Mortis Dagger was a mysterious weapon that was located on the planet, Mortis.
The Dagger was The Fatherâ€™s, who was a god-like being who believed in a balance in the Force.
As long as The Father was alive his children would have immense power.
Because of this, he used The Dagger to control the two siblings, a son, and a daughter.
The siblings were total opposites; The Son was a Dark Side user and The Daughter was a Light Side user.
Need be the father could use it to kill them, but only if necessary.
The Son who was angry at the father took the Dagger to hopefully kill The Father.
Unexpectedly, The Daughter got in the way and The Son killed her.
Because of her death, there was a great unbalance in the Force making The Son too powerful.
Since The Father was the powerhouse of the children, he sacrificed himself to make The Son lose all his power, resulting in The Son getting killed.
