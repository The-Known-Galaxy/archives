# Introduction

Rakatan Empire, otherwise referred to as The Infinite Empire or the Rakata Empire, was a vast dominion spanning across the galaxy.
It was governed by the Rakata, a highly advanced species originating from Lehon, a planet located in the mysterious Unknown Regions.
Using their advanced technology, the Rakata subdued and enslaved numerous other species across the galaxy.
Their ancientness is such that even during “The Old Republic” era, they are regarded as little more than myth and legend.

When the Kwa, a Force-sensitive reptilian species native to the planet Dathomir, journeyed to Lehon, the ancestral home of the Rakata species, they assumed the role of benefactors to the Rakata.
Imparting knowledge about the Force and bestowing advanced technology upon them, the Kwa sought to elevate their civilization.
However, their goodwill turned to horror when they discovered the Rakata's cannibalistic tendencies and their rejection of the Kwa's teachings of balance in the Force.
Instead, the Rakata embraced the dark side of the Force, combining their aggressive nature and lust for conquest with the advanced technology provided by the Kwa.
With this formidable combination, the Rakata expanded their dominion beyond Lehon, embarking on a campaign of conquest across other worlds within the enigmatic Unknown Regions.

Classified the Infinite Empire by the Rakata themselves, they set their sights on worlds abundant with the Force, overpowering their inhabitants upon conquest.
Pioneering technology enabled them to manipulate fear and hatred within Force-sensitive individuals, utilizing enslaved Force users from conquered populations to power their warships and machinery.
These slaves were captured within devices that converted their dark side emotions into energy, sustaining the Rakata's advancements and dominance.
Expanding their influence into the Unknown Regions and beyond, the Empire reached into the eastern galaxy by 35,000 BBY.
Among the worlds brought under their control was Kashyyyk, a lush forest planet.
Here, the Rakata installed a terraforming computer to manipulate the planet's iconic wroshyr trees.
However, in 33,598 BBY, communication with the computer was lost.
Over two centuries later, the malfunction of the terraforming system caused a rapid and uncontrollable acceleration in the growth of the wroshyr trees.

Around 30,000 BBY, the Infinite Empire reached its height, connecting more than five hundred Force-abundant worlds across the galaxy.
Amidst the absorption of Kwa territories, the Rakata ruthlessly conquered Dathomir, the Kwa's home planet.
Fascinated by the colossal rancors indigenous to Dathomir, the Empire transported several of these creatures to Lehon as peculiarities.
Subsequently, one rancor was introduced to the planet Gamorr integrating into the native Gamorreans' cultural mythology as a legendary creature.
In approximately 27,700 BBY, the Rakata stumbled upon the planet Korriban and encountered the Sith species.
Initially, the Rakata demonstrated the technology of holocrons to the Sith king, Adas.
However, Adas quickly discerned the Empire's true motives for conquest and rallied his people and were able to repel the Rakata from Korriban.
Despite this setback, the Rakata succeeded in conquering numerous worlds in the region that would eventually be dubbed the Core Worlds, among them Coruscant, the ancestral home of the Human species.

Relying heavily on Force-sensitive individuals to power their starships and drive their galactic conquest, the Rakata established a notorious reputation for their widespread practice of slavery, which not only underpinned their society but also served as a vital dependency.
Additionally, they exploited a vast number of slaves as laborers to construct their most monumental achievements, such as the Star Forge—a colossal shipyard fueled by the energy harvested from stars.

During the reign of the Infinite Empire, the Esh-kha species initiated a series of uprisings on several Rakatan slave worlds, prompting the Empire to launch a counterattack against them.
Despite efforts by one Esh-kha, known as Hallow Voice, to appeal to the Rakata for mercy, negotiations were intentionally prolonged by the Rakata until they successfully subdued the Esh-kha and apprehended Hallow Voice.
Subsequently, all members of the Esh-kha species were incarcerated within stasis vaults on Belsavis, effectively imprisoning the entire population.
The Infinite Empire repurposed Belsavis into a prison world, utilizing stasis technology to confine monsters, warlords, and other formidable entities.

The Force-powered technology of the Rakata, known as the Star Forge, had far-reaching consequences that ultimately triggered the collapse of the Infinite Empire.
As the Star Forge tapped into the aggressive tendencies of its Rakatan creators, it generated dark side energies that corrupted them further.
Over generations of galactic dominance, cracks began to form within the Empire.
Widespread slave uprisings erupted along its borders, while various factions within the Empire vied for control, plunging Rakatan-controlled space into civil war.
Already weakened by internal strife, the Rakata were blindsided by a devastating plague in 25,200 BBY, possibly engineered by one of the slave species.
This lethal disease spread swiftly among the Rakata due to their genetic similarity, nearly wiping them out and dealing a crippling blow to the Infinite Empire.
However, the worst was yet to come….

A genetic mutation within the plague severed the Rakata's connection to and mastery over the Force.
With Force-sensitive individuals dwindling, the Rakata found themselves unable to harness their own advanced technology effectively.
Forced to rely on inferior alternatives, their dominion weakened.
Sensing an opportunity, enslaved populations across numerous worlds rebelled against their weakened overlords.
As member worlds like Korriban expelled their Rakatan rulers, the foundations of the Infinite Empire crumbled.
In a desperate retreat, the devastated Rakata were left with no choice but to abandon their conquests and seek refuge in their homeworld.

Factions on the Rakatan homeworld engaged in a bitter struggle for supremacy, igniting a devastating civil war that razed cities and reshaped the planet's surface into fragmented islands.
The conflict nearly drove the Rakatan species to extinction, compelling the surviving remnants to seek refuge underground, where they regressed into primitive tribal societies.
Among them, a group known as The Elders, descended from the priest sphere of the Infinite Empire, preserved the true history of their people's rise and fall.
Over the ensuing centuries, the once-mighty Infinite Empire faded from memory, erased from the annals of galactic history by its former slaves.
Its existence remained dormant until its rediscovery during the Jedi Civil War, millennia after the presumed extinction of the Rakata.
