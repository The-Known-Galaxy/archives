# Overview

Translation Talismans were mystic devices created by the Dark Jedi to understand the language of the Sith species.

King Ommin possessed one of these and lent it to Satal Keto.
After he put it on his neck, he was able to understand a stolen Sith Spellbook he owned, something he was unable to do before.
