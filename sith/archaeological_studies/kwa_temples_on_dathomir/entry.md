# Introduction

The Kwa Temples on Dathomir, also known as the Star Temples, were ancient pyramid buildings that were constructed by the Kwi thousands of years ago around the Infinity Gate in order to protect themselves from possible hostilities.
The gate would normally help them travel to far-flung locations around the galaxy, however, the gate could also be used as a superweapon, as it could insert infinite power limits to the real world and colonize whatever planet - including its stars, moons, and suns that it was unleashed upon.

# Section 1

As the Kwi was betrayed by the Rakatan Infinite Empire and became rather weakened by the conquest of Dathomir, they closed the Star Chamber and set whuffa worms as guardians to prevent anyone from entering again.
Throughout the years, the Kwa degenerated into Kwi, who became semi-sentient descendants of the species and started living in the Dathomirian deserts.

# Section 2

During one of Quizlan Vos’ adventures, he discovered a group of Nightsisters in 31 BBY that invaded the Star Chamber, where they slaughtered many Kwi in an attempt to destroy the Galactic Republic’s homeworld, Coruscant, via using the gate’s abilities to power a so-called Infinity wave.
As Vos interfered, he used his powers to redirect the wave back to the gate, causing it and the temple to collapse into scattered ruins.

In 12 ABY, Sigit Ranth, a member of the Imperial Remnant and Project Nightsaber, discovered the existence of the Infinity Gate and investigated the Star Temples, but found no trace of it as it had already been destroyed - resulting in the search being abandoned.
