The Sword of Khashyun was an artifact that belonged to the Sith.
It was constructed by a branch of Dowutin Sith warriors for the purpose of lightsabers being weak.
There were myths that assumed this sword was cursed and began to manipulate the Sith to turn on eachother.

Doctor Aphra was trying to retrieve the Sword of Khashyun in an ancient Sith temple when she had a near-death encounter with a Tuk’ata and managed to get out of the Sith temple, carrying the blade with her.
Dok-Ondar did not like the fact that she had the blade so he tried to threaten her.
She tried to convince him but it had little to no effect so she had no choice but to strike.
She used her new-found artifact to impale his guard.
Remarking that he would not take the possibility of destroying the sword, Ondar did it anyway, breaking the hilt and sword into its blade and immobilizing Aphra soon after.
When she wakes up, Aphra asks her droids what happened only to see Ondar’s ship flying away and that the artifact she just found is now gone.

The blade was intersected, with the handle coming into possession of Dok-Ondar, the Ithorian collector who hid it in his outpost on Batuu.
Kendoh Voss and his gang managed to steal the handle of the sword, already bearing the other half of the artifact.
