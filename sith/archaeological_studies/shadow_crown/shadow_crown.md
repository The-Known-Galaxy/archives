Also known as the Moon Hat, the Shadow Crown was a dark side artifact researched for many years into the dark side and Sith lore by Cronal.
Of crystalline origin, the Crown once worn by a mortal being whom Cronal could choose to inhabit to extend his existence, rather than the Darth Sidious direction of manipulating a clone body to cheat death.
Cronal submitted his devotion to the Way of the Dark using the Shadow Crown.
Connecting directly to the Shadow Crown, with his own version known as the Sunset Crown.
When wearing the Shadow Crown, the crown would project a holographic image of Cronal to the face of the wearer, activated by several hundred pointed crystals that projected into the skull of the being.
When the crown would activate, dark side energy would concentrate and corrupt the individual, which would allow Cronal to control them and their body.
However, the crown was very dangerous to the wearer if the connection was interrupted.
