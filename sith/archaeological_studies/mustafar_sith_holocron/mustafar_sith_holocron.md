# Overview
It was an ancient Sith holocron recovered on the planet of Mustafar, circa a year after the Battle of Yavin.

# History
It is estimated that this holocron was lost sometime during the Galactic Civil War era, before being found by a mining droid on Mustafar.
Although, as the droid lacked interest in the holocron itself, it only memorized its coordinates before continuing its mining operations.
The droid would then malfunction in the middle of Mustafar’s wilderness, remaining stranded there.
Coincidentally, a protocol drone named Q4P3 belonging to a Jedi Knight, who was looking for a relic known as the Codex, learnt of the accident.
As a result, he hired an armed spacer to find the mining droid’s wrecks and retrieve the holocron’s coordinates from his memory banks.
The spacer succeeded, finding the coordinates of the holocron, and traveling to the location to retrieve the holocron.
As he retrieved the relic though, he was confronted by a group of Trinity assassins of the faction known as “The Blackguard” that were guarding the object.
After successfully defeating them and returning to Q4P3, the protocol droid determined that the holocron was in fact not the Codex he was looking for, and allowed the spacer to keep it, as well as paying him a generous credit reward.
