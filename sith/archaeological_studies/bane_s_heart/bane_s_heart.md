# Overview
Darth Bane’s Heart was a unique synthetic (red)  lightsaber crystal passed down to his apprentice Darth Zannah upon the Seventh Battle of Ruusan.
Zannah utilized this unique crystal in her double-bladed lightsaber and named it after the crystal itself, Bane’s Heart (Lightsaber).

Soon, both the saber and crystal were obtained by a Dark Jedi who was murdered by General Grievous, and the Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems on either Dica or Necropolis.
After the death of the Dark Jedi, Grievous stored the Bane’s Heart (Lightsaber) within his starfighter, however, it was recovered by Imperial forces and soon, utilized as a part of the N-K project.
During the Galactic Civil War, the saber was in possession of N-K Necrosis, but until Necrosis was murdered by a group of spacers who then stole the crystal from his dead corpse.

When Bane’s Heart (Crystal) was placed in a lightsaber, it would cause the lightsaber to release an electrical discharge, therefore, making it so that only the rightful owner of the crystal can easily wield the saber.
