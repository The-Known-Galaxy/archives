# Information
The Infinite Empire Ruins were created by the Rakatan species and constructed around 25,793 BBY – 25,200 BBY during their reign.
These ruins contained Dark Side nexuses and were located on various planets across the galaxy, where each ruin held a piece of a star map that led to the rakata’s secret superweapon, the Star Forge.

# Section 1
Even though the ruins were constructed thousands of years ago, the pieces of the star map that the Rakata held did not come into use until the end of the Mandalorian wars in 3960 BBY when Darth Revan and his apprentice Malak discovered the first piece on Dantooine.
It revealed the rest of the pieces across the galaxy, where Revan and Malak tracked them across other planets in the following order: Tatooine, Kashyyyk, Manaan, and Korriban.
When all the pieces were eventually gathered, the complete map indicated that the Star Forge was located in the Lehon system, to which they traveled and took over the superweapon.
However, when Malak betrayed his Sith Master precisely three years later, Revan with his mind cleansed of his former memories as a Sith Lord submitted to obeying the Republic and later rediscovered the map in these ruins, which assisted the Jedi in tracking down the Star Forge for its upcoming destruction.



# Section 2
The ruins were primarily created by slaves of many different species that the Rakata had captured, and they were also tasked with creating quizzes for some of the pieces.
If an individual answered incorrectly to a question - or the majority - droids would be summoned to execute the target; however, if the individual destroyed the droids, the individual would somehow still gain access to the map or have to retry answering.


It is not exactly known how Revan and Malak discovered the existence of the ancient ruins and the Star Forge, but it is theorized that it had something to do with the destruction of Malachor V that made the ruins call to them.
