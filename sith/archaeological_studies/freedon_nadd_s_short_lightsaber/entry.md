# Overview

Freedon Nadd’s short lightsaber was found within the Dark Lord’s tomb on Dxun, a moon of Onderon, along with his physical remains.
It was a short lightsaber with a rubat crystal, which produced a yellow-red blade, and had a more simplistic straight cylindrical hilt.
It was among the weapons Nadd possessed when he ruled over the planet Onderon and was unique in the fact that only those that trained with the dark side of the Force could wield it.
In 3951 BBY, during the Onderon Civil War, Meetra Surik and her companions had intruded the tomb to thwart the Sith’s plan in aiding a coup d’etat, and it is debated whether she claimed the lightsaber from Freedon Nadd’s sarcophagus or simply left it.
