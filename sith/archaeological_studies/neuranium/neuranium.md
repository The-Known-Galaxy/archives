# Overview
Neuranium was the dark metal used in the sculpture of the Chancellor's mansion in the Senate building on Coruscant, where Darth Sidious' lightsaber was sheltered.
It was also used to craft lightsabers.
Neuranium was a metallic substance used for radiation safety and was one of the heaviest and densest metals in the galaxy.
Just one millimeter of this could block most scanners and even temporarily block lightsaber energy.
Neuranium was so dense that some gravity-sensitive species even detected the distortion of the space-time structure of gravity itself, forming extensive clumps.
It was used in the dense walls of Emperor Palpatine's Surgical Reconstruction Center and the boards of Palpatine's Four Magi statues.

For years, Palpatine's lightsaber had been concealed deep within the Neuranium pocket of the Sistros statue.
The Neuranium core of the figure was able to resist even a lightsaber activated within it for a few seconds.
The Neuranium went from magenta to purple with his lightsaber in the core; Palpatine used the Force to tuck his lightsaber into the sleeve of his cloak for the inevitable battle ahead.
