The Mask of Lord Momin was a Sith artifact that was worn and sculpted by the Dark Lord Darth Momin.
It was placed into the hands of the Jedi Order’s archives in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant due to the mask’s immense dark energy.
The Mask was a blue helmet created by Darth Momin, using his newly acquired lightsabers.
In the center of the helmet was a horizontal opening, an enclave in the center connected to the horizontal opening, and a second vertical opening positioned on the elevated faceplate of the mask.
When individuals were left alone with the mask, they were vulnerable to being corrupted by the dark side of the Force.
The mask would corrupt them by a set of two glowing red eyes from the mask, which flashed when an individual gazed upon them.
Its power was strong enough to influence and control bodies even after decomposition, despite that the mask did not require individuals to wear the mask, but had to be in close proximity with them.
The mask had the ability to communicate with individuals after corrupting them, even Darth Sidious, who had communicated with the mask to learn of its history.
Darth Momin was seen as a heretic among his Sith brethren, as he believed in achieving power through creation, rather than destruction.
Most records of the Sith Lord were suppressed as a result of Momin being a heretic by both the Sith and the Jedi Order, but his mask was still considered a powerful Sith artifact.
Darth Sidious would have come into possession of the powerful artifact, gifting it to his Sith apprentice, Darth Vader.
It was eventually stored in the Imperialis.
