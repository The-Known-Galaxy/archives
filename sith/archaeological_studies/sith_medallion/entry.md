# Overview

The Sith Medallion was a medal that was given to force-sensitives during the Jedi Civil War, that impressed students at the great Sith Academy on Korriban, and proved worthy to study the secrets of the Dark Side.
These medallions had a meaning, it symbolized their acceptance into the Academy.
However, it was not the last step of entering the Sith Academy.
In order to officially join the Sith Academy, they had to get final approval.
Sith Hopefuls obtained this approval by speaking with Yuthura Ban, the Twi'lek apprentice of Uthar Wynn.
Uthar Wynn was the Academy's Headmaster at that time.
It was no ordinary interview, nor trial.
These Hopefuls had to prove their worthiness, and dedication to the Dark Side, even if they know so little about it, and convince her that they were worth accepting.
Once accepted, the medallion served as a demonstration and proof of prowess to be admitted into the Sith Academy.
