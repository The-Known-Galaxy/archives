# Overview

After being reborn in a new body, Darth Vader was sent to Al’doleem to retrieve a lightsaber and bleed a crystal from a Jedi, as his old lightsaber was taken during the Duel on Mustafar against his old Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
During this mission, Darth Vader faced and killed the Jedi Master known as Kirak Infil’a.
After being successful in his task, Vader went to the Sith Planet Mustafar to bleed his new crystal.
This was a tough process as Darth Vader couldn’t focus his emotions to make the crystal bleed.

During a mission in Cabarria, his retrieved lightsaber was destroyed during a fight against mercenaries who tried to kill him.
He then had to build his own in Coruscant.
Vader’s lightsaber was based on the lightsaber he occupied during his time as a Jedi.
The Emperor’s apprentice lightsaber went through different phases, and the most visual difference was on its exterior.
It consisted of a black-ridged handgrip, black power cell chamber, two dual-phase focusing crystals, beveled emitter shroud, high-output diatium power cell, and customary power and length adjustment.
As any other Sith lightsaber, Darth Vader’s blade projected a single beam of Dark Side energy, meaning the corruption of the crystal.
