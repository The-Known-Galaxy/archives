# Introduction

Located on the planet Circarpous V, the Kaiburr Crystal was an ancient Force relic that could increase the power of a Force-sensitive over a thousand times, boosting abilities such as Force Push and Force Lighting.
If the Kaiburr Crystal ended up in the wrong hands, it would bring disastrous consequences.

# Description

The Kaiburr crystal was utilised in the Temple of Pomojema by priests.
Using the artifact, they healed people that were sick.
The Kaiburr crystal became a legend; however, it was later found by a woman named Halla, and Luke and Leia Skywalker.
To their surprise, while Leia and Luke found a crystal, they encountered Darth Vader, who was pursuing them after their escape from prison.
Vader had eventually beaten the siblings and taken this crystal from them.
Later on, Luke was able to get his hands on one, who used it in his Jedi Praxeum on Yavin IV as a teaching tool.
It could also be used as a Lightsaber crystal.
