Created many years before the Great Hyperspace War was a Sith artifact named the Helm of Ieldis.
Whoever wore the dark side imbued artifact witnessed their negative emotions such as grief, regret, anger, and misery and changed them into dark side energies that made many sentient beings overcome in a homicidal frenzy.
At some point after the destruction of the Sith Empire, the Helm would be hidden on the planet known as Sarrassia by the Grumani Hierophants.
It was hidden in an underground temple beneath Mount Diligence.
Later, it would be moved to another planet, whose surface was a bleak desert, called Skarpos.
During the Republic Dark Age, with the cooperation of the Jedi Order many years later,  the University of Sanbra began preparations for a scientific exploration to locate and collect the helm.
Learning about the existence of the helm after raiding Sanbra, a Sith Lord known as Odion would begin to become intrigued by its whereabouts.
He sought to acquire the helm before his Sith compatriots, kidnapping some researchers on Aquilaris Minor and conscripting them into a top-secret plan called Project Pandemonium which focused on the possession of the artifact.
Among the researchers of this team included archaeologist Mercia Holt, and her husband Aron Holt, the parents of a Jedi Knight named Kerra Holt.
Around 1038 BBY, their last recorded position was located on Sarrassia.
In order to hopefully destroy the artifact, it was later revealed that the Holts attempted to trigger an explosion and sacrifice themselves.
While the temple had been badly damaged, the Helm remained unharmed due to it being a Sith artifact.
