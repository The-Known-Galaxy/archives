The Great Crystal was a massive pulsating violet crystal.
It was a dark artifact belonging to the Dark Side, a prison within the Great Temple on Korriban for hundreds of spirits of Jedi Masters.
Due to the defeat of Jedi Masters by the ancient Sith, the Jedi Masters were trapped in the Great Crystal and were lost to memory after the Sith left Korriban.
Therefore, leaving the souls trapped in the crystal, suffering an eternity of endless torment whilst the crystal remained intact.

While attempting to seduce Jedi Padawan Exar Kun to the Dark Side of the Force, the spirit of Sith Lord Freedon Nadd brought him to the Great Crystal, claiming this is the final test of his commitment to the way of the Sith.
However, after hearing Kunâ€™s explanation of the horrible fate the Masters suffered, Nadd decided to destroy the crystal, setting them free and causing an avalanche that would be capable of nearly killing Exar Kun.
