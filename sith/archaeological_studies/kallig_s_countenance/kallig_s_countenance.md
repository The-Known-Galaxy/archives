# Overview
Kallig’s Countenance is the name of the mask owned by Aloysius Kallig, an ancient Sith Lord who served under the Dark Lord of the Sith, Tulak Hord.
This mask carries the weight and history of the Sith Lord and the Kallig name.
Circa 3653 BBY, the mask was recovered by the Sith Lord Khreusis during the Cold War but was later confronted by a young Apprentice and the lone descendant of Kallig, the former being defeated by the latter.
The Apprentice would reprise his family name and take the title of ‘Lord Kallig’ after being classified accordingly, shortly before he would move on to ascend to the rank of Darth.
