# Overview

The legendary Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Nihilus, or the Lord of Hunger, owned a special Sith Holocron.
Sith Holocrons were powerful artifacts that contained teachings of the Dark Side of the Force that were extremely dangerous.
Many powerful Sith and Jedi tried to claim the Holocron.
One of the most notable stories about the Sith Holocron was when Vaverone Zare, a human female Sith, attempted to steal the Holocron but when Jedi Nariel Pridence found out,  she tried to stop her.
In 137 ABY, the powerful Dark lord of the Sith, Darth Krayt found the long-lost Holocron and claimed it as his own.
Krayt used the powerful artifact to contact a Sith Lord on the Sith home planet of Korriban.
After that, the location of the Holocron was unknown and so was its existence.
