This artifact known as the Mask of Nihilus was a piece of armor that the Sith Lord had bound to himself in order to remain in his physical form.
Powerful in the force, the sith lord was able to bind it to himself.
Due to his need to feed himself on the force, he was left with no choice but to bind his spirit to his armor, mask and robes using the force.

The mask itself was considered a sith artifact of great power that however, influenced its users to slowly destroy themselves in search for great power.
The Mask itself was imbued with powerful dark energy which was exerted by Nihilus himself.

After the Sith Lord’s death, his mask was left aboard his flagship,  as a reminder of his reign which was often associated with his destructive thirst for hunger.
The Mask would later be recovered aboard the wreck of the Nashuaga on planet Volik.

The mask allowed any to wield the force on a level equal to that of a sith apprentice, the reason was that the mask was imbued with so much of the sith lord’s dark force energy that it would flow through the user, granting them great power as previously discussed at the cost of their life through an agonizing process that would slowly drain their lifeforce.
