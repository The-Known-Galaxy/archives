The Ravager was a Sith artifact used by the resurgent Sith Empire that made its victims go insane after ripping information from their minds by force, which would slowly kill them afterwards.
Not long after the creation of the artifact, the Sith Emperor locked it away within the Dark Temple on Dromund Kaas.
Around 3643 BBY, Darth Baras of the Sphere of Military Offense sent his apprentice to retrieve the Ravager.
Baras wanted to use the artifact to break the mind of an SIS agent, Grik Sonosan, that proved too difficult to receive information from, wanting to break their mind.
After assembling all of the parts to the artifact, the apprentice took the Ravager to Baras.
Baras placed the Ravager atop the Agent’s forehead, activating it, and forced Sonosan to give him the information regarding the threat to Baras’ network of spies.
However, after receiving only a portion of the information he wanted, the Ravager liquified the mind of the agent, killing him instantly.
The Ravager proved to be a dangerous and deadly artifact, killing many of its victims.
