# Overview

Also known as “Jedi Readers”, force detectors were portable devices used to identify Force-Sensitive individuals.
The device consisted of two crystal paddles, connected to a hologram projector powered by thaissen crystals.
Whenever an individual was placed between the paddles, the device would project a hologram of said person.
In the case of a force sensitive, the hologram would have a blue aura around it.
Additionally, if an individual was aligned to the Dark Side of the force, the blue aura would have red marks.
The most notable users of this device were Emperor Palpatine’s Jedi Hunters, as well as the Dark Jedi Brakiss.
