The Morrigan Scrolls contained Sith knowledge and tactics created around the Jedi Civil War and were written by Darth Malak in 3956 BBY prior to his death.
By 684 BBY, the scrolls would fall into the hands of the Hutt known as Vortga and were stored in his treasury on Pybus.
The Scrolls would remain in his treasury until his death on Nar Shaddaa hundreds of years later.
Those that recognized the true importance of the Morrigan Scrolls would buy them for a price of 30,000 credits, but most collectors thought it had a monetary value of 5000 credits alone.
