# Overview
Wayfinders were ancient technology manufactured by both the Jedi and Sith for the sole purpose of navigating challenging stretches of space.
The design of Wayfinders was similar technology to that known as Jedi star compasses.
This navigation technology was through the studies of the brains of purrgil (space-faring megafauna who could travel through hyperspace by biological actions).
The Jedi and the Sith both distributed the power of the Force into their Wayfinders, securing secrecy and safety by making the Wayfinders non-accessible to those who aren’t  Force-users.

# Early History
Throughout history, ancient Sith discovered ways to navigate the anomalies of the Galactic Barrier to find Unknown Regions to utilize as staging grounds or temples.
However, their methods were lost to time, leaving their secret routes hidden within the Sith Wayfinders.



# First Order - Resistance War
During 35 ABY, Kylo Ren obtained Darth Vader’s Sith Wayfinder after his assault on planet Mustafar, giving him the capability of navigating to Exegol (the hidden world of the Sith located in the Unknown Regions).
Several days later, Rey utilized Sith inscriptions on Ochi’s Blade to locate a second Sith Wayfinder, which also led to Exegol, towards the wreckage of the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station upon the ocean moon of Kendor known as Kef Bir.
Within the Emperor’s vault, in the ruins of the throne room, Rey obtained the Wayfinder in the chamber hovering on a pillar.
However, while in the chamber Rey confronted a vision where she saw herself as a corrupted dark version.


Upon exiting the chamber, Kylo Ren confronted Rey and destroyed her Wayfinder, claiming the only possible way to reach Exegol is with him.
Although after the defeat of Kylo Ren against Rey in a duel, Rey came into possession of his Wayfinder when she stole Ren’s TIE Whisper.
Though she burned the ship with the Wayfinder, she found the last Wayfinder that led to Exegol in the wreckage, which was the first Wayfinder she was tracking.
Hence, she used it to travel to Exegol with Luke Skywalker’s X-wing starfighter whilst transmitting her coordinates to the Resistance to finally be victorious against the First Order, the Sith Eternal, the Final Order, and Darth Sidious once and for all.
