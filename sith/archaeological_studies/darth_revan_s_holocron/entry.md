# Information

Darth Revan was a Sith whose knowledge and power were extraordinary.
He decided to store all his understanding of the Dark Side into a Sith Holocron during the Jedi Civil War so the Sith who discovered it could feed his knowledge by the teachings of the Dark Lord.
The Sith Holocron of Darth Revan contained information about his beliefs about Sith Philosophy, the Dark Side of the Force, and details about dangerous ancient Sith rituals.
One of the rituals Darth Revan talked about was the Thought Bomb, an ancient rite that would eradicate every Force-sensitive in its blast radius.

Revan’s Holocron also mentioned Zelashiel, an individual who was proficient with the Force ability known as Force drain.
In Revan’s Sith Holocron, Zelashiel’s teachings were detailed enough for a Sith to project the ability against another user.
As well, this Sith Holocron taught the student how traits such as loyalty, mercy, and compassion stopped anyone from reaching their most powerful version.
The reasoning behind this was that anyone should accept their Force’s transformation instead of trying to control it.
Darth Revan also mentioned that having more than one apprentice was a mistake because the weak learners could overthrow the Sith Master, making the new Sith generation weaker.
