# Part I
The Darkstaff was an ancient sentient Sith artifact of great power and was known as one of the most dangerous artifacts to exist throughout the galaxy.
The rod was brown in color, one meter in length, and four centimeters in diameter.
It was crooked on one end, while a blue shining light was on the other end.
The Darkstaff was created to feed off the Force, however it was not imbued with the Force.
All light near and around the staff was consumed, causing the staff to produce dark, smoky tendrils that absorbed the Force essence out of organic organisms.
With enough Force essence, it had the power to destroy a planet.
In case the Staff required protection, it could create a small barrier, within the barrier it was devoid of the Force.
It could also teleport, but could not teleport within one kilometer of the Eye of the Sun, the opposite of the Darkstaff, an object imbued with the power of the light side.
The Darkstaff was immune to all Force powers, including lightsaber attacks.
It had the power to possess sentient lifeforms’ minds, allowing the Darkstaff to communicate, in which it had a raspy, darkened voice.
Strangely, the Staff also had an ability allowing it to transform creatures into Sithspawn, dark side imbued mutations, like zombies.

The personality of the Darkstaff thrived on suffering, it’s primary goal being destruction and death.
It was obsessed with the idea of gaining more and more power, it wanted to consume energy in particular, but it desired to consume the Force most of all.
The Darkstaff was deceitful, it used others to achieve its personal goals, persuading them into thinking they would be achieving their own goals rather than helping the Darkstaff reach its goals instead.
The staff would eventually warp the user’s mind.
The Darkstaff believed itself as powerful, and even thought it had the right to end the lives of anyone they pleased, seeing the strong as making choices for the weak.
The Darkstaff was unable to comprehend the ideals of compassion and self-sacrifice.



# Part III
Many thousands of years before the Clone Wars, a member of the Sith Order would create the Darkstaff, and it would eventually fall into the hands of the reformed Sith Empire, placing the artifact into storage aboard a space station by the name of the Arcanum.
However, around 3639 BBY, the artifact would be stolen by the Sith Lord Tagriss, a Dread Lord follower of the rogue Sith known as the Dread Masters.
Tagriss took the Staff to the Dread Guard’s Sanctum on Belsavis.
Operatives loyal to both the Republic and the Empire would trace Tagriss back to Belsavis, where Dread Guardsman Varrow would encounter the operatives, utilizing the Darkstaff to fight them.
The Darkstaff had granted Varrow immunity from many of their attacks and powers, however, he was unable to control the power of the Staff, resulting in his death.
The Darkstaff would then vanish in a fiery blaze of an explosion, disappearing.
Later, the Staff would be transported to a planet named Oblis, a part of the Cularin system, where the natives of Oblis, the Oblee will possess the artifact.
However, the staff began to manipulate the Oblee, transforming them.
It summoned shadow creatures, energy based beings that fed on the emotions of others.
However, the Oblee saw these creatures as threats, and attempted to use the Darkstaff against them, powering a weapon that would force the creatures away from their planet, but the Darkstaff absorbed the power, inevitably resulting in the destruction of Oblis.
Years later, the Darkstaff’s power would influence a Sith Lord named Darth Rivan to the Cularin System; he sought to control this power and obtain the Staff for himself.
During a crucial fight against the Jedi Order, Rivan will gain possession of the Darkstaff, in which the staff will transport Rivan through a wormhole hundreds of years into the future, during the Ruusan Campaign.



# Part IV
About 31 BBY, a Force-Sensitive named Len Markus will travel to I-9 to seize the Darkstaff for himself.
As Markus starts to leave the asteroid belt, a bolt of Force-lightning extending many kilometers long will be fired from Darth Rivan’s fortress on Almas.
The bolt damaged the staff, resulting in Markus making a deal with Phylus Mon, where he would repair the staff.
The artifact would regain most of its strength after being placed into the Crystal Pyramid, to feed upon Force essence.
However, a group of agents called the Heroes of Cularin boarded Mon’s ship and destroyed the pyramid before the staff could repair itself completely.
Then, the staff would return to Len Markus, who would then help the Darkstaff achieve a new goal: Destroy the Cularin system.
Its plan was to consume the Eye of the Sun, then use the power consumed from the artifact to lay waste to the Cularin system entirely.
As Markus began to learn the location of the Jedi-created artifact, he would bring the staff to the Ch’hala Heart Tree, where the artifact was hidden.
However, they were stopped in their path as the Heroes of Cularin encountered them, ensuing a battle between them.
One of the agents managed to channel the light side of the Force into the Sith artifact, resulting in its destruction, ending the threat that the Darkstaff posed towards the galaxy.
