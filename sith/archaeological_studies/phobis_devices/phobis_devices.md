The Phobis Devices were large, mysterious Sith artifacts that harnessed the powers of fear with only the simple exposure from them.
They left many people crippled with horror after witnessing the effects of their dark energy.
Three phobis devices were created and one of these would be placed into the Dark Temple on Dromund Kaas by the Sith Emperor, where it would sit and be used as a component to spread fear and hysteria for many centuries after its placement.
Many Sith had attempted to meditate around these devices, but many would fail and be overcome by the power of the Phobis Devices’ dark energies, going mad as a result.
Six Sith loyal to the Sith Emperor as advisors would be the only ones in existence that would be able to harness the power of these devices and were tasked by the Sith Emperor to study and research them, they would be known as the Dread Masters.
The Dread Masters would successfully harness and utilize the horrible power of these devices against the Republic.
