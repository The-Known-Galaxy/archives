# Overview

Coaxium is a rare element used to fuel hyperdrives and allow a ship to enter hyperspace, it is mainly found on the planet of Kessel, a planet used for mining by the Empire.
Due to Coaxium's rarity, the element was mainly used by the Empire for its massive fleet.
Unrefined Coaxium is very unstable and will explode when it turns red which is why most people will buy stabilized Coaxium to avoid danger.
Coaxium is used to fuel a ship's hyperdrive and will allow it to enter hyperspace and because of how scarce and unstable the element is, only a thin layer of it is applied.
The element is so potent that it was even used for the Death Star's planet-killing superlaser as it was so much more refined than normal hypermatter.
The Rebel Alliance got their hand on Coaxium by intercepting Empire transport ships and soon, the Rebel Alliance was able to use Coaxium to their advantage and be able to traverse the galaxy faster than ever.
Although due to the Empire's massive grip on the galaxy, they were able to seize full control of Coaxium production for a few years.
It was soon discovered that Kessel is not the only planet that could produce Coaxium, planets with strong interstellar energy were able to produce Coaxium.
