# Overview

The Holocron of Belia Darzu was a Holocron created by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Belia Darzu.
Shaped like a four sided pyramid device, this Holocron withheld all of the information Belia carried, mainly regarding Sith Philosophy and Sith Alchemy.
After Belias was murdered, her Holocron was kept in a stronghold on Tyhton.
Hundreds of years after her death, the Holocron was found and recovered by Darth Bane, who sought after figuring out how to create a Holocron of his own.

# Section I

Around the last quarter of the New Sith Wars, a Sith Lord under the name of Belia Darzu held reign over the Sith Empire during a period commonly referred to as the Sictis Wars.
Sometime around 1230 BBY, Belia constructed a Holocron, using this Holocron, Belia would record most of her knowledge on all Sith Philosophy and knowledge of the Dark Side, as well as how she constructed the Holocron specifically.
The dark energy that Darzus holocron produced led to a Technobeats army swarming her castle, acting as a sort of defense.

After successfully infiltrating Darzus’s tomb on Tython, Bane would discover this Holocron and use the secrets for his own benefit.
The Holocron contained an entire section detailing how to construct a Holocron, as well as showing pictures explaining how exactly it worked.
This was known as the “Rite of Commencement.”
