# Overview

The Qel-Droma Epics were a series of stories and poems that detailed the Unification Wars of Empress Teta, alongside Jedi Master Odan-Urr.
The Epics also go into great detail about the battle against Empress Teta of which was led by the legendary Sith Lord, Naga Sadow, and his forces during the Great Hyperspace War of 5000 BBY.

Not only do the Epics detail this event of galactic history, but they also detail the life of the Jedi Knight, Ulic Qel-Droma, of which the Epics are named after.
Ulic was believed to have infiltrated the Dark Sider cult known as the Krath during their Crusade of Krath, which led to the death of Ulic Qel-Dromaâ€™s master.
This event also led Ulic Qel-Droma to fall to the Dark Side along with Jedi Knight Exar Kun, the renowned Sith Lord and inventor of the modern Double-Saber, however, in the end, Ulic would eventually redeem himself and cut himself off from the Force.

Historians believe that the Qel-Droma Epics warn and teach young Jedi of the dangers of the Dark Side of the Force, however, the inhabitants of Empress Teta believe the story's origins are set as historical facts, but archaeological expeditions to this day have failed to find any distinctive proof that verify the legends.
