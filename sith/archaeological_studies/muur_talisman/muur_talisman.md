The Muur Talisman was among the first of the three Great Amulets to be created by the Sith Lord known as Sorzus Syn, who would also create the Sith code.
The Talisman had the ability to turn other life forms into mindless thralls that stood at the possessor’s command.
It would be one of the most known Sith artifacts mentioned in many Sith holocrons dating back to the Golden Age of the Sith.
Sorzus Syn created the talisman for Lord Karness Muur, to allow Muur to create rakghouls and sustain his essence, which would then grant him spiritual immortality.
Once the user of the Talisman was executed, it would seek out the next most powerful Force user in the galaxy to act as their vessel and conduit.
For centuries, the Muur Talisman would be asleep in obscurity.
Many Sith Lords, including Naga Sadow would tear at others to claim its power for themselves.
At some time, the talisman would be buried in the Undercity of Taris after its last owner was crushed by a cave-in.
It would remain there for the next hundred or so years, spreading the Rakghoul plague to the surrounding areas amongst the Outcast.
As of 3963 BBY, the Jedi Covenant suspected the Muur Talisman to be located in the Undercity of Taris, they sent Jedi Master Xamar of the First WatchCircle to find the artifact when they were forced to leave the planet following Zayne Carrick’s escape.

The Muur Talisman found a suitable host within Celeste Morne, a Jedi Shadow from the Jedi Covenant.
However, she had begun to fall under the Talisman’s evil corruption and sensed the Rakghoul plague’s immense potential along with the presence of Karness Muur’s spirit within the Talisman.
She pleaded with Zayne to end her life while she still had control over her mind and body.
Although the Padawan had different ideas, deciding to enclose Celeste in an oubliette of the Sith Dreypa, hoping to bring her to Jedi Covenant researchers on Odryn to remove the Talisman from her neck.
However, the Jebble would be bombarded by Cassus Fett by nuclear missiles and Zayne presumed that Celeste was dead and the Talisman was lost.
The Jedi Covenant assumed Zayne was corrupted by the Talisman and Celeste had been killed.
