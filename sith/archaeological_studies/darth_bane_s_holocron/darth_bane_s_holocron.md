# History

Before successfully creating this holocron, Darth Bane had already attempted to make a holocron on three separate occasions to no avail.
The first time, he worked effortfully for days, but the holocron’s matrix collapsed on itself.
The second time, he worked slowly, prudently and meticulously, but the holocron’s matrix degraded until it was unusable.
The third time, he let the force guide his actions.
He put all of his faith into the force, so it may guide his movements, but once again, the matrix degraded.
He only understood the reason of his failures after he went to Tython to find Belia Darzu’s holocron.
After accessing Belia’s holocron, he discovered that the reason for his unsuccess was him not linking the matrix with the capstone correctly.
He would then create the holocron correctly, intending for it to be a message to future Sith.
By 137 ABY, the Holocron would fall in the hands of Darth Krayt.
