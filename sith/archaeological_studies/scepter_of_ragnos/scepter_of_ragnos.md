The Scepter of Ragnos was a Sith artifact of great power once belonging to a Dark Lord of the Sith known as Marka Ragnos of the ancient Sith Empire.
The sword could siphon and store dark side energy within itself, then release it onto individuals to make them Force-Sensitive.
The sword would be created by Marka Ragnos around 5000 BBY, the weapon consisted of a forked crest.
Both the handle and tip were smeared, and the pommel had a double guard, the inside guard shorter than the outside guard.
Around 14 ABY, a female Dark Jedi known as Tavion Axmis would buy the weapon from a collector on a planet called Commenor, in which they used it to create the Disciples of Ragnos.
The Disciples were a cult that was devoted to bringing Marka Ragnos back from the dead.
However, the cult was stopped completely when a Jedi Knight named Jaden Korr destroyed the scepter.
Along with the destruction of the scepter, Axmis was destroyed as well when the spirit of Marka Ragnos had to leave her body forcefully.
