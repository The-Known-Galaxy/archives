# Overview
An Oubliette was a Sith Artifact that could keep a Sith alive for thousands of years, regardless of their health.

# History
Remulus Dreypa was a Sith Lord who strove to torment and eliminate Karness Muur, his nemesis, so he could become the possessor of his Muur Talisman amulet.
In order to obtain his enemy’s amulet, Dreypa invented an Oubliette that would fall later into Pulsipher’s ownership, a Mandalorian Neo-Crusader who delivered the Sith Artifact to his laboratories within Jebble.
Following the Mandalorian’s demise in 3963 BBY, a Padawan known as Zayne Carrick made it his own and suggested the Jedi Covenant Celeste Morne could be jailed within the Oubliette to stop the Rakghouls from following her orders, something that happened after they nullified her Talisman’s interference.
In 3956, Darth Glovoc carried an Oubliette aboard the Dying Sun, but was intercepted during his visit to Nyriaan.
Although he didn’t land in the location he wanted, he still placed himself in the Oubliette to preserve his life.

As this Sith Artifact changed ownership constantly, it became known as the Jebble Box for his discovery by Pulsipher on Jebble.
According to the dealers, this casket contained a secret treasure that made the Oubliette’s price increase.

In 137 ABY, Darth Vurik sought out Glovoc along with the Oubliette he was inside of.
During this mission assigned by Darth Krayt, Vurik was distracted by a Jedi Group that resided on the planet Nyriaan.
Darth Glovoc’s followers took advantage of this and moved the Sith Lord’s Oubliette to a hidden position.
He then informed the Dark Lord of the Sith he had failed to locate and apprehend Glovoc and his Oubliette.
