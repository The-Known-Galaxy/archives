# Overview
Doonium was a metal found on multiple planets and asteroid belts around the galaxy.
These planets include but are not limited to; Umbara, Lothal, Batonn, and Samovar.
The biggest Doonium mine, called the "Lothal Doonium Mine", was owned and operated by the Galactic Empire after making a deal with Pryce Mining.
This metal was used for many Imperial weapons, droids, and other gadgets, with one of them being the Mark 1 Buzz Droids.
The Empire felt an extreme need to gather and hoard this material as it was the main material used for the Death Star.
It was an extremely necessary material used to assist in the shielding of the Hypermatter Reactor.
Many individuals grew to wonder why so much Doonium was being transported, and eventually received an answer after a rebel spy leaked the information.
