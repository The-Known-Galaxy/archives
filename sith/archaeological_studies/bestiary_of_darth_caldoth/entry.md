The Bestiary, written by Darth Caldoth, is a compendium of Sith warbeasts, alongside their traits and attributes.
It collected information on creatures like the Silooth, Tuk’ata, Veergundark, and the Krastenane.

# History

Prior to 1,032 BBY, Darth Caldoth wrote his famous Bestiary.
At almost 88 BBY, the Jedi Order acquired the book and stored it within Coruscant’s archives, thanks to Jedi Master Lene Kostana.
Later, Jedi initiates Dooku and Sifo-Dyas would break into the Bogdan Collection; a secret place inside the archives that contained Dark-Side artifacts.
This caused Dooku to experience a vision that he managed to repress.

Kostana became aware of Dooku’s vision and wanted to learn more about it.
She claimed that it would be key to understanding the Sith, who she feared will soon return back to the galaxy.
The Jedi Grandmaster, alongside the High Council, disagreed with her theory and suggested the vision remained buried in Dooku’s subconscious.

Days later, Lene Kostana disobeyed the council and formulated a plan which she believed would trigger Dooku’s memories.
She took a fragment of the Bestiary and snuck it inside the articles of Lothal Papyri; a series of treatises Dooku was translating as punishment for breaking into the archives.
Kostana thought that being in contact with that artifact would help resurface Dooku’s memories of his vision.

Shortly thereafter, Sifo-Dyas discovered the Bestiary’s fragment and immediately showed it to Dooku.
Dooku grew alarmed and wanted to turn it in to the council and report Kostana.
While Sifo-Dyas convinced him not to do the following, Dooku began to suspect that Lene Kostana was secretly a member of the Sith.

Dooku then decided to confront the Jedi Master about the Bestiary.
It transformed into a lightsaber duel which was intervened and resolved by Yoda.
Kostana’s plans were revealed, which removed Dooku’s suspicions.
However, Yoda grew frustrated at the Jedi Master and forced her to return the Bestiary back to the archives.
