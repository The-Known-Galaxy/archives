# Introduction
This lightsaber belonged to the renowned Jedi Knight Revan.
He constructed the lightsaber during his retraining with a blue blade, until he defeated Darth Malak, where he would subsequently change it to a green blade during his search for the Sith Emperor.
He wielded this saber until his final death on Yavin IV in 3637 BBY during the Revanite crisis.

# Section 1
In 3954 BBY, shortly after the Jedi Civil War, Revan left the known galaxy, taking his saber with him as more of his lost memories started to return.
During his discoverance of Dromund Kaas, he was taken captive by the pureblood Dark Council member Darth Nyriss and her apprentice Sith Lord Scourge, in the Emperor’s fortress.
While he was captured, his saber was taken for months and was kept as a belonging, where he was additionally tortured by the captors trying to get information out of him.
After three long years, Jedi Knight Meetra Surik came to rescue him, accompanied by the help of a treacherous Scourge.
Altogether, they defeated Darth Nyriss and the saber was retrieved back.



# Section 2
Revan, Surik and Scourge stormed the Sith Emperor’s citadel, and after three years, Revan’s lightsaber was finally put to use again as it cut down an Imperial Guard before taking on the Sith Emperor himself.
After Scourge betrayed and killed Surik, the assault failed, and Revan was eventually imprisoned and became the Emperor’s captive for three hundred years.
During the Cold War, the Republic became aware of his imprisonment due to Surik’s Force ghost, who stayed with Revan his entire capture.
In order to navigate through the Maelstrom, where Revan was held, they had to gain access to a Gree computer.
A Republic strike team was sent to Taral V, in order to access that Gree computer, where they succeeded in tracking and freeing Revan.
As time went on, Revan’s lightsaber changed to violet in demonstration of his connection to both the light and dark side of the Force, where he traveled to the Foundry–a massive space station within an asteroid, which was able to create a massive amount of droids in a short time.
The lightsaber was put to use again when Revan had to defend the Foundry against an Imperial strike force, commanded by Darth Malgus who ordered the capture of the station and his demise.
As Revan was killed during the assault, there was a part of him that still had the urge to survive, as his connection to the dark side would revitalize his body.
Subsequently, he escaped the station, where he returned in leading the Order of Revan which bore his name.
The saber would remain with the Dark Side fueled warrior until his final battle on Yavin IV.
