The Sith Lord known as Darth Nihilus, the Lord of Hunger, bound himself to his mask using the Force in order to retain an alikeness of a physical form.
Darth Nihilus was one of the few survivors of the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator on the surface of Malachor V during one of the last battles of the Mandalorian Wars.
Being left with an insatiable hunger to feed on Force essence, Nihilusâ€™ hunger began to erode his physical body.
In order to keep himself alive, he bound his soul to his robes, armor, and even his mask with the dark side of the Force.
Eventually, aboard his flagship, Nihilus would be killed by his former apprentice, Meetra Surik, Visas Marr, and Canderous Ordo.
However, after his death, his soul remained within his mask, encouraging the victims that wear the mask to slowly destroy themselves for greater powers.
Those that wore the mask were imbued with dark forces that allowed them to use the dark side of the Force similar to that of a Sith Apprentice.
