# Description
Ludo Kressh’s War Sword was a weapon that was wielded by a Sith Lord named Ludo Kressh.
It was used by Kressh in the great hyperspace war.
This weapon was not a lightsaber, it was a metal sword.
With its look it was similar to regular Sith war swords.
Ludo had a unique taste because he didn’t wield a normal lightsaber because he preferred traditional weapons, such as swords and war blades.
The way with which the weapon was forged was the Ancient Sith Alchemy.
Ludo used this sword in a battle against his rival, Naga Shadow, which soon became the Dark Lord of the Sith.
Kressh destroyed the weapon as a sign of non-acceptance of Naga Shadow being a Dark Lord of the Sith.
