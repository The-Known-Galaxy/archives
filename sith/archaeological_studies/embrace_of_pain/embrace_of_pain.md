The Embrace of Pain was an organic torture device that resembled a rack-like restraint.
The victim would be placed upside down against the Embrace and the more they struggled against it, the more pain it would inflict upon them.
The creature would read electrochemical outputs of the victim’s nerve impulses and evaluate their brain chemistry in order to torture them.
The resultant data was being used to keep constant and optimum pain levels.
The Yuuzhan Vong used the Embrace of Pain as a form of meditation, since they did not see its use as torture.
The device could use a number of different ways to torture the victim, such as stretching ligaments and joints, acid, electric shocks, sharp objects, needles, injected biotoxins, and even thorns.
When a victim was at the edge of death, the Embrace would keep the victim alive by lowering them to the floor to let them sleep while working on fixing their body, injecting water and food into them and tending to wounds.
