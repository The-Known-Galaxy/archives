# Overview

The Carbonite Sith Army Holocron was a Sith Holocron containing information pertaining to the location of the tomb where the Carbonite Sith Army is found.
At first it was Jabba the Hutt’s possession, but was then stolen by Tyber Zann and Urai Fen.
It’s around 4000 years old, during the time when the Great Sith War was happening.
To comprehend the device, they required the use of the Force, so they asked Nightsister Sliri for help.
However, Silri was only able to find ancient star charts.
Zann then returned the Holocron to Thrawn.
Silri, furious, decided to recover the artifact during a raid on Emperor Palpatine’s vault.
She then looked deeper into the Holocron, noticing the location of the Carbonite Sith Army tomb, which she then used to reach the planet where it’s found.
