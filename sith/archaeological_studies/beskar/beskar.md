# Overview
Beskar is an extremely legendary steel, known mainly for its insane durability and special usage.
This was a steel primarily used by Mandalorians for their unique armor, hence why this metal also carries names such as the Mandalorian Iron or the Mandalorian Steel.
This metal was so strong that it could handle blaster bolts and actual Lightsaber strikes.
The armor and other Beskar items were crafted using a superweapon known as the Arc Pulse Generator that was able to achieve such high temperatures that it could completely melt and mold the Beskar.


The Mandalorians had many different groups, but every single one of them used Beskar to craft their own armor.
Hundreds of years ago, the Jedi and Mandalorians went into a war, and the armor forged from Beskar was the only thing keeping the fight equal.
The Armorer used top of the line tools to craft Beskar items strong enough to block even Darksaber strikes.
The exact strategy for creating Mandalorian armors was an extremely ancient and sacred practice, with only some Mandalorians knowing how to perform the act of Beskar craftsmanship.
Beskar had uses outside of the armor though.
It was used to craft other items such as the Beskar spear, dagger, sword, Halber, and even the hilt of the Darksaber.
The Beskar armor was so strong that a hit from a plate in the armor could destroy someone's insides.
