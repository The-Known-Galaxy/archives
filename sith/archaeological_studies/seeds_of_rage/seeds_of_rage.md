# The Seeds of Rage
Sith Lord Fulminiss was a master of Sith alchemy, developing and creating many of the Sith artifacts, including the Seeds of Rage.
The Seeds were cylindrical and about as wide an average Human’s shoulders.
The Seeds of Rage were multiple artifacts that were buried underground to manipulate the emotions and thoughts of any living lifeforms near or around them.
Over a span of time, the creatures affected by the Seeds would contaminate their minds with the dark side of the Force and drive them insane, which caused both the victims and the environment to warp and shift.

# Galactic War Era
Around the Galactic War, a servant to the rogue Sith known as the Dread Masters, Lord Tagriss, spread the Seeds across many planets that were settled by their intelligent natives.
These planets include Alderaan, Arcanum, Balmorra, Taris, Tatooine, Hoth, Corellia, Voss, and Ilum.
Darth Acina, Sphere of Technology of the Dark Council, summoned and deployed an Imperial individual to recover the seeds.
However, Jedi Master Cedral Gend asked that a Republic individual also look for the seeds, but to destroy them instead.
