# Overview
The mask of Viceroy Exim Panshard was a Sith artifact that was made from meteoritic metal.
It was an ancient artifact that was destroyed in 21 ABY.
The design was quite unique, it had tiny hammered divots and had no nose or mouth, but eyes made from black glass.
Yupe Tashu, who was an adviser to Emperor Palpatine, found this artifact and claimed that it contained hundreds of screams from innocents who were slaughtered by the Viceroy.
The Viceroy killed these innocents out of pleasure and when he died, the mask’s journey through the years was lost until it was found by Yupe Tashu.
Yupe didn’t want the mask due to its horrifying screams, so he gave it to one of the Acolytes of the beyond, Kiza, who he entrusted it with.
Afterwards, the mask was later destroyed by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker.
