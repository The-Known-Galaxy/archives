# Introduction

The Sith spellbook, also known as a grimoire, was a transcript prepared by someone well versed in the lore of the Sith.
It contained spells, rituals, and incantations that were used for Sith magic.
The use of these books dates back to the Ancient Sith Empire.
Marka Ragnos and Naga Sadow were known to have had possession of a Sith Spellbook.
Sadow later handed the book in his possession over to his apprentice, Gav Daragon.
Daragon studied the contents of the book during his time that he trained under Lord Sadow on Khar Shian.

# Section 1

The Dark Lord of the Sith, Freedon Nadd, managed to transcribe a Sith spellbook.
He even recorded the spells he performed with a holocron.
Nadd’s holocron and other artifacts were later passed down to his direct descendant, King Ommin.
As the ruler of Onderon, the king was able to master the powers from these artifacts that he was given and used them during his reign.
In 3998 BBY, two aristocrats named Satal and Aleema Keto managed to obtain a Sith spellbook when they infiltrated the Museum of Dark Side Antiquities on Coruscant.
However, the pair were unable to decipher the contents of the book, so they headed to Onderon to meet with King Ommin in hopes that he would assist them.
They landed on Onderon and found King Ommin, and while there he gave Satal an amulet that would allow him to decipher the ancient Sith writings.
King Ommin later died  during the Second Battle of Onderon.
All of his treasures were given to Freedon Nadd and the Ketos.

# Section 2

Around 3,000 years later, a new Dark Lord of the Sith rose to power and gained possession of the spells.
The new owner of these teachings was Darth Bane, the only Dark Lord of the Sith to survive the New Sith Wars.
He later transcribed the teachings into text for easier access.
Some time passed and Bane was taken to the tomb of Freedon Nadd, during his search for knowledge about the creation of holocrons.
He was able to successfully infiltrate the chamber within the tomb that housed Nadd’s personal holocron.
Bane studied the contents of holocron and found that there were spells for harnessing Sith sorcery inside.
However, he was not accustomed to the ways of Sith sorcery, so he transcribed the data into a spellbook and later presented it to his apprentice Darth Zannah.
