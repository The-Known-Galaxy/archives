The mask of Revan belonged to a female Mandalorian during the early skirmishes of the Mandalorian Wars, and had a red and gray color.
Ten years after the Mandalorian female’s death, during the Mandalorians’ genocide of the Cathar people on their homeworld in 3973 BBY, the mask would be claimed by Jedi Knight Revan accompanied by his fellow Jedi Knight and friend Malak.
When light was shone onto the mask, all of the Jedi present at the time experienced a vision through the Force showing them all the battles that had taken place a decade prior to their arrival.
Revan realized after the vision that the woman that wore the Mandalorian mask was attempting to defend the Cathar people from being killed and was executed as a result of the Mandalorians’ want to kill the defenseless people of Cathar.
He would wear this mask in honor of the sacrifices made by the woman, promising to never take it off until the Mandalorians were brought up to justice.
As he led the Galactic Republic to victory against the Mandalorian Neo-Crusader, Revan would wear this mask.
Up until Revan’s capture by the Jedi Order and Republic’s forces as a Dark Lord of the Sith, he would wear his mask as his personal armor.
Revan also wore the mask once more on Dromund Kaas when he confronted the Sith Emperor.
The two friends and Jedi Knights, Malak and Revan, had fallen to the dark side under the influence of the Sith Emperor, Revan would eventually call himself the Dark Lord of the Sith, and Malak his Sith apprentice, thus starting their own Sith Empire.
