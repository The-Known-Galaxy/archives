# Description

The Amulet of Kalara was a Sith Relic that was filled with the energies of the dark side, such as passion, hatred, and anger.
The Amulet when put on was able to make the user invisible.
It was constructed around 1960 years BBY.
It was a good addition to a Force-sensitive loadout, because it gave him more abilities and boosted his connection with the force.

In history, Sith Lady Lumiya gave a task to Ben Skywalker, which said to retrieve the Amulet from Lando Calrissianâ€™s collection of artifacts.
Before Skywalker got his hands on the relic, it was taken by Faskus Olvidan.
Later on, he managed to capture the artifact, giving it to Jacen Solo.
