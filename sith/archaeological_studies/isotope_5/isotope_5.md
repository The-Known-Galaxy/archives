# Overview

Isotope-5 is one of the rarest elements in the galaxy, it is a radioactive version of illerium, an element found normally in neutron stars.
The element was the fifth-ever known variation of illerium, the variation bends gravitational and electromagnetic fields at the atomic levels.
The element was first found on the planet of Makeb, an oceanic planet with gravitational levels below the standard.
The odd gravity of Makeb was believed to be the cause of Isotope-5's gravitational and electromagnetic warping properties.
The element was soon used for the development of weapons such as the Isotope-5 droid and more devastating blaster fire.
The Hutt Cartel utilized the element to fight and rival the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire, although they were unable to fight both sides due to the Sith Empire sending in a small taskforce to seize the element or prevent the Hutt Cartel from utilizing it even further.
Other properties of Isotope-5 was its lightness and how durable it is, the element was described as light as shimmersilk and even more durable than durasteel.
Shimmersilk was mostly used for clothing and was incredibly light meanwhile, durasteel was used for armor like Mandalorian armor.
The element itself is highly unstable and requires a lot of time to stabilize before it can be used for any development.
