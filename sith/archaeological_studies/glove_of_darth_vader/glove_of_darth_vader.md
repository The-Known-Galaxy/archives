# Overview
As the name suggests, the Glove of Darth Vader was the glove used by Sith Lord Vader on his right hand.
While the left grip held primarily the same functions, the left one had additional features that made it a better accessory.
This gauntlet was also fitted around Lord Skere Kaan’s Sith Amulets.
While the Battle of Endor was still ongoing, Like sliced off Vader's hand in an intense battle, causing Vader's hand to spiral down a seemingly endless pit leading to the Emperor's Throne Room.
While the glove was believed to be lost, its material caused it to stay intact where it appeared in a wreckage on the planet Dac.

It was believed that the wielder of Darth Vader's glove would become the next-in-line to serve as the Galactic Empire.
This was because of the Kadann, better known as the false Prophet of the Dark Side.
Grand Moff Bertroff used this false Prophet to his advantage and got a random mutant-human to serve as the Empire, acting as a puppet for the Grand Moff Bertroff.
The mutant however did not care about using the glove for a seat as the Empire.
Instead, he wanted to use it as a weapon.
He believed that the glove was magical and gave its user the ability to move things telekinetically, unaware that this was the doing of "The Force'.
After retrieving the glove, he got into a battle with Luke and other rebels.
He attempted to use the magical glove, but of course to no avail.
