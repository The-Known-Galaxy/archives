# Description
Aleema Keto’s robes are a Sith relic.
The robes, once put on, boost the wearer’s strength and wisdom.
Aleema Keto was a Sith Sorcerer, the cousin of Satal Keto.
She was the co-leader of the Dark Side cult of Krath.
Later on, she managed to overthrow the command of Krath.
There are rumors that the Jedi Exile, Meetra Surik, had found those robes in the midst of the First Jedi Purge.
