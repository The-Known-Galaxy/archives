# Overview

The Sith Empire was the successor of the original Sith Empire that spanned thousands of star systems throughout the galaxy, starting with the Great Hyperspace War which resulted in a defeat.
The Sith that were left were forced to retreat to the Unknown Regions because of the Dark Lord Naga Sadow’s failed attempts at destroying the Galactic Republic.
The exiled Sith were led by Lord Vitiate, looking desperately for a new home.
At the time, Vitiate was at his palace in Nathema and broadcasted news about helping the Sith Empire regain its glory through ancient Sith magic and they would have to come to Nathema.
Over eight thousand Sith Lords arrived, but Vitiate had lied to them and used his power to dominate their minds and make their wills his own.
After this, Vitiate decided to perform an extremely powerful and ancient Sith ritual, granting him immortality and destroying the planet in the process.
About twenty years into the journey for a new world, the Sith finally arrived at the hidden world of Dromund Kaas where they settled in and started rebuilding.
They established the capital named Kaas City and prepared a war machine to one day get revenge on the Galactic Republic.
During this time, Lord Vitiate had become the Dark Lord of the Sith, creating a Dark Council of Sith Lords to assist him in the rebuilding process.

# Section 1

The Emperor, known as Darth Vitiate appointed twelve Sith Lords to the Dark Council who became the highest ranking members in the new Sith Empire and they ruled in the public view while the Emperor began studying the Dark Side deeply.
An Imperial force was formed and they began with clearing the forests of Dromund Kaas to make place for constructions.
The Dark Temple was discovered early and the Emperor's visions and echoes led to him taking control of the Dark Temple.
After Kaas City was fully completed, they used the Dark Temple to store ancient artifacts but also as tombs for those opposing the rule of the Emperor.
Early in the Empire’s history, members of the Dark Council began building up spheres of influence.
Darth Zavakon chose the recovery and studies of Ancient Knowledge because he found out the Empire lacked knowledge due to fellow Sith not sharing any.
He began working on a project where the old Sith tombs and artifacts would be further studied and investigated by his team of archeologists.
The team made groundbreaking discoveries that previous Sith had missed, leading to the Dark Council allowing Darth Zavakon to create the Imperial Reclamation Service who would work on protecting the sacred knowledge.
Another individual named Odile Vaiken chose to build the Imperial Navy with the knowledge of it having to take some time.
He assigned his forces to gather resources, fabricate the ships and get them ready for manufacturing.
Vaikens efforts led to him gaining the title of Grand Moff from the Emperor.
He went on to conquer other societies outside Dromund Kaas with this newfound navy, but was eventually killed on one of his crusades in 4904 BBY.
The Empire expanded further and further, but remained unable to reclaim the lands of Korriban from the Jedi Order.

# Section 3

After three hundred years of hiding, the Sith emerged from the shadows and made their presence known throughout the galaxy.
Still under Vitiate's control, they set up Republican puppet governments around the Outer Rim and invaded the Republic to high lengths.
These were the early stages of a war that would become known as “the Great Galactic War”.
After securing the Outer Rim, Vitiate turned his eye on the Galactic Core and had his forces push towards it.
Even though the march forward caused many losses, they kept going and eventually managed to get through with the help of the Mandalorian clans made up of fierce warriors.
The Republic's economy was decimated and heavily damaged, but they managed to push out the intruders leading to another stalemate.
In a shocking move, the Dark Council sent a peace offer to the Republic.
After having detrimental losses and with the lack of motivation among the fighters, they desperately accepted this peace treaty.
But the Sith had a trick up their sleeve and launched a surprise attack on the capital of Coruscant.
This attack led to the Republic completely submitting to the Empire and signing the Treaty of Coruscant, essentially ending the Great Galactic War.
With this victory, the Empire grew stronger than ever.
With peace, a cold war took place right after the Great Galactic War.
The Cold War had the Empire engaging in small proxy wars or conflict with the Republic but none of the sides actively engaged in war with each other and remained neutral.
However, this peace would not last for long as a new war emerged.

# Section 4

After the Cold War, the peace treaty previously created fell to pieces.
The actions of incredibly powerful individuals made the two sides break out in war.
Originally, a plan was set in motion to turn the Emperor to the Dark Side, but it failed with the entire Jedi Strike Force being captured.
Another plan was put to play, but this time it was successful.
Plan Zero was a plan made to assassinate the Republic’s War Trust military leadership so the Republic wouldn’t have the leadership to keep fighting.
Darth Baras apprentice managed to kill off all targets and this marked the beginning of an escalation within the conflict.
During the opening stages of the war, there were inner conflicts within the Republic and the Empire.
The Emperor had a project meant to defeat the Republic in the long term, called the Children of the Emperor.
His agents would be placed in a world controlled by the Republic and quickly rise the ranks and gain influence while being under the rule of the Emperor.
One of them was Syo Bakarn, who made it to the Jedi Council without anyone knowing of his true nature.
This project eventually fell apart when the Barsen’thor issued a search to eliminate these agents which took them to many places.
Darth Baras, who had previously helped the Emperor and risen to the rank of Dark Council, turned on the Emperor and claimed to be his voice when the Emperor's voice was trapped on the planet Voss.
In his hunger for power, he betrayed his apprentice causing the apprentice to become the Emperor’s Wrath and killing his old Master in combat.
During the war, one of the Emperor's servants known as “Hero of Tython” managed to break free of his will.
The Emperor now had a plan to strengthen his own power leading to the destruction of all life of the galaxy through a Sith ritual.
The Hero and his allies went out of their way to stop the Emperor’s plan to take action, so they traveled to the prison world of Belsavis to free the Dread Masters.
These Dread Masters were powerful users of the Dark Side who were the primary target of the Emperor’s plan, so they were freed from the prison world which would cause future consequences for the galaxy in the upcoming years.
Shortly after these events, the first major event of this war would begin, which was the full launched invasion of the planet Corellia, a core planet to the Republic.
This invasion failed with millions of casualties, and marked the beginning of a counter invasion made from the Republic.
Eventually, the Hero of Tython launched an invasion of Dromund Kaas with his strike force to once and for all end the cruel Emperor’s reign of terror.
The group went on to complete different objectives needed to be taken care of, while the Hero was to face the Dark Overlord.
It was a hard fought battle, with the Emperor trying to cast many attacks and abilities, but the Hero of Tython eventually came out on top and killed the Emperor’s host body which didn’t fully kill the Emperor, but significantly weakened him and the Empire suffered a heavy defeat.
A heavily dissatisfied Darth Malgus saw the fall of the Empire and created the New Empire under his rule.
