# Overview |

Operation: Knightfall was the name given to the direct attack on the Jedi Temple by Darth Vader and the 501st Legion during Order 66.
After assisting in the death of Jedi Master Mace Windu, Anakin Skywalker (now Darth Vader) was ordered by Darth Sidious to conduct an all out attack on the Jedi Temple.
Desperate to save his wife, Padme Amidala from death, Vader obeyed without hesitation, storming the Jedi temple he once called home with the 501st legion.
Operation Knightfall, along with the remote execution of Order 66 to clones on the battlefield marked the beginning of the great Jedi Purge.

During the fighting, Vader and his clone legion were able to defeat all Jedi within the temple, including Jedi Battlemaster Cin Drallig and Jedi Master Shaak Ti (according to Disney canon).
During the fighting, Darth Vader altered a beacon, informing all Jedi outside the temple that the Clone Wars had concluded and ordering them back to the temple.
Those who returned were slain by clone troopers in wait (some of whom were disguised as Jedi).
When this signal reached Jedi Masters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi, the two Jedi returned to the temple to disable the beacon and replace it with one warning all surviving Jedi to stay away from the temple.
