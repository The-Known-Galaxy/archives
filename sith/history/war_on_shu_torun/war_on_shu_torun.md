# Overview
The War on Shu-Torun took place in 0 ABY on the planet of Shu-Torun in the Mid Rim region.
Queen Trios, the newly appointed monarch of the Kingdom of Shu-Torun, faced a rebellion led by Duke Rubix and his faction of ore-dukes.
Their objective was to challenge Trios' rule and gain control over the planet's valuable mineral resources.
To suppress the uprising and maintain her authority, Queen Trios sought military support from the Galactic Empire.
Responding to her request, the Empire deployed their forces to aid Trios' loyalist faction.

# Section I
After the destruction of Alderaan and the Rebel Alliance's victory at the Battle of Yavin, Darth Vader journeyed to Shu-Torun with the aim of solidifying the planet's alliance with the Galactic Empire.
Princess Trios, daughter of the king of Shu-Torun, extended an invitation to Vader for a celebration, but her true intention was to assassinate him.

During the event, disguised guards that were posing as rebel opposition, ambushed Vader.
However, the Dark Lord swiftly defeated them.
In a surprising turn of events, Trios then led Vader into a perilous shaft where lava threatened their lives.
Despite the danger, both managed to survive the encounter.
In a desperate move, Trios attempted to shoot Vader, resulting in the loss of her own hand.

In the aftermath, the Emperor's Fist dispatched two assassin droids, 0-0-0 and BT-1, to eliminate the king of Shu-Torun and his remaining children.
With the rebellion crushed, Vader bestowed a fragment of Alderaan as a grim reminder of the Empire's power and appointed Trios as the new monarch of Shu-Torun.
Subsequently, after Vader's triumph over Commander Karbin at the Battle of Vrogas Vas, Emperor Palpatine dispatched the Emperor's Fist to aid Grand General Cassio Tagge and Queen Trios in subduing the ongoing rebellion led by the ore-dukes.



# Section II
In the War on Shu-Torun, Darth Vader joined forces with Queen Trios to confront the rebellious barons.
Their strategic plan involved a direct assault on a delving citadel, a vital power source controlled by one of the dukes.
Leading the charge, Vader, Queen Trios, and their allied forces engaged in a frontal assault, while Doctor Tulon Voidgazer's drones positioned themselves to strike the Citadel's flanks with experimental ordnance.

The combined might of Vader's stormtroopers and the Queen's forces put immense pressure on the Citadel's defenses, diverting their attention from Voidgazer's drones.
Exploiting this advantage, the drones breached the Citadel's defenses and detonated their payload, causing extensive damage.
Although the complete destruction of the Citadel was not achieved, the successful attack served as a reminder of the Empire's relentless power and left the dukes reconsidering their rebellion.



# Section III
In the aftermath, Queen Trios appointed Bixen as Baroness to negotiate peace with the remaining rebels.
She pledged to handle the remaining ore-dukes while ensuring their bloodlines persisted.
Darth Vader departed but left a stormtrooper captain as Trios' advisor.
Meanwhile, Doctor Cylo and his abominations fled after supporting Rubix, later facing defeat when they tried to seize the new Super Star Destroyer, the Executor, at the hands of Vader.
