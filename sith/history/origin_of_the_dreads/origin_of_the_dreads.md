Following their study into the mysterious Phobis devices, they gained their reputation for surviving the observation of the devices.
Even the most powerful and wicked of the Sith would go mad with terror due to the power of this artifact.
They mastered their abilities over these artifacts and gained a powerful ally in the Sith Emperor whom they would begin to serve in the near future as generals, advisors, commanders, and even as prophets.
They had spent many years in secluded meditation on Dromund Kaas, and were only interrupted to bring crucial wisdom to the Emperor or receive gifts in the form of supplicants.
These powerful Sorcerers learned that they were now inseparable, remaining together as the Phobis devices bounded their power to the six of them.
They would receive immense power when working in union together.
They served in the front lines of the Great Galactic War, inflicting pain and projecting their terror upon their opponents.
Such power allowed the Dreads to destroy entire fleets of the Republic.
However, in order to secretly keep them protected from the Republic, the Dread Masters were stationed aboard an Imperial Dreadnaught.
Their Dreadnaughtâ€™s location was eventually discovered by a Jedi Knight, Jaric Kaedan.
Kaedan led a team of the Republic Special Forces division to infiltrate the Dreadnaught and capture the Six Sith Lords.
The Six Sith were captured by the Republic, yet resisted all attempts at being interrogated, in which the Jedi soon learned they were centuries old at this point.
The Sith Dreadnaught was destroyed, the Jedi relayed a false message stating that the Dread Masters were killed in action, but they were in fact, being held captive.
The Jedi Council had hoped that because of this information, the Emperor would not send help to save the Dreads.
The Jedi Council believed the Dreads were too valuable to the Republic, and could not be eliminated.
Their imprisonment was the only probable answer for the Council, in which they would place the Dread Masters on Belsavis, where they would remain until way after the end of the Great Galactic War.
It was feared that the Sith Empire would eventually release the Dread Masters, so that the galaxy would tremble beneath their feet and wreak havoc on the galaxy.
