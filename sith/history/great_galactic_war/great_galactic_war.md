# Overview |

The Crusade of Krath was a religious conflict that was told about in Qel-Droma Epics.
This conflict took place a millennium after the Great Hyperspace War.
These stories tell that the Crusade was led by the Krath, a dark side cult, going against the Jedi Order.
The crusade was led from the Krath command center in the Iron Citadel, as a continuation of a military coup conducted by corrupt noble descendants inside of the Empress Teta system.

# The Great Galactic War begins

In the Unknown Regions, Darth Vitiate decided to name himself the new Sith Emperor.
He formed a new Dark Council and filled it with Dark Lords of the Sith, thus creating a New Sith Empire.
This New Empire thrived for thousands of years while Emperor Vitiate kept himself alive by using the Dark Side of the Force.
During this time the Republic had recently suffered from the betrayal of Exar Kun.
Emperor Vitiate caught wind of this and decided to create a new conflict for the Republic.
This went on for about three centuries before the Great Galactic War would begin.
In his preparation, he influenced governments with puppets in the Outer Rim.
He would first challenge the Mandalorians to attack the Republic which caused the Great Sith War.
He would then begin the war by launching an attack on Korriban, liberating it in a raid from Jedi and Republic defenders.
The Sith Empire gradually established a strong foothold across the worlds through small battles, and many would defect to join the Empire.
This would make the Republic face heavy resistance from their former territories.
Their armaments would be damaged after the Sith's invasion of the Sluis sector, which was crucial to the Republic Navy.

# The downfall of the Sith

However, the Jedi and Republic would reestablish their strengths, showing their prowess in the battle of Bothawui, where the entire Republic fleet was anticipating a Sith invasion.
They would indeed face such an invasion and would defeat them numerous times, though sustaining a tremendous loss.
This would force the Sith to look elsewhere, turning to the planet of Alderaan, a key planet in the Republic.
Darth Malgus would be injured on Alderaan by Satele Shan, and they would lose their foothold on the planet.

The Republic with the Jedi would go on to capture the Sith Dread Masters, who were responsible for the disappearances of Republic fleets, and they would soon discover the Sith's capital on Dromund Kaas.
The Sith Empire would enlist the Mandalorians for help, who damaged the supply and trade routes of the Republic.
They would be defeated by a smuggler fleet led by Hylo Visz and would be forced to stay out of the war after the death of Mandalore the Lesser.
The Sith would sustain heavy losses from the pyrrhic victory on Ord Radama, where the Republic would continue their counter-offensive campaigns.

# The peace treaty and the plan

The Sith Empire was still intact and pushed for a peace treaty.
Both sides sent representatives to Alderaan to discuss the possibility of achieving peace.
During their deliberation, a Sith plan was underway, which would speed up the peace process under their terms.
Darth Malgus led an attack on the Jedi Temple on Coruscant using a transport filled with Sith.
This would reach the delegates on Alderaan, where they were forced to surrender.
The Republic would give up huge tracts of territories to the Sith, and they would be left devastated economically and in stability.

Both sides would enter into a period of a Cold War, engaging in small proxy wars that would lead up to another war with the Empire.
