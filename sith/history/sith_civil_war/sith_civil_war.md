# Prologue |
The Sith Civil War was an event sparking warfare and infighting between the Sith of Revan’s shattered Sith Empire in 3958 BBY, ending in the Galactic Republic taking control of additional Sith territory in 3950 BBY.
Following the events of the Jedi Civil War that resulted in the demise of Darth Malak, many of the Sith Lords that dedicated their loyalty to both Malak and Revan sought to take advantage of the aftermath of the Jedi Civil War and take advantage of it, they did.
The Sith Lords scavenged what remained of Revan’s Empire, taking points of interest, artifacts, technology, and whatever else they happened to come across.
Piece by piece, the Sith Empire was ripped apart, each of the remaining Sith Lords taking what they could and proclaiming themselves as warlords.
Due to this, a multitude of different spaces became occupied by these various warlords and infighting began.

# The Conflict |
As more Sith entitled themselves to be the rightful ruler of the Empire entirely, the conflict began to see its first battles on the planet Korriban; the homeworld of the Sith.
Their destructive, gruesome, and harsh battles ended in the desertion of the Dreshdae settlement that the Czerka Corporation utilized: a former allying faction of the Sith Empire that provided an abundance of technology.
The Jedi also involved themselves in the conflict as the former Lord Revan commanded Jedi forces in an invasion of the Sith homeworld.
This invasion forced many of the Sith Lords to retreat and the planet was essentially uninhabited.


	The Sith that managed to survive and expand into Sith territory continued to battle for dominant control and leadership over the Sith Empire; however, this allowed for the complete destruction of the Sith Empire and for a newer one to emerge, led by the strongest Sith Lords at the time.
Eventually, Darth Sion and Darth Nihilius came into the spotlight in 3954 BBY and claimed rule over the Sith by formulating the Sith Triumvirate.
Those that remained alive within the conflict were accepted into this newly formed Empire; though, a rather short tenure of the leading Sith Lords.
After the Sith Triumvirate met its end along with the other aspects of its legacy such as Malachor V and Trayus Academy, the Sith sparked infighting once more leading to yet another destruction of a once-powerful Sith Empire.



# Legacy |
This event was part of many reasons why Darth Bane decided to create the Rule of Two.
He realized the outcomes of the different battles amongst the Sith and decided to take initiative to prevent this yet also keep the Sith powerful and somewhat in control.
The Sith Civil War remained to be the true destruction of Darth Revan’s Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic used it to aid their efforts in purging the Sith from the galaxy completely.
By taking control of Sith spaces and other territories that the Republic had lost, this superpower became the dominant faction within the galaxy once more despite the losses and other conflicts it had faced during the Sith Civil War.
