# Introduction

The Galactic Republic Unification Wars were a series of conflicts that led to the formation of the Galactic Republic.
This war was a rather short one, forming in 25,053 BBY after the fall of the Infinite Empire led by the Rakata.
Given how ancient these times were, not much is known about the details of this war in particular, but its most notable figures were the warlord Zakrinand Minus as well as the members of the Jedi Order that fought alongside the freed victims of the Infinite Empire.
Those that dared to oppose the process of unification were swiftly defeated and eliminated.

# Conflict and Result

As a result of the revolution from the enslaved species of the Infinite Empire and a plague that wiped out the majority of the Rakata, the Rakata and their power were quickly taken off the charter of the galaxy, allowing for a newer supreme power to make itself known: The Galactic Republic.
With the fall of the Infinite Empire, it can be assumed many individuals and organizations fought each other to claim control as the dominant power of the galaxy, but it was the Jedi Order, their allies, and potentially even the Dai Bendu Monks and their unification that emerged victorious to create the Galactic Republic.
According to records, the opposing side was deemed as the forces of “evil,” but the true identity of this evil remains unknown.
Zakrinand Minus would emerge as one of these leaders during this conflict, acting as a Warlord to then live to witness the emergence and foundation of the Galactic Republic.
The history of Zakrinand was quite vague and is speculated by many historians that he was deemed invincible due to his efforts during this war.
Despite the lack of information, Zakrinand would still be referenced throughout history by many, even Mandalorians.

Unification was not just common among the Republic and the Jedi, but the galaxy as a whole.
Plenty of the Core Worlds unified as well to create the Galactic Constitution, marking the start of a brand new symbol of hope and peace among the galaxy.
Planets such as Alderaan, Coruscant, Duro, and even Corellia became allies to assist this new Republic.
The Jedi also integrated themselves nearly a hundred years later to act as the enforcers of peace for the Republic’s will.
For the efforts and contribution the Jedi made as a whole during times of war and even centuries before, the Galactic Republic used the Dai Bendu symbol as a representation of harmony.
For the next twenty-five thousand years, the Galactic Republic fought in many other conflicts and continued to provide aid to worlds all across the galaxy up until its destruction to form the Galactic Empire.
