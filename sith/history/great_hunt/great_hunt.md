# Introduction

As the Great Sith War came to a close, a series of events known as the Great Hunt occurred.
The Jedi Council enacted a proposition to rid the galaxy of all the creatures that Exar Kun had let loose upon the galaxy and its territories, ordering the Jedi to slay any form of Tarentatek, Sith Wyrm, or Silan.
Sith Wyrms were previously exogorths that were changed through Sith alchemy to be guardians.
Tarentateks were creatures native to the Sith planet Korriban which fed off the blood from force-sensitives.
Once the Jedi Council enacted this decree, many hunts for these creatures would begin, many of which being failures as the Tarentateks grew back in their numbers very quickly.
These hunts were not very effective and never truly worked.
Due to the many failures of the Jedi Order, the Council eventually abandoned these hunts and they were considered too dangerous.

However, three Jedi were sent in to finish the Hunt due to their powerful bond of the Force, the Jedi in this trio included Shaela Nuur, Duron Qel-Droma, and Gun Haan Saresh.
During their hunt, Shaela and Duron slowly fell in love, ignoring the warnings from their companion, Gun Haan, in which he eventually condemned the two for the remainder of the hunt.
Soon, the trio came to a fatal end with Shaela and Duron being ambushed by Tarentateks on Korriban, in which Duron was killed.
Shaela, overwhelmed by the grief and despair of her lover being killed, turned to the dark side in order to defeat the Tarentateks, thinking it was her only hope.
Therefore, by turning to the dark side, her lightsaber crystal was unable to be used, as it was only to be used by followers of light, which led to her death soon after.
Gun Haan, after leaving the two behind on Korriban, found himself on Kashyyyk, only to be ambushed and killed by Tarentateks as well.
The Great Hunt was not very great, and the objective that the Jedi Council had once sought to accomplish, was never completed.
Eventually, the Jedi Revan found the body of Shaela Nuur on his journey, soon killing all of the Tarentateks on Korriban and Kashyyyk, accomplishing what the trio could not.
