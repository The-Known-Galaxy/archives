# Introduction

The Mandalorian Wars were a series of conflicts and atrocities that became one of the most notable events in galactic history.
The Mandalorian Wars would contain some of the most devastating battles in Republic history while also directly serving as the foundation on which numerous other notable galactic events would take place.

# Beginnings

The Mandalorian Wars were some of the bloodiest conflicts in known history.
Numerous genocides, war crimes, planet wide conflicts and many legends were both created and finished during the course of this conflict.
Though it all began with a simple Taung warlord who we will come to know well as Mand’alor the Ultimate.

Mand’alor the Ultimate recovered the mask of his predecessor, Mand’alor the Indomitable after his death near the end of the Great Sith War and would continue the nomadic traditions of the Mandalorians.
Mand’alor the Ultimate would use this time of peace after their defeat at the hands of the Galactic Republic just two decades earlier and rebuild many of the shattered Mandalorian Clans.
At the same time, the Republic was also recovering from the Great Sith War and were in the process of rebuilding their Navy, as well as bringing the flourishing city world of Taris into the Galactic Republic.
Taris would serve as a major importer and exporter of goods and materials that would be crucial to the success of the Republic war machine.

Like many conflicts in the galaxy, the Mandalorian Wars were from the beginning a Sith plot.
Just before the Wars began a Sith pureblood would contact Mand’alor the Ultimate, claiming that he represented a great Sith Lord.
Together the Sith pureblood and Mand’alor the Ultimate would travel to the world of Rekkiad, where the Sith would inform Mand’alor the Ultimate that his master, who was the secret Sith Emperor, Darth Vitiate, had a vision of the Mandalorians conquering the Republic and becoming the most dominant force in the galaxy.
What the Mand’alor was unaware of was that he was being manipulated through the force and as a result, believed that he was capable of destroying the Republic.

After concluding his meeting with the Sith, Mand’alor the Ultimate, along with his right hand man, Field Marshal Cassus Field, began reorganising the Mandalorian clans into what would become known as the Neo-Crusader movement.
This movement was designed to be a much more unified version of the earlier Mandalorian Crusaders, designed to place warriors as the rulers of society and adopt a much more open policy of recruiting non-Taung species into the ranks of the Neo-Crusaders.

The newly minted Neo-Crusaders also established a new strategy.
Unlike their predecessors, the Mandalorian Crusaders, the Neo-Crusaders would raid worlds and actually hold them.
This would allow the Neo-Crusaders the ability to conscript warriors and utilise the resources of dozens of planets to get their forces ready for the coming war, and by the time the Mandalorians invaded the Republic, they were indeed ready.

# Conflict

The beginning of the Mandalorian Wars is often debated.
From the point of view of the Republic, the war did not start until the Neo-Crusaders would invade Republic territory.
However, from the point of view of the Neo-Crusaders, they had been raiding and conquering numerous worlds on the edge of Republic space and independent worlds and colonies within the Outer Rim for years.
The Republic itself would not actually take part in the conflicts for over a decade from when they began.

The Mandalorians began the conflict by conquering the independent world of Althir III, in an invasion that lasted a total of 5 days, and to the credit of the Althiri, had a major stalemate.
The Neo-Crusaders took the planet utilizing their famous Basilisk War Droids, conducting orbital shock trooper attacks, the planet was taken and served as a major producer of war materials for the Neo-Crusaders.

It wouldn’t be until three years later that the Neo-Crusaders would carry out their second major invasion of a territory, on the planet of Cathar.
The Cathar species were not very war-like and the invasion commanded by Field Marshal Cassus Fett would quickly turn into a genocidal massacre.
The Cathar put up little resistance and in a swift strike the planet fell to the Neo-Crusaders.
Cassus Fett believed the planet’s inhabitants were weak and ordered that they be massacred, utilizing orbital bombardments, basilisk war droids and death squads, the Neo-Crusaders decimated over 90% of the Cathar population and literally drove them into the sea.
The Republic was well aware of the events that took place, Cassus Fett made no effort to hide them, but out of fear of public unrest and a lack of desire to commit to war, the Republic hid the genocide from the media.

The genocide of Cathar did inspire the Republic Navy to blockade the trade world of Taris and the mostly Mandalorian inhabited moon of Dxun.
Taris was crucial to the Republic war machine and economy, and Dxun was crucial as it was nearby a main Republic supply route but was also inhabited by dozens of Mandalorian Clans that the Republic did not wish to see rally to Mand’alor the Ultimate’s cause.

After the Republic Navy established their blockades, Mand’alor the Ultimate began probing the Republic’s defence fleet by launching small strikes and provoking minor skirmishes.
This caused some confusion amongst the ranks of the Neo-Crusaders who were used to large campaigns and major invasions, one particular Mandalorian, Commander Rohlan Dhyre would attempt to desert the Neo-Crusaders as a result of this, only to be forced back to the front lines.
He would attempt to desert the Neo-Crusaders multiple times, but was never truly successful.

# The Revanchists

While the Neo-Crusaders were launching their various campaigns, capturing independent worlds and probing the Republic.
A young Jedi Knight and his close friend and ally Alek were scouring the Jedi Order for Jedi who sought to retake the worlds lost to the Neo-Crusaders.
His words were controversial and challenged the direct authority of the Jedi High Council, who at the time were seriously concerned about potential dark side influences within the Neo-Crusaders.
Revan, being a man of action, did not wish to allocate any more time to meditation or discussion on the topic and against the wishes of the Jedi Council, took his followers of Jedi Padawans, Knights and even Masters and rallied to the aid of the Republic military.

The Revanchists amalgamated well into the ranks of the Republic military, adopting General and Commander positions, they would re-evaluate the strategies and tactics of the Republic Military and provide a serious advantage for when the Neo-Crusaders set their sights on Republic territory.

# Padawan Massacre

A small event took place that would indirectly cause the first defeat of the Republic and result in many of the early Revanchists, including Alek, being captured by the Neo-Crusaders.
During their travels, the Revanchists sought other Jedi to join them from the various sub-councils and enclaves across the galaxy.
The Jedi Masters and their Padawans that occupied the Jedi Tower on Taris denied Revan their aid in the war but still stood as the only Jedi defence of the world should the Neo-Crusaders attack.
This changed when the Jedi Masters, who were part of a secret sub-sect of the Jedi Order that believed in the eradication of the dark side by any means necessary, decided after having a vision to slaughter their Padawans, who they believed would fall to the dark side and become a threat to the Republic.

After news of this spread and the Masters, who tried to blame the act on a surviving Padawan were caught, they were summoned back to Coruscant to face judgement.
The only problem with this is that it left Taris without any Jedi defence, something the Neo-Crusaders took immediate advantage of.

# Invasion of the Republic

The Republic Navy’s blockade of Taris and numerous surrounding planets, known as the Jebble-Vanquo-Tarnith line was assaulted numerous times by the Neo-Crusaders but was never breached.
The defences were so massive, containing a variety of large Republic fleets that the Neo-Crusaders were stuck in a stalemate.
Numerous skirmishes and assaults were carried out but were ultimately fended off by Republic forces.
During this stalemate the Padawan Massacre had taken place, and Revan had left behind many Revanchist Jedi on the planet of Suurja, a neighbouring planet of Taris.
When news of the Padawan Massacre had spread to Mand’alor the Ultimate he took the news as a strategic opportunity and prepared his forces for a campaign with the objective of taking Taris.

Mand’alor the Ultimate also sent Commander Rohlan Dyre to Suurja to ambush and capture the Revanchists that were left there, successfully capturing Alek and numerous other Jedi.
These Jedi would be taken to a captured space station known as Flashpoint, which had been repurposed by the Mandalorian scientist known as Demagol to conduct experiments on Jedi and force-sensitives, another war crime conducted by the Mandalorians.

This capture of Alek and his fellow Jedi would mark a small but still the first victory against Republic forces and allowed the Neo-Crusaders to learn more about Jedi capabilities from the experiments conducted.

Mand’alor the Ultimate rallied the Neo-Crusader fleet and ordered the invasion of the planet Vanquo, this would be the first large-scale engagement between the Neo-Crusader and Republic forces.
The Neo-Crusaders would be victorious, sieging the planet and forcing the Republic Navy to withdraw and reform their defensive line around Taris.
Numerous Republic Navy Admirals would be seriously wounded or die and the defensive line around Taris had to be made up of heavily damaged ships that would be no match for a full scale invasion.
Many Mandalorians and the Republic saw this invasion as the true beginning of the Mandalorian Wars.

# Seige of Taris

The Mandalorians laid siege to Taris and forced a complete withdrawal of the Republic Navy.
Utilizing their infamous orbital bombardment tactics, the Neo-Crusader fleet would bomb critical military and civilian installations on the world prior to launching their ground invasion.
The Mandalorians did not expect much resistance but were shocked to see local resistance forces rallied from civilians and Taris police units, as well as resistance from the underground swoop gangs who had united to battle the foreign invaders.
Ultimately however these groups were no true match for the Neo-Crusaders, and other than a few attacks the Neo-Crusaders had conquered the world with relative ease.

During the siege of Taris, Revan, now known simply as the Revanchist, was being labelled a hero of the Republic and had rallied a serious number of Jedi from various enclaves as well as independent military forces from worlds that were at risk of Neo-Crusader invasion.
Revan would be contacted by a fellow Jedi and follower known as Ferroh, who was notably of the Cathar species and was concerned about the lack of Cathar on his homeworld as well as the lack of contact between him and his species.
Revan, also concerned by this, travelled with Ferroh and his Jedi followers to the Cathar homeworld and found evidence of the genocide carried out by Cassus Fett and the Neo-Crusaders.

The Jedi Council, aware of Revan’s intent to investigate the world, travelled to meet Revan and demand that Revan and the Revanchists stand down before they truly got involved in the war.
During these demands Revan would find the mask of a Mandalorian woman who had died protesting the genocide, executed by her fellow Neo-Crusaders.
Revan and the Jedi on the planet had a collective force vision of the genocide and felt the losses suffered on the planet.
Upon finishing the vision, Revan declared himself as the Revanchist and swore to defeat the Mandalorian threat, this inspired even more Jedi to join the cause and ultimately sealed the fate of the Jedi who would take part in the war, the Revanchists were finally going to join the fight.

# The Onslaught

After taking Taris and its surrounding worlds, the Neo-Crusaders launched a new campaign through a variety of trade and travel routes that would provide them a direct line of attack against crucial Republic systems.
This invasion was so devastating for the Republic that it became known as the ‘’Onslaught’’.

During the Onslaught the Mandalorians took an entire system of space known as the Zongorlu system, as well as the planet of Ord Mantell and Wayland.
The Mandalorians also attempted an invasion of Ithor but were ultimately repelled by a unified force of Zabrak and Republic forces.
As a result of the Zabrak resistance, the Mandalorians decided to invade their home of Iridonia and successfully captured it.
Iridonia would serve as a recruitment ground due to the hardiness of their warriors.
Iridonia would later be freed by Republic forces and Zabrak resistance fighters but a large presence of Mandalorians and their culture would remain.
Even while the planet was technically back under Republic control, it still served as a large provider of warriors for the Neo-Crusaders.

The Neo-Crusaders would finally launch a successful invasion towards the corewards and would capture the ice planet of Jebble with relative ease.
This planet would serve as an excellent staging ground for a larger invasion, the invasion of Alderaan.
The Republic Senate in response to the Onslaught had recalled almost all of the Republic fleet from territories the Republic was responsible for policing and protecting in an effort to match the strength of the Neo-Crusader fleet.
While this was being done, the Neo-Crusaders successfully captured Onderon and Dxun.
This was a true testament to the strength and speed of the Neo-Crusader fleets, and Dxun was a particularly large blow to the Republic.
Dozens of Mandalorian Clans that inhabited Dxun jumped at the chance to join the Neo-Crusaders and boltered the strength of the Neo-Crusader armies by a sizable margin.
Onderon and Dxun would remain under Neo-Crusader control for almost the entirety of the war.

The invasion of Alderaan would be thwarted by the efforts of Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick and Jedi Shadow Celeste Morne.
The two would recover a Sith artifact from Neo-Crusader hands that they would accidentally use to infect the Neo-Crusader army on Jebble with the Rakghoul plague.
This accidental infection prevented the invasion of Alderaan.

# Serroco

While the Neo-Crusaders were rallying on Jebble, Mand’alor the Ultimate saw a need to continue their aggressive invasion strategy in an effort to leave the Republic with little time to rally.
Mand’alor the Ultimate set his sights on Serroco which happened to be the staging ground for one of the largest elements of the Republic fleet.
Mand’alor the Ultimate, with an oddly twisted sense of honour, saw the defense of the planet as dishonourable, he believed the Republic thought the Neo-Crusaders were not willing to attack the civilian population on the planet, he sought to prove them wrong.

Mand’alor the Ultimate dropped his fleet out of hyperspace above Serroco and launched nuclear missiles towards the planet’s civilian populated areas.
The Republic Navy believed the missiles were meant for them and raised their shields in defiance but were surprised to see the missiles hit the planet’s surface instead.
Billions of civilians died in a matter of minutes, causing so much death that Revan and his Jedi followers felt the devastation through the force.

The Naval fleet defending Serroco was forced to withdraw, having too many refugees on board their battleships and being unable to defend the planet as many of their ships were stationed on the planet’s surface, unprepared for how swift the Neo-Crusaders would attack, many of their ships on Serreco were destroyed.

# Mandalorian Triumph

The following campaign after Serroco would see a massive amount of territory come under Mandalorian control.
A group of defiant Jedi Knights who believed in the Neo-Crusader movement had defected to the Neo-Crusaders and proposed a plan to Mand’alor the Ultimate to kidnap Jedi Younglings from the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine to be used as Mandalorian Knights in future invasions, the plan was given a go ahead and with the Mandalorian Knights at the helm, Mand’alor the Ultimate’s fleets took numerous systems from the Republic and conquered dozens of worlds.

The Mandalorian Knights with the aid of Neo-Crusaders had attempted to capture Dantooine, though due to the efforts of a survivor of the Padawan Massacre, Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick.
The Mandalorian Knights would be unsuccessful and many of the Mandalorian Knights including their leader, Jedi Master Dorjander Kace, would be captured and face trial on Dantooine.
Mand’alor the Ultimate would abandon his northern offensive and effort to take the planet of Dantooine.

Despite a failed kidnapping attempt, the ultimate removal of the Mandalorian Knights from the war and the abandonment of the northern offensive, the Neo-Crusaders were still extremely victorious during this period of the war.
During this period the Neo-Crusaders would launch roughly 18 separate offensives and ultimately reach Duro.
The Neo-Crusaders would successful in destroying a large amount of shipyards surrounding the planet and also made an effort to steal many of the materials and plans used in building Republic ships, but were ultimately stopped when Revan arrived with his new fleet of prototype Republic interdictor-class battleships and stopped the Neo-Crusader invasion.

As a result of his efforts and with pressure from the Republic Military, Revan was made Supreme Commander of the Republic Military and was made responsible for the Republic war effort.
The Jedi Council were forced to agree with this decision as a result of an idea Revan concocted.
Revan had re-made the ‘’Mercy Corps’’, who were a large group of Jedi that attached themselves to the Republic Military during the Great Sith War to provide medical and support assistance during the war effort.
The Revanchists were now given military positions with Revan himself at the helm of the Republic Military.

The Mandalorian Triumph resulted in the destruction of many shipyards crucial to the Republic war effort, as well the destruction of many of the Tibanna mining operations on Bespin.
The Battle of Eres III was another battle of the Mandalorian triumph that would become another infamous controversy as a result of the destruction caused on the planet, which would cause fires so fierce from bombing attacks that even a decade after the end of the war, the fires were still rampant on the planet’s surface.

# The Republic Counter-attack

The Republic Military, now with Revan as Supreme Commander and the officially sanctioned aid of the Revanchists Jedi decided that the Neo-Crusaders had gone on the offensive long enough.
Revan planned a huge offensive against the Neo-Crusader forces that resulted for the first time since the war began, a huge spark of Republic victories.
The Republic even managed to retake the world of Taris.
Unfortunately for the Republic, Revan and Alak, now known as Malak, had begun discovering the ancient Rakatan Star Maps across a variety of the worlds they had invaded.

Revan and Malak eventually discovered the world of Malachor V and found the ancient Sith Academy known as Traya’s Academy.
There they discovered many Sith teachings and had fallen to the overwhelming allure of the darkside.
Still identifying as Jedi, Revan and Malak continued their offensive but had become much more tolerable of casualties and sacrifice.

Many Republic invasions were successful but came at a high cost, hundreds of ships and thousands of troops were being sacrificed to gain as much territory as possible.
This most notably occurred on the moon of Dxun during the invasion of Onderon.
General Meetra Surik, one of Revan’s closest followers, was responsible for taking Dxun from Neo-Crusader control.
Unfortunately for the Republic the world was a dense jungle and Mandalorians had inhabited the moon for decades prior to the Mandalorian Wars, they were well prepared for invasion.

Despite this, Revan ordered the invasion and General Surik obeyed, sacrificing many of her soldiers in an effort to take deeply entrenched anti-air gun emplacements and Neo-Crusader strongholds.
It is said that ten Republic soldiers were lost for every Neo-Crusader killed, the invasion was a true blood bath.
But ultimately successful, Dxun had fallen back under Republic control, the Neo-Crusaders lost a crucial staging ground and Onderon was retaken.

These victories cemented Revan’s fall to the dark side, he became increasingly aggressive in his tactics and the Neo-Crusaders even started to fear what tactics he might employ.
Neo-Crusader warrior Canderous Ordo attested these tactics and Revan as being the sole reason the Republic would eventually win the war.

# Final Confrontation

Revan created a strategy that would force the Neo-Crusader fleet into a battle on the world of Malachor V.
During the war, Republic scientists had crafted a weapon known as the Mass Shadow Generator.
The weapon was essentially a mini-black hole machine, it would envelop and destroy almost everything surrounding its detonation and could be deployed with relative ease.
Revan intended on using the Mass Shadow Generator on Malachor V, hopefully putting an end to the war.

Revan rallied the largest elements of the Republic Fleet for this final battle and engaged the Neo-Crusaders on Malachor V.
An epic battle ensued and Revan would board Mand’alor the Ultimate’s flagship to confront him directly.
Revan would kill Mand’alor the Ultimate during the battle and during his final moments, Mand’alor the Ultimate confessed to Revan that the Mandalorian Wars were a Sith plot all along, and that an ancient Sith Lord existed in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy on the planet Rekkiad, the same planet Mand’alor the Ultimate and the mysterious Sith emissary had visited before the Mandalorian Wars.
Revan would take the Mand’alor’s helmet to prevent anymore Mandalorians from taking the mantle of Mand’alor, putting an end to the potential of another united Mandalorian rising.

Revan would then order General Meetra Surik to detonate the Mass Shadow Generator, despite thousands of Republic ships and soldiers still being in its range.
Despite this, the Mass Shadow Generator was detonated by Republic commander and engineer Bao-Dur.
killing an unspeakable number of Republic soldiers and Neo-Crusaders alike.

The blast was so harmful that Meetra Surik was forced to sever her own connection to the force to survive the blast, and the once forest covered world of Malachor V would be reduced to a dead world of darkness.
Shortly after, the remaining Neo-Crusaders would contact the Republic Senate and announce an unconditional surrender, ending the 16 years conflict once and for all.

# Aftermath and Legacy

In the aftermath of the war the Republic would set about regaining many of the worlds lost to the Neo-Crusaders and dozens of worlds that initially were not part of the Republic would admit themselves to the Republic Senate.
The war was seen as a strategic success but almost collapsed the Republic’s economy and military.

Revan and Malak would act on the information of a secret Sith Lord and disappear into the Unknown Regions for years, taking many followers with them.
General Meetra Surik, now a hero of the Republic, would be the only Jedi to return to the Jedi Council to face judgement for her actions in the war.
The Jedi Council exiled her and took her lightsaber, she would later become known as the Jedi ‘’Exile’’.

The Mandalorian Clans would scatter, removing their title as Neo-Crusaders; they would return to their nomadic and tribal ways for many years.
The Mandalorian Wars would cement the Mandalorians forever as the most fearsome warriors in the galaxy.
Multiple millennia later the Mandalorian Wars would still be discussed and the world of Mandalore would be decorated in murals of Mandalorians fighting and defeating the Jedi, even under pacifist rule.

The Mandalorians would begin fighting amongst themselves to try and rebuild the title of Mand’alor, but ultimately they were largely reunified under Canderous Ordo, veteran of the Mandalorian Wars in search of the mask.
They would ultimately be successful and Canderous Ordo would become Mand’alor.
The war was so fierce it essentially caused the extinction of the Taung species who would die out entirely not long after the Mandalorian Wars.

The Mandalorians were wounded by their defeat, but contrary to what most people expected, many Mandalorians were honoured to have fought against the Republic and the Jedi, and were honoured that they had lost to such a capable foe.

As a result of the Mass Shadow Generator, a wound in the force would be created.
This wound would later become the infamous Darth Nihilus.
Many Jedi, including Jedi Master Kreia would be blamed for Revan’s actions in the war and while they were not exiled, they were practically forced out of the Jedi Order and would find themselves on Malachor V, where Darth Nihilus, Darth Sion, Darth Traya and many Dark Jedi would would work on creating a new Sith Order, known as the Sith Triumvirate.
