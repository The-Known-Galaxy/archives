# Introduction

The Battle of Thule was a vital mission for the jedi knights due to the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus also known as Count Dooku, was planning to use a new engineered weapon known as the Dark Reaper as a source to steal the force essence from the planet moon known as Thule.
This mission was vital for the Sith and would have been a powerful boost to Darth Tyranus’ quest to lead a powerful army and bring back the Sith Rule under Darth Sidious guidance.
Unfortunately, the Jedi would interfere with its success resulting in force energy being taken from the Sith yet again.

The Battle started on the Moon of Thule but the Separatists-controlled by the Sith were making a shield to keep the grand army of the republic from interfering with the plans to steal the force essence from the moon.
Though Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, found a way to bypass through the shield and enter the battle unscathed.
Soon after and with many annoyances, the Republic had also broken through the gates and disabled the shields, allowing all of the grand army to enter Thule.
Which ultimately led to an attempt to stop the Separatists from taking the force essence of the moon.
Mace Windu, the master of the Jedi order and second in command of the Jedi was now fighting in the battle.
Though it was only afterMaster Windu was breaking through our defenses that Darth Tryanus’ hired a mercenary named Cydon Prax stopped Windu’s progress by destroying his AT-XT walkers.
Leaving Windu on the ground and running to a cave due to the Empire’s army having explosive rounds, something a Jedi can not deflect as easily as a normal blaster bolt.
This led to Anakin Skywalker finishing their mission and ultimately being immune to the Dark Reapers power and being able to go in the core of the weapon and destroy it entirely, resulting in the Battle of Thule ultimately ending in the Jedi's favor.
