# Overview |
The Crusade of Krath was a religious conflict that was told about in Qel-Droma Epics.
This conflict took place a millennium after the Great Hyperspace War.
These stories tell that the Crusade was led by the Krath, a dark side cult, going against the Jedi Order.
The crusade was led from the Krath command center in the Iron Citadel, as a continuation of a military coup conducted by corrupt noble descendants inside of the Empress Teta system.

# History |
During some point of the Crusade, the Krath slaughtered thousands of Jedi, including the Master of Ulic Qel-Droma.
Following the death of his Master, Ulic volunteered to help infiltrate the Krath, but he was then manipulated by the Dark Side taking over the cult alongside fallen Jedi Exar Kun.
Together, they formed a new Sith Empire, using Empress Teta as the capital.
Ulic eventually redeemed himself after being cut off from the Force.
The inhabitants of Empress Teta then displayed the events in the Qel-Droma Epics.
