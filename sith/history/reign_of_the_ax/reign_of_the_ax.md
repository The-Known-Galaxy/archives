# Overview

Within the Nakgru Holocron, Ajunta Pall learned the history of the Sith Purebloods in vivid detail not found through oral histories or brittle scrolls.
He learned these warlike people are living proof that the smug Jedi who banished them are wrong about the Dark Side.

# Details

The Sith kill, rage and hate, yet their society does not fragment.
It thrives.
More than three millennia before the Republic’s founding, a prodigious Sith arose.
His name was Adas.
He bore a glossy ebon hide and carried a pair of battle aces, one in each hand.
Most others required two hands to swing just one ax.
When Adas roared, other Sith rushed to his side or fled in terror.
He enslaved the foolish and executed the idealists.
When warriors challenged him, he drank their bloodsoup to honor their deaths.
He took control, uniting the squabbling Sith and became their ruler, King Adas.
The Reign of the Ax lasted three centuries, while Adas sustained his life energy with the Dark Side.
He was worshiped as the Sith’ari, or god of the Sith.
Only when the great Rakatan conquerors arrived did his life end.
Yet even in his death, he achieved a final Victory for the Sith by driving off the Rakatan.
The technology the Rakatan brought allowed the Sith to expand their influence and claim the planets that make up the dark fist of Sith Space.
From that time, Ada’s example has been followed.
It is a simple principle: a strong ruler gives power to the Empire.
