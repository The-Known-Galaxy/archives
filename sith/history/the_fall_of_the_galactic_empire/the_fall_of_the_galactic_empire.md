# Section 1
The Battle of Endor marked the initiation of the collapse of the Galactic Empire’s collapse.
Emperor Palpatine had planned a trap to eliminate the rebels and end the Galactic Civil War at Endor.
However, the Rebel Alliance proved to be the stronger, or at least luckier, force.
The Battle of Endor led to the rebels destroying the second version of the Death Star with help from Luke Skywalker and events within the Death Star itself.
This event also resulted in  Palpatine’s death.

# Section 2
With  Palpatine’s death,  the Empire began a small spiral of chaos,  later escalating to complete collapse and defeat.
 Emperor Plapatine's death led many to continuously revolt against the Empire.
The Imperial forces rushed to restore and maintain or keep authority in the galaxy,  aiming to control resources.
Remnants of the Empire faced difficulties retaining control over planets,  resulting in the loss of territories and entire systems over time.



# Section 3
Emperor Palpatine had formulated a contingency plan for his death.
Unbeknownst to the Empire, this plan called for the full destruction of the Empire via orbital bombardment.
This plan was devised and implemented because Palpatine believed the Empire couldn’t thrive after his death.
Emperor Palpatine also considered the destruction of the Empire vitally important to pave the way for a new order to rise in its place of the Empire.



# Section 4
The Battle of Jakku marked the final official battle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance.
Despite the Empire being in complete disarray, their forces rallied to challenge the Rebel Alliance.
If the Empire were to beat the Rebel Fleet and Army at Jakku, they might stand a chance to execute the Emperor’s contingency plan.
However, the Rebel Alliance proved to be the better force at Jakku that day.
The defeat of Imperial forces at Jakku signaled the end of the official Imperial faction.
However, the Empire's small forces and holdout factions persisted, attempting to prosper and even attack and raid rebel forces.
