# Introduction |

The Ritual of Nathema is the name of an event that took place in 4,999 BBY.
The Sith Lord Vitiate performed a ritual that stripped the Force’s presence entirely off the planet Nathema.
The Sith and its scholars viewed this event as one of the greatest achievements within the Sith Empire; however, the ritual was a result of Vitiate mentally enslaving more than eight thousand Sith Lords, forcing them to partake in the magic that killed every living thing on Nathema and therefore rendering Vitiate as immortal.

# Context  |

In 5,000 BBY, the Sith Empire was destroyed by the Galactic Republic because of its defeat in the Great Hyperspace Wars.
This caused the remaining Sith to fear that the Republic and Jedi Order will not rest until every Sith was wiped out, as they discovered that Supreme Chancellor Pultino was orchestrating a purge against what remained of the Sith and their Empire.
Lord Vitiate took advantage of his follower’s increasing fear and proceeded to broadcast to the Empire that the Jedi will not stop until all Sith are eradicated and then followed up with an offer of hope.
Vitiate arrived at Korriban and summoned all remaining Sith Lords to the planet Nathema, luring them by stating that he had a plan to conjure a magic ritual that would exterminate the entirety of the Jedi Order.

# The Ritual |

On 4,999 BBY, Vitiate announced the beginning of his ritual and more than eight thousand Sith Lords answered his call, alongside surviving members of the Sith Council–past equivalent to the Dark Council– joining the event.
When arriving at Nathema, each Sith Lord that arrived at Vitiate's palace had their minds controlled and their will bound to Vitiate; therefore giving him their strength.
Once all Lords were under his control, Vitiate enacted a ritual that lasted for 10 days.

To fulfill the goal of his ritual, Vitiate used the Zildrog central computer; a superweapon that originated from the Iokath sphere, that allows the transfer of life energies.
He used this machine to strengthen himself at the cost of consuming the life force of everything present within Nathema.
This action later bestowed immortality to Vitiate, which gave him grand strength with the Force while exterminating a planet’s entire population.

# Aftermath |

After the ritual was over, Nathema was left without the presence of the Force, and its physical environment was completely altered.
Its colors were removed, having Gray as the only present color.
Its bright orange sun lost the majority of its light and became a dull brown star when in Nathema.
As life faded away from the planet, Vitiate took on the immortal identity of the Sith Emperor and proceeded to blame Nathema’s demise on the Jedi.
Afterward, he gathered his followers and embarked on a two-decade-long journey that led to the “discovery” of Dromund Kaas and the Empire’s reconstruction.
After settling down in Kaas, Emperor Vitiate purged all data regarding the planet Nathema, so that nobody gets the opportunity to discover the truth about its fate.

By the time the Great Galactic War was ongoing, the Ritual of Nathema was considered a great achievement according to historians and was often celebrated by the Sith, completely ignorant of the truth behind it all.
Unbeknownst to the Sith Order and the Dark Council, the Emperor continued to use Nathema for his experiments and maintained a sanitarium within it.
In there, he secretly built the Eternal Empire of Zakuul and housed powerful force-users that opposed him so they could be experimented upon and have the Force drained from them.
The sanitarium is also guarded by Nathema Zealots; a group of powerful Force-Sensitives that could withstand the horrors done within Nathema.
