# Introduction
The Candorian Plague was a contagious disease that formed after the outbreak of the Blue Shadow Virus.
The plague was well known because of  the constant epidemics it triggered.

# Section I
During the Draggulch Period, the plague had diminished multiple colonies within The Slice.
A few years passed and then came the rise of the Republic Dark Age and the Old Republic was at the brink of death.
Because of this, a strain of the Candorian Plague spread across the galaxy.
This newfound strain wiped out two-thirds of the major cities across the galaxy.
However, it seemed to hit the strongest in the Grumani sector, which later led to the demise of Sanrafsix and Alphoresis.
Around 1060 BBY, Mandalore was the next victim of the plague and it was later found in ruins.



# Section II
In 46 BBY, Candoria fell, which eventually led to the extinction of the disease.
During the Clone Wars, a Separatist scientist, Nuvo Vindi, discovered a sample of the disease and used it to try and make a bioweapon.
Which was later used by the Galactic Empire against rebellious planets such as Dentaal.
The Galactic Empire attacked Dentaal in 0 ABY, after they expelled Governor Taliff and declaring independence from the Empire.
Over the span of two months the whole planet had been wiped out and the Empire later claimed that the plague was a Rebel plot to use against the Empire.
