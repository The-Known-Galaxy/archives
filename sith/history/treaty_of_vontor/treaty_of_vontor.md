# Introduction

Treaty of Vontor was established in 25,100 BBY, with the goal of uniting three species of the Si’Klaata Cluster under Hutt rule, following their victory against Xim the Despot at the Third Battle of Vontor during the Xim Wars.

# Description

Treaty of Vontor was established at the conferences of the representatives of the Hutts, along with three representatives of three races, Barada M’Beg from the Klatooinians, D’we’mouk from the Nikto, and Kl’ientu Mutela from the Vodrans, at the Si’Klaata Cluster.
Those three races, along with the Weequay soldiers, formed the foundation of the armies that Kossak the Hutt had recruited to defeat Xim the Despot.
After the inevitable victory from the Hutts and the respective races, the Hutts decided to put those three races in a permanent servitude towards the Hutts.

This treaty was finally abolished after 25 millennia of permanent servitude toward the Hutts, when it was declared by the Klatooinians after their Fountain of Ancients that was on Klatooine was pillaged by the Sith of the Lost Tribe.
