# Introduction
The Great Schisms were a series of major occurrences that resulted in conflict and war between the Dark Jedi and the orthodox Jedi.
There were a total of four Great Schisms in history, the earliest dating back to 24,500 BBY leading all the way up to the fourth and final Great Schism in 2000 BBY.
These events in history allowed both the Jedi and Sith to witness advancement in all aspects but at times, also at the cost of their own structure and culture.

# First Great Schism
The First Great Schism was the first set of events that divided the Jedi Order, creating groups of Jedi that didn’t wish to adhere to the Jedi’s hierarchy or rule sets.
After the creation of the Je’daii Order, all of its members and inhabitants of Tython lived in peace and harmony.
Roughly ten thousand years later in 24,500 BBY, two Jedi known as Xendor and Arden-Lyn grew disfavor for the strange functionality of the Order.
Xendor chose to voice his opinions and statements before the leadership of the Jedi.
He proposed to create a newer Academy off-world and integrate a variety of different practices of the Force such as Dai Bendu's philosophy and even the Way of the Dark.
Naturally, Xendor’s proposal was shut down, but it didn’t stop him from making his way out of the Order to establish this newer academy himself.

Both Arden-Lyn and Xendor made their way to the planet Lettow where they would create their own Academy.
These Jedi were not alone in their beliefs, as it didn’t take long for other members of the Jedi to leave Ossus and pledge their loyalty to Xendor and his cause for a newer Order.
A new order of force-sensitive beings was established with the increasing influence of various beliefs across the galaxy known as the Legions of Lettow.


This legion preferred to be left out of the antics of the Jedi to delve deeper into their own practices and beliefs; however, the Jedi did not allow this to continue, and as tension arose, both the Jedi and Legions of Lettow created the first conflicts between the primary philosophies of the Force.
