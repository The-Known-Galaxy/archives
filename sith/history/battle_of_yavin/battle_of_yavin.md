# Pre Battle
For years, the Galactic Empire had been spreading its reign across the galaxy and putting fear in every soul they cross.
During the Battle of Scarif, Jyn Erso Successfully stole the Death Star plans in hopes to stop the empire from unleashing their superweapon.
These plans successfully made their way to Princess Leia, one of the most legendary resistance members.
This victory would be sort of short-lived as she would be captured by Vader with her crew on the Tantive IV.
After sending droid R2-D2 off with the plans, she was held in captivity with Vader and his Stormtrooper crew, which was put to an end after Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan, and Chewbacca, who had received leia's distress signals asking for help.
After successfully fleeing with Leia, the crew went to the rebel base on Yavin 4, where they devised a plan to blow up the Death Star.

# Devising a Plan
Because the Death Star's security was meant to detect large-scale fleets, they would get past the security systems unnoticed.
After passing through the shields they would attack the exhaust port on the Death Star, which had a small weak point that could destroy the Death Star.
This weakness was put there deliberately by Galen Erso, an Imperial scientist who wanted to end the Empire’s reign of terror.



# The Battle
When the plan was set up, they sent out multiple X-Wing fighters, including the Red squadron, the Green squadron, and the Gold squadron.
While the rebels were still making it, there were many being killed, with the first to go out being the Red four.
Some time into the battle an empirical officer detected the ongoing fight and tried to get Moff Tarkin to send backup.
Tarkin rejected her request and Vader ended up sending his fleet to stop the rebels.
After this, things took a dark turn.


Vader's fleet wiped out a multitude of Rebel ships.
Luke knew if he took longer he would be in trouble so he started going down the trench full throttle.
The Rebels at the base were worried and freaked out when they saw Luke had turned off his targeting system.
Luke assured them it would be fine and he could use the Force to win as his master Kenobi taught him.
Vader found hitting Luke a struggle, with his only shot being on R2, temporarily destroying the Astromech droid.
Suddenly when Vader had a clear lock on Luke, he was shot from above.
Han and Chewbacca, who everyone thought left, actually stayed to help Luke in his most dire moment.
Vader and one of his Tie pilots spiraled out of control and Vader ended up flying away from the Death Star.
This gave Luke the perfect chance to blow up the death star and he took it.
The Death Star was successfully destroyed.



# Aftermath
After the successful blow of the death star, Han, Luke, And other surviving rebels were brought to Yavin, where a ceremony was held to celebrate the great rebel victory, and where they were given medals to show their great bravery and victory.
Unfortunately, not long after this, the Rebels were again forced out of the planet to flee the Empire.
Regardless of this, the explosion of the Death Star led a new ray of hope into the Rebels and their chance of destroying the Empire.
