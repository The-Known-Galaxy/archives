# Introduction
The Great Hyperspace War was a series of conflicts, battles, and wars between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic that took place in 5000 BBY.
Billions upon billions of deaths, injuries, and casualties would be witnessed across the galaxy as a result of this brutal conflict leading to the downfall of the Sith Empire.
It was also around this time that the Dark Lord of the Sith Naga Sadow exiled himself to the gas giant known as Yavin IV.
A necessary conflict to allow for the rise of many notable Sith Lords such as Darth Vitiate to come into power in order to reestablish a better and reformed Sith Empire.

# Prologue
Upon suffering loss from their previous conflicts with the Galactic Republic known as the Great Schisms, the exiled Dark Jedi fled to the world of Korriban where they would enslave the native Sith species to do their bidding.
With the usage of biotechnology alongside Sith Alchemy, the native species of Korriban was able to interbreed with the exiles, formulating a powerful sect of Dark Side users and leading to the creation of a Sith Empire trained in the Dark Side with the assistance of thriving technology and philosophy.
As the years went on, the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic continued their operations, both factions unaware that the other even existed.
The existence of the Sith Empire remained a secret until two Republic explorers found themselves in the Sith-infested world of Korriban.
Gav and Jori Daragon, the siblings that discovered this planet for themselves, had been in great debt for their antics in the past.
As a way to make up for it, they were assigned to discover new and quicker hyperspace travel routes.
Putting their trust in The Force, they had set random coordinates for hyperspace, hoping to find something to get them out of their dilemma.
Their arrival was not a welcome one at all, seeing as they were just witnessing one of the greatest ascensions in history, the death of Marka Ragnos, and the challenges to succeed him amid battle known as Ludo Kressh and Naga Sadow.
It wasn’t long until the siblings were captured and taken to the remote world of Ziost for interrogation.
Believing the prisoners were Republic spies, Kressh and his powerbase proposed they be sentenced to death.
Though Naga Sadow disagreed, instead he deduced that it may be possible to act as an ally to the siblings, grooming them as a resource for his use, and to deceive the Sith Lords that chose to sentence them to death.
With the assistance of his Massassi warriors enhanced by alchemy, Sadow formed an escape plan for the siblings, claiming that they had been rescued by Republic agents in hopes that the Sith Lords would be given reason to engage in conflict with the Republic.
However, that was a ploy of Naga Sadow so that he may take the explorers to his personal fortress located on the moon Khar Shian where he would delude them into thinking he was their ally.
To do this, he taught Gav the ways of Dark sorcery, devising different reasons to keep Gav’s sister in the fortress.

Eventually, Kressh figured out the intentions of Naga Sadow and gathered his followers to rally on Sadow’s fortress to put a stop to his foolery.
This is exactly what Naga Sadow wished for, a chance to defeat his rival for the Dark Lord of the Sith by wiping out Kressh and his followers at once.
Sadow gave the directory for Jori to flee from the fortress to warn the Republic of a soon-to-come invasion.
With Jori out the way, the Sith Lord let off a force that was swift to defeat his competition.
With the death of his rival, Naga Sadow claimed the title of the Dark Lord of the Sith, succeeding Marka Ragnos.
As for Gav, he would serve as the Apprentice to the Dark Lord, acting as the commander of all of the Sith Lord’s fleets.
Making use of the homing beacon he had placed on the sibling’s ship, he began to rally his forces to begin the invasion of the Galactic Republic.
Jori on the other hand made her way to the Koros system, where she would warn its Empress known as Teta of the coming Sith invasions.
Empress Teta wasn’t so certain at first, but with the advice given to her by her Jedi Councilor Memit Nadill and his other fellow Jedi Masters, she decided to deliver warnings to Coruscant about the Sith invasion.



# Sith Invasion
The Dark Lord established his base over the red supergiant at Primus Goluud, his eye meditation sphere being located right around the star.
From there, he would deploy his fleets to conduct invasion upon multiple Republic spaces.
Naga Sadow relied on quick and short victories, as well as surprise attacks on smaller Republic forces as he was well aware he could not take on the Republic Navy head-on.
Opposed to deploying himself on the battlefield, Sadow used battle meditation to empower his invading forces.
Over time, the Republic Navy was pushed back bit by bit, turning the tide of battle into the Dark Lord's favor.
The Sith and the Republic engaged in a series of vital and crucial battles within the Coruscant System and the Koros System up until the major turning point of the war during the Battle of Koros.


Gav commanded and directed Sith forces during the Battle of Koros, such a conflict he attempted to seek out his sister Jori, knowing she would be present.
The Dark Lord’s apprentice found his way into Arraba the Hutt’s starship repair dock.
Gav’s Massassi warrior guards struck down Arraba believing he was a threat.
Just as this occurred, Jori entered the sector leading her to the false conclusion that it was her twin brother that killed Arraba, a great friend of the family.
Out of vengeance, Jori charged at her brother with a flurry of attacks using the lightsaber given to her by Jedi Padawan Odun-Urr.
Gav survived the encounter and fled from the battle leaving the Sith without directory in battle which ultimately altered the conflict into the hands of the Republic.
The apprentice of the Dark Lord returned to Sadow and decided to attack his meditation sphere, thus severing the focus he applied upon the Battle of Coruscant, transpiring quite a ways away.
Once more, the Republic gained the advantage in the war as a result of disorganization among the Sith.



# Destruction of the Sith Empire
There was something more to the Republic’s advantages, the knowledge that Naga Sadow used Force illusions to make it appear as if his armies were massive.
The Republic Navy made use of this information and rallied on the fortress world Anaxes to launch a counterattack to drive the Sith Empire’s forces away from Coruscant.
To do this, the Republic conducted a multitude of counterattacks on Kirrek and Thokos.
Of course, the battles were not easy considering the billions of casualties, sacrifices had to be made.
Jedi Master Ooroo was among those that made great sacrifices, as he managed to defeat a massive army of Massassi warriors during the Battle of Kirrek but met his fate and died in the hands of Odun-Urr in doing so.
Due to this sacrifice, the Republic Navy was now able to deploy defense on Coruscant, forcing the Sith Empire to fall back to Koros Major.
Sadow returned his forces to Primus Goluud but was pursued by Jori alongside Empress Teta and her fleet.
Realizing that he was no match for Empress Teta and her fleet, he retreated off of his base in Primus Goluud, leaving Gav trapped within.
The Dark Lord then used a superweapon on his flagship to destroy the giant star.
Gav remained trapped, prepared to perish at any moment, but before his death, he transmitted both a warning to depart from the system and the coordinates to locate the Sith Empire to Empress Teta just moments before the star imploded destroying the base, Sadow’s meditation sphere, and Gav.



Naga Sadow returned to the Sith Empire, met with the surprise that Ludo Kressh had survived and that his rally upon Sadow’s fortress was just a ruse formulated from his discovery of Sadow’s plan to make the Dark Lord believe that he had been dead all along.
Even with the antics of Kressh, he died anyway when one of Naga Sadow’s ships collided with his own during the Battle over Korriban.
The death of Ludo Kressh mattered not, he still had allies willing to fight in his name and thus, the Sith would battle each other on and over Korriban.
Occupied by battle, the Sith fleets were annihilated by the Republic forces that had arrived over Korriban.
Sadow fled once more and managed to barely survive, using his prowess in the Force and sorcery to destroy those that attempted to pursue him.
The Sith Lord that pledged his fleet of Ch’hodos to Naga Sadow’s cause, Shar Dakhan would also retreat with the Dark Lord to assist his escape.
With Sadow gone, the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic issued an invasion of all Sith worlds in order to eradicate any remaining bases or traces of the Sith.
The Republic with the help of the Jedi Order traveled across the galaxy to conquer the remaining Sith territories.
Shar Dakhan ordered his people to launch suicide attacks against the Republic and the Jedi Order to halt their invasions of Sith space.
An abundance of Sith was killed in the process, but it was enough to drive off the invading Republic from Sith worlds.



# The End of the War and the Aftermath
By the end of the Great Hyperspace War, a museum inspired by the valor of Master Ooroo was established by Odan-Urr.
This museum’s foundation occurred on Ossus and would house a variety of libraries and artifacts both from Urr’s master and even Sith artifacts gathered from the war.
In time, Ossus grew to be a fountain of knowledge consisting of Jedi archives, libraries, and even an academy.
As a reward for the wonderful support provided to the Republic by the Jedi Order, the Galactic Senate provided an ancient mountain to the Jedi Order that would go from being just a simple meditation chamber to transformation into Jedi Temple on Coruscant following the Great Sith War in 3996 BBY.
Empress Teta also received praise for her efforts in leading and defending her star system during the war, because of this, the star system was named after her.



The Sith were shattered at the end of the Great Hyperspace War, many of them being exiled to other planets such as Tund and Thule.
Some even crash landing on planets such as Kesh where the Lost Tribe of the Sith was founded.
Though, it was this war that allowed the Sith to reinforce and ensure the functionality of their tradition and custom among the galaxy.
As for the Dark Lord of the Sith, Naga Sadow, he retreated to the fourth moon of Yavin where he remained hidden with his most loyal Massassi.
He conducted many different gruesome experiments in hopes to extend his power but ultimately made the decision to use his sorcery to place his body in a state of inactivity.
600 years later, he would awaken and be killed by the former Jedi Freedon Nadd after he had gained the wisdom of the Dark Lord.
The war would also lead to the rise of one of the most powerful Sith Lords known in history, Lord Vitiate.
Vitiate had been one of the survivors of this devastating conflict and had coaxed thousands upon thousands of other Sith Lords to his homeworld of Nathema to engage in a ritual that allowed him to not only consume the essence of the Sith Lords, but the essence of the planet and its lifeforms entirely.
With enough time, Vitiate led the remainder of the Sith Empire throughout the Unknown Regions where they discovered Dromund Kaas and a Sith colony that resided within.
Utilizing his resources, Vitiate claimed himself as the Sith Emperor and reformed the Sith Empire on Dromund Kaas to what was known as the “Reconstituted Sith Empire,” a successor to the previous that had been demolished in the Great Hyperspace War.
