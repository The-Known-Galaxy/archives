# Overview
The First Battle of Ruusan was the first engagement between the Army of Light and the Brotherhood of Darkness during the Ruusan Campaign war.
It occurred in 1002 BBY and ended with a Sith victory after Sith Lord Kopecz caught a female Cerean Jedi Master using Battle Meditation in a capital ship.

# The First Confrontation
The plan of the Sith Force’s leader, Skere Kaan, was to crush the Light Side army by following an offensive strategy along with using the Sith Battle Meditation to influence his army.
The Brotherhood of Darkness decided to start the battle by using Nightfall to destroy the Republic battleship, along with a bombardment, and the fall of two Hammerheads.

This advantage for the Dark Side didn’t last long, as a Jedi Master who was superior to Skere Kaan, used the Battle Meditation to help the Republic fleet, causing problems to the Brotherhood of Darkness and their forces.

The fate of this battle was altered once Sith Lord Kopecz arrived.
After seeing Kaan’s Battle Meditation influence was no longer useful, he made his way into the Army of Light’s ship to kill the Jedi Master that was using the Battle Meditation against the Sith Army.
After infiltrating the ship and killing all the troops and the two Padawans guarding the Jedi Master, he confronted and killed her.
Following this, the Brotherhood of Darkness executed another offensive attack, and the Republic troops left, leaving this first battle as a Sith victory.
