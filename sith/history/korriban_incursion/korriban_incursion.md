# Introduction
The Korriban Incursion; also known as the Republic Occupation of Korriban, was an event that happened during 3,696 BBY within the Galactic War.
The Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic were at war after the collapse of their peace treaty and built up a series of catastrophic events.
For this battle, the Republic set up the goal of retrieving data located inside the Dark Council’s Chamber on Korriban’s Academy and causing as much damage as possible.

# Description
The assault within Korriban began through a Republic breach on the Valley of the Dark Lords; a sacred burial ground for recognized Sith Lords.
The Empire managed to interfere and defended its positions, but was defeated by four Jedi heroes.
The heroes then confronted and killed Lord Renning, freed the Imperial slaves, and went forward into the Sith Academy.


To access the Dark Council Chambers, the Jedi had to kill Sith Instructors to unlock the turbo-lift to their destination.
They later encountered Darth Soverus and fought an intense battle.
Soverus was later killed by Jedi Commander Jensyn, who arrived on time with reinforcements to assist the mission.

After successfully stealing the data needed, certain Jedi and Republic troops were forced to leave Korriban, as they were summoned to assist the Assault on Tython; a similar mission as the Incursion, because the Sith invaded to steal information stored on the Jedi Archives.
However, the Sith managed to recover Korriban shortly after the departure and killed the majority of Republic members still on the planet; recovering their strength and forcing all invaders away from their sacred Valley and Academy.
