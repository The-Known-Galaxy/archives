The Hundred-Year Darkness, also known as the Second Great Schism, was a conflict that began in 7000 BBY and lasted for about 100 years; it began with the Dark Jedi's separation from the Jedi whilst creating a monstrous army to fight in their war against the Jedi.
The conflict had started after a group of Jedi had taken the teachings of the Legions of Lettow, which were the rogue Jedi defeated during the First Great Schism.
The Legions' legacy and teachings resulted in a new group emerging; this was a group of rogue Jedi led by Ajunta Pall, XoXaan and Karness Muur.

The exiled Jedi would retreat from Jedi worlds and start settling themselves on planets strong in the dark side; the rogue Jedi would start raising armies of the dead and creating abominations twisted with the dark side.
Even with these armies, the rogue Jedi were pushed back by the Jedi and started losing ground whilst heavily outnumbered.

The rogue Jedi, now known as Dark Jedi, would start creating bioengineered dark side abominations and species that horrified the Jedi; the Dark Jedi’s Leviathan could suck the life essence out of Jedi and into blister traps where it contained the essence and knowledge.
Eventually, the Jedi were able to unite with the combined strength of the Jedi and Republic, pushing them back to their final stand on Corbos.

After their loss on Corbos and with many of the Dark Jedi killed, the Dark Jedi eventually surrendered as they were exiled to worlds far away from the Republic with seemingly no or little life.
The Jedi hoped that the Dark Jedi would learn from their mistakes.

The Dark Jedi that did escape from the Republic’s grasp ended up settling on the planet of Korriban.
After landing on Korriban, they found the Sith species who had a king as their leader.
The Dark Jedi conspired with the king’s hand, together with the usage of their power, they made the Sith submit to them.
The Sith would raise them to god-like creatures, with it becoming the rulers of the Sith people.
Ajunta Pall would be the first to become the Dark Lord of the Sith, the strongest and ultimate leader.

The Dark Jedi would interbreed with the Sith species, and the Sith species would see technological advances, slowly turning the term Sith to be used for more than the original species, instead as a general term for dark side Force-users who followed Sith Lords their teachings.
Large temples and buildings would be created by the Sith people, constructing a Sith homeworld and the breeding place of the newly found Sith Empire, which would later be known as the Original or Old Sith Empire.
