# Overview

The Seventh Battle of Ruusan was the last confrontation of the Brotherhood of Darkness against the Army of Light in Ruusan.
This last fight was the most important one since it would determine the fate of the galaxy.

# The Last Engagement

After six months of battle between both factions, the last engagement was set to begin, with the Sith Army near defeat.
During this battle, Darth Bane helped the light side by ordering the Sith’s fleet to break formation and attack the Jedi, allowing the Army of Light to gain the advantage and make the Sith retreat.
This decision made by Darth Bane was because he wanted to destroy the Brotherhood of Darkness, yet nobody knew his real motives.

Skere Kaan’s army retreated to the caves after being attacked by the Army of Light, where he would use the Thought Bomb given by Darth Bane.
However, the Dark Lord of the Sith didn’t notice he was being deceived by Darth Bane, since the Thought Bomb would kill every Force-Sensitive in its radius, including him.

After Valenthyne Farfalla’s forces found where the Brotherhood of Darkness was hiding, they made the Sith who were guarding the entrance surrender.
On the entrance of the caves, he met Kopecz, who told him about Kaan’s plans before being killed by Farfalla.
After Hoth’s team arrival, Farfalla informed the Jedi Lord about Kaan’s plan to detonate the Thought Bomb.
Jedi Lord Hoth and ninety-nine Jedi went inside the caves, knowing what their fate would be.

Dark Lord of the Sith Kaan after seeing the Jedi inside of the caves, instantly unleashed the bomb, eradicating every Force-Sensitive in the blast radius.
After the Thought Bomb wasdetonated, the Brotherhood of Darkness was successfully destroyed.
However, most of the Army of Light retreated in order to survive against this ancient technique.

The only surviving Sith was Darth Bane, who took an orphan on the planet, Zannah, as his Apprentice under his new rule, the Rule of Two.
Due to the Sith’s assumed destruction, Bane and Zannah were able to work in secret.
