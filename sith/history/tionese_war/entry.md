# Overview

The Tionese War began around 24,000 BBY and ended at approximately 23,900 BBY.
It ended in Republic victory and the dissolution of the Honorable Union of Desevro and Tion.
Major skirmishes involved the Battle of Coruscant and Abhean.

# Origins of the War

After the demise of Xim the Despot to the Hutts in their wars, the Tionese were oppressed by the Hutts.
This oppression led to a lack of technological advancements, meaning that the Tionese were falling behind other civilisations.
Furthermore, the Hutts committed the “Devouring” of several Tionese expansions in the Kiirium Reaches.
This assault on the Tionese was a result of the Tionese trying to ally with the powerful, industrial Galactic Republic.

The Galactic Republic was formed in 25,000 BBY by the Core Worlds.
They had wealth and lots of industrial power but lacked military prowess.
This was discovered by the Tionese when Republic scout ships were encountered transiting through the Perlemian Trade Route and contact was made.
This led Desevro leaders to persuade the rest of the Tionese states to go to war with the wealthy, unprotected Republic, as they were seen as an easy target.
The Jedi saw this alliance of Tionese states amass battle fleets and warned the newly founded Republic of possible Tionese action; this advice was ignored, and the Republic was caught unaware when the attacks began.

# History of the War

The first act of war occurred down the Perlemian Trade Route, where the Tionise were successful in capturing Abhean, Roche, Lantilles, and Tirahann.
They were met with little to no resistance, as the Republic was severely under defended.
These captured planets spurred the Republic into mass production of battleships to create fleets to protect.
The Tionese were successful in destroying a few of the stations where the ships were produced using new pressure bombs, but not all of them were destroyed.
Now that the Republic had a force to defend with, along with the help of the Hutts, a century of war occurred along the Perlemian Trade Route.
Eventually, the Jedi joined to lead the Republic forces to try and maintain a galactic rule.
Due to the superior industrial might of the Republic, it was inevitable that the Tionese lost this war.
This led to the Tionese resorting to sneak and suicide attacks on planets in the Divide.
These actions only angered the Republic which adopted a total war doctrine.
Key Tionese worlds and Deservo were pounded with pressure bombs and bombardment from the Republic battle fleets, and the offer of unconditional surrender by Deservo was ignored; the attacks continued.
This was the tactic used to try and get the other Tionese states to surrender through intimidation.

# Afterrmath of the War

The Jedi were appalled by the treatment of Deservo and removed themselves from the Republic, yet still offered protection in particular locations.
The Honorable Union of Deservo and Tion joined the Galactic Republic by 23,900 BBY, except for the independent Deservo, and became a standard sector of the Republic.

The aggression created by a centralised military produced by the Republic led Core regions to believe that a centralised military would bring instability to the Republic.
This was met with many objections, notably the Jedi and the more vulnerable Rimworld systems, yet the fleets were downsized, and the next time a centralised force would be created was 15,000 BBY.
