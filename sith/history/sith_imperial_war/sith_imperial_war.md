# Introduction
After their defeat during the First Galactic Civil War, the Sith-Imperial War would see the Galactic Empire return as the dominant power in the Galaxy.
Darth Krayt, Dark Lord of the One Sith also known as the New Sith Order, would set out to destroy the New Jedi Order.

Following the war, the Galactic Alliance would surrender, however it would save portions of its military and would be reforged into the Galactic Alliance Remnants.
The Galactic Alliance Remnants were set on keeping up opposition against the Galactic Empire and the One Sith.
However, the Sith would reveal their deception and take control of the Galactic Empire, thus causing Emperor Roan Fel and his followers to form the True Empire.

# Section 1
The routes of the war could be traced back to the Ossus Project, during which the New Jedi Order would convince the Galatic Alliance to allow Yuuzhan Vong Shapers, to be headed by Master Shaper Nei Rin, to use a desolate part of Ossus where one of the Order ancient strongholds as a test site.

The intent of those who championed the project; such as Jedi Master Kol Skywalker wanted to see if the Yuuzha Vong terraforming methods, like those used centuries before to turn the planet of Coruscant into a temporary homeworld for the Yuuzhan Vong, could save and restore the desolate part of Ossus.
Kol Skywalker thought that the terraforming method could be used to save and restore ailing worlds while also transforming the galaxy's view of the Yuzzhan Vong.
The Project appeared to be work as the desolate part of Ossus was being restored to a vibrant life-bearing portion of the planate once more.
With the Ultimate success of the initial part of the project, one hundred planets were selected for terraforming.
The initial results were wondrous to watch.
However, no one would think the One Sith would intervene, but the One Sith under the rule of Darth Krayt, and assisted by a renegade Yuuzhan Vong named Zenoc Quah would start to sabotage the terraforming projects.
The sabotage would cause the planets to become deformed and start to grow painful bony growth not seen since the Yuuzhan Vong forcefully took populations as slaves.

The Yuuzhan Vong were shocked as the Ossus Project showed great success.
However, the Jedi would suspect foul play, but both citizens and members of the Galatic Alliance would start to point fingers at the Yuuzhan Vong and blame them for the planets starting to become deformed.
This was the Sith’s plan and it was working in their favor greatly.
The Jedi knew the Yuuzhan Vong were innocent however the Jedi Order would ask the Alliance to accept the Project despite large public resistance to allow the Yuuzhan Vong to terraform planets.
Eventually, the Alliance allowed the Yuuzhan Vong to work but once the Sith plan went into effect and started to show results members of the Alliance started to get angry and would leave the Alliance and declare neutrality.

This would lead to the Empire eventually declaring war against the Galactic Alliance.



# Section 2
From the beginning of the war, the Alliance was at a disadvantage.
With the Alliance defending the Yuuzhan Vong it would lead many planets to leave the Alliance thus weakening them.
Suddenly the Alliance was faced with suggestion movement as well as a war with the Empire.
Thus the war began with the Empire holding every advantage.
However, Emperor Roan Fel did not support the war he declared war reluctantly against the Alliance.
His lack of support for the war would lead to him preventing his Imperial Knights from participating in the war.
This would lead to the Empire despite having every advantage to start the war off on the wrong foot and take more losses than expected.

Meanwhile, the Alliance would contact the Mandalorian, now under the leadership of Mand’alor Chernan Ordo.
Ordo was contacted by the Alliance to hold the planet Botajef and its shipyards against the Imperial Military until the Alliance fleet could arrive to reinforce.
However, during the Battle of Botajef, the Manalorians had a traitor among them by the name of Yaga Auchs.
Yaga Auchs served an unknown master and was ordered to sabotage the communications between the Alliance and the Manadlorians.
This sabotage would lead to the death of Mandalore and Yaga Auchs would take the title and become the next Mandalore.
With Yaga Auchs as Mandalore, he would order a retreat and withdrawal of Mandalorian forces.
This would leave Botajef for the Imperials to take and it would leave a few Manadlorians who refused to follow him stranded on Botajef with the Imperials closing in.



# Section 3
In the year 128 ABY, one year into the war, things for the Empire were not going well despite the Alliance's disadvantage; the Jedi were more than making up for any loss of Alliance planets and military power.
Another reason the war was going badly for the Empire was the fact that Emperor Fell refused to send his Imperial Knights into battle.
This would cause the Empire to not have enough ability to counter the Jedi.
Through the ruthlessness and ambition of the Director of Imperial Intelligence Grand Moff Nyna Calixte, the Sith would approach the Imperials and lend their aid to the Imperial Cause.
Once the Sith openly voiced themselves the Jedi knew they were behind the sabotage of the terraforming projects, but due to how quickly events progressed the Jedi were unable to prove that the Sith were behind the sabotage of the Yuuzhan Vong’s terraforming.
Eventually, members of the Imperial Camp, where even Emperor Fel himself would realize what was done, but it was far too late to halt the plans of the Sith.
Emperor Fel personally hated the Sith but he was overruled in objections of an alliance with the Sith by the Moff Council as no Emperor had ruled absolutely since the days of Palpatine.
The Moff Council was eager to use any advantage they had at their disposal so they could bring Imperial dominance to the galaxy once more.
Once the Yuuzhan Vong knew of the Sith sabotage they knew it was no longer the work of their gods and they were determined to reverse the effects of the sabotage of the Sith.



# Section 4
The Battle of Caamas took place after three bloody years of war had raged on.
The Alliance was all but a spent force while the Sith only grew in power and strength and would eventually start producing their starfighters.
Under the command of Grand Admiral Morlish Veed, who was Calixte’s lover and participant in the Sith conspiracy.
Grand Admiral Veed would deal a crushing blow to the Alliance fleet at Caamas causing Admiral Gar Stazi to order a fighting retreat to save his ships.
Veed’s victory announcement essentially brought an end to the war altogether.
With the Alliance forces in tatters, the Alliance was left with nothing to defend Coruscant and was forced to surrender.


With the war coming to an end the Jedi still stood in defiance of the Empire and the Sith.
Emperor Fel would call upon the Jedi Order to surrender itself to the will of the Empire; some Jedi would surrender and join the Imperial Knights while others refused to surrender.
The Jedi who refused to ally with the Empire and the Sith would withdraw from Coruscant to their Temple on Ossus.
The Sith would eventually follow the Jedi to Ossus, where Darth Nihl would lead a brutal attack with the Imperial forces under the command of Moff Rulf Yage.
The massacre left the Jedi scattered across the galaxy but not fully defeated as the Sith attacked before the whole order could gather on Ossus.
This would cause various Jedi to go into hiding across the Galaxy.



# Section 5
Shortly after the war the Sith were determined to rule the galaxy directly.
This would lead to the Sith launching a deadly palace coup against Emperor Fel and his Imperial Knights.
This attack launched on Emperor Fel and his Imperial Knights was successful and would lead to Darth Krayt taking the Imperial Throne and reestablishing a New Sith Empire for the first time in over a century.

However, some worlds and systems choose to stay loyal to Emperor Fel and his Imperial Knights.
Emperor Fel would eventually manage to the fortified world of Bastion and would turn it into the new Imperial capital.
By taking Bastion and making it the Empire’s capital, he created a racial faction to fight against the Sith–thus plunging the galaxy into Civil War once again.
Later Emperor Fell would create an Alliance with the Galactic Alliance Remnants to fight against the Sith.
The Jedi would later join the Alliance created between Fel’s Empire and the Alliance Remnants, but in an unanticipated event, Darth Krayt himself was seemingly killed by his advisor after a duel with a female Jedi and an ancient Sith Lord.
