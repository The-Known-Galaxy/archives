# Introduction
The Treaty of Coruscant was a treaty of peace to attempt to put the Great Galactic War to an end.
This treaty was established in 3653 BBY, with an agreement that the Republic would withdraw their troops and the Jedi forces would abandon their claimed systems to their enemies.
However, most powerhouses and factions of the Republic refused to recognize the Treaty of Coruscant, and continued to battle the Sith Empire.

# Description
The Treaty of Coruscant was firstly proposed by the Dark Council, under leadership of the Sith Emperor, with this agreement stating that both the Sith Empire and the Republic would cease hostility between themselves, and that the Republic and the Jedi forces have to withdraw captured systems.
It was eventually implemented in 3653 BBY, when the Republic’s Galactic Senate finally gave in out of desolation, even though they knew that it was possibly a sham, or that the Sith Empire had other motives behind this treaty.


After a meeting was accepted by the Republic’s Galactic Senate, the Sith Empire and the Republic had their representatives and the conference was held on the planet Alderaan, with the goals of discussing the terms of peace.
During the conference, the Sith Empire launched an unexpected assault on Coruscant, led by Darth Malgus.
This conflict would later be known as Sacking of Coruscant, and this successfully placed Coruscant under the Sith Empire’s control.
After this assault, the Republic reluctantly agreed on the treaty and the Sith Lord, who would later be known as Darth Baras, presented the signatures of the Republic’s officials, thus leading to an end of the Galactic Great War.
The Treaty of Coruscant had harsh conditions, and the Republic’s officials were assigned a protocol droid to remind them of the terms that were agreed.

Following the establishment of the Treaty of Coruscant, the Sith Empire was able to thrive, with no factions or opposing governing bodies able to object to it.
This would lead to increased expansion of the Sith Empire.
However, this agreement had raised opposing voices within the Republic, including the Jedi Master Dar’Nala, General Elin Garza of the Republic Military, and the Royal House of Alderaan.
Due to the clashes in thought between many influential individuals, this created a new war, which then would be known as Galactic Cold War, between the Republic and the Sith Empire, with battles being both direct and by proxy.
