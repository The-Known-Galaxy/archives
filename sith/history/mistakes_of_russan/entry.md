# Overview

“All are equal in the Brotherhood of Darkness.” Those putrid words fell from the lips of Lord Kaan many times.
This central lie, upon which Kaan built his false Sith, is the reason behind their watery, diluted power.

The so-called New Sith Wars lasted a thousand years.
Many warlords during that time sought to control the destiny of the Sith Empire.
They achieved victories without a clear line of succession.
Every Sith wanted to be king and so they argued, while the Republic grew to fail  (its citizens sickened with plague) and became isolated by decaying infrastructure.
Coruscant’s throat lay bare beneath the Sith blades, but the Sith plunged their knives into one another’s backs instead.
Kaan was not the worst of these fools, only the last.
Kaan created the Brotherhood of Darkness to end this squabbling, but he chose a false egalitarianism over a strong central rule.
Within the Brotherhood, all members with rank called themselves “Sith Lords”.
This was Kaan’s first mistake.
Darth Bane served the Brotherhood of Darkness as a sergeant assigned to the Gloom Walkers and led his comrades in the capture of Phaseem.
He claims that if they had maintained a sound military strategy and followed an orderly conquest, the Republic would have been theirs.
Kaan though was impatient.
He overreached and leaped into the Bormea sector, the Republic’s heart, before it was time.
This was his second mistake.
Kaan’s third and final mistake came at Russan, a worthless world where he hoped to defeat Lord Hoth and the Jedi army of Light.
He was instead goaded into a grinding land war of needless attrition.
Bane watched it unfold and knew the Sith had become like the Jedi; too numerous and too weak.
Kaan had lost his grip.
In the end, Kaan followed Darth Bane’s suggestion and pooled the abilities of the other Sith Lords to create a brute force wonder: the thought bomb.
This was proof of what the Dark Side could achieve when it wasn’t split among thousands.
However, the thought bomb consumed not only the Jedi combatants but also the Sith who had created it.
It ended the war and exterminated Lord Kaan’s Brotherhood.
