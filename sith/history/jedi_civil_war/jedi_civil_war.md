# Overview
The Jedi Civil War was a war fought between 3959 BBY to 3956 BBY, it started when Dark Lord Revan and his apprentice, Darth Malak created their own Sith Empire and invaded the Galactic Republic with a Sith fleet they retrieved from the unknown regions.
Revan started this war to try and retake the Galactic Republic in hopes to change it for the better so they could fight back against a “Bigger Sith Empire''.
Revan was almost successful as well until falling for a trap set up by the Jedi that caused him to be near death until he was taken in and brainwashed into believing he was a loyal Republic agent.
The Jedi Civil War was galactic-wide and lasted around three years, with Revan being the main focus of it.
The Jedi Civil War was also referred to as the Second Sith War, The Malak War, and The War of the Star Forge.

# Section 1
Revan started the Jedi Civil War in hopes he could overtake the Galactic Republic and change it for the better.
He overtook Korriban and refounded the Sith Academy that used to take place there.
Revan had many on his side before the war, including Veterans of the Mandalorian Wars, and Dark Jedi converts.
After Revan fell for the Jedi’s trap, he was taken barely alive by a Jedi with the name of Bastila Shan, she and Revan would grow to become fond of each other.
After being taken to Dantooine, where the Jedi Enclave was, Revan would be healed and brainwashed into believing he was a loyal Republic Agent, where he would be assigned under Bastila Shan.

When Revan finished recovering, he was placed on a ship by the name of Endar Spire.
Revans ex-apprentice, Darth Malak, wasn't just going to leave him as a brainwashed agent, though.
Malak had set up a fleet to ambush Revans ship in hopes he would bring out Revans memories of the Star Forge, which was where Revan and Malak got their resources for beginning the war.
Unfortunately for Malak, his plan didn’t go well, and Revan, along with Bastile Shan and other Republic officers fled to Dantooine, where an old Jedi Academy was.
This was when the Jedi Masters of Dantooine decided to retrain Revan in the ways of the force.
After a few weeks, they sent Revan back out with a new fleet of old Ebon Hawk members to track down the Star Forge.

After Malak had retrieved numerous Star Maps, he sent out yet another fleet to attack the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine.
While the Jedi managed to hold them off, it only weakened them in their already vulnerable state.
After Malak had retrieved the final Star Map and found the homeworld of the Rakatan, Revan and the rest of the Republic launched the final battle.
Revan fought Malak on the Star Forge while the Republic routed the Sith Forces.
After a lengthy battle, Revan managed to defeat Malak and destroy the Star Forge, putting an end to one of the most infamous wars of Star Wars history.

Even though the Republic technically won the battle, the destruction was unignorable and it was so costly, that they could hardly rebuild what was lost.
So while the Sith physically lost, the destruction was so great it left a complete termination of the Jedi order.
