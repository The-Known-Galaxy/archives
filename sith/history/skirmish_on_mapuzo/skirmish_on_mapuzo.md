# Overview |
During the Great Jedi Purge, one of the last duels between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader took place on Mapuzo in 9 BBY.
The skirmish between the Jedi Master and the Sith Lord ended up with Obi-Wan Kenobi almost being burned alive.

# The skirmish
After escaping from the Inquisitorious to keep Leia Organa alive, Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived at a nearby quarry on the planet Mapuzo where he met Darth Vader, his former Padawan.
Vader taunted his former Jedi master by igniting his lightsaber, which made Obi-Wan retreat from the fight to be safe.
This decision taken by the Jedi Master was because he didn’t train during the Great Jedi Purge and didn’t have the capability and skill as before to fight Vader.
Darth Vader noticed the fear in Obi-Wan and kept chasing him in the darkness until he swung his lightsaber at Obi-Wan Kenobi, starting the fight between master and apprentice.
Kenobi kept retreating unsuccessfully as Darth Vader kept attacking him.
Kenobi then reached a place with no escape, and Darth Vader choked him with the Force.
Darth Vader knocked down and ignited flammable rocks, moving Obi-Wan Kenobi to them, causing him to burn alive.
Unfortunately for the Sith Lord, Obi-Wan’s teammate, Durith, saved Kenobi from being captured by stormtroopers by re-igniting the rocks with a blaster bolt, as well as shooting the stormtrooper in charge of bringing Kenobi to Darth Vader.
