# Introduction
During the time of 3699 BBY, the Sith Lord Darth Tanis created a powerful superweapon capable of eliminating all life in the range of its location.
During the time of its creation the Jedi sought to destroy the weapon, they attacked the Sith Temple containing the weapons eliminating a Sith Witch, unfortunately, this weapon activated during the battle.
In a short amount of time both sides turned to ash in the blink of an eye, the battle ended almost instantly and there were no survivors, only the memories of the fact that both Jedi and Sith never returned to tell the tales of what happened.

# The Events
Through the years the many Jedi that remembered this event would be traumatized by the heavy casualties of the battle and said it as a reminder to the many Jedi Padawans and Jedi Younglings about the Malachor disaster and would use this knowledge to make sure it never happens again.
In the year of the Galactic Republic, Darth Sidious would take his new Apprentice Darth Maul to the ashes of the battle, and tell him the story of how this was the result of what the Jedi and their arrogance can lead to.
Darth Maul breathed in the ashes and proceeded to have visions of the Great Scourge of Malachor and witnessed the Jedi attacking the Sith and allowing the weapon to set off, and eliminate all the Jedi and Sith in the area.
During the Imperial War, Darth Maul returned to Malachor to seek out the holocron that was used to create the superweapon.
He would be stopped by Ezra Bridger, Kanan and Ahsoka however would strike Kanan resulting in him becoming blinded.
The Sith holocron was then taken by Ezra but would almost be taken by a wrathful Darth Vader.
Vader was eventually stopped by Ahsoka Tano however; by Ahsoka Tano would leave behind a legendary duel, presumably dead.
With the Sith Holocron taken out without careful procedures, the superweapon would activate again, but this group became more aware of the power of the weapon.
They escaped with the holocron and leave Ahsoka behind and Vader.
