During the Old Sith Empire, there was an interval of great potency and potential within the Empire called the Golden Age of the Sith.
It all started with Marka Ragnos’ death which caused a lack of determination within the Sith Empire while two Sith Lords, Naga Sadow, and Ludo Kressh took this opportunity to try and show off their strength so they could take the throne for themselves.

During the Great Hyperspace War, Sadow’s plan involved using the hyperspace adventurers Jori Dagaron and Gav for the benefit of the Sith Empire, after their arrival.
However the plan and the Great Hyperspace War would prove to be a failure; he was betrayed by Jori who aided the Republic and Jedi who seemed to have more benefits in battle, power, and size.
Sadow’s forces managed to take Coruscant, but shortly after the Jedi took Coruscant back causing the Sith Lord to flee to Yavin 4.
The Sith Empire eventually crumbled down due to their defeat in the war after their period of strength.

After what felt like forever, Exar Kun tried to create a Golden Age of his own during the times of the Great Sith War.
This attempt proved to be a failure as well after the Jedi and Republic were underestimated once again leading to another of the Sith Empire’s losses.
