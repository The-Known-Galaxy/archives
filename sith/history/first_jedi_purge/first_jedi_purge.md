# Introduction |
Sometime after the Jedi Civil War ended, the First Jedi Purge took place.
From 3,954 BBY to 3,951 BBY, almost the entire Jedi Order disappeared from the galaxy, disbanded and slain by the Sith.
The purge began during the events of the Sith Civil War when Darths Traya, Sion, and Nihilus took command of what remained of Revan’s Sith Empire.
Shortly after Darth Traya was exiled from control, Darth Sion led his Sith Assassins to search and destroy the Jedi, while Nihilus consumed the life of a planet in an attempt to exterminate the present Jedi.
Although the purge was branded a success, it came to an end when the Jedi Exile, Meetra Surik, killed the three perpetrators of the purge and trained a new generation of Jedi.

# Context - The Fall of the Jedi |
By the time it was 3,956 BBY, the Jedi had experienced three galaxy-spanning wars in a span of fifty years and were heavily worn out.
The aftermath of all those conflicts weakened the Jedi and became a shadow of their former selves.
The following events that led to their status were the following: the Great Sith War, the Mandalorian Wars, and the Jedi Civil War.
Due to how sudden and close these wars were, the Jedi never got the opportunity to rebuild and were unable to sustain their impactful losses.


Aside from a weakened force, the Jedi suffered a major loss of knowledge, because of the destruction of learning centers such as the Great Jedi Library of Ossus & the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine.
Within these incidents, holocrons, records, and histories were lost, destroyed, or stolen during the previous battles.
This resulted in numerous Jedi who lacked the proper experience to teach aspiring students and a lack of knowledge to use for their training.

When the Jedi Civil War ended, the Jedi Order barely any Jedi remained alive, as less than 100 individuals survived and attempted to rebuild their faction.
Because the Galactic Republic was also on the brink of collapse, the Jedi crumbled alongside them.
They offered the recently redeemed Revan assistance to rebuild, but he denied their pleas.
The overall status of the Jedi Order provoked high levels of disillusion amongst their ranks, and the Jedi themselves–including the High Council– began to lose faith, because most of their numbers had fallen to the Dark Side.

Ever since Darth Malak died and the Star Forge was decimated, the Sith Empire also began to suffer collateral damage within their infrastructure.
The surviving Dark Jedi–Jedi who have recently fallen to the Dark Side–killed each other in an attempt to assert dominance, while the remaining followers of Revan’s Empire secretly remained in power; some of them still lingering on the Sith planet Malachor V.
One of the bases they resided in was the Trayus Core, the heart of the Trayus Academy.
Inside, the Sith Lords; Darth Traya, Darth Nihilus, and Darth Sion, developed a strategy to rebuild their numbers.
In doing so, the Sith Triumvirate was founded and proceeded to conduct a shadow war with only one goal: Exterminating every living Jedi throughout the galaxy.
They began manipulating incidents from the shadows, arising on Republic planets that can highly jeopardize them should they fall.
As time passed, their actions began to escalate and affect the few remaining members of the Jedi order.

While the Sith Triumvirate was recently founded, the Jedi were undergoing a chaotic period.
Surviving members began to step down and go off-grid, never to be heard of again.
Ongoing gatherings began to disappear as well, which suddenly left a high disturbance in the Force that few high-ranking members–the Jedi High Council– could sense.
This disturbance led to a prediction that they were being hunted.
This gave rise to a secret conclave on the planet Katarr, hosted by Jedi Master Atris, though its secrecy came to disappear.
Atris intentionally leaked information about the conclave to draw their attackers out from the shadows.
To answer that grave mistake, Darth Nihilus arrived on the planet and consumed the life force of Karr and every living being residing in it.
Only one survived this catastrophe, Visas Marr, who was then taken as an apprentice by Darth Nihilus.
Based on the Conclave of Katarr’s aftermath, the remaining Jedi High Councilors went into exile, believing that the Triumvirate would be baited into a false victory and reveal themselves.

# The Jedi Exile’s Journey
|
Almost all of the Jedi have been eliminated by the time it was 3,951 BBY.
One of the known survivors of the purge was Meetra Surik, who was given the alias of the Jedi Exile–for disobeying the orders of the High Council during the Mandalorian Wars– returned to aid the Galactic Republic.
She was picked up by The Harbinger Republic Cruiser, where they suddenly received a distress call to assist a vessel.
Arriving at the coordinated location, they discovered the Ebon Hawk and a Sith warship adrift in space, where they boarded the warship in search of survivors.
The results of the boarding were that it was empty, but brought aboard a corpse; unbeknownst it was Darth Sion they allowed into their ship.
The next few days that were spent roaming space, the Harbinger’s crew felt they were being watched and experienced suspicious activity.
As such activities became a common thing within the cruiser, Darth Sion finally awoke and began killing all Republic officers on board alongside concealed Sith Assassins; who secretly boarded the ship.
The Harbinger was then taken over by the Sith and jumped into hyperspace, bringing everyone on board to their unknown destination.
During this incident, Surik was extracted via the Ebon Hawk and attempted to flee the massacre.

Days after the takeover, Meetra Surik woke up in a mining facility, unsure of how she arrived.
She met an old woman who introduced herself as Jedi Master Kreia–Darth Traya–and guided Surik to escape the facility.
Their prison was abandoned, except for a prisoner named Atton Rand and a droid.
It did not take long for a Sith Lord to arrive at the mine.
Kreia, Surik, and Atton managed to board the Ebon Hawk and set a course for Telos IV, and survived a chase from Sion and an explosion within an asteroid field; only to once more get trailed by the Sith.

When the Ebon Hawk arrived at the orbital station of Telos, they were detained for the mining facility’s destruction.
Fortunately, they were cleared off by security, but their ship got stolen and they were refused to use another vessel.
Being forced to go down into Telos, they were shot down by air turrets but were pulled out by its creator, a Zabarak named Bao-Dur.
They learned that the Ebon Hawk was taken to the old planetary aqueducts in Telos’ polar region, so they journeyed to that location.


When inside the system, they were detained by the Last Handmaiden–Brianna– and her three sisters, because they accidentally intruded into the secret Telosian Jedi Academy.
Surik requested an audience with the facility head; Jedi Master Atris and was allowed to meet with her.
After arguing about Surik’s actions within the Mandalorian Wars, they were allowed to leave, while also stealing Atris’ database and navigational charts.
Thanks to the database, they were able to identify where the last five Jedi Masters were hiding: Atris (Telos), Kavar (Onderon), Vrook Lamar (Dantooine), Zez-Kai Ell (Nar Shaddaa), and Lonna Vash (Korriban).
Surik decided to travel to those five planets in search of answers to why she was exiled.



# The Lost Jedi |
After finding and conversing with the Jedi Masters, Meetra Surik returned to Dantooine to find the ruined Jedi Enclave.
She found all the masters she met–excluding Lonna Vash for she was killed in Korriban–where they would decide her fate.
Before the newly formed Council could strip the Exile of the Force, Jedi Master Kreia barged into the meeting and made the Masters feel the pain Surik felt when she was in Malachor V; which left them dead and void from the Force.

Surik was able to recover from her stasis and chased after Kreia, who once again took the mantle of Darth Traya.
She traveled to Telos once again to search for her.
Amid her chase, she was forced to fight against Atris, who was corrupted by the Dark Side by the academy’s holocrons.
After being defeated by the Exile, Atris was persuaded to forgive her and see the truth behind the actions that led to her exile.
Atris then informed Surik that Traya fled to Malachor V and was expecting her, and proceeded to exile herself after Surik left.



# End of the Purge |
Shortly after Surik left Atris, a Sith fleet led by Darth Nihilus arrived at Telos, as he was drawn into the secret academy.
With the help of Mandalore Canderous Ordo and his followers, Meetra Surik boarded and engaged Nihilus on his ship, so Telos does not meet the same fate as Katarr.
Darth Nihilus’ apprentice, Visas Marr sided with Surik and her allies and successfully defeated the Sith Lord and later traveled alongside them to Malachor V.

The Exile and her allies arrived at Malachor V and later proceeded to the Trayus Academy, fighting off storm beasts, Sith Warriors & Assassins along the path.
They later confronted Darth Sion, where he was defeated after a long and intense duel against Meetra Surik.
She then helped Sion realize that his master, Darth Traya, was using him and did not care about his fate.
Surik also convinced Sion to let go of his hate; the feeling that kept him alive, which caused him to succumb to all of his injuries and died out of fear of letting his power go.


Now with Sion defeated, Meetra Surik finally confronted Darth Traya, where the Sith Lord was defeated.
Surik decided to spare Traya’s life, but she did not wish to give up and attacked once more.
She failed once more, but the Exile allowed Traya to redeem herself from the Dark Side.
Before she gave her life to the Force, Kreia told Surik information about Revan’s location in the Unknown Regions, alongside the fates of her, her allies, and the planets they visited.
With the Sith Triumvirate finally defeated, Meetra Surik restored the Jedi Order and left the Galactic Republic in the hands of the Lost Jedi that she trained, to find Revan, located within the Unknown Regions.
