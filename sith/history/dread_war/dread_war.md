# Introduction
The Dread War was a conflict that occurred during the Galactic War; a conflict that arose after a peace treaty within the Republic & Empire was broken.
In this scenario, the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire both fought against six powerful Sith Lords known as the Dread Masters–powerful beings who served the Sith Emperor as prophets, military generals, and advisors.


The Dread Masters earned their titles after harnessing the power of the Phobis Devices; artifacts that drive Sith insane with fear.
During the Great Galactic War; specifically in 3,668 BBY, the Sith Lords used the battle meditation ability to destroy Republic Fleets while on board inside their Dreadnaught.
Then, Jedi Knight Jaric Kaedan led a strike team that successfully captured the Dread Masters.
He announced they had been slain by the Republic, but were secretly imprisoned on the planet Belsavis.

# Dread Master Crisis
After being imprisoned on Belsavis, the Dread Masters escaped their prison and set their goal to achieve total domination; therefore sparking the Dread Master Crisis.
They freed themselves in 3,641 BBY and returned to serve the Empire, fulfilling their own goals separately after the Emperor died on Dromund Kaas.
This caused a truce within the Republic and the Empire, which allowed them to cooperate on defeating the Dread Masters.


Lord Tagriss; a Sith Lord who decided to assist the Dread Masters, was tasked to raid the Arcanum Space Station on the Meram Sector to steal powerful Sith artifacts.
Darth Acina and Jedi Master Cedral Gend sent their forces to prevent the artifact theft, which was an overall success.
Lord Tagriss managed to evade his pursuers and managed to obtain the Seeds of Rage and Darkstaff artifacts prior to leaving.
He tried to unlock their powers on a Jedi Temple in Ilum, but was apprehended and killed during the process.
This allowed the Dread Masters to send a strike force to recover the artifacts as they were crucial for their plan of domination.


While the allies of the Dread Masters were constantly failing in enacting their plans, Dread Master Styrak grew furious and impatient on progress results.
This made him go rogue and assemble a mercenary team against the Hutt Cartel to fulfill his personal agenda.
He believed his actions would be hidden by the Sith & Republic, but was discovered and killed alongside his allies



# Oricon’s Discovery
Once Styrak was dead, the Galactic Republic discovered that the Dread Masters’ base was in the moon Oricon.
They sent a task force under the command of Jedi Master Ogan-Dei to bombard the moon on orbit and quickly end the Sith Lords, but the Dread Masters used the Force Fear ability to impact the Republic forces, which led to the death of the task force.
Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh called upon Jedi heroes to travel onto Oricon, assist the task force and complete their mission.


Shortly after, the Empire discovered the Dread Master’s base and the status of the Republic forces that were sent.
They allowed Lord Hargrev to assemble a task force and invade the Oricon base, where they also lost contact with the Empire as their ships were destroyed by the Dread Masters.
Darth Marr ordered the elite members of the Sith–the ones who orchestrated the Dread Master prison break–to locate Hargrev and his task force.


Meeting up on the surface of Oricon, the Republic and Empire formed a truce after realizing they both failed to defeat the Dread Masters.
They managed to cripple the Dread Hosts and started an attack on the Dread Fortress.
Both teams were approached by Dread Master Brontes and her following creations & servants: Nefra, Qor’thest, Draxus, Grob’thok, and Corruptor Zero.
Brontes and her forces were defeated and killed by the truced task force, who later discovered a portal leading to the true Dread Master base, the Dread Palace.


Once entering the portal, they discovered the four remaining Sith Lords, where they tried to kill the task force but failed.
Once reaching the throne room, the Dread Masters taunted their apprehenders, which to their surprise, realized they were truly a challenge.
The Sith Lords decided to summon the spirits of Brontes and Styrak to assist the fight, but managed to be defeated regardless.
When they realized how close they were to dying, the Dread Masters used some of their life force as an attempt to completely destroy the strike team, which ended up as a failure.
The team managed to survive and took down the remaining Dread Masters one by one.



# Aftermath
After ending the Dread Master’s rogue plans and stopping the current threat to the galaxy, a Republic camp had the unexpected visit of Dread Master Calphayus.
Surprisingly, he survived his death and was changed by it.
He explained that he saw the light and was no longer bound to his peers.
Not seeing him as a threat to the galaxy, the Republic forces spared his life and took him off-world to be treated by the Jedi.
