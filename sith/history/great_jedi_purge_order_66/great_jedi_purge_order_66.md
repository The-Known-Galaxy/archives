# Introduction
The Great Jedi Purge, also known as Order 66, was a secret command implanted in the brains of clone troopers to execute all Jedi as traitors to the Republic.
The Order was designed as a contingency protocol against renegade Jedi, but was actually part of a plan by the Sith to eliminate the Jedi and seize power.
The execution of Order 66 led to the downfall of the Jedi Order and the rise of the Galactic Empire.

# Section 1
After the Supreme Commander, Chancellor and Dark Lord of Sith survived the attack of the Jedi Generals, he announced the execution of Order 66.
It stated the extermination of all Jedi during the Clone Wars and a signal was sent to all clones in their brain chips.
They immediately killed all Jedi and future members of the Jedi Order because they were against the Republic.
When Order 66 was issued, a number of Clone Troopers believed it to be a false order and began to protect the Jedi instead of killing them.
Several other Jedi survived by killing the attacking Clone Troopers.
Darth Vader led the campaign to hunt down and kill most of the survivors in the years following Order 66.
This Imperial destruction of the Jedi is known as the Great Jedi Purge.
Over 100 Jedi and former Jedi went into hiding and survived the entire Purge; for example, Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi survived by going into exile on the remote planets of Dagobah and Tatooine.



# Section 2
Those who survived began to hide from the Empire and its Inquisitors.
Many hid behind the popular Outer Rim rings to avoid falling into the hands of the Empire or its servants.
Some of those who survived were Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and other Jedis such as Chief Librarian Jocasta Nu.
When most of those Jedi who were in hiding were found, the Inquisitors and Sith began to search for force-sensitive ones in order to revive the Sith armies as they were in the Old Republic.
One of those who became Inquisitors and went over to the dark side was the Grand Inquisitor, a former Temple Guard.
