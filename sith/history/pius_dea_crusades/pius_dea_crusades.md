# Overview
The Pius Dea Crusades were a sequence of conflicts that lasted from 11,962 to 10,966 BBY.
They took place in the Galaxy and happened during the Pius Dea Era.
The main reason the crusades happened was that according to Pius Dea’s beliefs, every alien species were to be eradicated from the Galaxy.

# History
The Pius Dea Crusades mainly happened because of the Goddess, an entity that ordered her followers to slaughter every rival alien sect.
Everyone who followed her orders would receive a reward from the Goddess.
Following the Goddess’ will, Pius Dea members engaged against the Hutt Space region from 11,962 to 11,920 BBY.
These four Crusades granted Pius Dea new alien territories: Delacrix, Nimban, Knewnn, and Toydaria.
After Pius Dea took over the Galactic Republic, their leader known as Contispex and his successors sought to purify the Galaxy by eliminating those who were not humans.
By 11,884 BBY, Pius Dea fought one of their most important Crusades, known as the Great Northern Crusade or the Seventh Pius Dea Crusade.
In this battle, the Pius Dea followers fought against Zabraks and the Ithorians and their home planets, being these Ithor for the Ithorians and Iridonia for the Zabraks.

During 11,820 BBY, a battle known as the Sixth Alsakan Conflict was happening between the planet of Coruscant against Alsakan.
The Pius Dea’s origins date back to Coruscant, so the alien species moved to Alsakan for protection.
After the Sixth Alsakan Conflict finished, Pius Dea targeted the Herglic Space region in a battle known as the Eleventh Pius Dea Crusade in 11,707 BBY.
After this event, Pius Dea attacked the Zarricines and Teirasans in the Twelfth Pius Dea Crusade in 11,660 BBY.



# The end of Pius Dea
The end of Pius Dea and their Crusades date back to the Battle of Uquine and the Seventh Alsakan Conflict, where the Jedi and the planet of Alsakan allied to eradicate the humancentric cult.
The Jedi allied with the Alsakani and Caamasi to make a schism inside of Pius Dea that would spread a secret heresy.
Those who left would be known as the Renunciates.
The Republic Navy Admiral Pers Pradeux was a Renunciate, and he planned to overthrow the Republic along with other Renunciates in 10,970 BBY, Prefsbelt IV.

Three years after this event, the Seventh Alsakan Conflict began and left Pius Dea with fewer members.
As well, the Bureau of Ships and Services made most of Pius Dea’s fleets go to hyperspace, leaving Pius Dea with almost no military assets.
The persecution of aliens ended in the Battle of Uquine, in 10,966 BBY.
In this battle, Pius Dea was defeated successfully as the cult along with their leader, Supreme Chancellor Contispex XIX, were captured and removed from their charges.
