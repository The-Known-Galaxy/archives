# Introduction

The Time of the Rot was a period of approximately nine hundred and sixty years of civil war between the various factions within the Lost Tribe of the Sith.
The Rot began in the year 3960 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin) on the planet of Kesh shortly after the death of the Grand Lord Lillia Venn during the Night of the Upside-Down Meteor.
The Night of the Upside-Down Meteor was a skirmish between a stranded Jedi and Lillia Venns troops.
Lillia Venn ultimately perished in this battle and caused an enormous power vacuum to form within the Lost Tribe.

# The Rot

The news of Lillia Venn’s death spread throughout the tribe like wildfire.
Many of Lillia Venn’s former rivals, Lords, and High Lords all attempted to become the new Grand Lord.
Eventually, one of Lillia’s former enemies managed to secure her place on the throne, Candra Kitai became the Grand Lord for a very short time.
During this time the only achievement she managed was the closure of the zoo in Tahv, the capital city of Keshtah Minor.
Kitai, being unable to unite the ever splintering factions of the tribe, was eventually overthrown and most likely killed.
After this, two main factions, the Red Faction and the Gold Faction, formed and vied for the throne.
It is unknown how long the Red and Gold Factions held together as much of the history during this time went undocumented or was destroyed in battles.
By 3000 BBY, the Red and Gold Factions had splintered into around 20 factions.

# Testament Day

Testament Day was the singular day in all of the Time of the Rot where fighting would cease and all the factions leaders would meet.
Testament Day was held in Tahv once every twenty-five years and all the leaders of the various factions would meet peacefully to hear a message from the founder of the tribe, Yaru Korsin.
In the year 3000 BBY, a few days before Testament Day, Iliana Merko, the leader of one of the splinter factions, the Sisters of Seelah, attempted to coerce Varner Hilts, the current historian of the tribe, into opening the Sith Holocron that contained Korsin’s message and altering it to favor the Sisters of Seelah.
Varner Hilts lied to Iliana, stating that the Holocron could only be opened on Testament Day.
The Sisters presence in Tahv attracted the attention of three other factions, Force 57, the Korsinite League, and the Golden Destiny.
The members of these factions ambushed the Sisters in the Circle Eternal, which was a sacred meeting place for the tribe.
Varner Hilts attempted to end the fighting by offering to read the founder's testament early, however, the Korsinite League opposed the reading of the Testament prior to Testament Day.
Hilt’s assistant, Jaye Vuhld, revealed that the calendar of Kesh was actually eight days behind the Galactic Standard Calendar.
This new information allowed for the Testament to legally be read early.
While the testament didn’t really do anything other than keep the factions from killing each other, Hilt discovered that Korsin’s message was actually recorded over a previous recording.
Hilt managed to uncover this recording which revealed that the founders of the tribe were actually slaves to the Red Sith and the Sith Empire.
This inglorious past discredited the widely believed theory that the founders were ancient conquerors.
In a vain attempt to cover up this terrible truth, Iliana destroyed the Holocron herself.

# The Great Crisis

Despite the attempts to cover up the truth of their past, the tribe's factions quickly found out the truth of their ancestors.
This news drove much of the tribe into a homicidal frenzy which resulted in many of Keshtah’s cities being burned to the ground and many, many, casualties from both warriors and civilians.
This crisis  threatened the entire continent of Keshtah Minor and its occupants.
While the tribe continued to riot and murder, Hilt, Jaye, and Iliana traveled to the long sealed Sith Temple of Kesh following the words spoken from the Holocron which mentioned secrets behind the throne.
After much difficulty finding the vaults that held the secrets mentioned, the trio discovered that the secrets were actually a map that depicted a much larger continent on Kesh, known as Keshtah Major or Alanciar.
Hilt quickly realized that this map and the idea of conquest could unite all the factions and bring an end to The Rot.
Meanwhile, the crisis had begun to end with the majority of the Sith aligning with the Golden Destiny Faction so they could destroy the Omen, which was the ship the founders had crash landed on Kesh in, and expunge the terrible history of their ancestors.
The Golden Destiny’s plan was to collapse the Sith Temple, which was directly above the Omen and would destroy it from above.
On their way to the Sith Temple, they encountered Hilt’s trio.
Golden Destiny engaged in a skirmish with Iliana which resulted in the death of Jaye before Hilt could reveal his new discovery and end the battle.
Hilts successfully managed to convince the factions of the tribe to cease the fighting in order to conquer Keshtah Major.
Hilts was subsequently elected as the new Grand Lord with Iliana becoming his Grand Consort and later the commander of the Tribes Military.
With the Tribe successfully united under a common goal and a new Grand Lord, the Rot had come to an end in the year 3000 BBY.

# The Legacy

Under Grand Lord Hilt’s leadership, the tribe quickly rebuilt Keshtah Minor and restored it to its previous glory.
This time period of rebuilding would be remembered for generations to come as the Hilts Restoration.
Hilts, taking the past mistakes into account, structured the order of the Tribe so that there would always be a successor to the Grand Lord so as to heavily reduce the possibility of a second Rot.
In a testament meant to rule the Tribe, Hilts outlined the new structure of order and outright banned open warfare.
Hilts also mandated that power would be earned and not inherited.
This caused conflict within the ruling families to diminish over time.
This testament led to the peace of the tribe for generations to come.
Even through the first challenge of annexing Keshtah Major, which was a militaristic society molded specifically to keep the Sith out.
In an invasion led by High Lord Bentado, the Sith managed to destroy the leaders of Keshtah Major and take the land for themselves.
