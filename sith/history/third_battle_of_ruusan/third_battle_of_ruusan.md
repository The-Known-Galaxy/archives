# Overview
The Third Battle of Ruusan was a conflict that occurred in 1001 BBY.
It is part of the last battles of the New Sith Wars, and the Ruusan Campaign.
It ended with a Jedi victory and is known as one of Jedi Lord Hoth’s biggest victories.

The Sith Forces were split during this battle because Sith Lord Kaan’s forces were taking the Bormea sector, and this gave Hoth and his units an advantage.
The Light side used one and two-man fighters instead of ships to evade the Sith Fleet.
The use of more fighters made it easier for the Jedi to overwhelm the Sith infantry, as they were superior and also had a stronger use of the Force.

Sith Lord Kopecz fled to the Bormea Sector to notify Sith Lord Skere Kaan about the defeat.
He and his forces instantly went to Ruusan, but it was too late, as the Light Side had beaten them.
