# Introduction |
The Xer Campaigns are a series of military campaigns launched and led by the pirate, Xer VIII.
He is a Tionese nobleman who became a pirate chief.
These campaigns happened during the Pre-Republic Era; specifically between 25,150 BBY and 25,130 BBY.
The outcome of these events allowed Xer to become King of Cron and conquer all of the Tion Cluster, located within the Outer Rim territories.

# Context  |
Thousands of years before the campaigns came to be; specifically during 27,000 BBY, human colonists arrived and settled on the planets within the Tion Cluster, which was back then ruled by the Rakata Infinite Empire; the first major galactic power before the Republic.
After the Rakatan Civil War was over, the Empire was expelled from the majority of its colonies and left its advanced technology to its slaves.
By the time it was 25,200 BBY; the year Xer was born, the humans who resided in the Tion Cluster had formed three states: The Kingdom of Cron, The Kingdom of Barseg, and the Livien League.
All three Empires rule specific areas of the Cluster, but Cron had the biggest territories out of the three.

Xer was born on the planet Argai, a planet belonging to the Kingdom of Cron.
Although he was born into nobility, he shifted to piracy–something commonly done in Argai–and later became a pirate chieftain.
To seize the attention of the Lord of Argai, he went out to conquer the planet Dravione and proclaimed himself the leader of the Kingdom of Argai.
Xer then decided to expand his kingdom further and began to move into the Ihala Route, where he managed to expand his kingdom into Panna within a decade.
Noticing the Kingdom of Argai’s rapidly increasing power, King Ferece of Cron summoned Xer to offer him the pirate-lord title in exchange for his fealty.
Xer took offense to the offer and began to perceive Ferece and his court as weak and therefore decided to take over the Kingdom of Cron.



# Xer's Conquests |
The first move Xer made for the conquest of Cron was to assemble at Panna, where he destroyed a Cronese fleet at Duinarbulon.
He then proceeded to conquer the planet Chandaar, which forced King Ferece to flee.
As the newly proclaimed King of Cron, Xer began taking noble heirs and warlords as hostages because he found them useful.
Those who were deemed otherwise had their entire families destroyed by Xer’s hand.
Within his time as King, Xer had a son named Xim, who quickly gained a fearful reputation within the Coronese Sweeps because of the massacre he did on Timber Palace of Pasmin and also eradicating the High Fane of Xo on Nuswatta, who then converted it into a theocracy to his father’s service.


Xer and his fleet managed to expand his kingdom into the entirety of the Coronese Sweeps, housing a destructive navy under his command.
He wanted to conquer beyond his territory and planned to target the Three Allied Kingdoms.
With the help of his alliance of Cadinth, Jaminere, and Barseg, Xer did a flank and later moved along the Cadinth Run, which resulted in conquering the three kingdoms and additional planets such as Arcan IV, Corlax 4, and Lianna.
Regardless of his recent victory, Xer went out and conquered regions beyond the Ihala Spiral, moving up the spiral from Algor, he managed to conquer the planets Caluula, Brigia, and Tion.
In the aftermath of his conquest, Xer and his army settled on Raxus Prime and began building royal palaces, and used its inhabitants as his concubines and retainers.
Raxus Prime then lost its name and came to be known as the Circlet of Tion.

During Xer’s conquests, one faction managed to successfully defy Xer’s kingdom: the Livien League.
They were a confederation built around the planets of Livien, Desvero, and Kanaver.
Xer attempted to conquer the faction while moving into them through Corlax and Barseg, but was unfortunately defeated by the League; therefore pausing his overall conquests.



# Aftermath |
Xer realized that he over-stretched himself after his defeat against the Livien League, which prompted the suspension of his conquests to rebuild and forge Cron into a more powerful Empire.
He managed to extend his kingdom’s hyperspace beacons along the Black Spiral and Cadinth Run and successfully created a bureaucracy.
Even though he managed to create a successful and powerful Empire, Xer was hungry for more territory and still wished to conquer the Livien League.
Fortunately, his son, later on, went out and managed to defeat the League and satisfied his father’s original goals.
