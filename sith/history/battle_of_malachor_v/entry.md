# Overview

The Battle of Malachor V was the final climactic battle of the Mandalorian Wars of 3964 BBY.
This left the planet of Malachor V so devastated it turned the planet into what’s best described as a graveyard world, especially after Meetra Surik sacrificed a big portion of the Republic and Jedi forces to destroy the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders.
The battle was so devastating to the Mandalorians they referred to it as Ani’la Akaan, the “Great Last Battle” in the language of Mando’a.

# History

After countless battles, Commander Revan had forced a final confrontation with the Mandalorians above the planet Malachor V in the year 3960 BBY.
Not only had he deployed a massive Republican fleet, but he also used a secret superweapon designed by an engineer called Bao-Dur, which was known as the “Mass Shadow Generator”.

The weapon was developed as a part of a trap that Revan had planned which he’d hoped would bring an end to the war.
Overseeing the weapon and commanding the fleet was Jedi General, and soon to be Exile, Meetra Surik who had taken part in the recent battle and campaign on the planet Dxun.
Revan then lured the Mandalorian fleet to Malachor V and a massive fleet battle ensued in the orbit of the planet.
Revan was enroute to the battle, but had been delayed outside of the system due to engaging a Mandalorian scouting party.

Afterwards, Revan eventually arrived to the planet and soon entered into the battle, however, he was late and the fleet of the Mandalorians weren’t anywhere near being defeated.
Yet, Revan was able to draw out the leader of the Mandalorians, Mandalore the Ultimate, into a direct confrontation with him and swiftly made work of him when he cut the Mandalore down with a single strike.

While that was happening, more Jedi, who at this time called themselves Revanchists and were still fighting in orbit, started to become affected by the dark power emitting from the planet below them and subsequently being affected by the Dark Side.

Though Jedi can resist the Dark Side, the many years of fighting had worn down the Revanchists’ ability to resist the temptation and thus, they were drawn to it.
This, however, enabled the Jedi and Revan to regain their vigor, pressing the fight to the Mandalorians, where they would stay for a bit in a stalemate until pushing the Mandalorian fleet back to Malachor V.

As the fighting started growing in intensity, General Meetra Surik had thought that the Mandalorians had fallen into their trap and that it was finally set to be sprung.
She commanded Bao-Dur, the creator of the Mass Shadow Generator, to activate the contraption.
But when it was activated, she watched in abstract horror as a significant portion of the fleets of both the Republic and the Mandalorians were drawn into the vortex that the Generator created, via gravity, and was strong enough to crack the planet's crust open and kill all who were aboard the ships.

Because of this, the once agricultural and lush world of Malachor V had been transformed into what was called a graveyard world.
The Generator had transformed the planet also into a cluster of rocks and planetoids that were only held together due to the gravitational anomalies of the Malachor System.
Not only did clusters of rocks orbit the now broken planet, but also broken and destroyed warships of the Republic and Mandalorians drifted along its orbit; some also say the surface of the planet is barren with only the echoes of thousands of dead Jedi, Republicans, and Mandalorians.

After the battle had come to a close, Revan then disarmed and disbanded the Mandalorian Clans, allowing them to scatter across the galaxy, specifically the Outer Rim Territories.
Devoid of both leadership and honor, some degenerated, though a select few returned to the Mandalore System while others, such as Canderous Ordo, became mercenaries and guns-for-hire.
Others turned to banditry and piracy.

After the victory at Malachor V and the defeat of the Mandalore, Revan and Malak were both hailed as heroes of the Republic, and soon after the battle, took their fleet and forces to the Unknown Regions with pretense on finding and defeating the remainder of the Mandalorian forces.
They did not return, however, and also did not send word on their whereabouts or status.
In time, the Republic feared they had been met with a terrible fate or lost in a tragic disaster, most likely caught in one of the many gravitational anomalies of the Unknown Regions, but in truth they were amassing their forces in preparations of conquering the Republic.

As for the Jedi General Meetra Surik, she couldn’t handle the backlash within the Force after the destruction of the planet and the deaths of many Republic, Jedi, and Mandalorian fighters and as such, she cut her connections off with the Force.
The result of Malachor V wasn’t over though as it had created a Wound in the Force, which would go on to create Darth Nihilus.
