# Introduction

The Cremlevian War was an intra-species war fought between Warmaster Yo’gand and Warmaster Steng.
It was fought by the Yuuzhan Vong and destroyed the Yuuzhan Vong galaxy.
It left mass destruction within the galaxy even after its end in 15,000 BBY.
The species eventually left their ruined galaxy after destroying their own between war and resource hunting.
It got so bad they weren't even able to use the force because their home planet wouldn't let them after dying out.

# Section 1

The Yuuzhan Vong were a very powerful race known for being warriors and force users.
They infamously hated machines and went on a crusade taking over the Yuuzhan Vong galaxy while exterminating all droid races and other general life forms.
But with so much of the galaxy in their hands, other factions of the Yuuzhan Vong galaxy began to clash, destroying many planets in the process.
One of the planets they destroyed was their home planet, Yuuzhan'tar.
The exact way it was destroyed is unknown, but due to the symbiotic relationship they had to the planet, when it was destroyed they lost the ability to connect to the force and experienced great pain.

# Section 2

The end of the war came when Yo’gand dropped a moon on a planet Steng was allied with.
After the war, the race once again united as one and became the Supreme Overlord of the Yuuzhan Von.
After the war, Yo’gand was seen as a war hero and was greatly acknowledged for dropping the moon on Steng.
Unfortunately, not long after the war, the Yuuzhan Vong became extremely violent, especially towards each other.
It got so bad that Yo’gand had to strip them of the ability to even
touch the force.
Yo’gands solution to this problem was to use pain and worship it, as well as find ways to “heal” through it.

# Section 3

A member of the Intendant caste, Shimrra Jamaane, slowly started to realize his foolishness and began trying to find another way to unite his race.
He refused to go to war and engage in fights with other races and focused on finding a way to rally the Yuuzhan Vong.
He was eventually killed and overthrown in a coup, which began yet another all-out war, starting the Yuuzhang Vong war.
