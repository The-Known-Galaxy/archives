# Overview

The destruction of Tund was caused by Rokur Gepta, a member of the Croke species.
He lived on this planet, and hosted a Toong dispora that inhabited the planet after the destruction of Toong'L.
This planet has a relatively small history, with its first known inhabitants being a colony of purebred Sith.
Gepta used his and his colony's power to infiltrate a group of force users on the planet.
After successfully doing this and using the colony to learn all he could, he set out an atomic superweapon that destroyed the planet and turned it into a toxic wasteland.

Before its destruction, Tund was an extremely wildlife-rich planet with over 18 million different species, sentient and non sentient, residing on it.
It had a very diverse wildlife, containing species like Toong and pureblood Sith.
Due to the emperor's sheer interest in the Sorcerers of this planet, he called on Gepta to act as a Scrivinir for the possessor of the ancient Sith secrets of these Sorcerers.
He was paid with an Imperial Cruiser and used it to contain his hold over this isolated area of the galaxy.
Gepta would end up being killed by Lando Calrissian, where he was killed while meditating and using his shields to defend the planet.
