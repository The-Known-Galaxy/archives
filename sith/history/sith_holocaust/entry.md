# Overview

The Sith Holocaust, otherwise known as the Post-Great Hyperspace War Counterinvasion was a mass genocide carried out by the Galactic Republic on all Sith-occupied worlds.
Following the Great Hyperspace War, the first major conflict between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, unrest and paranoia became rampant within the Republic.
Despite the Sith losing the war and being unable to commit any other offensive attacks against Republic space, many within the Republic did not believe this was enough.
They believed the Sith were due for a punishment and also feared that the Sith would in fact retaliate.
Thus, acting chancellor of the Galactic Republic Pultimo ordered an all-out genocide on all Sith-occupied space, though primarily worlds within Stygian Caldera.
The genocides resulted in rampant disease, mass ritual suicides, infighting amongst Sith Purebloods, destruction of sacred Sith sites and artifacts and a mass, the benning of the Sith exodus and many more.
The Sith Holocaust is considered the most evil deed ever-commited by the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic.
