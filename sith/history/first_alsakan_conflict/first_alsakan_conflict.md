# Overview
The First Alsakan Conflict was the first of seventeen engagements between Alsakan and Coruscant, planets that fought over the expansion region for colonization and natural resources.
This battle between both planets lasted 318 years as it started on 17,018 BBY and ended on 16,700 BBY.

# Development
In 17,000 BBY, Alsakan tried to block the Grand Companies along with the worlds of the Perlemian Trade Route by moving south and claiming resource-rich systems.
Few noble families from the Core Worlds joined Alsakan in their mission.
The Grand Companies, unhappy about this, sent Duros freighters to fight the Alsakani Warships.
The first conflict would be ended by the Bureau of Ships and Services after they threatened to withhold access to the system of hyperspace beacons.
