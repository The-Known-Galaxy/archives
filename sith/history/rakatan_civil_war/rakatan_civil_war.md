# Overview

The Rakatan Civil War was a feud of violent conflicts that arose within the Infinite Empire, subsequently tearing their empire to collapse.
During the high point of its conflict, the Rakata would be infected by a mysterious plague that would cause the death of hundreds upon thousands of Rakatans, whilst leaving the survivors insensitive to the Force.

# Collapse and Legacy

After centuries of galactic hegemony, the Infinite Empire would be shaken by successive internal conflicts as a result of corruption by the darkness and influence of their superweapon, the Star Forge.
The Empire boiled into complete civil war, as hundreds of thousands of Rakatans perished to infighting.
The worst was yet to come; A mysterious plague formed by one of the slave races under the Rakata caused a purge of the Rakatans, decimating their majority and leaving them unable to use the Force; forever insensitive to it.
This provoked weakness from the slave worlds and species, resulting in an open revolt that would liberate themselves and formally end the Infinite Empire as the preeminent hegemon in the galaxy.

Years later, they were replaced promptly by the Galactic Republic after its formation, as many of the worlds under the Empire would be placed under their sway.

The Rakatans on the other hand fled to their homeworld of Lehon and remained in primitive obscurity.
