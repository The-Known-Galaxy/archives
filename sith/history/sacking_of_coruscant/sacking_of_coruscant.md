# Overview
The Sacking of Coruscant was also known as the Battle of Coruscant.
It was one of the greatest victories in the history of the Sith, and one of the most devastating defeats in the history of the Jedi and Republic.

# Section One
The battle took place near the end of the Great Galactic War between the Sith Empire and Galactic Republic.
This Sith Empire arose from the unknown regions after the destruction of the previous Sith faction several centuries earlier.
During the war, the Republic was slowly overwhelmed over the course of the several decades where the war took place, while the Sith Empire only continued to grow more powerful.
The plan to invade Coruscant began when the Sith offered a sudden and surprising offer of peace to the Republic.



# Section Two
The Republic cautiously accepted the offer, and delegations from both sides arrived on Alderaan to begin negotiations.
Not long after, a Mandalorian who was employed by the Sith Empire arrived on Coruscant and disabled the planet’s defense grid.
Due to this, Darth Malgus was able to enter the Jedi Temple, followed by a captured Republic shuttle filled with 50 Sith warriors.
The Sith quickly dispatched the Jedi guarding the temple, and an Imperial fleet under the command of Lord Darth Angral arrived at the planet, and relentlessly bombarded the surface.
They laid waste to much of Coruscant, with the Jedi Temple collapsing.
Once they had finished bombarding the surface, Imperial troopers were deployed to clear out any remaining Republic defenses, and Darth Angral assassinated the Supreme Chancellor.



# Section Three
By the aftermath of the battle, six members of the Jedi High Council had been killed, the Jedi Temple reduced to rubble, and the Supreme Chancellor had been assassinated.
Darth Angral assumed control over the provisional government of Coruscant as Imperial forces settled in for an occupation.
All communications into and out of Coruscant had been halted during the battle, and they remained closed during the occupation.
All travel was heavily restricted, and the planet was blockaded.
There was little to no defense remaining for surviving members of the Republic senate, and civilians.
This led to many kidnappings, assassinations, lootings, and executions.
The Republic was forced to sign the treaty of Coruscant, leading to a period of weakness, and the prolonging of the reconstruction of Coruscant.
