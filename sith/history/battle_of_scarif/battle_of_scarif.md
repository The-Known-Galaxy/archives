# Overview

The Battle of Scarif was a battle of chance and hope for the rebel alliance during the year 0 BBY the time when the Sith was at its most precious, The battle would consist of a disparate group of rebels, led by Sergeant Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor the rebels were to enter an imperial planet holding the database and plans of the new superweapon the Death Star, capable of destroying entire planets in seconds.
The rebels would of course become desperate to defeat the Sith Weapon so Jyn and Cassian lead a team of troopers into the beaches of the planet attempting to distract all the soldiers for Jyn and Cassian to freely walk right in with disguises and take the plans without any of the Sithâ€™s troops interfering.
As a result of this plan possibly ending in severe losses, the two leaders were gonna attempt to walk right in first and see how far they can get in with no distraction, of course, the imperials masses would have been too much for them to attempt with no distraction so the rebels outside the Scarif base set off a chain of explosions to sound the alarms on the imperial base and leaving the stormtroopers to all focus on defeating the threat outside blinded by the three rebels inside the very walls ready to get the plans without many problems.
during the explosion the empire sent AT-ATs on the field to quickly wipe out the rebels as the entrance had not had much cover for the stormtroopers, leading to way too many deaths right at the start of the ambush, the AT-ATs eliminated a decent amount of rebels fighters however the Rebels then brought their fleet in the soon to be done victory.
the Rebels fought valiantly but our empire proved to be too much for the fleet, our plans were taken but the rebels were forced to flee unable to fight to the end unless they wanted to lose the plans of course, the Dark Lord of the Sith of the time, Darth Vader was sent to pursue the rebel ship that survived and claim the stolen plans that would become a problem for our empire if they were to fall in the rebels hands.
