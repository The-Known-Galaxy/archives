# Overview

During the third year of the Clone Wars, the Supreme Chancellor (Sheev Palpatine) had revealed to Anakin Skywalker his true Sith Lord identity.
Despite Anakin’s mixed feelings towards this, the young Jedi Knight had fallen victim to The Sith Lords deception and thus convinced him to fall to the dark side of the force.
After Anakin had informed Mace Windu of the Chancellor's treachery, the Jedi Master along with some other Jedi had encountered him in his office hoping to strike him down and end his rule over the republic for good.
Mace Windu had bested the Sith Lord in combat Leaving him severely scarred from his own force lightning and helpless.
Unexpectedly, Anakin had entered the office in an attempt to convince the Jedi Master to stay his blade and instead allow him to stand trial.
Mace Windu on the other hand was ready to strike down the Sith Lord and hastily Anakin had stepped in igniting his saber and cutting off the Jedi Master's hand allowing the soon to be Emperor to finish him off brutally.
Shaken and unsure of what he had done Anakin had kneeled to the Sith Lord, officially becoming his apprentice and stepping into the dark side of the Force.
Darth Sidious had set his new apprentice a task on the planet of Mustafar to slaughter the remaining members of the Confederacy Of Independent Systems.

Upon reaching the Archives Master Yoda would discover a recording of the Fallen Jedi Knight slaughtering the younglings.
Obi-Wan, filled with disbelief, would seek out Padme in hopes of finding answers to Anakin's whereabouts.

Obi-Wan could not believe what he witnessed and fully convinced of Anakin's treason he ignited his saber provoking the Sith to strike back.

The young Apprentice had notified Darth Sidious of his mission's success, however, allowing him to be saved by the newly announced Emperor.
Anakin would be given a new suit which would help him to breathe and help with his newly created long term health problems.
Applying the suit would now be complete thus marking the day that Darth Vader would be born.
