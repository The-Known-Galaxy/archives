# Section 1

The Galactic Empire had many names, as it was also known as the “First Galactic Empire”, The Evil Galactic Empire, the Old Empire, etc.
The Galactic Empire was a dictatorship that would replace the Galactic Republic roughly at the end of the Clone Wars.
The reign of the Galactic Empire was very harsh on the military personnel and expansion without diplomacy.
The Emperor conquered most of the star systems in the galaxy before the Galactic Empire ended, as the Empire rose to power on a promise–and that promise was to bring order to the galaxy.

# Section 2

The Galactic Empire was first just a concept for the Sith to get power back over the galaxy and destroy the Jedi Order, where Chancellor Palpatine secretly created clones for this exact purpose.
The Jedi had no clue of the Clone army’s soon-to-be betrayal, as they had served them faithfully for over 10 years.
All the chancellor needed now was someone to carry out the plan and take charge of the clones.
Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker was perfect for the task, where to convince him, Palpatine gave Anakin fake illusions of Anakin’s secret wife Padme, dying and told him he could help him heal her.
Instead of turning Palpatine to the Jedi High Council, he assisted Palpatine in defeating one of the members, Mace Windu, by slicing off his hand, so that he could finally be killed.

# Section 3

Order 66 was a command implemented by Darth Tyranusto all of the clones reminding them that it was time to eliminate all the Jedi.
In the aftermath of this event, Anakin Skywalker and the 501st stormed the Jedi temple and exterminated the majority of the Jedi, although there were some to survive like Yoda, Obi-Wan, Grogu, Cal Kestis, and more.
This allowed the Sith to gain full control over the Republic, as none were opposing them or none had the power to do anything.
