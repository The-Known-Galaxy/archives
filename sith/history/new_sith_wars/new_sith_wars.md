# Overview

The New Sith Wars, also known as Jedi-Sith War, War of the Fittest, The Betrayal, and The Curse of Qalydon, was the name given to the period of one-hundred years of battles between the Jedi and the Sith.
The war started in 2000 BBY in the Fourth Great Schism and ended in 1000 BBY in the Seventh Battle of Ruusan.
During these wars, the Sith rose to the point of almost overwhelming the Republic after the Battle of Mizra.

# The Conflict

After the last Alsakan Conflict, a former Jedi Master known as Phanius turned to the Dark Side as Darth Ruin because of his dark thoughts, being the first Dark Lord of the Sith after almost one thousand years.
The New Sith Wars started with the Fourth Great Schism when Darth Ruin reformed the New Sith Empire by uniting Sith clans and converting Jedi Knights to the Dark Side.
Although Darth Ruin was killed later by his teammates, the Republic was in danger; the Sith were back.
The Republic was defeated and overwhelmed in most of the wars that occurred, but the Sith units were fewer and fewer due to the Sith Civil War, making it easier for the Jedi.
After the Sith Civil War, a new Sith group would emerge, and it was the Brotherhood of Darkness, created by former Jedi Master, Sith Lord Skere Kaan.

After the Brotherhood of Darkness was created in 1010 BBY, a new conflict known as the Light and Darkness war started, where Kaan’s forces fought Hoth and Farfalla’s army in a decade of wars.
During the last decade of the New Sith Wars, the Brotherhood of Darkness was inferior to the Army of Light and as a last recourse in their last engagement, Skere Kaan used the Thought Bomb to eradicate every Jedi and Sith in its radius.

After such an explosion, the Jedi thought they had won the Seventh and last battle of Ruusan, but they were wrong, as only one Sith survived; Darth Bane.
With the presumed destruction of the Sith, Darth Bane reformed the Sith with the new Rule of Two, taking Darth Zannah as his apprentice.
