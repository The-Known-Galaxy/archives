# Introduction |
The Force Wars was a ten-year series of battles, war, and general conflict that transpired on the planet Tython among the light and dark side users of The Force.
The Je’daii Order represented the light side of the wars whilst its Bogan followers represented the Dark Side.
It is because of these conflicting ideals between the two main philosophies of the Force, that the Force Wars broke out.
This event would be remembered in history as the initial rise of conflict between the two different primary philosophies of the Force.

# Prelude |
In 28,000 BBY, a horrific Force Vision overcame the mind of Je’daii Master Daegen Lok and his fellow Je'daii Ranger Hawk Ryo.
In this unfortunate vision, an individual with a single red eye and a legion of fighters, empowered by the Dark Side carrying Forcesabers rampaged through the world of Ska Gora, reigning havoc wherever they went.
This vision caused Lok to fall to the Dark Side out of fear.
As a result, his presence was made in front of the Je’daii Council to explain the potential future consequences he had deduced from his vision alone; however, the Je’daii Council believed his fear to be directly caused by the effects of the Dark Side, therefore the council sent him to the Bogan moon to put his mind at balance once more.
Daegen Lok lived on Bogan for 7 years in exile, carrying the image of himself also wielding a large Forcesaber.
Daegen’s exile served to provide him the reasoning to make the first steps in starting a war between Bogan and Ashla followers.



# The Conflict |
Daegen spent his time on Bogan building up followers that would become accustomed to his own beliefs.
The Je’daii Council slowly came to realize the threat that this new faction presented; hence, a conflict between Ashla and Bogan followers made its beginning.
Both sides engaged in various clashes with metal swords enhanced by the power of the Force in hopes to eliminate each other to establish a dominant philosophy of the Force and eliminate anything else that may have opposed said philosophies.
Daegen’s Bogan followers also made use of the Forcesabers which were fairly similar to the ones seen within his vision.



# The Start of the Jedi and Aftermath |
Both sides showed no intentions of giving up, the Je’daii on the other hand chose to reorganize into the Jedi Order in 25,783 BBY; a faction dedicated to peacekeeping and unification of force-sensitives through the Light Side of the Force.
This was done to prevent a conflict like the Force Wars from ever arising again by disregarding the Dark Side of the Force entirely.
Rajivari was one of the first High Councilors of this newer Order and served the main role in its foundation.
Like Daegen, Rajivari eventually built a following that became enlightened by his principles and traditions.
These philosophies of his conflicted with the very Jedi Order that he played a role in creating; therefore, he made it his intention to destroy the Jedi Order.
The former Jedi Master’s plans did not turn out to be successful, as he was destroyed when Jedi forces invaded his fortress and killed him along with everything else within that was related to his legacy.


	Even after Rajivari’s death, Bogan followers still continued to ravage through Tython worlds.
An astronomical disaster eventually occurred that deemed the planet of Tython inhabitable, thus, the Bogan philosophers made their way off of Tython space.
The Jedi made attempts to tail these individuals; however, the Light Side adherent faction chose to settle on Ossus in 25.053 BBY, nearly 730 years later after the rise of the Force Wars.
