# Introduction |

The Darth Desolous Skirmishes were a series of minor attacks against the Jedi Order led by the Pau’an Darth Desolous.
These attacks occurred sometime after 3522 BBY but prior to the New Sith Wars.
They have no certified start date or end date due to the overall insignificance of the skirmishes compared to other galactic conflicts.

# Prelude |

The event which sparked this conflict was the expulsion of Desolous from the Jedi Order.
This was done after Desolous began to enthrall himself in the teachings of the Sith and consequently fell to the Dark Side.
Upon his expulsion, Desolous swore revenge against the whole Jedi Order and thus crowned himself Darth Desolous and the Dark Lord of the Sith.

To fuel his revenge, Desolous turned to his people, the Pau’ans.
With their assistance, he raised an army that would be personally trained by him in his personal form of martial arts.
This form utilized a cortosis shield in one hand and a melee weapon in the other.
This style of combat was highly effective at countering the primary weapon of the Jedi; the Lightsaber.

# The Skirmishes |

With his army assembled Darth Desolous began to enact his plan.
This involved the strategic ambushing and assassination of Jedi Knights all across the galaxy.
The martial art of the Pau’ans proved highly effective, allowing groups of Pau’ans to overwhelm and murder Jedi on a multitude of planets, their cortosis shields proving insurmountable to the unprepared Jedi.
This targeted hit and run strategy led to an overwhelming number of victories for Darth Desolous, in all nearly 2,000 Jedi were snuffed out by his forces.

# Decisive Strike |

Desolous would not bask in his victories for long as despite the Jedi’s losses and their lack of planning for the conflict they were quick to adapt.
This adaptation came in the form of exploiting Desolous’ biggest weakness; his hubris.
With every victory, Desolous grew more prideful and as such bolder.
This would be his downfall when Desolous deployed his forces and himself on the planet of Yaga Minor to confront a small group of Jedi Knights.

As soon as he had deployed his forces on the planet the trap was sprung.
The Jedi emerged their fleet from hyperspace and cut off all avenues of escape from the planet.
From there it was only a matter of time until Desolous and all of his men were cut down by the Jedi and their fleet.

It was alleged however that it took the entire Jedi Council to finish off Desolous, yet this statement was merely a ramble from the Simulacrum which held the visage of Desolous, yet to be disproven.
