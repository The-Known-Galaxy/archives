# Overview

The former Jedi and Dark Lord of the Sith, Exar Kun, left behind a somewhat intangible legacy; nothing was direct, yet he influenced both ancient and current Sith in their ways of training as well as being Sith.
A legendary figure with a sizable influence on Korriban and Yavin 4, Exar Kun can be proclaimed one of the greats in the history of the Sith.

# Description

Exar Kun’s rejection of the Jedi and ascension to the Dark Side of the Force and, in time, the Dark Lord of the Sith, were monumental, causing ripples throughout the galaxy that are still felt to this day.
Having been turned to the Dark Side by the ancient Sith Lord Freedon Nadd, Exar Kun began his reign of terror and destruction.
The most notable of his legacies was the effect that the Great Sith War in 3996 BBY had on the galaxy.
Exar Kun was responsible for the deaths of millions, as well as the razing and pillaging of worlds such as Yavin 4 and Ossus.
Having forced the Jedi to abandon Ossus with a supernova threatening to destroy the planet, Exar Kun was able to raid the Great Jedi Temple and reclaim many ancient Sith artifacts.
Yavin 4, despite being razed, regrew its wildlife and forests back in a short amount of time, his legacy still remained; temples dedicated to Exar Kun still dotted the moon, and his influence remained long after his death, living mainly through the Massassi, whom he dominated and enslaved to his will, modifying and changing them into brutal, tribal beasts.
Similar to the legacy he left with the Massassi, Exar Kun’s work with Sith alchemy can still be found around the galaxy, such as with terentateks and Sith wyrms, with attempts to cull and remove the Sithspawn from planets such as Korriban and Kashyyyk found futile, resulting in the deaths of many Jedi in what was dubbed the ‘Great Hunt’.
Another of Exar Kun’s legacies was that of fighting; he created the first double-bladed lightsaber, now seen in use all around the galaxy.
He first revealed it when fighting his old master, Vodo-Siosk-Baas, when attempting to turn him to the Dark Side failed.
He killed Baas, and the double-bladed lightsaber was baptized in blood.
One of the most notable users of the double-bladed lightsaber is Darth Maul, who copied Exar Kun’s saber as closely as he could.
One of the most important aspects of his legacy was Korriban; while Exar Kun did not directly create the Sith Academy on Korriban, his disciples did, and tablets were found with his name on them in the academy, dedicated to remembering him.
The Sith Academy, while going in and out of use, had been used by the Sith for thousands of years, and remained a stronghold for the Sith Empire, hosting the Dark Council and archeological digs in the Valley of the Dark Lords.
Exar Kun’s legacy was impressive; he proved to the galaxy that Sith were the dominant force.
