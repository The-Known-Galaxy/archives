# Overview
The battle of Jakku was known as the final stand of the Galactic Empire against the New Republic.

# Section 1
The planet Jakku can be located on the inner rim and is formerly a desert planet with the remains of the battle still present.
The Galactic Empire had their final attempt at defeating the New Republic via directing all their currently serving forces to the desert planet.
This action was planned by the newly indoctrinated Counselor Gallius Rax, though he had his own agenda during this, the destruction of the Empire.
He had intended to retreat to an unknown region with the hopes of rebuilding and starting a brand new Empire after the damages he caused were done.



# Section 2
On the planet's surface, the Republic’s forces had been attacking the Empire for months.
Rax had feared the longevity of the Empire and himself would finally have fallen if the war continued like this.
As a result, He planned a failed attempt to destroy the planet with everyone on it.
Though his attempt was planned out to the fullest, his life was cut short by the Grand Admiral, Rae Sloane'.
Sloane, a Naval Officer of the Empire, objected to the methods Rax had adapted and as such decided to join forces with a former rebel, Brentin Lore Wexley.
When working together they had both accomplished their goal of hunting down and ultimately killing Rex.



# Section 3
Though Rax had died, the battle of Jakku had not ended, continuing for months until the New Republic had crushed the Galactic Empire.
During the aftermath of the battle, the Galactic Concordance had been made, officially announcing the end of the Rebellion and the Galactic Empire.
