# Overview

The Battle of Phaseera was a battle between the Brotherhood of Darkness and the Galactic Republic during the New Sith Wars in 1002 BBY.
It sparked when the Brotherhood couldn't help but notice the great potential and wonder of Phaseera in the manufacturing business.
Unfortunately for them, the Republic had already claimed it.
The brotherhood originally sent out a wave of Walkers to take care of a Republic outpost, until one of the soldiers under the name of Dessel knocked out the Commander in an act of mutiny.
He led the walkers to victory despite being blinded by a flash canister.
Due to this heroic act, word of Dessel spread and he was sent to a Sith Academy where he would eventually become the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Bane.

The Sith launched their first invasion by hiding in a jungle cave outside of Phaseera’s capital city.
Gloom walkers were sent out first to mobilize the capital, however, when asked to do so the pilots of the walkers refused, claiming it was a suicide mission.
They ended up waiting until nightfall, with Dessel as the lead.
The Walkers split into groups right before an assault from the Republic, the Walkers did end up achieving victory with 46 Republic soldiers dead and nine Walkers down.

After the battle, Dessel was brought to trial for mutiny but was not charged after word got out about his amazing ability as a leader.
This led Dessel to transfer over to the

Sith Academy on Korriban, where he would go on to become one of the most influential Darth’s in Sith history.
