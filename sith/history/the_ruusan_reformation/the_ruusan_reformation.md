# Introduction
The Ruusan Reformation was an event that would restructure the entire Galactic Republic following the New Sith Wars.
The purpose of the Ruusan Reformation was to take all power away from the Supreme Chancellor and give it to the Galactic Senate in an effort to demonstrate more democracy.

# Reformation
The reforms were enacted by the then-Chancellor Tarsus Valorum, where the reformation  would cause the Republic Measures & Standards Bureau to rest the year to zero to the year of the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, which would later be known as 1000 BBY by the Galactic Standard Calendar.

With the reformation, it seemed that the system of government didn’t change too drastically.
However, the Jedi Order underwent heavy adjustments.
The Jedi would take symbolic measures, largely to convince the Republic that they would not become a conquering army.
The Jedi would abandon their Battle Armor and would dissolve their Commander-in-Chief rank and other titles like “Jedi Lord”.
The Jedi would also dissolve all army, naval, and starfighter forces and place themselves under the watch of the Supreme Chancellor and the Judicial Department, which would effectively dissolve the military.


To lessen the chance of Sith resurgence, the Jedi Order would start training children from birth.
In addition, all Padawans would be centralized on Coruscant to prevent unsupervised Padawans from delving into forbidden Sith knowledge.

Politically, the reformation would affect the representation within the Senate to help reduce corruption and decentralize power away from the powerful Core world sectors that would hold the most representation within the Senate.
Chancellor Valorum would take the then-millions of sectors, and would reformulate them to an orderly 1,024 sectors.
With the reductions of sectors, Chancellor Valorum would grant each sector a Senator.
However, there would be a few exceptions made for more powerful core worlds to retain their representation.



# Conclusion
The Ruusan Reformation would put an end to the Republic Dark Age, where it would be considered the start of a Golden Age of the  Republic.
Eventually,Palpatine's declaration of a new order thus marked the transition from the Galactic Republic to the Galactic Empire.
Simultaneously, Darth Bane’s Sith Order would undergo its own reformation–thus organizing the Rule of Two.
