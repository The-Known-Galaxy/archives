# Overview

The Imperial Civil War was a war fought between the different rivals from different factions after the loss of the battle of Endor.

# Section 1

Immediately after the battle of Endor, Grand Vizier Sate Pestage took control of the Empire.
However, he lacked the ability to hold political power and the Force.
These were essentials that Vader and Palpatine had used to rule over the New Imperial Order.
However, the first one to declare independence and create his own domain was Admiral Blitzer Harrsk.
Others followed in his footsteps after his time.
Pestage was in power for six months before being kicked out by the Imperial Ruling Council.
However, their rule would soon be influenced and replaced by Ysanne, who would maintain order and fight back the warlords.
Attempts were made to overthrow her by the recently formed Central Committee of Grand Moffs.
Ysanne, losing her sanity, decided to breed the Krytos Virus which would kill aliens.
She released the virus on Coruscant and started the Bacta War.
At the end of the Bacta War, Ysanne was rumored to have died.
After some time went by, the remaining parts of the Empire started sharing a common enemy with the New Republic, which was the Warlord Zsinj.
He was killed in the Battle of Dathomir in an alliance between Admiral Rogriss and Han Solo.
The Empire kept getting pushed back by the New Republic up until the return of Grand Admiral Thrawn.
In a desperate last effort, the Grand Admiral gathered all his Imperial forces and managed to take back half of the galaxy for the New Imperial Order.
His campaign fell with his assassination and the second in command knowing he can’t do it on his own, forced a retreat.
The Republic immediately started using this as an opportunity to create a counter attack.
They allied themselves with the other warlords and began making progress, winning battle after battle.

# Section 2

The surviving warlords were inspired by what Grand Admiral Thrawn achieved in such a short amount of time and organized under the Imperial Ruling Council for a push against the Galactic Core.
The New Republic were defenseless against a gathered Empire and the Imperial Center on Coruscant was reconquered.
An Imperial Senate was formed to report back to the Emperor.
The Moffs, Grand Moffs and Governors all agreed to this if they were granted seats in the senate and that the amount of votes would depend on how many worlds you ruled.
The Councillors declined this offer to prevent power being taken away.

# Section 3

It all eventually came crashing down.
The Imperial Military wanted power and the Navy was separated from the Army.
They insisted a new supreme commander could be chosen, and afterwards a coup was attempted by the bureaucrats and the COMPNOR.
They knew that changes to the New Order would dissolve the Empire.
The Imperial Intelligence and the ISB launched assassinations against one another in response.
The Imperial factions on Coruscant soon broke out in an all out conflict, with three Sector Groups killing each other and a divided Imperial Army laying dead on the planet.
The chaos then proceeded to spread across newly conquered territories by the Empire, like the droid TIEs annihilating a dreadnought on Drearia.
The return of Palpatine would put an end to these conflicts and most returned to their loyal positions and rankings.
However, the warlords that had waged war fled for their lives as they knew the Emperor would not take their betrayal lightly.

# Section 4

The Emperor had transferred his spirit into a clone, regaining life.
He proceeded to rebuild the Empire and with 6 years at his disposal, he gained the strength to challenge the New Republic once more.
All his forces were now united and they went to war with the New Republic.
By launching devastating attacks from his capital Byss and his newly built superweapon, the Empire received a massive advantage, crippling the New Republic in the process.
The Imperial Ruling Council were reluctant to lose the control they had since the battle of Endor.
Sarvec Quest, who was the Emperor's hand, worked together with Carnor Jax, a royal guard officer with a dream to become a Sith Lord to overthrow the Emperor.
The plan was simple: Jax would join the Imperial Sovereign Protectors who were the Emperors guards.
With Quests aid, they eliminated rivals and remained the only force users left on the Council.
With the help of other Councilors, Quest managed to pay Palpatine's physician to tamper with the clone's genetics making Palpatine’s rebirth an impossible task.
Palpatine had not recognized any threat from the Council, and when the time was right, they would make their move.
During the Battle of Onderon during the Galactic Civil War, the council saw themselves as the rulers of the Empire and guardians of the principles.
It ended in them creating a rebellion against the Emperor.

# Section 5

The Empire fell into conflict and chaos after the collapse of the new empire Palpatine had rebuilt.
High ranks retreated to the Deep Core with their forces desperate to control what they had left.
Admiral Daala hoped to reunite the forces to create the most powerful Empire and took the responsibility of reuniting the split factions.
Her success was extremely limited, and after being forced into service to fight among themselves, she couldn't take it anymore.
She met with the admiral Treuten Teradocs fleet command member and then the vice admiral Gilad Pellaeon to begin negotiation between the thirteen most powerful warlords on the Tsoss Beacon.
Daala realized hours into the negotiations that the warlords had no intent to work together.
In her rage and frustration, she killed them all by poisoning the room and made herself the Supreme Commander and Imperial Head of State, even though that was never her intent.
The Empire was forced to wage war with the New Republic yet again despite not having built a fully stable government, but it was this event that shaped the government.
Daala issued a regroup of the Imperial Navy and placed Pellaeon and Colonel Ivan Cronus in charge of the Star Destroyers.
Daala believed her the biggest obstacle laid in the Jedi Academy on Yavin IV.
She launched an attack with Pallaeon’s division attacking as a vanguard for her mothership.
The battle ended in a disaster for the Empire and many lives were lost.
Daala was successfully rescued but she was forced to resign from her position of Commander and Imperial Head.
Her final act was the promotion of Pallaeon after his stunning performances and with that, the Imperial Civil War ended.
