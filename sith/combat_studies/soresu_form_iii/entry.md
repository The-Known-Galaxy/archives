# Overview

Soresu also known as Form III  or The Resilience Form or as others say, the Way of The Mynock.
Soresu is the third of the seven forms which were recognised by the Jedi Council throughout the course of the Clone Wars.
Overall, Soresu was built for a more defensive style of fighting in battle.
Soresu, an improvement of the first form Shii-Cho, was made for training against blaster shots.
The Way of The Mynock was based on tight bladework and precise dodges to supply maximum defensive coverageand reducing vulnerability to ranged weapons.
Eventually Soresu went beyond this basic origin and came to be considered the ultimate expression of  a non-aggressive form.
Similar to Makashi, Soresu counted on the economy of motion and energy efficiency, holding up constant blade movement, to build up momentum and minimize energy wasting.
The Resilience Form was strongly based on defensive movements until the opponent began making mistakes due to frustration or fatigue before taking advantage of errors and countering them.
Regardless of its effectiveness, Soresu was heavily criticized because it didn’t have many offensive capabilities, as it was mostly effective for survival rather than victory.

# Section 1

Soresu’s opening stance, the practitioner held the blade back in a one-handed grip, angled forwards with the blade’s arm held parallel and the other hand held up in a challenge and the dominant foot was positioned back.
This stance had much in common with the stance of the form named Ataru.
Against individual shooters, Form III practitioners were encouraged to apply the “deflecting slash”.
The duelist was able to advance and cover the distance before the attacker could fire another shot, by using this maneuver to deflect an enemy projectile and transfer the momentum into a slashing attack at a nearby target.
Soresu also had an ability to redirect the shot back at the opponent but this move was more commonly used by Shien practitioners.

# Section 2

Soresu has been part of the seven forms for thousands of years but Meetra Surik was one of the early practitioners of this form..
During her rehabilitation Meetra’s tutor, Kreia, also knew Soresu.
When the time of the New Sith Wars arrived, the Sith Blademaster Kas’im had already mastered Form III and six other forms as well.
Almost a millennium later, Form III was mastered by Jedi Battlemaster Cin Drallig who taught others its use.
Grand Master Yoda was also a practitioner of this form, and has mastered it over the years.
He achieved mastery over all of the lightsaber forms, techniques and their stances.
He was very skilled against blaster-wielding opponents while using Ataru proved ineffective against such opponents.
Swordmaster Mace Windu was also a practitioner of Soresu and also a practitioner of all of the other forms, stances and techniques like Yoda but he doesn’t display as much usage of them like Yoda does.
In fact, during the Clone Wars, Soresu was the most used and studied form of all.
Count Dooku continued to have a remarkable command of Soresu, enough to instruct Grievous and his IG-100 MagnaGuards in its ways.
