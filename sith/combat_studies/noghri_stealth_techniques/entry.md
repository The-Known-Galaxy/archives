# Overview

The Noghri were a primitive, humanoid race, famed in their roles as bodyguards and elite assassins to both Darth Vader and his daughter, Leia Organa.
Their society was centred around different clans and the central building of their clans community, commonly referred to as the dukha.
Given that they were clan based, conflict would often break out between different clans, and their prowess for combat made battles bloody and vicious.
The Noghri were much older than many civilizations within the galaxy, even the ancient Je’daii Order.
The Noghri, after meeting Darth Vader and killing his honour guard with little difficulty, vowed to serve him.
The same went for Leia Organa, whom they called “Mal’ary’ush”, which means Lady Vader in Honoghran, their native language.

# Description

The Noghri, despite their small stature and unarmed nature in some circumstances, were some of the galaxy's foremost fighters; revered enough to act as the personal guard of Leia Organa, as well as the personal assassins of Darth Vader.
They were unstoppable in battle, and were single minded once set a task.
The Noghri used their lack of height as an advantage, as it allowed them to slip past unbeknownst to others, hence their disposition towards assassinations.
They possessed sharp claws and fangs, allowing them to quickly and quietly take out enemies, and a powerful sense of smell, allowing them to track and hunt their prey effectively.
Even though they excelled at hand to hand combat they still used weapons such as the E-11 blaster.
Their noses were so sensitive that they could smell the bloodline of an individual, which Leia Organa used to her advantage, as the Noghri recognised her as the daughter of Darth Vader, to whom they had dedicated their lives and service years prior.
The Noghri were quick and agile, capable of using all four limbs to move, giving them an advantage in speed and mobility, and also had sharp eyes, allowing them to see threats and take in more information.
All this, combined with a mirth for killing and no emotion to spare for those killed, created the perfect weapon.
In order to turn them into an even greater group of assassins,Emperor Palpatine removed all knowledge of their existence from the galaxy; he scrubbed their homeworld, Honoghr, from the maps, and removed all information from archives across the galaxy.
Even once they had escaped from the malevolent grip of Palpatine and his Empire, the Noghri still kept themselves shrouded in secrecy, never leaving Leia Organa’s side unless sent on a mission, and even then they remained unknown to the galaxy.
The Noghri were, by all accounts, the perfect warriors, and could have been unstoppable if applied correctly.
