# Introduction

Each lightsaber form comes with its own start-up, also known as ready stances.
However, there were some that were standardized across all lightsaber combat.
All of the known ready stances were ready, defensive neutral, offensive neutral, and center of being.

# Section One

The first ready stance, ready, was most commonly used amongst the Jedi.
This stance has many similarities to the Ataru guard.
When the form was used the dominant foot was held back and the blade was held in a vertical parry position.
Next is defensive neutral, which has little to no differences from the prior ready stance.
The blade would still be held in a vertical parry position, but the user would keep their feet evenly spaced.
Offensive neutral is the next ready stance and it has some similarities to defensive neutral.
However, it differs from defensive neutral because the blade would be pointed directly at the enemy.
This stance was intended to reduce the time that the blade is visible.
The last of the ready stances was center of being, which was also used for meditation.
This stance was used by members of the Old Jedi Order and they utilized it by holding their saber horizontally and keeping the hilt just below their chin.
