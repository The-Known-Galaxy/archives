# Overview

Zeyd-Cloth was a dark-colored, non-glossy styled fabric that contained square, waffled-styled weave patterns.
This fabric was used since the beginning of the Galactic Empire, in which it was utilized for clothing such as robes, boots, tunics, gloves, and headgears.
Members of the Banite SIth would often utilize Zeyd-Cloth for robes, due to the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, also utilizing this fabric to mask his shriveled appearance in public.
Darth Sidious chose to wear this fabric due to his admiration for his former Master, Darth Plagueis, who also wore this fabric.
The Emperor's Inquisitors would also wear dark maroon robes of zeyd-cloth that were designed to invoke images of dark blood and ultimately symbolize that secretly, the Sith ruled the Galaxy, unbeknownst to most at the time.
