# Overview

The Thermal Detonator was a weapon used by many weapon wielders.
This included those in the military, bounty hunters, regular criminals, and paid mercenaries.
This weapon has been in use for an extremely long time, dating as far back as 4000 BBY.
This weapon was used by pressing the thumb trigger and placing it so that the wielder has time to place it and move before exploding.
Thermal Detonators were extremely common during the era of the Galactic Republic and became big after many people realized that the plasma grenade and other explosive-type weapons were growing outdated.
The explosion was as big as five to six meters but had a customizable blast radius.

# Section I

The thermal detonator's name is linked to the process by which the device explodes.
The shell of the explosive is made with thermite or axidite.
When detonated the bomb emitted a sudden shot of energy that caused the shell to explode through a fusion reaction.
This explosive was so powerful it could eradicate any material that did not produce any form of thermal energy.
These weapons have different usages depending on certain scenarios, this means that some of them cling on to walls and other platforms, while some couldn't be detonated in mid-air.
While they were slight changes, they could completely change a situation in which the weapon is used.
