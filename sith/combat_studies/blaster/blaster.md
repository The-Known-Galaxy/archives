# Overview
Blasters were heavily used during the Clone Wars (22-19 BBY).
They were used by clones, bounty hunters, etc.
They fired plasma which would melt through the enemy.
They also had a ‘stun’ setting used to stun high-value targets.
Blasters were made of “Dedlanite” the leading manufacturer of this weapon was “BlasTech Industries”.
If the blaster fired red bolts, it was typically used by sith and droids.
These blasters have cheaper gas in them.
The Republic and Resistance used blue bolts.
This was good for disabling machinery such as droids.
Green bolts were used by the “Umbarans”, yellow was used by the “Mandalorians”, and purple was used by the “Magna Guards”, the “Malevolence”, and Geonosian Star Fighters.
Cyan was used for training clones on Kamino.

# How they work
Blasters were powered by energy-rich gas, which would melt through enemies.
They used the same principles as laser weaponry.
When fired the gas would turn into a glowing beam of plasma.
The lower quality of gas, the more ineffective the blaster is.
At one point they tried to power the blaster with a Kyber Crystal, the same item that powers the lightsaber.
It turned into the Lightsaber rifle which wasn’t used.
