# Overview
The Lightsaber is the ancient weapon of a Sith.
Properly wielded, it is an extension of your body, a limb that requires no conscious thought to move or position.
If a Sith ever loses their  saber, they must feel as if they have suffered the pain of losing a limb.
The Lightsaber became one with the Sith Order’s traditions and values to spread chaos, fear and bring victory to their battles.

# Analysis
The Jedi also carry lightsabers.
They tried to uphold peace and justice in each corner of the galaxy.
Unfortunately, they managed to maintain peace and justice, despite the many conflicts with the Sith and the Fallen Jedi, also known as the Dark Jedi.
However, everything ended for the Jedi after Order 66, when the Republic clones started executing the Jedi one by one, after Lord Sidious ' command.
Jedi claim their lightsaber crystals through the deep caves of Ilum.
The Sith, however, have a superior alternative.
They cook raw elements in a brood furnace that causes the production of an artificial crystal; one that can generate an energy blade that bears a bright crimson light.



# Sith Developments and Usage
Because this artificial crystal is forged through meditation and bleeding to the Dark Side, it has the marks of your will.
The red blade is strong and can even break the blades of the Jedi.
Only the strong may survive, the weak are unimportant.
According to the Terdyn Holocron, the first plans for the double bladed lightsabers were Sith creations.
Most Dark Lords of the era prefered using the Sith Swords, rather than Lightsabers, despite the fact that the Sith were the first to develop Lightsaber technology.
