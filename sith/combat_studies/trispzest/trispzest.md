# Description
Trispzest was a lightsaber dueling technique developed by a Force-Sensitive named Kharys.
Kharys developed this fighting technique by adding Juyo, Form VII, and S’kytri aerial combat.
The combat form created by Khares relied on using Force Flight while performing lightsaber combat.
In S’kytric, Trispzest meant heart palpitation.
One of the users of Trispzest was Dark Jedi Maw, a Force Sensitive that did not have legs and moved by hovering above the ground with Force Flight.
One of the techniques that Maw used within Trispzest was his spin attack, which was very efficient against many opponents surrounding him.
Trispzest has one weak point, which is an opening below the user.
This disadvantage seriously injured Maw during his duel against Kyle Katarn on Ruusan.
