# Overview

Lightsaber Pikes were a style of lightsaber that appeared to resemble one of two different forms.
The first form resembled a spear, glaive, halberd, or something similar.
The handle was long and was made up of Phrik, an alloy that was lightsaber resistant and a primary choice for the material.
The lightsaber blade itself resided at the end of the handle and was much shorter and thinner than a normal single-bladed lightsaber.
This type of lightsaber was almost as long as the wielder and was perfect for keeping enemies away from the wielder at a distance.
Notable users of this weapon include the Knights of Zakuul from the Eternal Empire and the Dark Honor Guard of The Sith Order.
The second form of this lightsaber type shares the same function and seems identical in appearance to the double-bladed lightsaber; it displays another blade at the other end of the handle.
This pike followed the same combat styles of the double-bladed lightsaber but had long enough of a handle to be considered a lightsaber pike.
Prominent examples of this form of the pike were used by the Temple Guard of The Jedi Order.
