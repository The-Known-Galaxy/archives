# Description
The lightrifle was a regular light saber with a ripple for the hilt.
During the imperial age, one of these unique sabers was built by Ezra Bridger.
While the Jedi have no use for blasters, force-sensitives during the galactic era needed to conceal the fact that they could use the force, and could not rely on their lightsabers openly.
If someone customized their saber they added a second emitter that could shoot energy related to a blaster bolt.
Though it could not keep a shape due to a lack of parts.
Powerful up close the more airtime the laser had the weaker it would get.
These bolts were more meant to stun since they are not as strong as a regular lightsaber or even a regular blaster.
