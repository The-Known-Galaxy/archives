# Overview

The booma was a weapon on Naboo Used by the Gungan Army.
The booma was made up of a blue material found deep in Naboo's oceans.
If thrown hard enough this blue ball would turn into an explosive mass of destruction.
It worked very well against droids and other electronics due to its electric properties as an EMP you could say.
It could also burn biomaterial and would leave a trail of burning goo heated to the touch.
Boomas were made in very different sizes.
The small ones would act as hand grenades and the big ones would be put in a catapult and launched.
Before the invasion of Naboo, Gungans had known many years of peace so their weaponry wasn't the best so making this powerful bomb could take out many things at once making up for the lack of weaponry.
