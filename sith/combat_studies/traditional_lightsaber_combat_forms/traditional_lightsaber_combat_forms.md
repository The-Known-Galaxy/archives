# Introduction
The art of lightsaber combat did not only involve basic movements of one’s lightsaber in hopes that it would land a hit on their enemy.
It is for this reason that a multitude of lightsaber combat forms was developed to combat against specific enemies or adversaries depending on the situation present at hand.
There existed a total of seven combat forms, some of which had variations within yet still adopted the same principles of technique specific to the respective combat form.

# Form I: Shii-Cho
Shii-Cho, otherwise known as The Way of the Sarlacc and The Determination Form was the first and most basic out of the seven lightsaber forms.
Being the first style of lightsaber technique, Shii-Cho consisted of rather basic movement and strikes.
This ancient form established the foundation for the basic concepts of attack, defense, and target body zones which is what the first form revolved around.



Given its ancient nature, the first form was developed as a result of the evolution from metal swords to revolutionary lightsaber development.
The first lightsabers relied on many other pieces of technology that greatly restricted mobility, rendering them useless in combat and more so for display.
With the development of lightsaber technology, freedom to adopt more mobility was increased and allowed lightsabers to be applied in combat leading to the creation of a real beneficial style of combat.
Many aspects of technique with metal swords remained, with the addition of newer skill finding its way into the combat form.
Its alternative names, “The Way of the Sarlacc” and the “Determination Form” emerged from the simple yet tenacious nature of this lightsaber combat form.
Given its basic concept, the development of Shii-Cho did not address lightsaber to lightsaber combat thus deeming it extremely weak against the other forms that would later be developed as a result of the flaws in Shii-Cho due to the emergence of more and more lightsaber to lightsaber battles, one of these newer forms being known as Makashi.
Shii-Cho remained a common practice of lightsaber combat for millennia, being adopted generation after generation.




Plenty of the movements entailed execution of horizontal and vertical maneuvering to allow for leeway into simple yet deadly diagonal strikes to target strike zones.
The target strike zones were the head, right arm/side, left arm/side, back, left leg, and right leg.
Standard principles of Shii-Cho stressed the benefit of obtaining victory without directly causing harm.
It was because of this, that the Way of the Sarlacc utilized the sun djem technique, an attack solely meant to destroy an adversaries weapon or disarm them entirely without causing injury or harm in any fashion.
Other forms of offense for Shii-Cho consisted of wide sweeping motions useful against many enemies as well as a basic parallel slash.


Even in the face of simplicity, the Determination Form was not rendered entirely useless due to its less complicated style, providing a basic set of skills that would be usable for eternity as well as offering an option for starters.
Many younglings within the Jedi Order were first taught the principles and style of the first lightsaber combat form so that they may understand the basic concepts of lightsaber techniques.
However, it was seen as difficult by many to adopt the technique that the first form stressed since it focused on disarmament rather than harm.
It’s because of this that under pressuring circumstances, it was difficult for some to hold back which sometimes resulted in sloppy and wild movements.
True masters of this form were able to not only use the first form in standard battle scenarios, but also lightsaber combat.
This is shown by many of its notable practitioners like Yoda, Cin Drallig, Meetra Surik, and even Darth Vader.
Some of these users incorporated the aspects of Shii-Cho into their style of combat to further advance their strategy on the battlefield and in lightsaber vs lightsaber combat but other forms such as Makashi later succeeded the first form and its faults.



# Form II: Makashi
Makashi, also recognized for its alternative names, the Way of the Ysalamiri and the Contention Form was the second lightsaber combat form of the 7 that existed.
This elegant fighting style was developed to stress lightsaber to lightsaber combat, something that the previous form, Shii-Cho failed to do, continuing to become more prevalent as lightsaber battles prevailed throughout generations.
Though similar to Shii-Cho, Makashi later became less useful with the introduction of newer threats such as blasters.
Despite its other downfalls, the contention form was still a very deadly form for lightsaber combat during its period of common usage.


The first form and its commonality with standard metal swords are what led to Makashi being developed to make up for the faults that Shii-Cho presented.
As lightsaber conflict increased during the time of Dark Jedi and other exiles, Makashi became the prominent form to directly counter the first form.
This style of lightsaber combat would excel during its time, but following the Hundred-Year Darkness that nearly wiped out the majority of the Dark Jedi, Makashi became a lot less common given the fact that there weren’t many other adversaries that could engage in lightsaber duels.
The events that transpired during the Great Hyperspace Wars and also the end of the Sith Wars also led to a decrease in the usage of this form.
With the addition of increasing blaster technology, the Jedi would begin to encounter far more enemies that utilized blasters and as a result, began developing greater methods of countering blaster users which is how the third form: Soresu was created.
Makashi would make its return during the New Sith Wars but with the conclusion of the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, practice of the second form vanished once more, and the Jedi in particular halted usage of it.
Makashi receives its alternative, “Way of the Ysalamiri” title from the Ysalamiri, a non-sentient creature applauded by the Jedi for its patience–a large aspect of the second form.






The practice of Makashi entailed balance and fluency of movement.
Practitioners usually tend to avoid the usage of acrobatics of any sort and instead rely on decent footwork and fluency of each attack to ensure proper defense.
The neutral stand called for the user to hold the lightsaber in their strong, dominant hand facing down at their side or directly at their enemy.
Users also held the hilt with their thumbs facing down to allow leeway for more precise and accurate movement of the blade.
The grip on the hilt was tight, enough to keep a decent grip but not so much so that it disrupts the fluency of each movement.
Makashi embraced two marks of content; Sun Djem and Shiak.
Sun Djem when used in the second form differed from the first form in the sense that the duelist targeted the weapon to destroy it, sometimes even harming the enemy in the process.
Shiak was a simple stabbing maneuver that complimented the additional jabs and footwork of Makashi.
This lightsaber combat form consisted of two special techniques, the “contentious opportunity” which was focused around waiting for an opening in the enemy before striking, and the “Makashi Riposte”, a maneuver to influence the angle of an adversary’s strike before continuing with a counter-attack.


The second form did not come without any weakness as already implied by its duelist skill sets.
Blaster fire was a huge counter to Makashi considering the style was developed to solely go head to head with other lightsaber users.
Not only that, the majority of its practitioners struggled against multiple enemies, fairing a lot better against single opponents; however, those who possessed a true mastery of Makashi found ways around disadvantages of multiple enemy engagement such as Count Dooku, a Sith Lord most notable for his usage of Makashi.
The most devastating weakness of users who practiced this fluent style of lightsaber combat was their incapability to generate any real strength, specifically kinetic energy through each swing.
Those utilizing lightsaber forms that required immense strength or power could easily overpower a Makashi user.
Usage of this form continued to decrease with the introduction of grander blaster technology which allowed for the foundation to be set to create a newer and more defensive form known as Form III: Soresu.



# Form III: Soresu
Soresu, also acknowledged as the Way of the Mynock and the Resilience Form was the third lightsaber combat form approach out of the known seven.
The third form emerged during the rise and increasing usage of blaster technology.
As the Dark Jedi and other lightsaber users began to vanish from the galaxy, the Jedi felt that there was no longer a need for Makashi to stay in use but instead for a newer form to be devised to combat blaster enemies.
Similar to the Mynock, a non-sentient species that the form was named in respect of, Soresu focused on evasion, compacted blade technique, as well as precise dodges to use defense to its fullest potential.
The strong defense of Soresu was vital in ensuring survival and outlasting of the enemy so a user may take advantage of the flaws that showcase themselves as a result of their fatigue.


The resilience form was crafted by the Jedi as a result of the trend of blaster technology that began to arise following the disappearance of lightsaber enemies.
Due to its extreme defense and ideology of perfect endurance, it is without question why it’s known as the resilience form.
Soresu’s other alternative name, the Way of the Mynock, was founded by the Jedi after their encounters with the non-sentient species known as the Mynock which the Jedi commended for their evasive skill and thus named Soresu after this swift creature.
The third form was quite useful to the Jedi during their various encounters with blaster-wielding enemies and in time, would become a symbol of Jedi philosophy for its non-aggressive nature.
Similar to many of the other forms, Soresu also saw quite a few weaknesses because of its lack of offense.
This later was corrected with the creation of other forms such as Form IV: Ataru and Form V: Shien.
Despite its ups and downs, usage of Soresu prevailed for thousands of years and especially was not forgotten by the Jedi.


As implied by its alternate titles, Soresu stressed endurance and defense.
In relation to Makashi, the third form practiced basic discipline regarding fluency in motion and energy preservation.
The opening stance demanded that the user holds the hilt parallel and angled forward with the dominant hand holding the lightsaber back.
The strong foot was positioned in the back as well, the other pointing forward.
Yet another stance involved similar footwork but instead, the user gripped the hilt with two hands for better regulation of vertical maneuvers.
When in the face of single opponents, Soresu duelist utilized the deflecting slash.
This technique was vital for closing the distance by deflecting the shot yet still allowing for advancement towards the enemy before they could fire another.
With proper proficiency, this move also allowed the user to deflect a blaster bolt back at their enemy.
Multiple enemies still posed a threat and to combat this, form three practitioners made use of the “circle of shelter,” a skill that let users enter a shifting meditation.
This meditation allowed duelists to perceive the position of the threats as well as the required movements to avoid blaster bolts and deflect them.
In a sense, the user could see into the future so that they may adopt excellent defense.
The resilient style of Soresu made it perfect for prolonged encounters since energy consumption was not a trend for its users.
Practitioners often outlasted their opponent, holding back and waiting for them to become fatigued until they may retaliate with their own attacks.



Weaknesses still existed in the third form as it does with all of the forms.
Considering that Soresu was dependent on an entirely defensive concept, it was quite clear that decent offense was hard to enact.
Attempting to wear down the enemy and prolong the battle also came with the risk of the user getting fatigued if they happened to face too much pressure from precise and aggressive assault.
Those that possessed a mastery over Soresu such as Obi-Wan Kenobi had extreme focus and often left nearly zero room for injury against blaster and even lightsaber enemies.
 To correct the flaws that existed within the third form, Form IV: Ataru alongside Form V: Shien was developed to employ a more aggressive nature in lightsaber combat whilst still maintaining the basic principles of techniques.



# Form IV: Ataru
Ataru, also known as the Way of the Hawk Bat and the Aggression Form was the fourth style out of the seven combat forms.
This form made itself known to address the faults of Soresu and was fairly common amongst the Jedi.
This aggressive form involved swift yet powerful strikes from various angles with the addition of flips, leaps, spins, and other acrobatics assisted with the Force.
The aggression established within the fourth allowed its users to pressure their enemy while also staying mobile and performing a series of strong attacks.


The Way of the Hawk-Bat came into the light during the Mandalorian Wars when Soresu proved to be far too defensive.
As a result, Ataru was crafted so that lightsaber duelists could tackle a more aggressive approach to single enemies to overwhelm them with a fast series of attacks.
The Jedi, in particular, named this form after yet another non-sentient species known as the hawk-bat.
In admiration of the hawk-bats' vicious, quick, yet powerful strikes in predatory settings, Ataru was named the Way of the Hawk-bat.
Similar to Soresu, Ataru remained an active style of combat throughout history, preserved for generations.
Eventually, weaknesses were seen within Ataru leading to further developments of other combat forms.

Deemed as the Aggression Form, form four users were quite adept in forms of offense and aggressive assault upon their enemies.
Practitioners of Ataru held the lightsaber vertically at either side of their body with a two-handed grip.
Complementary to the form’s alternative name, the “hawk-bat swoop” was a technique used with Ataru that involved sweeping motions to apply pressure with immense power as to not allow the adversary time to react.
The “saber swarm” technique was yet another move utilized by Ataru practitioners that involved a series of short and quick strikes at the enemy so recovery between each strike was not disturbed.
Usage of the Force to enhance the quality of acrobatics was also a common technique with Ataru.
In some cases, the force-enhanced acrobatics allowed a user to tap into force valor, an ability that further advanced one’s accuracy and speed behind each of their movements allowing oneself to bypass physical hindrance.
Anyone desiring to practice this lightsaber combat form had to bypass limitations to their physical performance by incorporating running, spinning, jumping, increasing speed, as well as the accuracy of their strikes by also using the force valor.
This allowed for a user to hit their enemy in an abundance of different directions to prevent them from retaliating.
All of these abilities and skills applied to Ataru worked well against single opponents as opposed to multiple enemies.
Though, this style of combat still came with many other weaknesses.


Ataru was not ideal for multiple enemy engagements, which left the user quite vulnerable to attacks from others as a result of their aggressive and vicious acrobatics.
Tight spaces that restricted movement in any fashion rendered Ataru quite weak regardless of the enemy.
Jedi and Sith who demonstrated extreme prowess in form IV easily overcame these faults such as Jedi Master Yoda who had complete mastery over Ataru and was indeed able to face multiple enemies at once not just because of his small size, but because of his abilities such as force valor that he applied to further enhance his movement.
Overall, Ataru remained a favorable form among the Jedi and even the Sith across all generations to come but there still prevailed other options for lightsaber combat for those that liked a more balanced approach such as Form V: Shien/Djem So which offered two variations.



# Form V: Shien/Djem So
Shien and Djem So, also notoriously known as the Way of the Krayt Dragon and the Perseverance Form was the fifth approach to lightsaber combat, the first development of a style consisting of two variations.
This hybrid combat style emerged when Soresu users felt as if the defensive style of form III demanded too much defense and that it prolonged battles for far too long since it was essentially a waiting game to land a counter-attack.
Form V had two styles of combat, Shien and Djem So.
Shien put more focus towards countering blaster users while its other variant, Djem So, was developed for the purpose of lightsaber combat.
Both variants of Form V involved using the enemy's attack against them in some manner, which is why both styles exist within the same form.

Both Shien and Djem So were developed by form III masters following the Great Sith Wars who felt that the tradeoff of offense for defense in Soresu deemed the form unbalanced thus making it less reliable.
As a result, Soresu practitioners combined the aggressive aspects of Makashi with the fluent defense of Soresu to create both variations of Form V.
Considering Form V intricated the use of physical power and strength, it received its title of Way of the Krayt Dragon from the non-sentient species known as the Krayt Dragon which the Jedi admired the power behind the predatory nature of this dragon, therefore, naming Form V in honor of the beast.
Just like the other forms accepted by the Jedi, Shien and Djem So continued to be used after its ancient era of prevalence, even past the Clone Wars.


Shien was quite common among the Jedi of the Old Republic.
This variation of form V was pronounced for its counter to enemy blaster fire all while still maintaining the proper offense to conduct powerful attacks in retaliation; usually excelling against multiple enemies.
Shien’s neutral stance involved the user holding the hilt with a two-handed grip above their head, pointing the blade vertically, and positioned behind them.
To allow for power behind each leading strike, the dominant leg was positioned back.
There were other alternatives to Shien stances such as the reverse-grip in which the user held the lightsaber hilt in a backward fashion, making room for more powerful and long sweeping strikes to eliminate multiple enemies at the same time.
The commonly used techniques with Shien were the Barrier of Blades and Shien Deflection.
The Barrier of Blades provided great protection from blaster fire incoming from all directions whilst also being able to redirect some of the incoming fire back at the enemy.
Shien deflection was another technique that involved redirecting blaster fire, but instead of remaining stationary or slowly advancing while deflecting, the user was able to leap and redirect the fire at the same time.
Shien still had its fair share of flaws, such as its ineffectiveness in the face of single enemies.


The alternate variant of Form V, Djem So, was more so designed for lightsaber combat as opposed to combating blaster-wielding foes.
Soresu masters had a much larger influence in the creation of Djem So, feeling that the dominant defensive style of form III was not reliable in lightsaber combat.
The neutral stance for Djem So entailed the user to hold the lightsaber hilt with a two-handed grip above their head, pointing downwards at a forty-five-degree angle.
Djem So users utilized different parries for the defense to create an opening in their enemy, staying in control of the fight and following up with their own attacks after defending from a blow.
Upon guarding against an attack from their adversary, a Djem So practitioner brought down the force of an enemy’s attack against them.
Brute strength and immense power was a key factor in utilizing Djem So.
The assault upon another enemy had to be continued throughout the battle with the usage of force-enhanced movements and power attacks.
Quite a few maneuvers presented themselves with the emergence of this aggressive form such as the “Falling Avalanche”, an overhand swing using great power to collapse on the enemy, and the “Fluid Riposte”, a move that allowed for fluency from a parry into a strike also with great power.
Just like Shien, Djem So also had flaws such as the lack of mobility due to the immense power and physical strength required to make decent use of this variant.



# Form VI: Niman
Niman, also noted as the Way of the Rancor, the Moderation Form, and the Diplomat’s Form was the sixth lightsaber combat form employed by many out of the seven lightsaber combat forms.
This form was rather unique in discovery in the sense that it was not the Jedi that devised it, rather an unpopular group known as the Royale Machetero of the Kashi Mer Dynasty.
The focus of Niman was to establish a balanced form, combining many aspects of the previous forms of lightsaber combat to unify them all into one generalized style of lightsaber combat.
Force-based attacks were also a part of form VI’s style to make up for the deficiency of specific proficiency.



Form VI was first practiced by the Royale Machertero, an elite guard force of the Kash Mer.
This rather balanced form received its most notable name, Niman, from the Kashi inhabitants who named it after the double triumvirate of their gods which is why this form was also known as Form IV.
After the Jedi discovered this form, they went on to make small alterations to adapt more to their philosophy.
The Jedi went on to provide yet another name for this simple yet reliable form known as the Way of the Rancor.
As implied, this form was named after the creatures known as Rancors, likely due to its balanced predatory nature.
It’s no surprise that Jedi Consulars in particular used Niman, as their devotion to diplomacy and the study of the Force served them well in their usage of Form IV.
Throughout history, the Jedi favored Niman during their various conflicts with the Sith because of the balance it offered in both offense and defense.
Eventually, the Diplomat’s Form grew to be a commonality for lightsaber combat training within the Jedi Order.
Following the Great Jedi Purge and the emergence of the New Jedi Order under the leadership of Luke Skywalker, form VI was replaced quite swiftly by other techniques in lightsaber combat.
Some Sith still chose to practice this form for the generations to come, but with enough time, Niman was forgotten by many.


Being dubbed the Moderation Form, Niman users possessed not the greatest attributes of offense and defense, but not the worst either, rather a perfect balance.
This was because form IV implemented different aspects of the previous lightsaber combat forms except for Makashi to create a rather vigilant and reliable form.
Niman had quite a variety of stances, the first being a wide stance with the feet being evenly spaced.
The lightsaber held away from the body in a one-handed grip.
The blade would be pointed vertically while the non-dominant hand was positioned across the chest.
A second stance showcased the blade pointed outwards in a two-handed grip yet still quite close to the body.
The dominant foot would position in the front.
Yet another stance of Niman featured the lightsaber held back at waist level with a low two-handed grip also close to the body.
Usability and reliability of Niman entirely depended on the user's creativity and quick-witted thinking in combat.
To make up for the relaxed state of mind through each maneuver, different force powers were incorporated into the use of Niman such as force pushes and pulls with the addition of lightsaber attacks that worked simultaneously with these telekinetic abilities.
To further enforce this, two main skills were used with Niman, the “draw closer” and the “pushing slash.” Draw closer pulled an enemy into the path of the user’s lightsaber, while the quite opposite “pushing slash” pushed an enemy backward with a force push after landing a blow.
Just like the other lightsaber forms, Niman still prevailed with an abundance of different faults.



Due to the practical style of Niman, standard executants of this form struggled heavily against Makashi.
Form VI may have been a decent fallback form but presented no general specialization to provide a clear advantage in battle which is why quite a few grew disfavor for its practicality.
Those who possessed a great mastery over Niman such as Sith Blademaster Kas’im didn’t find many methods to overcome these weaknesses and usually resorted to a different form that would grant them a clear edge in an aspect of lightsaber combat.



# Form VII: Juyo/Vaapad
Juyo, also known as the Way of the Vornskr and the Ferocity Form, was the seventh and most deadly form of the seven lightsaber combat forms.
Form VII was also another form that consisted of two variants, Vaapad being developed millennia after Juyo.
Practices of this voracious form were often banned within the Jedi Order since it heavily relied on emotional influence, sometimes bringing its users closer and closer to the Dark Side.




Juyo was also dubbed the Way of the Vornskr in honor of the non-sentient beasts that were known for their vicious, deadly, and ferocious behavior as a predator.
Vaapad, the other variant was later discovered during the age of the Galactic Republic by a Jedi Master known as Mace Windu who named this variant after the non-sentient creature due to its method of approach that involved quick and deadly attacks to overpower the opponent.
Only records of Mace Windu’s discovery exists, but it is speculated by many that the principles of Vaapad may have been adopted by many other ancient individuals before Mace Windu but there is no evidence to support this claim.
Precisely because of the fact that form VII utilized emotions behind each of the strikes, it was banned among the Jedi.
Jedi that happened to practice it usually fell to the Dark Side and joined the Sith in their conquest for power over the galaxy.
Likewise, Juyo in particular became more used by the Sith than the Jedi throughout the different generations.



The first variant, Juyo, consisted of chaotic and unpredictable attacks, making it perfect for a heavy offense.
The neutral stance showcased a one-handed grip on the hilt with the lightsaber blade wielded on a horizontal angle over the head but pointed down.
Similar to Makashi, Juyo was also decent for one on one encounters, being able to easily destroy nearly any enemy that dare test one’s prowess in Juyo.
This alternate style of form VII required more strength and energy distribution behind each strike than Form V due to Juyo’s adaptation to emotional influence and focus.
Despite the difficulties in controlling and using Juyo, practitioners that were capable of using the form properly like Darth Maul, Darth Sidious, and Darth Bane became known as deadly foes for their prowess in Juyo.
A primary skill employed in Juyo was “Assured Strike,” a technique that allowed the user to trade off power for the assurance of landing a strike.
“Vornskr’s Ferocity” was yet another technique used with Juyo that entailed aggressive, unpredictable, and ferocious attacks against the opponent.
Due to the erratic and aggressive actions of Juyo, it left its users weak against multiple enemies and did not fare well against those with decent mastery in the Force usage; however, this didn’t stop the practice of Juyo even during time periods where it would be illogical to use.



Vaapad, the second variant, displayed more internal thought that stepped in between the boundaries of the Dark Side, demanding that the user showcase enjoyment and satisfaction of the fight.
Vaapad practitioners allowed for the assault of their enemies to prevail so that they may accept the darkness within their enemy to take advantage of them.
Force power was not easily contained when using Vaapad, as there was a persistent flow of emotional influence and freedom of Force power.
The attacks from Vaapad appeared so fast that it seemed as if the user was using multiple lightsabers at once, making it difficult for the enemy to track at first glance.
One of the common skills applied with Vaapad was the “Swift Flank,” a technique in which the user leaped or performed swift dashes around the enemy to land a strike.
Another primary technique was “Tempered Aggression,” which allowed one to fully utilize the ferocity of Vaapad but still wield the proper control over their aggression so that they prevent themselves from falling to the Dark Side, a rather common risk among those that utilized Vaapad.
True masters were able to overcome the weakness of potentially turning to the Dark Side such as Mace Windu who was credited for the foundation of Vaapad.
Knowledge regarding Vaapad remained preserved in holocrons for the next generations following the Great Jedi Purge and ended up in the hands of the New Jedi Order but was never taught or used by any of its members.
