# Overview
Disruptor weapons were a type of vicious and notoriously dangerous ranged energy weapons, with widespread use outlawed by numerous governments including the Republic and the Galactic Empire.
Their effectiveness on targets, particularly organisms, made them popular among the dubious individuals of the criminal underworld and bounty hunters alike, especially Mandalorians.
The main function of disruptor weapons were generally to disintegrate anything it hit atom by atom, which meant either a slow and painful death or an instantaneous one.
Although effective against organisms, disruptor weaponry was also potent against physical structures like the hull of a starship.
