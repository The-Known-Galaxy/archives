# Overview

The Electro Whip or Shock Wip had a medal grip which had metal wires 4 meters long.
When activated via the button the generated battery in the whip would send electricity through the metal wire.
People who wielded this electrified weapon usually wrapped their enemy in before activating it.
The whip could kill someone with nothing but the smallest contact with the electrified metal wires.
This is the first model of the whip but newer ones have retractable metal wires.
A bodyguard that was hired by Senator Bezz Drexx owned the Shock whip and used it in a battle against Padme.
The Mistryl Shadow Guards also used the weapon.
Darth Maleval also used the shock whip alongside a lightsaber.
You could buy this weapon for roughly around 1,200 credits.
The purpose of this tool was not only for combat but for torture as well.
