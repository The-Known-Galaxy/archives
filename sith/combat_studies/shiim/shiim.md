# Overview
Amongst those who are practitioners of lightsaber combat, Shiim refers to a maiming wound or inflicted injury done by a quick, minute strike.
It is usually unconsciously or desperately done in order to main the opponent or even to taunt an inferior foe.
It can be relatively lethal when used to immobilize or gain an advantage.

# Notable Instances
Shiim was not a form nor a way of combat with a lightsaber but rather an effect of the blade.
This was seen plenty of times throughout recorded lightsaber duels and battles.
Prominent examples of these are the following: 

Jedi Knight Johun Othone successfully maims Darth Bane on Tython with a Shiim strike, gaping a wound in his orbalisk armor that would expose his wrist.
This, however, only enrages Darth Bane further.


Count Dooku would hit two Shiim strikes upon Obi-Wan Kenobi in their duel on Geonosis, elegantly slashing his left arm and leg.
