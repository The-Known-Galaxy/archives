# Introduction |
Cho Mai is the act of cutting off an opponent’s weapon hand.
It is a technique that demonstrates the user’s swordsman skills.
Practitioners of the Jedi Order considered this an honorable act when in combat because it allowed the user to win a duel without causing physical damage.
The Sith, on the other hand, considered Cho Mai as an act of mercy, given that they rather kill their opponents rather than let them live with one less limb.

# Application |
To perform Cho Mai against your opponent, the user simply drives their opponent’s blade aside before cutting their dominant wrist.
There are other alternative methods to perform Cho Mai, such as altering the angle of a parry, so the user catches their opponent’s wrist instead of their weapon or sliding your saber inside their guard to cut it off.
This combat skill is the perfect representation of observing possible advantages and executing them because once that vulnerability is present in the eyes of a Cho Mai user, they will use it for their dueling benefits.
