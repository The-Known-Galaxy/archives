# Overview
The Echani martial arts shared the name with the race that created it, the Echani, and was a form of unarmed combat that, traditionally, desired no armour, weaponry, or use of the Force, as it emphasised turning one's body into a weapon.
In Echani customs, combat was the only way to truly understand a person and their experiences.
Duels with the martial arts required honour and unspoken rules were in place.
It was a way to express thought and sentiment, and some have described it to be similar to art.
It had three tiers, Echani children usually started early and slowly progressed as their instructors shaped them into becoming refined practitioners.

Echani was documented to have been used multiple times in history.
Some historians claim that Meetra Surik, the Exile Jedi, sparred with the Handmaiden Sisters in Telosian Jedi Academy.
The Echani Handmaiden Sisters were masters of the combat form.
Echani was also notably employed by the forces of the Galactic Empire such as the Imperial Guard, Imperial Intelligence, and less skillfully by stormtroopers and Imperial officers who simply learnt the basics in standard training as part of the Imperial Academy’s standard training.
