The emitter would have a circular blade around the hilt and had the blade be able to move around the hilt in a circular motion at the press of a button.



# Advantages
The double-bladed spinning lightsaber had a deadly advantage for it had its spinning name for a very good reason, The blade had a circular emitter around the hilt allowing the saber to be able to spin like a propeller and use many dangerous strikes on their opponents if it connected.
The spinning mechanic could be used to fly as a way to get to a hard spot or escape should it be necessary.



# Disadvantages
The double-bladed spinning lightsaber was very good for combat but could be exploited very easily should an experienced Jedi take control of the duel.
For example, the hilt was a lot thicker than the average lightsaber so it could easily be disarmed or grabbed if not spinning.
This mechanism also could be seriously damaged should the emitter be damaged while it’s spinning, potentially resulting in the user's untimely death as it was very easy to cut and end their lives due to them becoming disarmed due to their blade being dis-ignited.
