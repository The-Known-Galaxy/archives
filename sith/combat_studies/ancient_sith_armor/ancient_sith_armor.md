# Overview
One of the oldest Sith armor models, this form of armor was mostly used by early Sith.

# Characteristics
The full suit consists of the following: a flat-topped, visorless helmet protects the wearer’s head.
Two square pauldrons cover the shoulders, while a ribcage-like chestplate covers the torso.
Lastly, a skirt of blade-shaped strips was worn around the waist.
The armor was mostly crimson in color, with a few golden details.
Many of them were present as relics in the tombs of the famous Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban, with a few Sith Lords choosing to be buried whilst wearing such armor.
Another original armor of this kind was present in Darth Tanaton’s private library.
