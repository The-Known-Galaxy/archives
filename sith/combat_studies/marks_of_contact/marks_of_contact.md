# Overview
A Lightsaber Combat usually ends when the opponent is disabled, dead, or forced to surrender.
Such results are achieved through the Marks of Contact.
The Marks Of Contact Should be applied with intent and with the objective of preserving life unless circumstances force you to deliver a killing blow.

# Marks
Shiim:
Shiim, one of the two fundamental marks, is a blow delivered with the edge of the blade.
It usually inflicts superficial wounds, but if you have any opening in battle you should be quick to seize it.

Shiak:
Shiak, the second fundamental Mark, pierces an opponent with the blade’s point.
Prefered for its precision, it is a Mark that indicates you are in control of the blade and the Force is in control of you.

Sun Djem:
Sun Djem, known from Form II, can disarm an opponent by destroying his weapon or forcing him to drop it.

Cho Mai:
Cho Mai is more direct.
It severs the weapon hand entirely, leaving your opponent alive, but unable to continue the fight and thus, a victorious/merciful conclusion to battle.

Cho Sun:
This Mark removes the entire weapon arm at a point above the elbow on most humanoids.
Not as precise as Cho Mai, it will nevertheless end a battle quickly.

Cho Mok:
It severs a different limb, such as a leg.
Cho Mok, maiming of this nature should be done only if an opening exists and you should not think you can otherwise win the fight.

Mou Kei:
Mou Kei is a forbidden variant, literally meaning “to dismember”.
It involves the act of cutting several limbs at once.
You should never need to use Mou Kei against a living being given the many alternatives.

Sai Cha:
Sai Cha is the act of cutting an enemy’s head from his shoulders.
This Mark Should not be used as the first solution, as there are eight more alternate Marks.
But when required a lightsaber can also kill.
If Shiak thrust through the heart cannot be done, this is the preferred method for fatality.

Sai Tok:
Slices the entire body into two halves.
This act is rightly considered barbaric and evidence of furious emotions of the dark side.
