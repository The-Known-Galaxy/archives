# Overview

Mou Kei was a finishing move in lightsaber combat where the user dismembered the opponent through circular motions with the lightsaber aimed at the major limbs.
This movement was exclusive to the Dark Side users because its purpose was to dismember the opponent.
Although Mou Keiâ€™s use was prohibited for the Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi performed this movement against Darth Vader in their duel in Mustafar.
