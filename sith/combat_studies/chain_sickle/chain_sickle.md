# Introduction
The chain-sickle is a melee weapon with a cylindrical handle that was mainly used by the nightsisters and nightbrothers on Dathomir.
The sickle had a cord that adorned a sharp blade at the end.
At a quarter of the length of the cord, there was a second grip for another hand to be used.
This allowed the wielder to be able to swing the chain-sickle with accuracy and force.
At the end of the cord, near the blade, were small studded spikes that aligned the area.
These spikes were able to inflict damage even if the target had evaded the initial blade strike.

# Section One
Jedi Master Thame Cerulian fought against three wielders of the chain-sickle on the planet of Filve.
He managed to survive, but just by the skin of his teeth.
Another instance of when this weapon was used was when Count Dooku betrayed Asajj Ventress.
Dooku had presumed that she was dead and because of that she decided to return to the Nightsisters of Dathomir, looking to seek revenge against her former Master.
Ventress then traveled to the nearby Nightbrother village in search of a warrior to send to Dooku in her stead.
She chose a group of Zabrak Nightbrothers and put them through a series of trials.
First, was the Test of Night, where Ventress wielded her weapon of choice, the chain-sickle and used the Force to conceal herself from sight.
She then used the weapon to lash them with strikes that would come from anywhere and kept doing so until she found her warrior.
Some time passed and the Jedi Council sent Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to Dathomir to investigate the death of two Jedi on Devaron.
The Jedi arrived at the village and they were confronted by a group of men, one of them wielding a chain-sickle that nearly cost Skywalker his head.
