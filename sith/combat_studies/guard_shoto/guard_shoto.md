# Introduction
Guard Shotos, which were more commonly known as lightsaber tonfas were lightsabers, which had an outward bit in the middle, where the user would grip them.
The name Shoto means short, so the weapons would be made from short-bladed lightsabers with a middle component extruding from a 90 degree angle to hold it from.
Even though one could hold it from either angle, most people would prefer to hold it perpendicularly.
Guard shotos were best used to block other lightsabers and were used by very agile and quick Force Sensitives.
These sabers would allow the user to block, jab, slash, and utilize many other useful techniques.
These weapons were pretty difficult to wield if one was not competent with lightsabers.
Most users would hold the blade outwards for attacking, switching to a backhanded grip for more defensive purposes.
Considering the blade was short and lacked range, it was pretty difficult to deliver significant blows or attacks .
These guard shotos were most commonly used with the form Shien, given that most of its users preferred the backhanded grip style during combat.

# Notable Users
There were not many Force Sensitives who used guard shotos, or lightsaber tonfas; however, there were a few named users such as Jedi Padawan Maris Brood who used dual guard shotos, with dark red blades.
She would use these weapons when she faced Starkiller, Darth Vader’s apprentice whom he was teaching without Palpatine's knowledge.
Besides Maris Brood, Sinya, a Twi’lek bodyguard who was part of the Black Sun crime syndicate also used a pair of guard shotos, which had deep purple blades.
