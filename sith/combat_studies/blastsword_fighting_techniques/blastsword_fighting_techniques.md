# Introduction

The blastswords were a melee weapon that were commonly favoured and used by the Adumari noblemen.
This weapon closely resembled any other traditional sword one may see.
However, it had one significant difference resulting in it to stand out among many others like it.
The end of the sword contained an energy outlet which would emit a blaster bolt upon activation.
Blastswords would come in variants to perform better for multiple situations.
This would include a polearm version used by perator guards.
The blastswords were held in high regard by several different Adumari duelists and were seen as great weapons for single handed combat paired commonly with short knives and daggers in the off-hand.

# Fighting metods

After several years, the blastswords would have their own fighting form in development that included lower lethality well-fitted for stunning rather than killing the enemy.
Although certain blows would be illegal, some fighters chose to ignore the rule and continue to use the weapon as they saw fit.
After the Adumari Civil War however, non-lethal blastsword methods would experience a huge rise in popularity, lethal blastsword fighting techniques on the other hand would begin to decline and most duels would follow this new trend.

# Functionality and appearance

Blastswords were fine and balanced weapons with the length of a human-male’s arm and allowed proficient-users to wield it one-handed.
The hilt of the blade containing a pommel of the blade was covered by a curved metal guard to protect the user’s hand.
The exotic design and function of the weapon forced its user to achieve high proficiency in order to wield the weapon properly without failure.
The tip of the sword was connected to a blaster mechanism that would be powered by a cell placed in the hilt.
When the mechanism activated (through a switch on the pommel) it would discharge an energy blast when in contact with a solid object.
The blaster end when activated would give off a humming noise alongside a glow of energy that left behind a colourful trail when mobile.

# Additional information

The blastswords price ranged from 600-1500 credits and weighed in at around 2.1kg with its blade approximately a meter in length.
The blastswords were melee weapons used primarily for close range combat and were used mainly by the Adumari.
These weapons saw their first introduction into the greater galaxy at around 13ABY and were located in various different Adumari nations.
