# Introduction

The protosaber is the first ever known design of the modern lightsaber.
It is also referred to as Archaic lightsabers.
Instead of these protosabers having a blade emitted from a Kyber Crystal within the lightsaber, these protosabers had an external power pack with limited operation time.
This meant that it was harder to continue duels for extended periods of time before a power pack would burn out and stop working.
The mobility of a user was restricted due to the long cable, which connected the weapon to the power supply located on their hip, back, or belt.
The thick cable would be connected on the bottom of the protosaber.
Its design eventually became obsolete due to improvements in technology and materials.
This new invention allowed more potent power cell technology which allowed users to replace the power packs, with even small ones that fitted within the hilt of the lightsaber instead of a big bulky bag.

# Limitations

Due to these protosabers being connected by a power cable one could not be as agile and mobile.
This also meant that the power pack would eventually surge out and stop working, if used for a prolonged time.
Another disadvantage was that if someone were to cut the cable connecting the power pack to the protosaber that the protosaber would cease to work, and they would have to replace it.

# History

Protosabers were used during the Hundred-Year Darkness and also the Great Hyperspace war by both Jedi and Sith.
During the battles, they clashed with weapons imbued with the Force, and other weapons, some made of Mandalorian iron which is also known as beskar.
As the galaxy evolved, the protosabers became a weapon of the past.
They found ways to create better weapons that didnâ€™t rely on these big power packs, but instead found a way in order to put power cells inside of the lightsaber, requiring no unneeded cables.
This also allowed the user to be more mobile, using these lightsaber with power cells inside of the hilts let a user dual wield, or even come to create a weapon that had two blades, connected to a long staff hilt.
