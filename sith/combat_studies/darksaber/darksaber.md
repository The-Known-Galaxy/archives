# Description

The Darksaber was an ancient version of a lightsaber and was a very unique weapon with a black flat blade made of plasma.
This powerful weapon was more connected to a regular sword and less like a lightsaber.
The blade was 1 meter long and the powerful plasma surrounded the black part of the powerful blade.
It had a black inside with a light surrounding and looking at it for too long would be very uncomfortable.

The hilt of the Darksaber was very thin and rectangular and was long enough that it could be held with 2 hands.
It had an angled crossguard and a guarded blade emitter.
When the saber was emitted by pressing the activation stud.
The sound when emitted was a high-pitch hum and when swung was a high-pitched whistle.
When the darksaber came in contact with a lightsaber or any other object the would screech and the clack part of the blade would crack.

The darksaber is a symbol of leadership and whoever owns it is a worthy opponent.
The only way to truly be able to own the Darksaber is to defeat the previous opponent in battle.
To wield the Darksaber you must have a clear mind cause having a clouded mind makes it heavy and hard to handle.
