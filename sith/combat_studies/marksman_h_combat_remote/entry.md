# Overview

The Marksman-H Combat Remote, also known as the Seeker Droid and Training Remote, was a remote control used in military training.
It was manufactured by Industrial Automaton and was equipped with a non-lethal blaster that deflected damage from its target, though the price of it was just 350 credits.
Fast-moving and unpredictable remote controls were commonly used by gunners to improve reaction time and aiming.
To avoid damage, the remote control was usually shot with a ray.
Many smugglers and bounty hunters have also used their remotes to perfect the quickdraw.
Most famously, Han Solo owned and practiced with his Marksman H model training remote control.
