# Overview
The lightsaber rifle was a type of rifle made to be worn in the ways of a lightsaber.
During the first year of the galactic empire, Jocasta Nu used one against Darth Vader and was a Jedi cultural weapon.
Once the saber was fully loaded into this advanced weapon it would have an overwhelming amount of powerful energy.
The weapon had 5 shots before it melted due to heat.
It also has a self-destruct which is so powerful it could blow a huge hole into the Jedi Temple.
After returning to the great Jedi Temple after the great purge, Nu used the rifle found in the archives against the Sith Lord Vader.
During the fight, it ran out of ammo and Nu tried to self-destruct it but Vader got to it first leaving a huge hole in the Jedi Temple.
