# Introduction

The double-bladed lightsaber, also known as the doublesaber, was another variation of a lightsaber crafted by Dark Lords in which there was a single hilt where two emitters would produce beams on both ends.
Most double-bladed lightsabers created featured two pommels combined together to enlarge the hilt rather than assembling this lightsaber with a single hilt.
The design was similar to that of a quarterstaff which many would use as practice before testing their skill with the real deal.

# Advantages/Disadvantages

The purpose behind having twin blades was to allow for a more swift offense without the user having to expend too much energy on movement.
Double blades also were beneficial defense mechanisms because of the area that two blades could cover at a time, making it much more convenient to deflect blaster bolts and other attacks.
In addition, Having two blades as a resource also made fighting enemies a lot less difficult.
In fact, having dual-blades created confusion for adversaries, because they did not just have to track one, but two blades at the same time during combat.
The usefulness of the saber throw technique could also be amplified with the use of a double-bladed saber, providing the user with nearly double the amount of kills.
Physical advantages were not the only ones provided as a result of handling a double-blade.
These lightsabers also made an enemy's focus difficult, as the adversary had to keep track of not one, but both blades at the same time during combat.

Whilst the double-bladed saber offered a wide variety of advantages in combat, it was not without weakness.
The hilt was a difficult target to defend given its larger size compared to a single blade, a multitude of users falling victim to the sun djem technique that aimed to disarm the enemy by destroying the weapon.
Usage of such a weapon required intense special training, wielding twin blades was no easy task.
Users often had a limited range of motion as to not harm themselves when holding the hilt resulting in their horizontal or diagonal neutral stance in combat.
The different maneuvers adopted by the double-bladed saber were quite hindered due to awkward movement or positions that had to be taken to pull off these techniques.
Plenty of practitioners were left open because of the rapid attacks and movements that had to be employed when using this weapon.
Considering all time towards practice, complicated movements, and other complications of the double-bladed saber, most Jedi and Sith opted for a single-bladed lightsaber instead.

# History

The first designs of the double-bladed lightsabers appeared in 4000 BBY, forged by the Dark Lords of the Old Sith Empire.
Just like many other forms of technology, this lightsaber variation's most prevalent first appearance emerged during the Great Sith Wars.
Exar Kun was one of the first notable users during this time period that forged his lightsaber into a double-blade with the knowledge he gained from a holocron that displayed the specifications to do so.
This weapon once wielded by Exar Kun would eventually find its way into the possession of the Jedi Council to act as an artifact that would be studied for generations to come.
