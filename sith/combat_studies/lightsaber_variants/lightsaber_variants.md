# Overview
It is rare for Adepts to construct nonstandard Lightsabers during their visionary experiences on Korriban.
Often, a variant design doesn’t emerge until much later, after years of experience spent analyzing one’s own fighting style and evaluating deficiencies caused by that first effort.

# Variants
Curved-hilt Lightsaber:
The curved-hilt Lightsaber is perhaps the least radical of all variants.
Its extended handle accommodates a slight bend seldom exceeding thirty degrees.
This style is common among practitioners of Form II lightsaber combat, who prefer its balanced weight and precise handling for saber-to-saber dueling.

Shoto:
The Shoto is a short saber with a blade extending perhaps a half-meter.
The Shoto is often wielded in a Jedi’s off hand as a second blade.
The guard shoto is carried by means of a perpendicular handle, allowing for spins that put an opponent off balance but put oneself at risk.

Lightclub:
The Lightclub is a giant-sized saber, with a massive handle and a thick blade.
Lightclub are often built by Houks or other Jedi of unusually large size.

Dual-phase Lightsaber:
The dual-phase lightsaber uses focusing controls to shift between twin crystals, allowing a normal-sized blade to suddenly become twice as long.
This is useful only for surprise attacks and I have not found it practical for running saber cadences.

Dual-Balanced Lightsaber:
A familiar image from the last Sith War, the dual-balanced lightsaber is known as a Sith weapon, but there is nothing inherently wicked in its design.
Using one takes years of study.

Lightsaber Pike:
The Lightsaber Pike employs the same combat style as the dual bladed saber.
Both are staff weapons, but the pike has a shaft of saber-resistant metal and a short blade on only one end.

Lightwhip:
The Lightwhip is the most exotic of all weapons that use the crystal energy technology.
Instead of having a rigid blade, the Lightwhip’s energy tendril is flexible and can be wielded to entangle or cut.
Unless you are already an expert with traditional whips, you should not even attempt to hold a Lightwhip.
