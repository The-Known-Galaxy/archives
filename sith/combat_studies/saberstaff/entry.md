# Overview

The double bladed lightsaber, the saberstaff, has been known as a Sith weapon since the time of Exar Kun.
Darth Bane studied under the blademaster Kasâ€™im its techniques, secrets and its power.
He confessed that training with the saberstaff and learning its use, was very hard as it is a difficult weapon to use.

# Details

The saberstaff may be constructed as a single piece, or it may simply be two interlocking saber hilts that can be detached for two-handed combat.
It is best used in wide, sweeping movements while the hilt remains close to the body.
It requires a firm stance and a two-handed grip.
Novices are likely to injure themselves while training, which will expose the flaws in their techniques.
Punishment can be a great teacher.
Do not be confused into thinking they are two blades.
The blades are connected.
If you know the position of one, you know the position of the other.
But while both blades are in motion, you can choose to extinguish one blade and surprise your enemy with a sword fighting lunge or riposte.
The saberstaff is ideal for defeating multiple opponents as well as for defending against blaster fire.
The broad energy barrier created by a whirling saberstaff is impenetrable when deployed by a skilled Sith Lord and above; one who possesses the precognitive ability to sense the timing and the vector of a threat.
But this type of barrier defense should be used only temporarily, while you close the distance separating you from your attacker to deliver a fatal slash.
