# Overview
The lugjack machine was a mechanical device commonly accessed by gamblers in the form of a slot machine that featured gambling games for the users through a built-in virtual screen.
It featured a spinning wheel that gamblers would spin in an attempt to gain a profit, with the amount players bet in the machine acting as a multiplier against a payout score for each spin.
To play this game, players would have to locate a lugjack gambling station, or they could access a remote station, usually roaming around the gambling tables to entice players.

# Additional Sections
The lugjack machines were commonly connected to the lugjack betting window, which was one place where the player could control the betting process whilst playing lugjack.
Players tended to have three options, spin the wheel, bet one, and bet max.
Players were limited to being able to make a total of three bets for a single game.
The player was also able to opt to make bets incrementally one at a time by choosing ‘bet one’, or they could choose to bet max, which would engage the spinning process.


Adding bets incrementally up to the three max will also begin the wheel spinning process.
Each bet made subtracts a singular credit from the player’s balance.
After winning, all credits are deposited from the slot machine located at the bottom of the machine.


Once the max bet has been reached, or the player chooses to spin the wheel, the engine will begin three, four-second cycles of random rolling numbers between 0-7.
After the spinning is complete, a notification is sent to the player to inform them whether they have won, or lost, and include any payouts if successful.
