# Overview
The remaining components of the lightsaber can be assembled from everyday materials or the rarest of metals.
It matters little, so long as the crystalline heart has been forged by your will.
The other elements, a power cell, an emitter matrix and a magnetic emitter ring or focusing lens, will be placed around the red shard within the hilt.
The crystal is special, but these pieces are replaceable.
Use them, replace them, but always ensure that the crystal and the blade are bright and strong.
Depending on your chosen fighting style, you may incorporate innovations in your lightsaber hilt that will aid you.
You should not care about the ceremony, only the results.

# Blade Lock
A Small notch added next to the activation stud will make it possible to leave the blade extended after it leaves your hand.
This is useful for throwing, but can prove dangerous if the lightsaber is jarred out of your hands or buffed with a Force push.



# Pressure Grip
This customization replaces an activation stud and assures that the lightsaber will ignite only when held.
If you align the pressure grip to your unique biology, you will be the only one who can activate it.



# Force Activation
With this configuration, the circuit that connects the power cell to the crystal can only be completed with your mental energy.
Only you can wield such a lightsaber.
But if your attention lags during combat, the blade may blink off.



# Beskar Hilt
Beskar, also known as Mandalorian iron, is resistant to a lightsaber blow.
This material is extremely rare, but if you choose to incorporate it into your hilt design, it could be used to intercept a Jedi blade.
