# Overview

Sabercanes were casual lightsabers, however, the saber’s hilt would be a cane.
The purpose of the unique saber was to act unarmed, hiding the fact that it’s a lightsaber.
Two Sabercanes observed were Haazen’s and Tera Sinube.
They used the cane as a shaft, placing the emitter down inside the cane and the hilt on top, therefore, being able to pull the saber out and wield it.

# Notable Practicioners

Several individuals utilized Sabercanes such as Sith Acolyte Haazen due to being unpermitted by the Jedi Order to wield a lightsaber.
Therefore, Haazen built the cane to hide his weapon, secretly practicing using it and wielding it when it is only necessary.
Haazen’s Sabercane followed the aesthetic of his grisly prosthesis, thus producing the Sith color blade (red) when ignited.

The Cosian Jedi Master Tera Sinube’s Sabercane had a custom hilt made out of wood found from his homeworld.
Notably, in one out of the few situations that occurred, Sinube used the shaft as a secondary weapon as well, bludgeoning an opponent with it.
