The Crushgaunts were gauntlets that assisted the strength of its wielders.
They were originally designed by Mandalorians.
They were made of a Mandalorian steel called Beskar, which made them able to stop a lightsaber blade or a blaster shot.
Crushgaunts boosted its user strength to a level at which one could break a bone or collapse a throat just by gripping hard enough around it.
The Crushgaunt was forbidden at 250 BBY, but was later brought back to use by the Death Watch clan, and after it was brought back it came back to common use by the Mandalorians.
The Crushgaunts were so powerful that they even caught the attention of a powerful Sith Lord, Darth Vader.
There were a lot of rumors that the famous Sith Lord’s right glove was a Mandalorian Crushgaunt.
Some notable people that used Crushgaunts were: Boba Fett, Din Djarin, Bo-Katan Kryze, and Pre Vizsla.
