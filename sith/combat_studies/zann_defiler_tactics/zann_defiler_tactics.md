# Overview
Despite having a well-equipped and structured military, the Zann Consortium's Defilers favored guerilla warfare tactics and criminal activities to achieve power.
Defilers sought to spread Tyber Zann's "corruption" across the galaxy, in which many or all were indoctrinated to serve the Consortium.
Other tactics used by the Zann defilers were sabotage, kidnapping, bribery, piracy, slavery, and corrupting local militia on planets, as well as intimidating or kidnapping individuals who defied the Consortium.
They may have operated illegal casinos as racketeers.
As required, they also participated in Zann's covert military operations.

Precision blaster rifles and thermal detonators were used by defilers for long-range warfare.
They killed infantry squads with their thermal detonators and worked effectively with the Droideka Mark II to destroy larger vehicles.
Their weakness was Wookiees, who could pull off a Defiler's arms in close battle.
Due to personal safety, defilers operated in secrecy.
