# Overview
Ice Wampas were carnivorous predators living on the cold and snowy planet called Hoth.
They could grow up to two meters in height with white shaggy fur and razor-sharp teeth alongside deadly claws.
They are also extremely aggressive and tend to attack anything they deem as prey.
A Wampa usually prefers to hunt their prey alone rather than hunting together with other Wampas.
Even though they were substantially solitary hunters, they could hunt as a pack on rare occasions.
The wampa species dominated at the top of the food chain on planet Hoth and was established to be the planet’s most aggressive carnivorous predator.

# Ambush Tactics
A wampa that was not engaging in the hunt for food prefers to be walking on all fours instead of two, with one exception being when they were actively hunting their prey to intimidate and immobilize the victim with its razor-sharp claws, deadly teeth, and immense brute strength.

Wampas were covered with white shaggy fur making it easy for them to camouflage themselves with the snow around them to blend in while stalking their prey without exposing their close-by presence.

These creatures would typically stalk their prey until both of them were close enough within the vicinity for the wampa to launch an attack on the victim while keeping them trapped.
Standing up with their two legs and taking a fearsome and intimidating stance in front of its prey would mean that it has taken its final sighting and prepared counter-measures, springing towards the victim with its razor-sharp claws deploying for a final deadly pounce to stun or eliminate their prey on the spot.
