# Overview
Kendosu, also known as Form VIII and The Way of Varactyl, was a lightsaber form created and only used by Jedi Knight Scott Borek due to the difficulty it required to be mastered.
This form was conceived in 21 BBY to give the Jedi an advantage against the Sith throughout the Great Galactic War.
It was also known for relying on the practitioner’s prowess in dueling and swordplay rather than the user’s ability with the Force.

# Kendosu's Creation
Besides being created to help the Jedi during the Great Galactic War, it also corrected aspects of different forms, such as Makashi, Djem-So, Ataru, and Soresu.
The Jedi Knight saw on Makashi that it didn’t have enough strength to sustain itself during a duel, and was practically useless against blasters.
On Djem-So, he noticed it didn’t have the necessary speed.
He also found out Ataru lacked precision and strength, while it needed massive amounts of stamina to be mastered.
Scott Borek also observed the blasters were prevalent and decided to borrow Soresu’s defensive style.



# Strengths and Weaknesses
Kendosu mainly relied on speed for an attack.
Said speed was used to overwhelm, confuse and counter-attack the opponent, allowing the user to gain power during the battle.
The defence and precision varied depending on the strength of the practitioner.
Form VIII was also weak against strength-based offences or extremely precise offences.
