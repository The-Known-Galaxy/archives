# Overview

Sun djem was a technique employed in lightsaber combat that entailed the disarmament or destruction of an opponent's weapon.
Naturally, this maneuver was used to defeat an enemy without causing harm to said person.
Sun djem could be used to disarm nearly any enemy with a weapon.
When utilized against blaster-wielding enemies, the user simply destroyed the weapon by cutting the barrel.
During lightsaber combat, the maneuver simply involved twisting the hilt out of the enemy's hands or even knocking the hilt out of the adversaryâ€™s grasp by using brute force.
Other methods also involved chopping off the hand of the opponent completely, rendering their ability to hold a weapon useless.

# Application

This ancient technique of lightsaber combat was most commonly used with the first form known as Shii-Cho.
Given the basic nature of the first form, it is to no surprise that such a skill was so consistent during the emergence of lightsaber combat forms.
The most common technique of sun djem with this style of lightsaber combat was the disarming slash, a maneuver that was simply meant to destroy the weapon of an enemy.
Sun djem would begin to become a rare technique within lightsaber combat after newer forms began to succeed the first such as Makashi which was entirely focused on preventing disarmament.
