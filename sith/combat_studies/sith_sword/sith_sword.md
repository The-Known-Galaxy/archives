# Overview
The Sith swords, also known as Sith Warblades, were combat weapons used by the Sith in the days of the Sith Empire, from 6900 BBY to 5000 BBY approximately.
These swords were the previous weapon to the lightsabers.
Though similar to the bladed weapons utilized by the ancient Jedi, Sith swords were distinguished from Jedi katanas by their fundamental nature, both powered by and empowering the dark side of the Force.
The Sith swords were built through an alchemical and metallurgical process transmuting base metals into an alchemical alloy possessing an unusual affinity for Dark Side energies.

# History
The origin of the first Sith sword ever constructed is unknown, however, it predated the earliest lightsabers.
Developed by the ancient Sith, it was adopted by the Jen'jidai following their arrival on Korriban.
The Sith's native martial traditions were absorbed, blending with the exiled Jedi's forms of lightsaber combat to create a powerful hybrid—much as the Dark Jedi would do with the Sith race as a whole upon seizing the mantles of Sith Lords.
Quite a few Sith Lords, including the Dark Lords Ajunta Pall, Marka Ragnos, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh used Sith swords rather than lightsabers, either for tradition, or because they preferred the feeling of sword cutting through flesh.
