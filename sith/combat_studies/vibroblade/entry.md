# Overview

The vibroblade was a type of melee vibroweapon that had increased cutting effectiveness due to the ultrasonic vibrations coursing through it.
Vibroblades resembled short swords, albeit with a high-tech design and feel.
It functioned the same way as any other vibroweapon: inside of the weapon’s hilt or handle there was a compact ultrasonic vibration generator, which made the blade vibrate at extreme speeds, turning even the smallest injuries into large wounds.
Vibroblades conducted electricity, which would run through the length of the blade, and connect with the energy cell, causing a small explosion that could even take off somebody’s hand.
At first it used to be fitted with cortosis-weave so that the wielder may be able to block and parry lightsaber blows, but as time went on this method was left forgotten, and the cortosis mineral itself became exceedingly rare.
A newer, highly adaptable variant of the vibroblade was then produced, called the prototype vibroblade, which could be fitted with many more weapon enhancements than the basic vibroblades.

# History

Vibroblades were popularly used by soldiers, mercenaries, assassins and pirates throughout the entire galaxy, along with other criminals and bounty hunters.
The criminal allegations made these weapons banned on multiple worlds.
Vibroblades were common around the Jedi Civil War era, because with the rapid increase of personal energy shields, blasters became less and less viable.
However, vibroweapons could easily cut through energy shields.
Vibroblades were carried by Mandalorian Neo-Crusader Shock Troopers, as well as Republic Military officers.
During the Clone Wars, clone assassins used them as main weapons, and Imperial Dungeoneers as backup weapons.
They were also sometimes used by high ranking imperial officers such as inquisitor Jerec.
Even though vibroblades were banned almost everywhere in the galaxy, they were still being produced and used in less civilized worlds such as Tatooine.
