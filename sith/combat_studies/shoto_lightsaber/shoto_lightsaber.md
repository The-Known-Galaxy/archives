# Overview
The Shoto Lightsaber also known as Lightdaggers or Shortsabers, was the same design as a regular lightsaber but shorter.
The reasoning for this weapon was for people who wanted to have two lightsabers but use a smaller off-hand weapon so they could use the form Jar’kai.
These short yet powerful blades were also used for those of small statures such as Yoda, Young Ashoka, Yaddle, and Toki talivar.

# Design
In thought, the Shoto is no different from a lightsaber other than size.
The Shoto was about half the size of the regular lightsaber and its hilt is slimmer to allow for maximum dexterity.
The Shot was quite rare compared to the more commonly used lightsaber.
During the Jedi Civil War, these handy weapons were quite popular.
These lightsabers were constructed by hand by certain people.
This blade was not only for convenience either it was also for looks if somebody wanted a different lightsaber color.



# Notable Users
Yoda- Yoda used this weapon due to his small body and the fact that the blade is much lighter than other sabers and also allowed him to have more agility.


Yaddle- Much like Yoda, yaddle used this to her size and the Shotos capabilities.

Ahsoka Tano- She used Shoto along with a regular saber, this was so she could have a quick off-hand attack.
