# Introduction |
This weapon was wielded in the same way one might wield a regular whip, however, this weapon was rare, and quite like a lightsaber in a fashion.
The lightwhip was an energy weapon, so it was hot like a lightsaber, but at the same time, it was solid, unlike a blaster bolt.
It took a long, thin shape, and was often employed by duelists who were not as skilled in regular lightsaber combat, as it held many advantages.
It was a very toxic and potent weapon and could be quite a surprise to an unsuspecting enemy.

# Advantages/Disadvantages
The Lightwhip held many aspects that made it a truly unique weapon.
First of all, this weapon was a combination of a Lightsaber and a regular whip, one lash could cut an opponent down easily.
It had a wide and varying range and could be employed with multiple tassels.
However, it came with just as many disadvantages as advantages.
The blade was uncontrollable, and the long rope of light was not suited for parries or feints.
It needed to be drawn back for an attack, leaving the user vulnerable.
Lightwhips were also known to short out when struck on something with great force.



# History
This weapon was first made and employed by the Sith, specifically Sith Lady Githany.
Lightwhips were often frowned upon by the Jedi, due to its aggressive nature, and dark origins.
Lightwhips were later often used in prisons and slave-driven planets.
The form and weapon were also employed by Dooku’s Dark Acolytes.
Nightsisters often used it, as it gave them an advantage on their homeworld, where they could easily use the range to attack in the dense forests.
Obi-wan Kenobi once used the lightwhip on Ord Cestus during the Clone Wars against the Dark Acolytes.
