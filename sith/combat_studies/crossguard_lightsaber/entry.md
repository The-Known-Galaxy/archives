# Introduction

The Crossguard Lightsaber was a unique style of a lightsaber, it had a normal size of a lightsaber, however, it had two blades on the edge of the emitter known as a Quillon and was used as a weapon in case the two duelists got into a hold stance while dueling allowing the crossguard user to use his Quillons to stab them disabling them temporarily.
One of the most common forms for this unique blade was Makashi which was used due to its very precise hits, allowing the Quillons to make the most out of their placement of the lightsaber.

# History

There were very few known users of the crossguard lightsaber, but all were very well known across the galaxy.
First, there were the many Jedi that fought using this lightsaber at the Great Scourge of Malachor.
There was a powerful Sith who used the blade, this Sith Lord was known as Darth Atrius, however, he used a very dark use of the blade, fusing it with the Dark Side and making the wielder of Darth Atris’ Blade have a surreal amount of anger that they cannot control unless they let go of the blade.
Atrius’ crossguard was later destroyed by Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader during the Imperial War.
There was also a very uncommon crossguard saber, found by Ezra Bridger; unfortunately, the green crossguard was broken as soon as Ezra ignited the blade.
The most commonly known user of the Crossguard Lightsaber, Kylo Ren, a very powerful user of the Sith, and user of the unstable Crossguard Lightsaber that he used in the many battles he would face.
Kylo Ren would have an unstable blade since he equipped the saber with a cracked kyber crystal, which made the blade very unstable and hard to use.
Through the Dark Side, Kylo Ren possessed no trouble with the crossguard lightsaber and later used it to strike down his father, Han Solo.
Eventually, through grief, he would see his father in a vision, resulting in him betraying the Order, and turning back to the light.
