# Overview

Sith Poison was created by early Sith Purebloods.
It was first invented before Sith were wielding lightsabers, instead, they used primitive weaponry.
The Purebloods were dedicated to lethality when it came to combat.
They invented a lethal poison that could coat their weapons and projectiles.
Sith Assassins utilized the poison to lace drinking cups of their targets or rivals.
The beautiful thing about Sith Poison was the Sith’s will of bettering it throughout generations and generations until it became its most refined form.

# Early Versions

Around the time Sith Poison was developed, there was a secret infamous order of assassins, named “The Poisoners of Malkite'', who resided on the planet Malkii.
These poisoners were incredibly envious of Sith Poison.
Even the most lethal poison assassins were jealous of Sith Poison, which shows how powerful even its most primitive form was.

The symptoms the poison caused were but not limited to: pain, paralysis, death, or blood frenzy.
That blood frenzy will soon be explored by later generations of Sith.
With every generation of Sith, the poison MUST be improved to compensate for the species’ improved immunities.
