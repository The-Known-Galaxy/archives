# Description

The energy slingshot was a wrist mount that was beloved by pranksters or young kids of all races.
The weapon was used by pulling back an electric cup as it relates to energy.
When released it releases a powerful burst of electromagnetic energy although it is not lethal.
Unfortunately, the electro shots have gravity unlike blaster bolts so the slingshot only works at short distances.
Before 18 BBY, the Graff family used modified slingshots in games.
Milo later watched a holocom game where his parents were taken by the Galactic Empire.
Near the date of 5 BBY, Ezra Bridger had a slingshot before he built his lightsaber.
It was made by Xexto.
He later put it on his wrist but after a battle, he attached it to his saber.
