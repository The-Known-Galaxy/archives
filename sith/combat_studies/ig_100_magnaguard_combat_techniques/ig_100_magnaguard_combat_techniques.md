# Overview
The IG-100 MagnaGuards were a special unit of droids favorited by General Grievous who would use them as his personal bodyguards during the events of the Clone Wars
which would also be under the command of other high-ranking separatists such as Count Dooku.
The Magna guards weighed 123 kilograms with a height of 1.95 meters (6 ft, 5 in) carrying various different types of weapons such as Electrostaffs, RPS-6 rocket launchers, and Precision laser darts.
Most MagnaGuards would use an electrostaff however as it proved to be efficient against lightsabers and were also able to continue fighting after the loss of a limb or a head.
Magna Guards were so well designed and programmed that they could even face some of the most skilled Jedi with one of them even being able to back Obi-Wan into a corner.

# Section I
Magna Guards would usually fight in pairs of two where one would be tracking upfront to keep the Jedi’s lightsaber occupied while the other would strike in unprotected areas and weak points.
The electrostaff was a weapon well suited for the IG-100s as it would complement their training in the seven forms of lightsaber combat techniques.
The rod was made of phrik metal which was strong enough to withstand a lightsaber which caught many Jedi off guard and occasionally would lead to deadly consequences as a result.
Additionally, the Magna Guards were in possession of a wide range of weapons, particularly long-range with a preference for explosives.



# Section II
The IG-100s had a unique combat style through the combination of the 7 forms of lightsaber combat allowing the deadly droids to overwhelm their enemies with ease.
The many different MagnaGuard variants had a wide range of different materials, this would include missile launchers, tow cables, and magnetized or extendable arms.
Their unique fighting style complemented by their heavy amounts of armor, finely crafted with the usage of duranium, make them some of the deadliest opponents on the battlefield and easily one of the best separatist droid units.
Even after many Jedi would eventually learn the IG-100’s weak point on their chest they would still have trouble taking them down as it would be one of the most well-protected places on the IG-100 MagnaGuards.
