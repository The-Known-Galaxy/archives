# Description
The forcesaber was a Rakatan invention in which powerful dark energy blades were able to be ignited like the soon-to-be-made lightsabers.
Force hounds were required for these powerful weapons which required a special crystal and some alchemy.
Some sabers were like regular ones but some used Pikesabers.
The model and technology would later be used to make a proto saber.
Forcesabers, as well as lightsabers, had different colors.
Xesh and Daegan both had the color purple as their saber.
In the vision, Loki had of these powerful weapons were red which is why the Sith in later years owned the red saber.
 The Rakatan warriors usually used orange while the raiders used yellow.
The force saber could be used as a great divider between the light and dark side and could put the user at risk.
