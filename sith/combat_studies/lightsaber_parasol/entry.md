# Introduction

Kouru, the leader of a bandit group and former Sith warrior, created the lightsaber parasol as a Sith saber variant.
When only the hilt was used, the saber acted like a regular one sided blade.
When attached to its auxiliary, it released numerous crimson plasma blades in the shape of a parasol, even more when used as a shield by spinning it.
She employed it during her attack on a native village situated in Genbara.

# Description

A lightsaber variant that consisted of the utilization of an auxiliary to modify it´s capacities.
When attached to the saber’s hilt, the kyber crystal’s energy was channeled outward into several blades, forming a parasol.
The auxiliary itself was composed of two parts: A central pole and several radiating ribs that opened upwards in resemblance to a parasol.
Once activated, the red plasma beams seemed like multiple lightsabers.
In addition, there also existed another extension piece to further enhance the saber’s length.
The saber had the possibility to be detached in order to duel with a single bladed classic saber.

# History

The lightsaber parasol was created using holographic blueprints developed  by “ The Ronin '', former Dark Lord of the Sith, during the Sith rebellion by a Sith warrior named Kouru.
While attacking a remote village, not recognizing each other, Kouru and the Ronin faced each other.
With the auxiliary removed, Kouru dueled the former Dark Lord, but was ultimately surpassed and almost killed.
Kouru’s kyber crystal was given to the village’s chief as a gift by the Ronin, stating that no evil would come near as long as they maintained that crystal.
The ronin returned to the village with his drone, B5-56 and brought the auxiliary along as a gift for a Sullustan shopkeeper who had helped him repair the previously mentioned droid.
