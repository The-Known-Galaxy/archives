# Overview

The Jensaarai Combat Style, colloquially known as Rek’dul, was the name of the fighting stance used solely by the Jensaarai during combat.
This style of combat was not created solely for lightsaber combat.
However, it compliments and encourages the use of a lightsaber simultaneously due to involving Sith martial arts and High Republic Jedi lightsaber combat.
This combat style requires the lightsaber to be held like a dagger, facing downwards, similar to Form V variation Shien.
This style of combat originated from Nikkos Tyris, who taught it to his students during the classic era of the Galactic Republic’s reign.
