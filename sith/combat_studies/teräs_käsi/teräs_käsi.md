# Overview

Teräs Käsi, which translates to "steel hand" in Basic, is a mysterious and dangerous martial art style that is well-known for its brutality throughout the galaxy.

# History

Teräs Käsi was created in a far-off star cluster in the Pacanth Reach on the planet Bunduki, which was home to the Epicanthix, a close-to-human species.
Teräs Käsi was created on Bunduki by the clandestine Followers of Palawa, refugees from the planet Palawa, which had been decimated earlier in a conflict involving the Jedi Council.
The Followers did this to make sure that another world would never be destroyed by the Council's actions.
Pupils were frequently sent to the Followers in order to learn Teräs Käsi, where they were taught about history, literature, metaphysics, and the cultures of the Pacanth Reach.
The Followers also urged the students to use Teräs Käsi for the welfare of society.
Although it was still uncommon enough that one had to look for one of these graduating masters in order to study Teräs Käsi off of Bunduki, many people who discovered the mysteries of Teräs Käsi spread the information to other parts of the galaxy.

# Characteristics

Teräs Käsi, a devastating martial art, literally translated to "steel hands" in Basic, alluding to the practitioner's fists' exceptional tenacity and the powerful piston-like blows they could deliver.
This reputation was well-deserved because experts of Teräs Käsi were known to unleash blows with as much force as slugthrowers and blaster pistols, easily punching through body armour.
Even novices were known to be capable of shocking damage, albeit to a lesser extent.
A practitioner of Teräs Käsi may also become blindingly fast and fine-tune their senses to the point where they could anticipate attacks with an amazing ease and avoid them so quickly that they appeared as a blur.
Because of this, practitioners also possessed a high level of acrobatics; a practitioner falling may employ midair acrobatics to control their fall and prevent hitting cliffs and other potentially fatal obstacles.

These power, speed, and acrobatic feats were made possible by Teräs Käsi's core principles, particularly control and self-mastery to the point that a practitioner had total control over their body.
Teräs Käsi also included meditative arts, turning a Teräs Käsi artist's mental control inwards as opposed to outwards; practitioners could enter a meditative trance-like state in which they were immobile and stop bleeding as well as slow poisons and diseases; master meditation artists could even slowly heal their own wounds by refocusing their mental energies within themselves.

Teräs Käsi is a martial art that was modeled after the hunting techniques and movements of numerous monsters found throughout the galaxy.
Many moves in the system have these names, like Charging Wampa, Rancor Rising, and Dancing Dragonsnake, to mention a few.
With half a dozen fundamental stances that relied on four ranges of engagement kicking, punching, elbowing, and grappling range Teräs Käsi focused on close work with hands, feet, elbows, blades, and sticks.
