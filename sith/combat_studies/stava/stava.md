# Description
Stava is a combat technique developed by the Noghri assassins of Honoghr.
This martial art was named after a predator from the planet of Honoghr.
The Stava martial art was about pressing nerve points on the enemy’s body creating deadly takedowns and strikes, making this martial art one of the deadliest in the galaxy.
The way of Noghri relied on velocity and endurance, due the velocity of the combat style Stava practicioners were able to dodge a blaster shot, which made it really effective in fights against blaster users.
The martial art could be combined with weapons such as; vibroblades,  sickles, and the Vrakolian Spin-blades.
Stava was originally known only by the race of Noghri, but later on it was spread around the whole galaxy.
In history, using this technique Noghri was able to kill a stormtrooper of Darth Vader.
