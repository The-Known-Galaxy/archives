# Overview

The Orbalisk armor was an armament formed by many orbalisks, near unbreakable parasites which inhabited a moon called Dxun which circled Onderon., The Orbalisk had a particularly formidable superficial shell-like outer body that was capable of stopping even lightsabers.
The parasitic varmints hooked to the body using their thousands of little teeth and foraged off the Dark Side in the host, most often Force Sensitive Darksiders.
Darth Bane was capable of keeping this armament on for long periods due to the restorative practices of Caleb, who made a deal with Darth Zannah, Bane's Apprentice.
An orbalisk was a parasitic varmint located on Dxun that lived in clusters.
They lay dormant in burrows or other dark places until they found a suitable host creature to whose skin they would connect themselves.
Orbalisks were able to feed on the Force-sensitivity of Darksiders.
The Holocron of Freedon Nadd possessed the knowledge to make armament to stop the orbalisks from wrapping the face, hands, and feet of the individual.
The orbalisks living on Darth Bane gave him extraordinary recovering effects and nourished the host with greatly improved resilience and dexterity, but it also stopped him from utilizing one of the most essential skills as a Sith, stealth.
Bane had to count on his apprentice, Darth Zannah, to get necessities, information, and to carry out other tasks that required stealth.
