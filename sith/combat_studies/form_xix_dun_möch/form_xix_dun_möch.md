# Introduction |
Dun Möch is a combat strategy that distracts opponents through taunts in the middle of combat.
It is classified as using the Force, through the means of psychological warfare.
This scheme mostly involved spoken jeers and jests that revealed an opponent’s weakness; therefore eroding their will.
Dun Möch will also combine mental attacks, so their opponent’s concentration with the Force is stripped away and making them less precise and accurate.
This is mostly used by Sith since they aim to dominate their opponent in every means necessary (combat, spirit, power, etc.).
Not only that but because the Jedi rely too much on their concentration with the Force, they would be left open and weak by the Sith, essentially giving them the upper hand in combat.

# The Boomerang Effect |
Should the user fail to use Dun Möch, it will backfire by angering the target instead of making them afraid; thus endangering the user with increased hostile actions.
Darth Tyranus (Count Dooku) fell victim to this effect twice against Anakin Skywalker, where when trying to implant fear into him, he only provoked anger which ultimately led to his defeat.



# Inverse Dun Möch
There also exists another variant of this ability, that contains a purpose opposite to the original.
In this case, the Inverse Dun Möch is used as a reminder to the sith that it is still good inside them and an opportunity to redeem themselves to the light.
Luke Skywalker used this on Darth Vader, to remind him of who he was in the past and capable of loving again.
This strategy turned into a success as Vader redeemed himself by fighting back against Palpatine, even though it led to his demise.
