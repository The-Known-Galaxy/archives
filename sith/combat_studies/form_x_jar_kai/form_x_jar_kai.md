# Overview
The Yovshin Swordsmen invented the original swordplay technique known as Jar'kai, which involved the use of two blades.
Royale Macheteros of the Kashi Mer monastery created a similar dual-blade technique to Niman.

# Origins
During the First Great Schism, both the Jedi Order and the dark side faction known as the Legions of Lettow adopted Niman, also known as form VI.
After the incident, Niman evolved into six different lightsaber forms, whereas Jark'ai essentially became a generic name for dual-blade combat.

Niman wasn't the only form with a dual variant; Form IV Ataru also possessed one, which is surprising because it was known to use two swords while training.
Ashoka Tano achieved mastery in this form while still a Padawan, which is something that a Jedi master would find troubling.



# Analysis
The Jar'kai isn't really a form.
Instead, it is the idea of effectively engaging in combat with two sabres.
When they reclaimed their dead comrades or the enemy's sabres in battle, many Jedi were compelled to use Jar'kai for a brief period of time.


The forms have to be learned by Jar'kai users as well, with Niman and Ataru being particularly helpful for their style due to the emphasis on balance and force-enhanced agility.
Any advantage in force while employing two sabres is worthwhile.
By incorporating Makashi, Ataru, and Juyo into Jar'kai, Asajj Ventress was able to gain notoriety as a formidable opponent during the Clone Wars.
