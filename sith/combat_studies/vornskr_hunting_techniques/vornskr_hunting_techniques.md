# Introduction
The Vornskr, a canine beast native to the forest plant Myrkr, was a ferocious and ruthless hunter.
These beasts utilized a variety of adaptations to hunt down their prey through the large forests that covered their planet.
Vornskr possessed two forward-facing eyes that overlapped in their fields of vision, giving them stellar depth perception.
They also possessed a dark green or gray skin tone, allowing them to effectively disappear into the shadows of the forest.
They could angle their hyper-sensitive ears to pick up on the direction of even the smallest noise.
Their whip-like, venomous tails could be used to injure and stun prey before using their razor-sharp teeth to finish the job.
All of these combined made them expert hunters, but their biggest advantage was their sense of the Force in living creatures.

# Section 1
The sense of the Vornskr evolved as their favorite prey, the Ysalamiri, a salamander-like lizard species, became more and more difficult to catch.
These beasts evolved the ability to sense the Force around them and within living creatures.
This greatly aided them in hunting down the Ysalamiri, who were rich in the Force, but also caused them to sometimes target Force-Sensitives.
Thinking these Force-Sensitives, including Jedi, were their favorite prey, they would sometimes mercilessly hunt them down for food.

As the Vornskr evolved to become better and better at hunting down their prey, the Ysalamiri also evolved to be able to avoid being slaughtered by their predators.
The Ysalamiri eventually developed the ability to suppress the Force within and around themselves to effectively cloak themselves from the Vornskr’s ability to sense them.
The Ysalamiri became so skilled at using this ability that they became able to create a “Force Bubble” around themselves that would suppress all Force inside, to the point where no creatures could even use Force abilities within.



# Section 2
Vornskr are primarily known to be nocturnal hunters.
However, they have been reported to occasionally hunt or fight during daytime hours if extremely hungry or threatened in some way.
Vornskr have rarely been seen outside of a wild capacity, but in rare cases, they have been known to be tamed by those brave enough to do so.
Their talent in hunting was used by some to hunt down prisoners of war who escaped or to track down enemies in a combat zone.
These skilled, innate hunters are some of the most, if not the most ruthless and terrifying hunters you will find.
