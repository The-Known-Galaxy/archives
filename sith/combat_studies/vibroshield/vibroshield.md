# Overview
The vibroshield is a versatile weapon and as the name states, it is a shield.
The vibroshield is made out of ultra-chrome, a metal used in the Old Republic Era for ship armor by the Sith Empire.
Kar Vastor created the vibroshield intending to be able to act as a normal shield but at the same time, be able to use it as a weapon for cutting.
The vibroshield had a simple system of electronics where it would make the shield vibrate to the point it could cut most metals.
The vibroshield was able to block a lightsaber long enough for the user to counterattack.
The vibroshield was mostly used by the Akk Guards, a fierce and animalistic group of Korunnai trained by Kar Vastor himself.
With Kar Vastor's knowledge about the vibroshield and the Force, he was able to teach the Akk Guards to use the Force and vibroshield together to make an offensive yet a defensive form of fighting.
