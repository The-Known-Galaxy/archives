# Introduction
Tràkata was a style of lightsaber combat created by Jedi Consulars during the Old Republic to overcome the hindrance of using a lightsaber.
This style entailed dis-igniting the lightsaber and then re-igniting quickly afterward to allow for feints as well as confuse the enemy in combat.
Despite the uniqueness and practicality of tràkata, it was rarely ever used by the Jedi.
As for the Sith, it was also a rare sight to see one making use of this style considering they relied on passion to provide an edge in battle as opposed to practicality.

# Technique
While not a part of the core seven forms of lightsaber combat, tràkata still had its fair share of techniques and maneuvers that made it useful in combat.
This complicated yet simple combat style aimed to adopt a mindset of deception and practicality by simply fooling the enemy with visual action.
Due to the mindset that was required of a user when using this form, the majority of the Jedi were not fond of it and decided to resort to one or many of the seven forms of lightsaber combat.
Sith that did use the techniques, mostly did so to allow faster access to their force abilities such as Force lightning.



One of the common techniques of tràkata was known as “Pass the Blade.” This technique involved the duelist dis-igniting their blade as they’re attacking or just before landing a strike to penetrate the enemy's defense before igniting to connect a blow.


Yet another but a rather risky maneuver was the “Unbalancing Block.” The user would feint by saber-locking with the adversary or catching their blade with their own, then dis-igniting which leads the opponent off balance causing them to stumble.


Likely the riskiest of the techniques, “Flash Slash,” which entailed ignition of the duelist’s blade for just the right amount of time for the lightsaber to ignite to the fullest length during an attack before being dis-igniting once more.
