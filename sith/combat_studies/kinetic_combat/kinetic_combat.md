# Overview

Kinetic Combat is the concept of using Force to manipulate a physical object.
A singular, one-handed melee weapon can operate without the need for physical contact from the user's hand or grip.
Due to its obscure nature and hard-to-master techniques, it was never dully embraced by either Sith or Jedi, though a select few did dabble to teat the theory.
