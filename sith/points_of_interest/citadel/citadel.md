# Overview
The Citadel, also referred to as Citadel Station, served as a prison on Lola Sayu.
The station was originally constructed by the Galactic Republic to detain renegade Jedi, however, it fell into the hands of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars.
At that time, Osi Sobeck assumed the role of warden.
Among the captives in the citadel were Jedi Master Even Piell and Captain Wilhuff Tarkin, along with several other officers.
These individuals were subjected to interrogation with the goal of seeking out the coordinates of the Nexus hyperspace route.
A group of Jedi and clone troopers managed to successfully rescue them, although requiring assistance from the Republic fleet after their escape route was destroyed.
In the subsequent Imperial era, the Citadel harboured a Separatist holdout.

# History
Designed in 522 BBY, its primary purpose was to hold rogue or dark Jedi.
In fact, a rogue Jedi was imprisoned there around 520 BBY.
There were rumours among the Jedi that the Citadel housed a correctional unit specifically designed for Jedi with foresight abilities.
Fearing that Jedi Padawan Sifo-Dyas would be imprisoned there due to his worsening Force visions, Jedi Master Lene Kostana withheld information from the Jedi Council.
However, the Jedi Archives contained outdated information on the Citadel's layout during the Clone Wars.



# Clone Wars
By the time of the Clone Wars the Citadel was taken control of by the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
It was run by Osi Sobeck who took the role of warden.
Under Sobeck's control, the Citadel became known as the Confederacy's most isolated prison that kept only the most dangerous prisoners.
The prison was protected by a great amount of droids, and it had giant fields of electromines.

In 20 BBY, Jedi General Even Piell was captured.
Piell was tortured for information about the Nexus Route.
The Jedi Council sent a team led by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker.
After the team froze themselves to pass the life-form scanners that were set up by the Separatist fleet guarding the planet, they landed just outside the Citadel.
They started to climb a cliff full of electromines, but clone trooper “Charger” fell down and hit one of the mines, letting the Confederacy know they were there.
The team ended up getting in the prison and rescued Piell and his Officers.

When they were to meet up with the other team that consisted of R2-D2 and reprogrammed Separatist battle droids, a fight started on the landing pad.
ARC trooper "Echo" was thought to be dead when a droid commando blew up the Team’s shuttle.
When the Jedi tried to escape, a team of anoobas and droids led by Sobeck ambushed them.
General Piell was hardly injured by an anooba, but Piell managed to tell half of the Nexus Route to Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano before dying.
Sobeck was  killed by Ahsoka Tano while trying to throw Tarkin into a pool of lava.
The group managed to reach the meeting point where a ship came and retrieved them.
