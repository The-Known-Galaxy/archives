# Overview
Eclipse Station was located at a Jedi stronghold on the planet Eclipse in the Deep Core during the Yuuzhan Vong War.
Its existence was a result of the event known as the Great River scheme.
The Yuuzhan Vong threatened the New Republic that if they did not reveal the location of Eclipse, they would destroy thousands of refugee ships.
The Jedi, however, were able to free the refugees with help from the New Republic.
Unfortunately, Eclipse Station's coordinates were leaked by a captured yammosk when Anakin Solo fell in a battle over Myrkr.
