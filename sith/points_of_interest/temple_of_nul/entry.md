# Overview

The Temple of Nul was a Sith temple created by Darth Nul on the planet Elom.
It was built by Darth Nul and was located in the Charred Divide and was spread across the planet and had many of Darth Nul’s creations inside.
Within the main temple had Darth Nul’s most notable creations, one being a holocron that held the locations of “unworthy” Force-Sensitives that were seen as useless by both the Sith Order and the Jedi Order.
The date that the temple was created is unknown to both orders and may never be discovered due to it being destroyed when the Jedi and Sith sought out more artifacts that may have been held at the temple.
2 Jedi named Master Denolm Orr and his Padawan Sa’har Kateen went to visit the temple to retrieve a holocron, but the rogue Sith Lord Darth Malgus had also been on the planet to retrieve the holocron.
Darth Malgus killed Master Denolm Orr and left Sa’har to fend for herself in the process taking the holocron from Sa’har.
Once the temple had been destroyed Darth Malgus was defeated and captured by the Alliance Commander.
