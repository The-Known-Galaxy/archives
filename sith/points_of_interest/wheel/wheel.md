# History
The Wheel had been existing from as early as the High Republic Era.
During that time, the Jedi Grand Master Yoda had met with the members of the Jedi High Council, two Jedi Masters known as Pra-Tre Veter and Ela Sutan, in the passageway of The Wheel while it was doing orbits around Besh Gorgan.
Master Yoda had stayed on Turrak at that time and had gone to The Wheel so he could speak to the Jedi Masters, the Jedi Masters argued whether or not Master Yoda should go back to Coruscant until Master Yoda pulled out the instrument Taratti and showed it to them.
After Master Yoda had been gone for a little bit after leaving, Master Yoda had returned to Turrak.
