The Imperial Citadel was a glorious and large structure of the Sith Empire; it was built alongside Kaas City after the surviving Sith of the Great Hyperspace War had retreated into Dromund Kaas.
The Imperial Citadel was located in the centre of Kaas City to show off the might and capabilities of the Empire; the Imperial Citadel and Kaas City combined were a testament to the newly formed Empire.

The Imperial Citadel served as the centre of the Imperial Government, it contained the headquarters of the Ministries of War, Intelligence, Logistics, the Sith Enclave and the Mandalorian embassy, known as the Mandalorian enclave.
It was the latest version of the Imperial Citadel, the first version held a different layout.

The first construction of the Imperial Citadel resembled Korriban’s Sith Academy and Ziost’s Sith Citadel, however, this construction was destroyed in 4043 BBY during the Kaggath between Darth Qalar and Darth Victun.
The Dark Council executed these Sith Lords, the reconstruction would be overseen by Darth Nostrem.

The reconstruction and design of the second citadel were designed by the former Emperor and traitorous Darth Vitiate, it was the design as we know it now.
After the completion of the construction, Darth Nostrem, the one who was responsible for overseeing, was locked inside the citadel’s depths in order to test the new labyrinthine defences.
Darth Nostrem would never escape and was killed by its defences.
