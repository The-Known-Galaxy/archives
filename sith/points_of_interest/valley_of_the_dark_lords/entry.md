# Introduction

The Valley of the Dark Lords is one of the most notable points of culture and history for the Sith Order.
Having been originally established as a burial site for fallen Sith Kings of ancient Korriban, the site was originally known as the ‘’Valley of the Sleeping Kings’’ prior to the creation of the Sith Empire.

Sitting prominently at the mouth of  the most notorious Sith Academy in history, the Valley of the Dark Lords would become a consistent place of interest for a wide variety of beings.
Sith, Jedi, pilgrims and unfortunate wanderers, the draw of this Valley is unlike any other place in the galaxy.

# History of a Graveyard

100,000 BBY - 3959 BBY

The Valley of the Dark Lords would first be utilized to house the many fallen Sith Kings of the ancient Sith tribes.
However, after the death of Ajunta Pall it would be deemed the most appropriate place to bury the former ruler of the Sith Empire.
After many centuries more notable Lords would fall and would end up buried in the same valley.
Eventually earning the valley its name.

The official purpose of the Valley of the Dark Lords was to act as a graveyard.
However, due to the Sith Academy raised there by Exar Kun and the many desirable secrets and treasures buried within its many tombs, the Valley of the Dark Lords would become a sight of battle, pilgrimage, education and much more.

Prior to its destruction, the Valley of the Dark Lords would become the eternal resting place of Ajunta Pall, XoXaan, Tulak Hord, Ludo Kressh and Marka Ragnos, among many others.
After the death of Naga Sadow and the valley’s destruction at the hands of the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order, the valley would not be used as a grave site for thousands of years.

During this period the Valley of the Dark Lords would become plagued with grave robbers, bandits, pilgrims and scavengers.
Though due to the dangers of the valley, more people would become unwillingly buried there over the centuries.

3959 BBY - 1000 BBY

Darth Revan’s Sith Empire would later make use of Exar Kun’s old Sith Academy and use it to teach all of the Acolytes seeking to enter Revan’s Sith Order.
Revan would also use the Sith Academy as a place of research and discovery, making a large part of the Sith curriculum be focused around develing into the various tombs and grave sites of dead Sith.

Many of the tombs during Revan’s reign would be stripped of their most desirable artifacts as a result of the archaeological and discovery efforts undertaken at the Sith Academy.
Quite often the final test of a Sith Acolyte would be to delve into these perilous tombs and recover some form of secret or ancient artifact.

After the destruction of Revan’s Sith Empire the Sith Academy and Valley of the Dark Lords would once again be left dormant.
A place ripe with wildlife activity, smugglers, pirates and other undesirables.
The Galactic Republic would blockade Korriban until the emergence of a new Sith threat would come to retake the planet for its rightful owners.

The Sith Empire would return in 3681 BBY and immediately reconquer Korriban, putting to good use the Sith Academy there by rebuilding it almost entirely.
Under the control of Darth Thanaton the archaeological efforts into the Valley of the Dark Lords would resume and the site would once again be used to train the followers of the Darkside.

Throughout the Sith Empire’s existence, the Sith Academy and Valley of the Dark Lords would suffer from constant attacks from various Republic and Jedi strike forces.
The Sith Academy in the Valley of the Dark Lords would become extremely efficient at producing Sith for the Empire’s War Machine and as a result it became a prime target for anybody seeking to undermine the Empire’s efforts.

After the destruction of the Sith Empire, the Valley of the Dark Lords would again be left abandoned.
A former shell of the activity that once flowed through its tombs, dig sites and training grounds.
The Valley of the Dark

1000 BBY - Today

The Brotherhood of Darkness during their war against the Jedi Order reopened the Sith Academy in an entirely new location as they believed the Valley of the Dark Lords to be scavenged and ravaged beyond repair.

The Valley of the Dark Lords would remain largely inactive.
The Jedi Order would rarely visit the planet and would typically only do so in extreme circumstances.
It wouldn’t be until 14 ABY that a group of Darkside Acolytes calling themselves the Disciples of Ragnos would undertake a restoration effort to restore the valley to its former glory.
In many areas they would be successful and would even discover many tombs hidden after its destruction in 5000 BBY.
However, once more the Jedi Order would prove to be the bane of Korriban.
A strike force from Luke Skywalker’s Jedi Order would wipe out the Disciples of Ragnos and seal all of the newly discovered tombs.

The One Sith would return to Korriban roughly a century later to establish its covert headquarters but their use of the Valley of the Dark Lords and ancient Sith Academy is all but unknown.
Though it is unlikely they would not at least have dedicated some effort towards exploring the site in their many years hiding on Korriban.

# Layout of The Valley

Sith Lords are rarely humble, even less so when constructing monuments to themselves.
The Valley of the Dark Lords is only accompanied by the ancient Sith Academy raised beside it.
Beyond that the valley is surrounded by wild wastelands occupied by all manner of wildlife and Darkside creatures.

The most prominent architecture within the valley is that of the towering statues of six unknown figures who bow in submittance of the power of those buried nearby.
The valley is divided into two areas, the Upper-Valley and Lower-Valley.

Upper-Valley

Tomb of Naga Sadow
Tomb of Ludo Kressh
Tomb of Ajunta Pall

At the entrance to the valley the Tomb of XoXaan can be found and towards the back walls of the valley the ancient and derelict Sith Academy can be found.

The locations of the remaining tombs are unknown due to the condition of the grave site.
