# Overview
The Starlight Beacon, simply known as “Starlight”, was a space station created during the High Republic Era, in the Outer Rim.
It is situated in the middle of the region’s unexplored dark zones.
At the time of its construction, the region was difficult to navigate, and once it was complete, it was launched in 232 BBY.
It acted as a beacon, sending out signals that guided explorers.
Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh was proud of the Starlight Beacon, being one of their Great Works, and was officially opened in the aftermath of the Great Disaster on the deadline that Soh had set exactly.
Dignitaries from across the galaxy visited to see this great Beacon at last, including notable Jedi, Avar Kriss, Bell Zettifar, Indeera Stokes, Porter Engle, Elzar Mann, and even someone who rarely leaves Coruscant, Grand Master Yoda.
The Starlight Beacon was initially intended to run as a military station if needed, including strong fortuitous security from the Republic Defense Coalition.
The Beacon also worked as a hospital, observatory, research station, market, and cultural center, giving the visitors of the Beacon a glimpse into the many cultures of countless worlds in the Republic.
The Jedi stationed at the Beacon was initially supposed to be led by Jedi Master Jora Malli, but due to their passing at the Battle of Kur, Avar Kriss was assigned in their place.
The Station was made out of 19% Triazurite, a rare element that boosted the transmission signals from the station.
Years later, around 3 ABY, Commander Grek of the Rebel Alliance, would be known to utilize the Starlight Beacon as inspiration for “Operation Starlight”,
