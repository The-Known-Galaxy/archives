# Overview
Located on the volcanic planet of Mustafar was an ancient Sith temple in the Gahenn Plains.
The temple was built on top of a cave, which housed a special and unique Dark Side locus.
This temple was destroyed sometime before the Clone Wars.
The location of the temple was known to the famous Sith Lord Darth Sidious.
Sidious owned a secret facility, which was where the notorious Bounty Hunter Cad Bane delivered the Force-sensitive children to Sidious during the Clone Wars.
Sidious adopted a new apprentice, Darth Vader, who became a Dark Lord of the Sith.
Vader and Sidious built a tower for Darth Vader, named Fortress Vader, on the site of the former Sith temple.
