# Overview
Thule was a planet located in the Outer Rim territories, notably in the Esstran Sector, the planet acted as a dark side fortress for the majority of its history.
The planet interested the Sith for the status of being a Force Nexus leading to its colonization in the year 6900 BBY by the Sith purebloods.

# The Sith Temple of Hurom
The Temple of Hurom was located in the capital city of Thule, it was erected by the ancient Sith who first colonized the planet.
The temple was notably grandiose in size, spanning a whole city block, and as such dominated the surrounding area for miles.
Given the prominent location of the temple, it served great purposes, for one it acted as a formal meeting place for prominent Sith leaders on Thule, it also housed the residency for the Sith priests who by harnessing the powers of the darkness situated in the temple were granted visions by the force, most prominently that of the Clone Wars yet to transpire.



# The Sith Temple of Kessiak
The city of Kessiak also harbored its own Sith temple, despite being situated outside of the capital its importance was still that of utmost concern, for this temple housed the  Sith superweapon: The Dark Reaper.
A weapon that ripped the force from a target and concentrated it into a deadly beam.
However, in 22 BBY the sanctity of the temple was defiled as Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker breached the temple and destroyed the weapon in a bid to prevent Darth Tyrannus from utilizing the weapon.



# Academy of Sith Arts
Situated in an unknown region of Thule was the Academy of Sith Arts.
The purpose of such an academy was the training of force sensitives in the ways of the Dark Side so that they may serve the order on Thule.
The academy remained undisturbed until fallen Jedi Knight Drevveka Hoctu stumbled across the Academy during her banishment, she decided to situate herself at the academy and take up teaching.
Despite occupying the role of teaching she was never given the title of headmaster which caused hatred within the Fallen Jedi.
Notably, during Hoctu’s tenure, the academy had a great focus on deprivation training and survivalist exercises in order to strengthen her students' reliance on the Dark Side.
