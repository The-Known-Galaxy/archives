# Overview
The Valley of Golg was one of the many Sith burial sites constructed along the valleys of the ancient Sith homeworld of Korriban, also sometimes referred to by outsiders and non-Sith as Moraband, by the ancient Sith Empire of old.
Its location was built near the equator of the planet.
According to surveys made by a pirate vessel, named Jynni’s Virtue, the valley stretched for at least a hundred kilometers or more, and at one point the canyon's floor was as deep as twelve hundred meters.
Its walls were lined with tombs, similar to that of the Valley of the Dark Lords, and was covered with, what was hypothesized to be, runes of protective Sith magic.
What made the valley additionally noteworthy was the containment of the tomb of a notable Sith King, Dathka Graush.
Dathka Graush was a pure-blooded male Sith sorcerer born on the planet Korriban about seven thousand years before the Battle of Yavin.
It is believed he ascended to the rank of Sith King following the death of the prior Sith King Adas, and subsequently fell at the hands of assassins sometime around 6950 BBY.
After his death he was entombed in the Valley of Golg where he remains to this day.
