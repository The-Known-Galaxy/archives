# Overview
The Dark Force Temple was a Sith Temple located on Dromund Kaas, the capital of The Reconstituted Sith Empire.
The temple structure was so orientated in The Dark Side that it became an historical dark side nexus.

# History
The Temple was constructed after the fall of the Sith Empire following the Great Hyperspace war.
While its old history has been lost, it was rediscovered by the Sith during the Light and Darkness war.
Darth Millennial, a Sith Apprentice who rejected Darth Bane's Rule of Two, found the site that the Temple would come to be inhabited again.
Founding the Dark Force religion on Dromund Kaas, Millennial and his disciples claimed the Temple as their headquarters, operating out of it for centuries.
The clergymen of this Order, known as the Prophets of the Dark Side, were approached by Darth Sidious sometime after the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire, and eventually were integrated into the Empire as the Secret Order of the Empire.
During the Galactic Empire, Prophets such as Lord Cronal created Sithspawn such as Gorc, Pic, and mutated Noghri.
The Temple served as a training ground for many of the Emperor's dark side servants, including Grand Admiral Nial Declann, and was the childhood home of Cronal's daughter, Sariss.
Following the rift between the Supreme Prophet Kadann and Darth Sidious, the Prophets abandoned Dromund Kaas and fled into hiding on Bosthirda.
The Temple remained a place of the dark side, however, and it was within its walls that Kyle Katarn fell to the dark side.
Mara Jade fought her way past Sithspawned Noghri, Dianoga and Vornskrs to redeem her Master, barely escaping the world alive.
