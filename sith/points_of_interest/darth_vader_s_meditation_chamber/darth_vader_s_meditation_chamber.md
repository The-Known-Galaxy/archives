# Overview
Darth Vader's meditation chamber was a life support pod that allowed him to survive for extended periods without the helmet and mask of his suit.
The damages Vader sustained during his duel against Obi-Wan Kenobi on Mustafar made this impossible.

# History
Five years after the rise of the Galactic Empire, Darth Vader was in possession of a meditation chamber that he ordered to be transferred from a Victory-class Star Destroyer to Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's Carrion Spike for their mission to Murkhana.
During the transfer, Vader selected a Dozen Stormtroopers to accompany him and had them load the chamber onto Tarkin's corvette.
During the maneuver, the sphere collided briefly with the edge of the ship's cargo hold hatch, for which Vader grew angry at Sergeant Crest, the one controlling the repulsorlift crane.
When the Carrion Spike was stolen by Berch Teller's rebel cell, Vader used the meditation chamber as a homing beacon of sorts, allowing him to track and pinpoint the rebels' exact location despite the Corvette's stealth system.
Thanks to it, the Sith Lord and Tarkin pursued the ship from Murkhana to the Fial and Galidraan systems.
During the Imperial attack on Galidraan Station, Teller and Artoz decided to jettison the device just as they made their escape to Lucazec.
