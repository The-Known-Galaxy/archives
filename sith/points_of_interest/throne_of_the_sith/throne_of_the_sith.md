# Overview
The Throne of the Sith, also known as the Dark Throne, was located on the Sith planet Exegol.
It was located within the Sith Citadel on Exegol.
The Sith planet had a secret chamber for those who were loyal to the Sith.
One of the most famous Dark Lords of the Sith, Darth Sidious, sought to find the Throne and was successful.
He claimed the seat and the eternal Sith Empire for himself, and was so powerful with the Throne because he had the power of all the Sith.
During the battle of Exegol, the Throne and Sidious with it were destroyed by Sidious’ grandchild, Rey.
With the death of Sidious, the Galaxy was free from the First Order, Sith Empire, and the Galactic Empire.
This made Sidious’ long rule of tyranny come to an end.
