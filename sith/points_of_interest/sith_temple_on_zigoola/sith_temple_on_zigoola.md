# Overview
On the planet Zigoola there was an ancient Sith Temple.
This temple was a beautiful structure, made of reddish-black stone and used as a place where the famous Dark Lord of the Sith, Sidious, could hoard his artifacts.
During the Clone Wars, Senator Bail Organa and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi tracked down the temple, using information from a contact of Bail’s.
The presence of the Dark Side was so strong within the temple that Kenobi himself started being exposed to mental attacks.
These mental attacks were caused by an ancient and powerful Sith Holocron.
Bail realized what was going on and he had to act quickly, so he destroyed the powerful Holocron.
Unfortunately for the Jedi Council, the temple was destroyed and they couldn’t study the powerful Sith artifacts within the temple.
However, Bail’s actions did save Obi-Wan Kenobi.
