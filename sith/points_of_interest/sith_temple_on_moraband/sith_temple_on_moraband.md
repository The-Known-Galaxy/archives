# Overview
This incredible pyramid-like structure was an ancient Sith Temple.
It was known for holding the legendary Sword of Khashyun, an ancient artifact.
The Temple was very well guarded, and was specifically guarded by giant sentries and Tuk’atas.
Not only was it guarded by these horrifying creatures, but it was also covered in booby traps to prevent any trespassers.
A young archaeologist by the name of Chelli Lona Alphra, stole an ancient map during her time at the university of Bar’leth, which led her to the well hidden artifact on Moraband.
