# Section 1

The Tomb of Ludo Kressh was constructed on Korriban within the Valley of the Dark Lord.
Slave labor was used to create Ludo Kressh’s tomb.
Ludo Kressh’s tomb was prepared for him in the year 5000 BBY, after the death of Ludo Kressh in the attack on Korriban during the Great Hyperspace War.
Ludo Kressh’s body would be recovered after the battle and placed in the tomb's heart.

Soon after Ludo Kressh’s death and burial, the Sith Empire would be brought to ruin, and the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic would order the destruction of Korriban, thus causing Ludo Kressh and his tomb to be buried under rubble for millennia.

# Section 2

During a war called the Dark Wars, which took place just a few years after the Jedi Civil War,  a former Jedi named Meetra Surik would travel to Korriban in search of a lost Jedi.
During Surik's travels, however, she discovers a cavern on the planet and fights waves of shyracks and hssiss just to enter the crypt.
Once inside the crypt, Surik would discover that the tomb had several curses placed on it to cause illusions to be projected into the minds of intruders of several dead Jedi bodies and would deduce that they were driven mad in the tomb and killed each other.
Surik would guard herself from the tomb curses and open herself up to the force.
This would lead him to see visions of Darth Malak, as well as Bastilla Shan, and even Darth Revan.
Surik would be forced to fight these visions, and she would beat and strike down all visions that attacked her, and she would escape the tomb.
