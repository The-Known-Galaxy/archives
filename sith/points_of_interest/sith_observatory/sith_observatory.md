# Overview

The Sanbra region of the Beheboth system in the Outer Rim Territories contains the Hebine Ring, an asteroid belt, which is home to a Sith observatory.
The Sith had built the observatory long before the Battle of Yavin, and it contained a wealth of stellar resources, making the ring an important stop for the order.
This significance was largely attributable to a prehistoric artifact that was kept in the observatory.
About 3643 BBY, a dispersed member, whose allegiance is still unknown, noticed the artifact pointing to the Hebine Ring and dispatched a disposable member to investigate the asteroid belt.
He was able to locate the observatory's ruins and discovered that the star's reserve was unharmed.
No further investigation has been made of this place and therefore no more information is known.
