# Overview

The Maw, also referred to as the Maw Cluster, was an unstable and almost non-navigational cluster of black holes located near the well known planet called Kessel.
Despite being a group of black holes, the Maw was visible to the naked eye due to the ionizing gasses that the Maw drew into it.

The cluster's stability and integrity were a mystery, however, with some theorizing that rather than it being a normal clustering of black holes it was instead a construct of an advanced alien civilization.
Sometime around 44 ABY the New Jedi Order had learned from the Thuruht hive that the purpose of the Maw was that it acted as a prison for a Dark Side entity known as Abeloth, also known as the Mother.

The origins and creation of the Maw can be traced to Thuruht and other Killik hives.
To help with keeping Abeloth locked away, the entities known as the Son and Daughter helped by not only joining with the hivemind but by directing the Killiks in creating both the Centerpoint Station and the Sinkhole Station.
The purpose of Centerpoint was to create the Maw while the Sinkhole would maintain it from within.

# Description

The Maw was a cluster of black holes located within the Kessel Sector, which was located in the Outer Rim Territories, and was nestled at the center of the Maw Nebulae.
The Maw was visible to the naked eye due to ionizing gasses that the Maw drew towards it, which helped with it being categorized as one of the many Wonders of the Galaxy.

Because of the intense gravity projected by the cluster of black holes, the entire Kessel System was slowly drawn into the Maw as a consequence.
The integrity of the Maw, however, was a mystery to most.
Some believed it was held together due to careful construction by an advanced alien civilization rather than it being a result of the normal clustering of black holes.

The area surrounding the Maw was infamous for its strong gravitational forces and vast amounts of radiation and plasma that saturated it.
Any ship that neared the Maw’s edge would have parts of it pulled off.
Because of this hazard that turned most civilian shuttles away, smugglers and criminals would primarily use it as a shortcut past the Kessel Run, a roughly 20-parsecs route they would also use.

# History

Eons before the Battle of Yavin, a group of entities called The Ones would use a station they constructed called Centrepoint Station to help create the Maw while another station they also constructed called Sinkhole Station would help to maintain its integrity from within it, as such helping to keep the Dark Side entity Abeloth locked away inside the Maw.

Sometime during the Xim Wars, a number of warships from Xim’s Empire would be forced to retreat to Kessel, where several of the warships were lost to the Maw.

During the Imperial Era, the Maw was being used as the site of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's Maw Installation, where the Death Star Prototype and most of the First Death Star was built in secret, although it was completed later at the planet Despayre.

Tarkin theorized that the Maws' near-impossible accessibility matched with its remoteness made it the perfect spot to hide the project from the public eye.
However, the installation was in reality located within a safe zone inside of the cluster which was discovered just before the start of the project.

A planetoid near the Maw was also used as the site of an Imperial Detention Centre which would be the target of an assault by the Rebel Alliance’s famous Rogue Squadron after the Battle of Hoth somewhere around 3 ABY, during which a number of prisoners housed there escaped and the prison would be destroyed.

The Maw would also be the location of which an infamous superweapon, known as the Sun Crusher, would be constructed, but it would also be the place where the superweapon would also be destroyed.
Its destruction was a result of being sent into one of the black holes inside the Maw.
Other notable superweapons built inside the Maw were the World Devastators, the Tarkin, the Iconic Ring Ship, and the Galaxy Gun.

Post-Galactic Civil War, during the Yuuzhan Vong War, Lando Calrissian would sponsor the construction of a space station called Shelter within the Maw, also helping with its construction was the remains of the prior Maw Installation, as a refuge for Jedi Knights.
Shelter would be located at the very heart of the Maw and at one point would house the wartime generation of Jedi Padawans along with surviving Jedi Praxeum students.

Around 43 ABY, Luke Skywalker along with his son Ben Skywalker would visit the Maw during their journey to discover why Jacen Solo fell to the Dark Side.
Within the Maw, they would discover the Sinkhole Station along with the Mind Walkers, Force-Sensitives who resided within the Sinkhole Station and were capable of separating their minds from their bodies using the Force.

In 44 ABY, during the New Jedi Order’s conflict with the entity Abeloth, who was imprisoned inside the Maw, the Order would learn from the Thuruht hive that the Maw was created by Thuruht and other Killik hives to serve as a prison for Abeloth, also known as the Mother.
