# Overview

Mustafar was a luxuriant and forested terrestrial world, flourishing with life through the Bright Star.
Some stories argued that due to a cataclysmic battle between the Sith and the Jedi factions millennia before the Empire, the planet had become a burning wasteland.
During the Clone Wars, it acted as the final redoubt of the Separatist Council until Darth Sidious slaughtered the council by using the newly appointed Apprentice Darth Vader.
This planet also performed as the battle between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi,  effectively ending the Wars.

# Sith Cave's construction and purpose

Vader's Castle was a fortress above the Sith Cave of Mustafar; Vader would use this fortress as his base of operations to carry out missions from his master.
This fortress contained a Bacta Tank which Vader would use to rest and heal inside.
The construction of the Fortress took 2 years due to the complications in the battle between Mustafrians, which ended when Darth Vader used the Dark Side of the Force to rain Lava on them.
Vader, with the help of Darth Momim, had worked together to build this fortress to withstand almost everything.
There were 7 attempts to build this Fortress, and every time Vader would try to inhabit someone's body by using his spirit to build it.
This Fortress would also be built near the battle between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi.
This was to infuriate Vader and make him rage, making a path to use the Dark Side of the Force.
Vader had tried many times to open the Gates to the Sith Cave, but due to the Lava Flies which infested the planet, it would be difficult since they would interrupt the meditation.
Vader soon unlocked the Doors and was able to use the Sith Caves' malicious energy to grow his connection to the Dark Side.
