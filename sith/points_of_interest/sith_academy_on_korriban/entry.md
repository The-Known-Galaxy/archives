# Introduction

The Sith Academy located on Korriban was a structure built by the Disciples of Exar Kun during the Great Sith War.
This facility was devised to enlighten force-sensitives in the ways of the Dark Side as well as to uncover the mysteries of the Valley of the Dark Lords.
Quite a multitude of Sith organizations utilized this ancient ground for centuries such as the Brotherhood of Darkness, the True Sith Empire, and even Darth Revan’s Sith Empire.

# Design

This academy was constructed with stone and durasteel that reflected the light of the sun at its core.
Giving off a pyramid-like structure, the entrance consisted of a wide stairwell leading up to the gateway.
The opening of the academy and its base was further supported by two humanoid statues that held the frame near the entrance, acting as a symbol of the great power the Sith possessed.
Beyond the main hall was the center that consisted of two dual staircases that formed a path to the higher levels of the Academy.
This center area also had a statue made of stone, faces of the Sith engraved into them.
These statues acted as a symbol to the students that represented the importance of destroying those that seek power as well.
The first layer of the Academy consisted of a variety of chambers meant for training, lecturing, meditation, and even a jail area to keep prisoners.
As for the second layers, they contained yet another variety of different rooms for the basic protocol curriculum of the Sith Academy.

By the time the reconstituted Sith Empire held control over Korriban once more, they also made a few renovations to the Sith Academy’s layout during its reconstruction.
The Dark Council chambers had been introduced on the second layer as a chamber for the Dark Council to congregate in to discuss matters pertaining to the Sith Empire and its welfare.
In addition, the Sith Archives shifted from the main hall into its own separate room with multiple layers consisting of holocrons, data tablets, holobooks, and many other pieces of technology that stored information.
Chambers for rituals were also established to allow the many different Acolytes to prove their worth in the Sith Academy.
The higher levels contained different rooms for the

# Academic Curriculum:

To even be accepted into the Sith Academy and its teachings, one had to obtain a Sith Medallion as a mark of their impressive and promising skill.
Those that sought to get their hands on one of these medallions were referred to as Hopefuls by the Sith and other inhabitants of Korriban.
Jedi that happened to fall to the Dark Side had a far easier time being admitted into the Sith Academy given their previous experiences.
To progress, an Acolyte had to achieve prestige by demonstrating skill through competitive tests, plenty of which pitted Acolytes against each other.
Life did not come easy within the Sith Academy, as plenty of Acolytes met their demise at the hands of other Acolytes or even the instructors in the Academy.
Academic Curriculum held no punishment for those that chose to destroy others in hopes to ascend, not even the Headmaster was safe as observed when Uthar Wynn was killed during his time as the Academy’s Headmaster.
For one to be given a greater adventure and ascension in the Sith Academy, they had to become an Apprentice.

# Foundation of the Sith Academy:

Korriban’s Sith Academy was erected sometime in 3996 BBY by the Brotherhood of Sith led by Exar Kun during the dawn of the Great Sith War.
The Jedi were well aware of the existence of this Sith Academy, but didn’t choose to invade Korriban and its contents until the conclusion of the war.
Jorak Uln was instated into the Sith Academy as the Headmaster upon its finalized product.
Following the destruction of the Brotherhood of the Sith as a result of the Great Sith War, the Sith Academy was abandoned and remained untouched until two Sith Lords later in the years decided to reopen the Sith Academy.

# Darth Revan's Sith Academy

With the near-destruction of the original Sith Academy on Korriban, two Sith Lords known as Darth Malak and Darth Revan returned to Korriban during the Mandalorian Wars to re-establish the Sith Academy.
Their ultimate goal was to train an army of warriors to fight in their Empire.
Jorak Uln eventually was replaced as the Headmaster, being succeeded by Uthar Wynn, the next Headmaster that acted as oversight of the Sith Academy during Lord Revan’s rule.
Upon Revan’s capture by the Jedi, his memory was erased.
He returned to Korriban and killed Uthar Wynn with the assistance of his apprentice Yuthar Ban.
In response to the death of the Headmaster, the Sith Academy descended into chaos and anarchy.
The majority of the academic students present were killed by Revan as well after guards grew suspicious of Revan and decided to assault him with nearly all of the academy which resulted in their death.
With the end of the Jedi Civil War and the beginning of the Sith Civil War, the Sith Academy remained abandoned, many inhabitants and other travelers of Korriban looting what remained of this training ground.

# The Last Reformation

The Brotherhood of Darkness eventually took Korriban for themselves in 1006 BBY.
During this time, Qordis served as the Headmaster of the Sith Academy.
Though, the re-establishment of a new Academy was the very reason for the destruction of the Brotherhood of Darkness.
Powerful Sith Lords had been trained within this academy, most notably, Darth Bane who went on to create his own rule by erasing the Brotherhood of Darkness from the galaxy.
The content in the Sith Archives also expanded more than ever in the Sith Academy established by the Brotherhood of Darkness.
After this new group of Sith fell at the hands of Darth Bane, their academy went with them and thus it remained abandoned and forgotten.
