# Overview

Located on Ashas Ree, this temple contained a relic with an immense power source.
Traps were rumored to be scattered around the Sith temple.
Pressure plates scattered around the floor and on the relic itself would be found guarding this powerful item.
Eventually it was buried and replaced with a Jedi temple in an attempt to seal the dark side found inside of it.
In 34 ABY the temple was unearthed by Mika Grey, a resident of the planet, who reportedly secured the relic before the First Order could find it.
The temple was later destroyed when a fellow resident by the name Xiono accidently activated a Sith glyph causing its collapse.
Thus ended the temple's history.
