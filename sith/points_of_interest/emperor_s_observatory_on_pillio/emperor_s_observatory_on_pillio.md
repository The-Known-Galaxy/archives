# Description
Emperor Palpatine's Observatory is located on the planet Pillio and was constructed in 4 ABY.
This Observatory could only be opened with the help of the force .It was one of the many observatories scattered across the galaxy.
Each one was a part of his goal to find out what was beyond the known galaxy.
Compared to all the other observatories, this one is full of artifacts from the Emperor's personal collection.
This entire place was underground and could only be opened through the force, so it made it difficult for outsiders to enter.

# History
During the Clone Wars, while Palpatine was the Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine sensed a call from past the galactic rim.
This gave him the urge to explore the unknown regions of the galaxy.
He even theorized that the outer rim could be the source of his dark side powers.
He responded to this feeling by placing observatories all around the galaxies for exploration and to store his important artifacts.
In 4 ABY, Palpatine-ruler of the galaxy was killed in the battle of Endor.
After the battle , Del Meeko was given a task to lead troopers to Pillio in order to destroy the Observatory.

In 4 ABY, after Palpatine's death, the Emperor's Observatory was found by Luke Skywalker and the Imperial Agent Del Meeko of Inferno Squad.
Meeko's orders were to destroy the observatory, although Skywalker convinced him to avoid any possible damage to the planet Pillio because the empire has done enough to innocent planets.
After this, Skywalker left the planet Pillio with a compass that he had sensed held great importance.
