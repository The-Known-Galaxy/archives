# Overview

The Trayus Academy stood as a reminder and heed to the Sith, a place so ancient and rooted in darkness.
This academy was situated on the planet of Malachor V, where its deep connection to the Dark Side of the Force stood as a corrupting factor to many Jedi and outsiders that have come before it; a place so evil it had become taboo to the Mandalorians.
It served as the pivotal grounds for the ascension of many Sith, serving many ends from Darth Revan to the Sith Triumvirate and the Sith Assassins.

# Foundation and History

The Academy was established and built as proving grounds for the ancient Sith, who developed the site in Malachor V.
It served its purpose well for a span of hundreds of years, growing attached to the Dark Side for each malice and atrocity within its confinements.
In the midst of the Mandalorian Wars, a Jedi known as Revan would rediscover the planet's surface, wishing to learn why the Mandalorians disdain it in its entirety.
There, he discovers Trayus Academy amidst the ruins of cities and countless Sith knowledge and artifacts left behind before their abrupt exodus as well as the coordinates of Korriban giving him proof that the Sith do indeed endure beyond the Unknown Regions.

```
Malachor V would become a pivotal part in the climax of the Mandalorian Wars, serving as Revan’s lure for Mandalore the Ultimate and his armada.
```

The Republic forces would bait the Mandalorians into entering the system’s proximity where fierce fighting would ensue, resulting in Revan’s trusted general Meetra Surik deploying the Mass Shadow Generator which tore through Malachor’s core and surface as well as the ships that fought above.
Through coincidence or other circumstances yet unknown, Trayus Academy remained intact and persisted on the now decimated planet; a home of countless thousands left dead.
Revan’s curiosity towards the pioneers of the Academy would result in him and his companion Alek venturing into the Unknown Regions where they would come into contact with the True Sith.

```
Following the Sith Emperor’s mind control and takeover of the two Jedi, Revan would be bestowed the title Darth and thus making him Darth Revan, as he would return to Republic space in pursuit of the discovery of a lost Rakatan superweapon, the Star Forge.
```

This Star Forge would become Revan’s power base, as it built arms and entire ships for his conquest of the Galactic Republic.
With his defeat at the hands of the Jedi soon after in the Galactic Civil War, Revan now redeemed would once more return to the Unknown Regions in search of the True Sith whilst his former master and mentor Kreia would embark on her own journey to the shattered planet of Malachor V, coming upon Trayus Academy.

# Destruction and Legacy

With Darth Traya’s discovery of Trayus Academy, it would serve as the power base for the Sith Triumvirate, where she would train her apprentices Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus.
The Triumvirate’s purge of the Jedi from the Galaxy would come in full sway with their Sith Assassins eliminating the Jedi Order to the brink of total extermination left to only a handful of masters.
As Traya sought to end the Force in perpetuity, her apprentices would abruptly betray her, removing her of her power and effectively exiling her.

```
The Jedi Exile, Meetra Surik would be discovered by Traya soon after, uncorrupted due to her severance from the Force.
```

She later became Traya’s tool in the extermination of both of her former apprentices, as she would orchestrate a final conclusion between her and Surik.
At the hands of Surik, she killed both Nihilus and Traya in subsequent lightsaber duels, ending the stain on the Force that is Malachor by reactivating the Mass Shadow Generator.
