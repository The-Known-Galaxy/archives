# Introduction

The Galactic Empire was known to be a threat across the galaxy, one of their iconic moments of power was the creation of the superweapon, the Death Star; a power space station in the form of a moon that could destroy entire planets while also holding a fleet inside for protection.
The Death Star was operated by none other than Grand Moff Tarkin who was a smart Moff and a serious problem for all who opposed him on the battlefield.

# Structure

The Death Star had many tactical advantages such as being an indestructible machine of destruction, and near-impenetrable to enemy fleets.
This structure was able to be used as a massive defensive base for the many empire soldiers running the Death Star.
It had many operating systems such as a sector for each commanding title, such as general, security, military, command, service, and technical.
It also had a general store location which acted as a gathering for citizens to come in and sell or buy on the Death Star.
The Death Star was 120 km in diameter and had a trench in the middle of the weapon that was 503 km and was the main operating part for the fleet, the trench would act as an operating system for the tractor beams, the fleet, and the many soldiers that would be ready for an attack should a curious, unauthorized, civilian decided to enter with a clearance.
The Death Star had but one main weapon attached to the top of the station, a very large blaster that was powered by ion engines and was attached to 123 hyperdrive field generators to create an ultimate blaster that is capable of destroying entire planets.

# History

The Death Star did not start with a simple creation of blueprints, the Empire was unfortunately not smart enough to plan such an idea, this was originally planned by a man called Raith Sienar who make the idea and blueprints for the Death Star, however, he would find the plans useless and have many flaws.
Raith would send his plans to his closest friend Wilhuf Tarkin who would deliver the plans to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and would be considered impressed by the plans.
The schematics would end up being taken into work by the geonosians who were amazing scientists, they would look to perfect the plans and make them into a working system as the plans were incomplete.
During the time of the battle of Geonosis, the Clones that were made by Darth Sidious would be released by the Jedi to help them raid Geonosis and make sure their intentions are taken care of.
The outline for the Death Star would be safe from the Jedi clutches and would be delivered personally by Darth Tyranus to his mentor Darth Sidious.
This act of desperation would make sure that the now completed plans are kept from the Jedi and to make sure that once Darth Sidiousâ€™ plans were so, the Galaxy would finally witness the Death Star and fear at its marvelous showcase.
During the end of the Jedi Order during the Jedi Purge, the Empire would finally begin construction of the Death Star creating a superweapon that would bring fear and order across the galaxy.
