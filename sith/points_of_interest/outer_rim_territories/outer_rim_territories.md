# Overview

The Outer Rim is the largest and least densely populated region of the galaxy, with most of it's inhabitants being scattered.
The Outer Rim is home to notable planets such as Tatooine, Geonosis, Mustafar, and Korriban.
The region is mostly run by crime organizations such as the Hutt Cartel, with them even having their own space called the "Hutt Cartel".
The Outer Rim's sheer size made full control over it by a faction impossible as the resources and manpower required would reach billions.
Rebellions were also prone in the region as the difference between the Core Worlds and Outer Rim planets was major to the point citizens would resent and spark rebellions.
Although parts of the Outer Rim were colonized by factions such as the Republic and Empire, controlling the colonized planets was tough.
Pirates and smugglers plagued the Outer Rims as there were little to no patrol forces in the region; sometimes, even the pirates hijack unsuspecting transport fleets because hiding in the Outer Rims was easy.
During the Clone Wars, the Outer Rim was contested by the Republic and Confederation due to the number of resources on some planets.
This soon made the Outer Rims a staging ground for war, with most wars such as the Cold War mostly taking place in the Outer Rims.
In the decades that passed, full control over the Outer Rim is still impossible as crime organizations, pirates, smugglers, and more evil plague the region.
