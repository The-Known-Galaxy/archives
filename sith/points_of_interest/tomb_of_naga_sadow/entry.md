# Overview

Naga Sadow’s tomb was one of the many ancient monuments found in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban, by the command of Tulak Hord despite the fact that the latter existed centuries before Sadow was even born.
Multiple centuries after the construction of the tomb, it was believed to be the final resting place of the legendary Dark Lord, but Sadow’s true corpse was buried in a separate tomb located on Yavin IV constructed by Massassi slaves.
Despite this, it was still venerated as the tomb of Naga Sadow and has been a focal point in the history of many esteemed Sith.

# History

The tomb had been constructed as the final resting place of Naga Sadow long before he was born and he never ended up in it as he spent the last of his days on Yavin IV, a moon of the gas giant Yavin Prime.
Despite not being used for its original purpose, the tomb would become a significant location in galactic history as it housed a fabled piece of ancient technology from the bygone and powerful Rakatan Empire, a Star Map.
Star Maps were imbued with the dark side, pieces of technology that could self-repair and lead to one of the most devastating constructs of the galaxy, the Star Forge.
During the Jedi Civil War, Revan’s Sith had taken control of Korriban and the Sith Academy used the tomb of Naga Sadow as a final testing grounds for Sith-aspirants.
Those who died would be forgotten, those who lived would be embraced into the ranks of a powerful legion.

Revan himself had twice entered the tomb, the first time in search of the Star Forge which he would later succeed in finding, and the second time when his identity was forgotten to himself, killing the headmaster of the academy Uthar Wynn and proceeding to bring Wynn’s apprentice, Yuthura Ban to the light side.
In 3951 BBY, Meetra Surik attempted to enter the tomb while on her journey of destroying the Sith Triumvirate that had devastated the galaxy and wiped out most of the Jedi.
The Jedi Exile failed to break in due to the fact the entrance was blocked.

During the Republic-Sith War, the Reconstituted Sith Empire had reclaimed Korriban and re-established the academy there.
Many acolytes would traverse the tombs including Naga Sadow’s by the tasks provided to them by their Overseers.
Overseer Harkun, a belligerent and aggressive man sent a batch of acolytes close to completing their trials to retrieve an ancient map from the tomb.
Only one of these acolytes succeeded by freeing a slumbering Dashade assassin known as Khem Val, an ancient and devout servant of Tulak Hord.
They killed a Terentatek to successfully retrieve the map and the acolyte would go on to become a feared Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Nox.
The Master of the Dead, Heir of Tulak Hord and Kallig.
Thereafter, a Sith who showed great promise was sent by Darth Baras to retrieve an ancient lightsaber from the tomb as their last trial with the assistance of a Twi’lek that discovered the hidden path.
Within the old chamber, the Sith defeated the ancient droids that protected the area with ease and successfully claimed the ancient lightsaber.
The Sith would eventually use their fury and lightsaber skill to kill Darth Baras and become known in history as the Empire’s Wrath.
