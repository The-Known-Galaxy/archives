# Information
The planet of Lehon was the homeworld to the species called the Rakata or Rakatans, where they once had their Infinite Empire..
Lehon was described as a tropical world and was recorded to be in a remote part of the galaxy known as the Tempered Wastes.
The planet of Lehon was greatly covered in water with many clusters of small islands and archipelagos, and was documented to be the only habitable planet within the Lehon system.
Two small moons also orbited the planet and one of the moons was very close to the point that it was visible during the day.

# Section 1
Millennia before the Galactic Republic, the planet was home to the Rakata and their Infinite Empire.
The planet of Lehon was made into the capital of the Infinite Empire.
The Rakata were a scientifically advanced civilization, where they were documented to be Force-sensitive beings who would use their knowledge to subjugate other species that would be considered less developed.
The Rakata would use the semi-sentient Star Forge to create and mass-produce battle droids and starships.
The Rakata would build large cities on the planet's surface, which would later become crumbling ruins that the jungle would take over.
The Rakatans would devolve into warring tribes as the Infinite Empire would collapse due to widespread slave rebellions.
This would cause them to retreat to their homeworld of Lehon and retreat underground as the planet had become mostly uninhabitable.



# Section 2
During the reign of the Galatic Republic, various Rakatan tribes would emerge from underground back onto the surface.
The Rakatans would use the advanced technologies they had created long ago to isolate and guard their forbidden lore in the Temple of the Ancients located on the planet's surface.

The planet itself was protected by a disruptor field that could disrupt and disable ship communications and navigational systems.

Lehon would be visited by Reven twice, once in the year 3956 BBY and another time in 3959 BBY during the Jedi Civil War.
Both times, Revan visited Lehon he would use the aid of the Eldar Rakata tribe to enter the Temple of the Ancients and he would later be granted access to the Star Forge.



# Section 3
After the Jedi Civil War, the entire Lehon system was littered with the wreck of the Star Forge and other shipwrecks.
Lehon itself would become surrounded with asteroid-like rubble that would make travel to and from the surface dangerous.
The ring rubble surrounding the planet would have been a great source of resources for the Republic but they decided to make the Lehon system a protected historical site.

Revan would later return to Lehon with a group of fanatics in hopes of building an army to fight the Sith.
He would make the Temple of Ancients his base of operations while on Lehon.
However, his base of operations would be assaulted by a mix of Republic and Sith loyalists, where his lieutenants would be killed, and would cause him to flee the planet.
