# Introduction
The Sith Academy on Umbara was founded by the Brotherhood of Darkness at the end of the New Sith Wars.
It was one of several academies used for training Sith, and specialized in training assassins and spies.
Students at this academy were taught the ways of the Dark Side of the Force and later learned to master secrecy and deception.
Because of this, the students preferred to use the Force to kill, making them some of the deadliest assassins across the galaxy.

During the Clone Wars, various Sith met up at the ruins of the academy, including Darth Maul and his brother, Savage Opress.
While this was happening, a Jedi managed to infiltrate the area in search of pieces of a holocron.
The holocron was used to open the door to the academy.
By opening the door he was able to access the area where the Sith were gathered and slaughtered a group of Sith Acolytes and then killed four training droids.
After the massacre, the Jedi fled to Varad and created illusions of Ahsoka Tano, Anakin Skywalker, and Mace Windu.
