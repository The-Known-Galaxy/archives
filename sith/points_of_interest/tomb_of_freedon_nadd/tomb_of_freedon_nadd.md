# Introduction

The Tomb of Freedon Nadd was located on the planet Onderon and was the final resting place of Freedon Nadd.
Eventually, a group of Freedon Nadd followers called Naddists started an uprising on Onderon against Jedi and Modon and his beast raiders.
This Naddist uprising would later cause the Tomb of Freedon Nadd to be moved from Onderon to the moon Dxun.
The original tomb of Freedon Nadd only consisted of Freedon Nadd’s sarcophagus in a hollow chamber below the royal palace of the Iziz.

# History

In the year 4000 BBY, the forces of the Iziz went to war with the combined might of the Jedi and Modon Kira’s Beast Raiders.
Queen Amanoa would quietly sneak away to Nadd’s tomb to draw on the full power of the dark side, focus her full power on Freedon Nadd’s remains, and start chanting Freedon Nadd’s name.
She would succeed in summoning Freedon Nadd’s spirit to cause panic and terror among the beast raiders.
This would work only for a short time as Jedi Master Arca Jeth would face Freedon Nadd and with the power of Arca Jeth’s light it would force the shadow of Freedon Nadd’s spirit to be driven from the tomb.
The light of Jedi Master Arca Jeth would also cause Queen Amanoa’s shadow to be driven from her, thus killing the queen.

To permanently remove the dark side from Onderon, Jedi Master Arca Jeth would give the order to construct a new Tomb on the moon Dxun and to move the sarcophagus of Freedon Nadd to this new tomb.
Jedi Master Arac Jeth would surmise that the natural fauna of the moon of Dxun would be enough to deter and stop any would-be tomb looter.
However, the sarcophagus would be stolen before the Jedi could move it to the new tomb on Dxun.
Dark Jedi Warb Null and his army of Naddist would surprise the Jedi from below with a huge tunnel-boring war machine.
Warb Null and his Naddist army would take the sarcophagus and retreat into the tunnels underground.

Master Jeth and his apprentice Ulic Qel-Droma, led by Queen Galia, would follow the Dark Jedi and his Naddist forces into the tunnel.
They would discover Warb Null as well as King Ommin who the Jedi would find alive much to the Jedi’s horror in league with Freedon Nadd’s spirit.
Master Jeth would be captured and subdued by King Ommin via him using his Force lighting.
However, Master Jeth would later be rescued by a team of Jedi Knights.
King Ommin was later killed and Nadd’s spirit was finally removed from Onderon.
Master Jeth would finally have Freedon Nadd’s sarcophagus as well as King Ommin and Queen Amanoa sarcophagus’s moved to the new tomb on Dxun in hopes they would be left undisturbed.

# Second Battle of Onderon

In 3951 BBY, the Tomb of Freedon Nadd was critical to the outcome of the second battle of Onderon.
During the second battle of Onderon Sith forces led by Darth Nihilus and a Sith Master, would use Freedon Nadd’s Tomb would use Tomb as a base of operation to help support the Onderonian General Vaklu and his forces as he wished to overthrow Queen Talia of Onderon.
The Sith would be later tracked by the Mandalorians and their current leader Kelborn.
Mandalore the Preserver was traveling with Jedi Knight Meetra Surik in a quest to reunite the remnants of the Mandalorian clans.
Once Surik and her companions met with Kelborn, a companion of Surik’s, Jedi Master Keria recognized that the Sith were on the moon of Dxun.
Master Keria would counsel action against the Sith.
Before Surik headed to help the loyalist of Queen Talia she would charge three of your companions with stopping the Sith.
Surik’s companions would eventually stop the Sith from completing a dark ritual.
