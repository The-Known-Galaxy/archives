# Overview
Dxun, colloquially known to the near inhabitants as the ‘Demon Moon’, was one of four moons that orbited the planet Onderon within the Inner Rim.
This large moon was covered entirely in vast and dangerous forests that were populated by fierce and unforgiving lifeforms.
These jungles posed life-threatening for inhabitants and almost rendered it uninhabitable to sentient species due to its relentless and unforgiving climate changes.
Dxun also shared the same atmosphere as Onderon due to its extremely close distance to the planet itself.

Many notable species were located on this vast moon such as bomas, cannoks, drexls, maalraas, skreevs, and zakkegs who were all vicious and well-known predator species on the moon, forcing the moon’s sentient inhabitants to be armed at all times.


Although Dxun was considered a moon officially, those who inhabit the moon refer to it as a sister planet of Onderon, due to its vast size and minimal distance between Onderon.
Once a year, the atmospheres of Onderon and Dxun would connect, in which the local inhabitants would have feasts in celebration of this annual event.
This allowed the viciously well-known species Drexls to wander and settle on Onderon, laying the foundations for the Beast Wars.
