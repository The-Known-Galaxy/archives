# Overview

The Malachor Sith Temple, located on the planet Malachor, covered by crusts of stone and surrounded by extensive ruins which was said to house an ancient Sith holocron containing the entity known as “The Presence”.
A superweapon was also said to be located in the temple which upon placing the holocron into the obelisk at its very top would allow the weapon to cause great damage such as destroying life itself.
The Great Scourge of Malachor saw this superweapon in action as both Jedi and Sith perished from the power it was able to inflict to everything around it.
This temple was rumored to have been built millennia before the rise of the Galactic Empire.

# History of the Temple

Three years before the Battle of Yavin the Sith Temple was visited by Jedi Knights Kanan and Ahsoka, and their padawan Ezra seeking knowledge on how to defeat Darth Vader and his many inquisitors.
The padawan was able to find the holocron with the assistance of Darth Maul and successfully placed the holocron on top of the obelisk thus activating the weapon.
Although activated, The Presence spoke to the padawan and revealed to him that he had activated the superweapon.
The padawan, refusing to use it,removed the holocron which led to a chain of events causing the temple to explode.
This would be the last time the temple would be used as of  late.
