# Overview

The Massassi Temples were large structures built by the Massassi race, who were enslaved by a Sith Lord through the use of Sith alchemy.
One of the most recognised and well-known Massassi temples was the Great Temple on Yavin IV.
The temple would be built and used to serve one purpose which was to worship a Sith Lord going by the name of Naga Sadow.
Many years after its construction at around 5000 BBY, the temple would house the Rebel Alliance base and the Jedi Praxeum.
In 26 ABY, the temple had been destroyed during the reign of the Yuuzhan Vong.

# Temple Locations

The Massassi would build a total of four temples, this included the Great Temple, Temple of the Blueleaf Cluster, Palace of the Woolamander and Temple of Exar Kun.
All four of the temples would all be built on Yavin IV with the Temple of Exar Kun being located northeast of the Great Temple on a volcanic island called the Isle of Kun.
The Palace of the Woolamander was located southeast of the Great Temple in the Val’Arnos Jungle.
The third temple (Temple of the Blueleaf Cluster) was built in the Taurin Delta, which was downstream of the Unnh river from the Great Temple.
The fourth and final temple, known as the Great Temple, was built at the Ersham Ridge and was one of the more well-known temples.

# Architecture

The Temple of Exar Kun consisted of polished black-coloured obsidian that was studded with corusca gems and its walls would be filled with Sith hieroglyphics and pictographs.
The temple would also have only one chamber upon entering with catacombs beneath it, which were intertwined by tunnels.
Not much was known about the appearance of the Palace of the Woolamander; however, it is believed to have been a fairly large temple with a chamber where Exar Kun had sealed the Golden Globe.
The Temple of the Blueleaf Cluster was named this way due to the fact that it had images of blueleaf shrub leaves carved on its outer surface.
The temple wouldn’t be nearly as tall as the Great Temple.
However, it had a proportionately wider base with a majority of it taken up by a large opening with stairs that would lead both up and down, ornamented with alcoves carved into its walls.
The final temple (the Great Temple) was impressively large, almost making it seem impossible to build without the use of modern gravitonic construction techniques.
The temple also had a sarcophagus in which Naga Sadow laid in a state of hibernation still being worshipped by the Massassi.
