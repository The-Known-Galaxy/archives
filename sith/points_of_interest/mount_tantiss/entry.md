# Overview

Mount Tantiss was a famous mountainous landmark on the planet Weyland.
Located in the Mid Rim Territories of the known galaxy, Weyland was a forested and mountainous planet that was home to the Galactic Empire's top secret Weyland facility.

It is unknown as to when the facility was built, but it was implemented with turbolaser turrets and hangers with fighters to help defend.
The facility also housed a landing pad along with other defensive and living capabilities.

During the early reign of the Galactic Empire, they relocated their cloning program from the watery world of Kamino to the Weyland facility, making it the home and base of operations for the secretive Advanced Science Division, the A.S.D.

Science and medical personnel were brought to the mountain to assist in the cloning program.
One notable individual was Nala Se, a Kaminoan female scientist and Chief Medical Scientist who had served with the Galactic Republic through the Clone Wars of 22-19 BBY.

The facility was also the home of cloned Zillo Beasts, safely contained in a zone within the underground facility.
The facility also had several containment zones for rogue clones, clones who had either defected or disobeyed orders, and a holding cell for Nala Se as well.
Along with the turbolasers and hangers, the facility was also guarded and defended by both the well-known clone commandos and the infamous Imperial royal guards.
