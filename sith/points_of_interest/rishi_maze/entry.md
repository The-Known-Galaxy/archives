# Section One

Formerly known as Companion Aurek, the Rishi Maze was one of seven satellite dwarf galaxies that orbited the galaxy.
The name of the satellite came from the planet Rishi, which was where hyperspace travel to the Rishi Maze started.
However, the formal name for the maze derived from Aurek, the first letter in the Aurebesh alphabet.
Prior to the Battle of Yavin, the Rebel Alliance created Firebase Alpha.
The base was an illegal energy-mining station located on an asteroid near a black hole inside the Rishi Maze.
Han Solo and Chewbacca had been contracted to deliver supplies there.
