# Overview
Located on the planet Manaan, the Sith Embassy was placed here for the sole purpose of shipping Kolto to other worlds.
Force sensitive Selkath would be lured here in an attempt to seduce such younglings into embracing the Dark side of the Force.
Inside this embassy was a probe droid with information on an illegal Kolto processing station in the Hrakert Rift.
The embassy would be protected by Sith Troopers, assault droids and Dark Jedi under the command of Commander Grann.
The embassy would later be sealed by the Selkath as they did not agree with teaching the dark side to its youth.

# Raid on the Embassy
During the Jedi Civil War, Revan carried out a raid on the embassy with a few companions in the year 3956 BBY.
Their task was to find and retrieve the probe droid holding the Kolto information.
On their mission they found a number of missing Selkath who were convinced to turn away from the dark side by Revan, furthermore the missing Selkath even gave plans on Darth Malak’s eventual plan to takeover the planet Manaan.
Revan would go on and encounter Commander Grann, the embassy’s  leader, and kill him as he and his companions made their way back to the entrance.
Many Sith troopers, assault droids and Dark Jedi would perish at the hands of Revan during this raid.
The Sith Empire would later be banned and the embassy sealed due to the teachings of the dark side and corruption of the force sensitive Selkath population.
