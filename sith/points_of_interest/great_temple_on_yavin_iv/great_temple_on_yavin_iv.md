# Introduction
The Great Temple on Yavin IV is also known as the Massasi Outpost.
 It is a tall stone structure that served as a base for the Rebellion during the Galactic Civil War.
It is a building that was built by an extinct race.

# History of the Temple
The Temple was created 5000 years BBY.
It was created by the Race of Massassi, which were under the slavery of the Sith, which at that time was ruled by Naga Shadow.
The original reason why the Temple was built is to store data, such as maps, blueprints, etc.
The Massassi were gone, and after a thousand years since the Temple was constructed, it was discovered by the Rebel Alliance, which abandoned their base on the planet Dantooine because they were pursued by the Galactic Empire.
After the discovery of the Rebellion, they used their finest engineers to install new technology and restore the Temple to claim it as their new base.
Eventually, the Galactic Empire found the Great Temple and it was captured by them.



# Temple's Appearance
Originally, the great Temple on Yavin IV was a tall structure that was built mostly using stones.
It wasn’t really advanced, because it is a really old structure.
After the Rebellion took over the Temple, it was upgraded with metal sheets, and ferrocrete.
It was also having a large technological upgrade, due to it being the Rebel base.
