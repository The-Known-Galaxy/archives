# Introduction
The Sith Citadel was the very fortress built by the Sith King Adas’s Old Sith Empire long before the Great Hyperspace War.
This capital city was located on Ziost atop a high cliff, constructed with gray granite, expanding to an area so large that it covered even the surface of the planet leading down to the icy caves within the lower levels.
This ancient site would see many different reconstructions as well as be affiliated with different Sith organizations throughout history.

# History
After the fall of Sith King Adas in 27,700 BBY, the remainder of his loyal followers continued to spread his tradition of the Sith and its culture by abandoning Korriban to rebuild the species in his name.
The priest caste of the Sith known as the Kissai acted as the oversight of this reformation and with enough time and effort, the sect developed the Sith Citadel on Ziost.
Korriban was abandoned as the capital of the Sith and Ziost succeeded it to become the newer capital to establish Sith domination and power.




The Sith continued to thrive in their newer setting even throughout millennia.
Ziost remained untouched by foreigners until the arrival of the Dark Jedi exiles in 6900 BBY on Korriban.
This historical event was known as the Hundred-Year Darkness and the key figure Ajunta Pall alongside the rest of his Jen’jidai adherents enslaved the Sith species and formed a newer Sith Empire under their rule.
Seeking to expand their power, Ajunta Pall eventually took control of Ziost as well, the Sith Citadel capital also going into his ownership.
Tradition and culture did not remain as the only alteration by Pall, the Citadel quickly followed to his will, allowing the capital to expand, become a large city, provide congregational chambers for the Sith Council, as well as transform into the newer capital of the Sith Empire.



Following the defeat and near destruction of the Sith as a whole in the Great Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY, Ziost was abandoned as well as other major worlds governed by the Sith.
It wasn’t until the later years that a newer ruler of the Sith known as Lord Vitiate proclaimed himself as the Sith Emperor after forming a reconstituted Sith Empire and leading the remainder of the Sith to the hidden world known as Dromund Kaas.
There, Vitiate deemed Dromund Kaas as the newer capital of the Sith, in addition to constructing a newer citadel.
As a result, Ziost remained abandoned and its capital status was revoked.


Many years later in 3680 BBY, the Sith Empire established by Emperor Vitiate conducted the Invasion of Ziost in an attempt to recolonize the world and its contents.
The Sith Empire was quite successful in its efforts and did indeed manage to reclaim Ziost; however, they decided to create a newer capital city over top of the Citadel known as New Adasta as opposed to restoring the Ziost Citadel.
Despite the valor given to claim Ziost once more, Vitiate used a similar ritual to the one he did on the planet Nathema to once again absorb the life essence of the inhabitants of Ziost along with any other forms of life to further empower himself.
This sequence of events caused the Ziost Citadel to remain abandoned for eternity, never again seeking reconstruction.
