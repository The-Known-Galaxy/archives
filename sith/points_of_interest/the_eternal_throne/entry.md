# Overview

The Eternal Throne was created by the Eternal Empire and was used by the Eternal Emperor.
The chairs' design and features were all developed by the smartest Zakuulan people that were ordered to build it by Emperor Valkorian.
The throne was connected to a hyperwave relay station that was placed 10 kilometers underneath the location of the throne and was powered by two hundred generators.
These generators tapped into Zakuul’s core which granted the occupant the ability to control the GEMINI units that ran the Eternal Fleet.
Emperor Valkorian believed his offspring Arcann and Vaylin were unworthy to use the throne, due to this Valkorian decided the "Outlander" would take the Eternal Throne’s place.
The Eternal throne would eventually be taken by the Outlander who would successfully fend off Valkorian's attempt to take control of their body.
The Eternal Empire would be replaced by the Eternal Alliance and the throne mechanism would be moved to the Alliance based on Odessen.
After the slaughter on the Eternal Fleet, the Eternal Throne was destroyed leaving the Eternal Alliance at a loss.
