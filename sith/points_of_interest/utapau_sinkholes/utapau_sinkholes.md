# Overview
The Utapau Sinkholes were natural, deep cavern formations stretching across the planet Utapau’s vast surface.
These natural formations allowed the local inhabitants, namely Pau’ans and Utai, to settle and survive from the vast emptiness of the surface, as well as the difficult extremities due to the nine moons of the planet.
The Sinkholes usually contained four individual layers, composed of settlements by the local inhabitants.
Surface layers would primarily contain hangers and supplies for incoming and outgoing cargo ships, as well as pilots.
The lower layers primarily housed citizens of the planet and served as shelter from the harsh conditions of the planet’s surface.
The lowest layer of the sinkholes were primarily used for mining.
The Pau’ans and Utai harvested minerals from the waters, grottoes, and pools that were located in the lowest Mining Level.

# Additional Sections
The Utapau Sinkholes were originally caused by Utapau’s complex tidal waves due to the number of moons.
These caused abnormally large tidal waves in the ocean, which resulted in groundquakes that ultimately collapsed sections of the surface into subterranean sinkholes, which then became known as the Utapau Sinkholes.
The ancestors of the Pau’ans and Utai converted these sinkholes to be habitable for all life.
