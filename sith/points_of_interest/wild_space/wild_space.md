# Overview

Wild Space was the name given to the separation of the galaxy from the Unknown Regions.
It was the frontier of galactic society and fringed the Outer Rim Territories.
The name given to this area has changed many times over the years and held all of the unexplored areas.
It first received its name during the Great Manifest Period, after a discussion regarding the partially explored area.
After its settlement, people started referring to it by different names, such as the "Slice".
One of Palpatine's goals when discovering this region was to learn about all of its unknown areas and establish hyper routes and other trade areas.
This would be good due to the Wild Space being mainly charted while the Unknown Regions were mostly undiscovered.
