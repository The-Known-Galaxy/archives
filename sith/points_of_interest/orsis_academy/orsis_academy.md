# Overview
Orsis Academy was an educational facility located on the jungle planet of Orsis that was used for an unknown amount of time by those seeking to be trained in various methods of combat and skills relevant to particularly combat oriented jobs.


The Academy would employ the galaxy’s most skilled mercenaries, soldiers, spies, assassins, bounty hunters and other niche individuals to educate those who studied at the Orsis Academy.


Despite the Orsis Academy being used to train particularly dangerous individuals and employing criminals, the Jedi Order did know of the Academy’s existence and allowed it to continue its practice, so long as it agreed to not train Force Sensitive individuals.

# Entry and curriculum
It is unclear as to how an individual gains entry into the Orsis Academy, though it is known that the academy staff did maintain an examination process.
Though what this process consists of is unknown.


Once a student was enrolled at the academy, they could expect between four and eight years of difficult training in a wide range of skills and disciplines.
The legendary Darth Maul during his childhood would begin his education at the age of ten and spend seven years at the Orsis Academy, during this time it is known he underwent training in tracking, assassination and even lessons in marksmanship and blasters.


The final test of the Orsis Academy was known as the ‘’Gora’’, though what this test consisted of remains unknown, though it is clear that the test could be taken numerous times, due to a number of the students in the Academy having survived what they described as their ‘’first’’ attempt.
It was not unheard of for graduates of the Orsis Academy to return at a later date to undergo further education themselves or to have an associate of theirs inducted as a student.
