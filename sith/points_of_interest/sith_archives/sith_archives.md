# Overview
The Sith Archives were a library made by the cunning Darth Bane and his Order of Sith Lords.
It was a secret library that contained influential knowledge of the Sith and the Dark Side of the Force.
Inside the Archives are stored tales and legends of the most glorious, famous Sith Lords.
It was believed that Sidious took his apprentice Darth Maul to the Archives since he was one of the only people believed to have access to the Archives.
Maul went through the Archives for hours, he was looking for information on Zabrak Sith Lords from thousands of years ago who wielded double-bladed lightsabers.
Maul was being trained by Sidious, and during that time he wrote a journal.
Maul wanted his journal to be implemented in the Archives.
