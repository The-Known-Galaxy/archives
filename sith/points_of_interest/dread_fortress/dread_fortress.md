# Overview
The Dread Fortress was the base of the Dread Masters, a faction created by Vitiate, a group of six Sith Lords, who were prophets and generals to the Sith Emperor.
However, once the Sith Empire and the Republic found their whereabouts, they went to the fortress and fought off the remaining five Dread Masters.
The Dread Masters made a last noble stand defending their fortress and lives.
The Dread Fortress was located in the Outer Rim on the moon of Oricon.
It was a nightmarish fortress with a unique design.
It had two, curved devil tails pointing to the tall tower in the middle of it.
