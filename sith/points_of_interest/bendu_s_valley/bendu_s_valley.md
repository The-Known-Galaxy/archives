# Overview
Bendu’s Valley was, much like its namesake, a valley which resided on the planet of Atollon, located in the Lothal Sector in the Outer Rim Territories.

Located centrally inside of the famous Atollon Coral Mesa, the valley was described as having a ring with dozens of steps that lead into an open flat space.

Something notable about the valley was the prevalence of the creatures known as the Krykna and the Dokma, compared to the other areas.
It was noted that they seemed to be peaceful in the mesa for reasons unknown.

Another point of interest was the presence of a Krykna hive within the valley along with the presence of a species of bird called the Convorees.

What made this valley special and where the name of Bendu comes in was the dwelling of a Force-Sensitive creature inside the valley whose name was Bendu, thus Bendu’s Valley.

The creature in question was unknown to its species name or origin, but Bendu was a male of his species who was very attuned with the Force, even claiming to be the representation of balance within the Force.
