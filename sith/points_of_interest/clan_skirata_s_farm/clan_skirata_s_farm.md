# Introduction
The Clan Skirata was a mandalorian clan run primarily by two members, Munin and Kal Skirata, the adopted son of Munin.
The farm was located in Kyrimorut in the northern hemisphere of the outer rim world of Mandalore.
Not only did Kyrimorut house the Skirata Clan, but also clone troopers and commandos alike who wished to abandon the Grand Army of the Republic during the events of the Clone Wars.
During The rise of the Galactic Empire however, Kyrimorut would also be home to various clones who deserted the Imperial Army as well as a small number of Jedi who had survived order 66.

# Description
Kyrimorut is said to be surrounded by trees located near a large lake with a nearby settlement named Enceri that would serve as a trading town.
A large structure resided within this plot of land that had a spherical shape and was slightly submerged in the ground.
This was known as the vheh’yaim though regardless of this, Kyrimorut’s most distinguishable features were its armory, kitchen, and a large dining area adorned with a medical research laboratory.
Its most common use being the study of genetics.
The location had also possessed a hangar for various different ships that was typically found covered for discreetly storing starships.



# History
The construction of Kyrimorut began around the year 21 BBY within Mandalore's northern hemisphere, owned by Kal Skirata.
Kal had shown great commitment to The Grand Army of the Republic and entrusted his long-time friend Rav Bralor to construct the farm.
After the completion of this construction, Kyrimorut was now a fully functioning farm and stronghold of the Skirata Clan that also served as a refuge to Clones and many others who served the Grand Army of the Republic.
The Skirata Clan was also found responsible for the creation of the omega team with their land serving as a training place for newcomers.
