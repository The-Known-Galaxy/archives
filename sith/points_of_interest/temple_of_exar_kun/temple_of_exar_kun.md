# Overview
Located on a volcanic island called Khun Island in the middle of a deep lake, the temple was only accessible on foot via stepping stones.
These were only inches below the water, and travelers had to approach the temples with their heads down so their feet could be seen.

The temple itself was made of polished black obsidian set with Coruscant gemstones.
It is etched with Sith hieroglyphics and glyphs, which translates as a magical spell that protects the temple and brings doom to its culprits.
It had a small courtyard.
Inside, the temple had only one room and the catacombs below.
These consisted of several rooms connected by tunnels.
The final chamber contains his Exar-Kun sarcophagus, presumably intended to contain his body after his death, but it is unknown when his spirit actually merged with the temple walls of Yavin 4.
There was also an inner water tank in the temple.

# History
Just before fully embracing the dark side of the Force, the corrupt Jedi Exar Kun came to Yavin 4 and enslaved the native Massassi, who regarded him as a god.
He had them build a temple in his honor.
This was later called the Temple of Exacune.
Kun used the Temple as a non-public retreat, where he continued his studies of the Force.
In 3996 BBY, shortly before his death at the tip of the Nice Sith War, Kun used the vitality of the complete Massassi population to transfer his mind to the Temple, where he lived for the following 4,000 years.

The temple was rediscovered during the Battle of Yavin by Dr'uun Unnh, a rebellious naturalist.
He soon realized it had been a Sith temple and was intrigued by the very fact that while all other temples on Yavin 4 were in ruins, this one showed no signs Reword I have no idea what it means.
finished.
Unnh died shortly afterwards when a speeder and motorcycle crashed into his downed TIE/LN fighter, while Temple's details were found in his datapad by a hunt team.
In 1 ABY, Professor Walter Emanus led an archaeological expedition from the school of Corellia to Temple, where he discovered many valuable artifacts, including Valahorn.
However, when their excavations uncovered the catacombs beneath the temple, they awakened the spirit of Exar Kun in him.
Slaves to the spirits, they formed the cult of Exar Kun.
The cult remained within the catacombs until it absolutely was driven out by a team of astronauts dispatched by Emanus' colleague at the university, Professor Cornelius Wagglehorn.
Jan Dodonna and Luke Skywalker were also present at the Temple at some point during the excavation and assisted the astronauts with many tasks associated with evacuating the bottom.
The astronauts were occasionally stopped at the temple by rebel soldiers who were possessed by Kun's spirit.

Skywalker later established the Jedi Praxeum within the Great Temple on Yavin 4 in 11 ABY.[10] When he arrived, he could sense Kun's dark presence within the Temple.
This was something I hadn't felt in Yavin 4, where the Jedi abilities weren't very developed.
Exa's Kun spirit revived and lured his disciples into the Temple to show the dark side of the Force.
Gantrice and Streen head to the temple, where he finds two Coruscant gems detaching from the wall and falling at Gantrice's feet.
This was probably caused by Kun, and Gantris used them to construct his lightsaber.
Kun managed to show Gantris, but when he resisted, he destroyed him.
Later, Kip Duron and Dorsk 81 visited the temple.
There, Kyp put his allies to sleep while he learned from the Sith Lord.
Kun tried to kill Dorsk on a whim to demonstrate his power, but Kyp prevented this by asking the Dark Lord to inform him of everything he knew.
Visiting the temple soon after, Kun promises to assist in finding his missing wife, Mirax, if she becomes an apprentice.
The Dark Lord realized this while other Jedi disciples were working to defeat his spirit, and that they succeeded[11].
After Exar Kun was destroyed, Kip was returned to the sunshine Side of the Force.
When Kip returned to Yavin 4, Luke took him to the Temple and faced a test like Luke's within the Dark Side Caverns of Dagobah.
Kun then merged with Kip's dead brother Zess as a Force Ghost even as Luke saw himself in Vader's mask.
Although there's no certainty, Zess's image was possibly formed by the Temple's Force powers, where he seemed to teach Kip a vital lesson.
Shortly thereafter, Koran Horn obtained permission from Luke to destroy the Temple.
He saw first-hand how the Sith books corrupted the Gensarai, and did not want the Temple books to lead others to the dark side.
You attacked it with your X-wing by firing at the statue.
Debris rained down, damaging the interior of the temple and falling into the lake.
He then switched to a laser and aimed at the outside of the temple, firing back and forth until the temple collapsed, heating it up and destroying all the writing.
