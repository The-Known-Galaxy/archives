# Introduction
The Dark Temple was a massive Sith structure located within the planet Dromund Kaas.
It was built during the time of the Old Sith Empire, by the followers of Lord Pharshol; the overseer and originator of the project.
This temple was used as a burial ground of powerful Sith Lords, such as Pharshol himself, Vacuus–his rival–and Aloysius Kallig.
Unfortunately, the temple fell alongside its housing planet after the events of the Great Hyperspace War.


The Sith Emperor Vitiate later took control of Dromund Kaas and took the temple as his own in 4,980 BBY.
He ordered his followers to expand on the structure, create more of his experiments inside, plus also bury his rivals prior.
Vitiate then ordered the closure of the temple, concealing vengeful spirits and powerful artifacts in the process; until it was later reopened during the events of the Cold War.


The spirits within took control of the archaeologists and explorers, with the inspiration of Lord Kallig’s fury, and managed to become an uncontrollable site by both the Sith and Empire.
The possessed beings were later cleansed by the Dark Honor Guard and Vitiate himself, and simultaneously defended the temple against an assault led by the Hero of Tython in 3,640 BBY.
The battle forced the Emperor to collapse a large portion of the territory while also forcing his essence out of his body.

# Layout
Located in Dromund Kaas, the Dark Temple was built atop a hill found West of Kaas City.
Its main section was a large rectangular hall that extended into the mountains and was constructed of dark gray and black stone.
The temple’s exterior contains a large obelisk found in the entrance arch, having a massive eye carved onto it that represented the Sith Emperor.
The temple’s roof contained large horn-like structures and contained a few cracks that let light into the interior.


Since the temple was deep inside the mountains, its interior housed various rooms and chambers that were open to the air, regardless of being inside caves.
Its entrance was built as a grand processional approach, met with multiple staircases, walls, statues, and a large courtyard.
The temple’s center was filled with large statues that were bowing, placed on each side of the courtyard looking towards the pathway.

Further inside the temple is a grand entrance that leads to a tall area that leads to a spiral of stairs.
The stairs split into two after reaching their final destination in the main hall.
This area contained two hallways with multiple statues in the center space bowing opposite the pillars they were located in.
At the north of this hall was a giant statue of a Sith Pureblood staring at the ceiling with both his arms laid out.
The hall had four different exits branching off from the chamber’s center.
The eastern path housed a spiral staircase that led to the balcony.
The northwest path was an entrance to the tunnels under the temple.
The southern path led to the Temple’s reliquary, where Emperor Vitiate stored powerful artifacts, next to another path that leads to Lord Ergast’s shrine.


Behind the Pureblood statue, there is a staircase that connects the first and second floors and has a door in the upper level that opens up to the Temple’s inner chambers.
To its east lay another door into the Unquiet Chamber.
The entirety of the Dark Temple was filled with a greenish light, with paved gray floors with ornamental structures drawn within.
When the Emperor took over the Temple, he forced his followers to construct its interior to contain Dark Side energy, so it may serve as a powerful prison and a secure site for his artifacts.



# Early History
The Dark Temple was built by Sith Lord Pharshol, his followers, and certain colonists of the Old Sith Empire.
The colonists resided within the temple as it was one of the few man-made structures built on a jungle planet filled with hostile creatures.
Shortly after its completion, Pharshol’s rival Vacuus and his followers–the Dark Path–infiltrated the Temple and attempted to capture Pharshol’s followers.
Vacuus, Pharshol, his apprentice; along with many of their followers, perished in the battle and were buried within the Temple.
When Aloysius Kallig died at the hands of Tulak Hord, he was also buried within the Dark Temple, and Lord Ergast followed him shortly thereafter.

Dromund Kaas later became abandoned but rediscovered during the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Wars in 4,980 BBY.
Two decades later, the Sith Emperor of the newly established Empire was drawn into the Temple after hearing echoes of the Dark Side.
With the help of Dread Master Brontes’ insight, the Emperor ordered an expansion to the Dark Temple, where he used this structure to contain the artifacts he created and the tombs of his enemies.
The Emperor later ordered the closure of the Dark Temple, and it remained abandoned for thousands of years.



# The Temple's Reopening
During 3,643 BBY, a group of Sith took advantage of the Emperor’s absence during the Cold War and led an expedition that breached the gates of the Dark Temple.
They unknowingly woke the spirit of the late Lord Kallig, who lashed his fury onto the trespassers and possessed the majority of the invaders.
Not even the Dark Council was able to contain and punish the rogue Sith members as almost no one returned alive or as themselves.
