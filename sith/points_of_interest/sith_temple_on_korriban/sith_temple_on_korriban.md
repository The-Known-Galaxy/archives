# Introduction
The Sith Temple on Korriban is an ancient piece of architecture worshipped by the Sith, especially for the tombs.
Usually referred to as the ‘’graveyard of the Sith’’.
It was situated in the Valley of Dark Lords in which a lot of tombs were made especially for feared and strong Sith Lords to be resting peacefully in.
It used to be at the rear side of the valley.

# Description
The Temple could be described as a massive stone structure.
In the main part of the Temple was the Hall of Judgment, which held an indefinite number of deceased Sith Lords, which all remained fully untouched, thanks to the guardians and the tomb raiders of the dark side of the Force.
Tuk’ata hounds were the sole guardians of the tombs, rendering grave robbers and tomb-raiders useless against their defenses, which contributed to the bodies being in perfect state as well.



# History
‘’Krath Holy Crusade’’

In 3396 BBY, a Jedi Apprentice named Exar Kun was guided into Korriban and entered the Temple, where he got tricked by the spirit that was guiding him into embracing the dark side of the Force after the destruction of the great crystal.

Sith Empire

The Temple has been forgotten ever since the visit of the Jedi Apprentice, for a long time.
The Sith Empire occasionally held the planet, but its main use was for the Sith Academy.
However, they had to move to the front of the complex, as it was deemed inhabitable due to the unstable structuring.

Galactic Republic

In 23 BBY, a squad of Jedi, composed of Jedi Knights and their padawans, with their leader being Obi-Wan Kenobi, invaded the temple as they were in pursuit of two very wanted criminals within the galaxy, Granta Omega and Jenna Zan Arbor.
When they entered the temple, they were met with a strong, indistinguishable presence, as if it were a Sith Lord.
He didn’t realize it for a while, but later on, it was proven to be Darth Tyranus, another formidable Darth within the Sith.
He was the exact opposite of the former Jedi Master Dooku, given to his altered ego.
Anakin Skywalker was on the mission as well, as he glimpsed the black-hooded Sith Lord.
Kenobi was terrified at the thought of how many people had been trapped here by their desires after hard work and training.
He felt everyone’s deaths, meanwhile, Anakin Skywalker, when he was just 18 years old, experienced a strange feeling, as if it was from the dark side.
From his feet to his head, it was slowly rising.
It was described as a traumatizing feeling as if his very nerves were about to split in half.
