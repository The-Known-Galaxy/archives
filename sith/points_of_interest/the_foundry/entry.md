# Overview

The Foundry, an excellent example of Rakatan technology from an age long gone.
Academics believe it to be 20,000 years old, perhaps even more.
A droid manufacturing factory buried deep in an asteroid.
The Foundry can be found in the Nanth’ri system, one such place that has practically vanished from all galactic maps.

# Description

The Foundry is cloaked in intrigue, a staple of Rakatan engineering rediscovered by the Sith Empire.
Not much is known about the construction or mechanisms behind the Foundry, but the Sith Empire believe the Foundry to contain at least twelve levels, each capable of mass producing thousands of droids; enough to conquer a planet in a relatively short amount of time.
Built deep into the bowels of an asteroid in the Nanth’ri system, the Foundry is special; it does not require any human input to keep producing droids.
It is entirely capable of doing this on its own, and it appears to be run by a highly sentient and intelligent droid or computer; this has still not been decided upon.
There are clear markings for where worker droids have hollowed out the asteroid, both to make space for the Foundry, but also to gather materials for the construction of droids and the construction of the Foundry itself.
It has also been installed with tractor beams and additional harvesting droids, which Sith Intelligence believes is for gathering materials from asteroids passing near the Foundry; again, this function requires no human input.
The Foundry is an immensely powerful structure, and the individual or group that governs it could change galactic history forever.
