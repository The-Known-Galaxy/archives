# The Citadel

The Sith Citadel on Exegol was a massive structure built on the Sith’s planet Exegol.
Although it is unknown when the Citadel was constructed, it is said to be one of the most ancient Sith fortresses.
Darth Sidious had two navigators made to direct the user to the Citadel, these would go on to be stored in various locations as time went on.

The Citadel itself consisted of a large, upside-down pyramid-like shape that floated above the ground.
Underneath it, a platform lowered visitors down into the ground, where the main portion of the Citadel was.
It is known to have housed the Sith Throne Room and a laboratory and had a large hallway with many ancient statues of Sith Lords.
The Throne Room housed the Throne of the Sith which sat across from a large amphitheater.
The laboratory was filled with machines dedicated to cloning and bioengineering.
Amongst these machines were vats filled with nutrient-rich fluid to house the cloned bodies of Snoke, which were used as bodies by Darth Sidious.

# Activity Within the Citadel

The Citadel was originally used by the Sith for rituals and meetings, however, it became the center for Sith activity during the reign of Darth Sidious as Galactic Emperor.
The Sith Eternal Cult named the Citadel their headquarters and began to experiment with cloning and extending the lifespan of Darth Sidious, the goal being to make his lifespan indefinite.
Using the cloning technology Sidious and the Sith Eternal created soldiers called the Sith Eternal Guard, who were stationed on Exegol.
These soldiers were little more than an experiment in cloning and were later killed by Vader when he discovered the Citadel.
The Sith Eternal built up the Sith Army on Exegol, conscripting their children into it and, during the reign of the First Order, kidnapping children from the First Order’s training program to become members of the Sith Army.
Further cloning experiments lead to the creation of a regular human clone who was set free.
He would go on to father a Force-sensitive daughter, Rey.

After his death, Darth Sidious was resurrected on Exegol and began to prepare it to be the place from which he would rule his new Sith Empire, constructing a throne room to house the Throne of the Sith.
Sidious also improved the ancient Sith shipyard and created the Final Order, a massive fleet of Xyston-class Star Destroyers.
This fleet was supposed to be used to take over the Galaxy and establish a new Sith Empire.

The Citadel was eventually discovered by Kylo Ren who journeyed to it to kill Sidious but was persuaded to instead hunt down Rey Palpatine in exchange for control over the forces of the Final Order.
Rey turned Ren back to the light side and set out for Exegol to confront Sidious.
Kylo Ren, now once again Ben Solo, and Rey fought Sidious in the throne room until Ben sacrificed himself to help Rey overpower Sidious and destroy him.
The ensuing battle caused the destruction of the Citadel, killed the Sith Eternal and Sith Army, and destroyed the Final Order along with the last remnants of the Sith.
