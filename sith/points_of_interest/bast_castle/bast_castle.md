# Overview

Bast Castle was one of few private fortresses owned by Darth Vader that was constructed during the reign of the Galactic Empire, and had remained in his ownership until the fall of the Empire in 0 BBY.
This castle was located on the precarious planet Vjun, notorious for its acidic rain, making the surface uninhabitable to unadapted lifeforms.
Long after the fall of the Empire and Darth Vader’s demise, Bast Castle became the headquarters of the Dark Side Elite.
Of which, they were warriors of the Emperor, and colloquially known as the Emperor’s Dark-Jedi.
These were a body of seven Dark-Jedi established by the former Emperor Sheev Palpatine whilst he was in a clone body.
This elite group was tasked with leading Operation Shadow Hand, in which the Emperor attempted to regain the galaxy.

Bast Castle contained formidable defenses in the face of opposition.
It was equipped with one turbo laser turret, as well as a number of ASP-38 Droids that were tasked with eliminating any intruders.

In honor of the fallen Dark Lord, Darth Vader however, the leader of the Dark-Jedi faction, Sedriss QL, constructed a monument of Darth Vader to honor his contributions and loyalty to the fallen Galactic Empire.
Unbeknownst to Vader’s treachery, Palpatine upon seeing this ordered Sedriss to have it destroyed.
Sedriss, on the other hand, overlooked this due to his admiration for Vader’s abilities.

After the death of Sedriss, the ownership of Bast Castle fell to Xecr Nist, who didn’t dare to tear down the statue of Darth Vader.
However, in a turn of events, a team of four Jedi including Luke Skywalker, Rayf Ysanna, Kam Solusar, and Empatojayos Brand raided the temple, killing the new owner of the castle.
