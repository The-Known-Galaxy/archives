# The Shrine

The Sith Shrine in the Depths is an ancient Sith shrine built on a Light Side Force Vergence on Coruscant.
The Sith had hoped to corrupt the Vergence with the Shrine's construction, which they did.
They continued to use it until their defeat in the war against the Jedi.

# History of The Shrine

Estimated to date as far back as 5000 BBY, the Shrine stood for millennia before finally being destroyed at the hands of the Jedi, who attempted to revert the corruption the Vergence had experienced.
They did this by constructing a grand Jedi temple over the ruins of the Sith Shrine, believing that the comings and goings of many Light Side users would neutralize the Dark Side energy.
Jedi would occasionally access the Shrine and attempt to weaken the powers of Dark Side artifacts, which may have been successful in some cases.
However, the energy of the Dark Side in the Shrine began to leak out and weaken the Jedi present in the area, who remained oblivious to this fact.
Over time, the Sith once again learned of the Shrine but kept it a deeply guarded secret.

```
   After the Jedi were destroyed by Darth Sidious, the Jedi Temple was converted into the Imperial Palace.
```

This allowed Sidious to have access to the Shrine.
Sidious, wanting to keep its existence a secret, had a legion of droids work to excavate the Shrine.
Sidious utilized it to meditate and probe deeper into the Dark Side but never revealed its existence to others.
