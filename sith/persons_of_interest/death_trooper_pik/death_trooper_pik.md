# Overview
Pik was a human male Death Trooper who served the Imperial Navy under the command of the brilliant Chiss Grand Admiral Thrawn.
Pik was a very intelligent and deadly trooper.
His most famous mission was when he, Assistant Director Ronan, Lieutenant Eli Vanto, and Waffle (a fellow Death Trooper) were sent to Aloxor.
They were deployed on Aloxor to search for a missing freighter.
Pik and Waffle were sent to protect Ronan and Vanto, both of which they despised.
Death Troopers weren’t a fan of traitors to the Empire and only had respect for those who earned it, mainly those who they served under.
Pik didn’t see much in Ronan due to his constant complaints towards Thrawn, and they didn’t respect Vanto much either because he left the Empire for the Chiss Expansionary Defence Fleet.
What they didn’t realise was that Thrawn sent Vanto.
Pik and his fellow Trooper Waffle showed courage on their mission with Vanto and Ronan.
They tried not to get in too many fights and kept their cover.
Pik had great respect for Thrawn and served as one of Thrawn’s guards even though a lot of people despised Thrawn.
