# Introduction
Adas was a Sith King, the first that ruled over Korriban and the Sith for a total of three centuries.
Adopting the title “Sith’ari”, the Sith believed his rule would last for eternity due to the belief of him being immortal.
Though, this belief was proven false once he met his demise in a war between the Sith and Infinite Empire.
Even after his death, the ancient Sith King’s history continued to make an impact on future events to come.
His wisdom was stored within a holocron, held onto by the Sith for many generations, creating a legacy that established the foundation of Sith unification.

# History
This soon-to-be Sith’ari was born sometime around 28,000 BBY.
At birth, Adas possessed a charcoal skin complexion, quite rare among Sith Purebloods.
Due to this, Adas was seen as one of few with outstanding amounts of potential and would be trained as such.
As he continued to grow throughout his life, he naturally grew with high intelligence and extreme combative prowess.
Adas was also proficient in Sith alchemy, proving such by wielding a large battle-ax forged entirely from alchemy with spiked ebon armor to complement it.
With his wonderful leadership capability, Adas led the Sith throughout many different conflicts that came forth on Korriban, thus providing him with the title of Sith King, also known as “Sith’ari.”
The time period of his reign which lasted 300 years was known as the “Reign of the Ax.” His rule was perceived as eternal by his fellow Sith followers because of his impressive feats in leadership and unification of the Sith species thus beginning the prophecy of the “Sith’ari” similar to the prophecy of the “Chosen One.” It wasn’t until the Infinite Empire governed by the Rakata arrived on Korriban in seeking to dominate the Sith species.
The Rakata taught Adas holocron technology, allowing the Sith King to record whatever information he pleased and store it within a holocron.
Adas followed along and did this to display a feat rather than preserve his wisdom.
Rakatan forces enlightened Adas with this knowledge in hopes to gain his trust so that they may enslave the Sith species for their own benefit.


After the Rakata realized that the Sith King was not easily fooled, they devised a battle plan to release their soldiers on Korriban in an attempt to conquer by force.
As a response to their invasion, the Sith’ari gathered all of his people to defend against the attack.
With great defense, valor, and leadership from Adas, the Sith pushed the Rakatan forces off of Korriban, capturing many of their starships in the process to use against them.
The Sith would move onto the worlds of Ziost, Tund, and Malachor V as a result of their battle.
Despite the hopes Adas had for establishing a newer, yet traditional generation of Sith, he met his demise in the process.
His death would cause disorganization and faults within the caste and society of the Sith, many other Sith battled each other to become a successor of Adas to unite the culture once more.



# Legacy
After the death of the Sith King Adas, Korriban descended into chaos and anarchy, most of the native Sith engaging in battle with each other in an attempt to display the strength to be deemed “Sith’ari.” Quite a few Kissai, the priest caste of the Sith believed that the death of Adas was an indication to reject the philosophies of the Dark Side and instead, follow their own instinct in The Force which would lead them to Tund.
With all the chaos transpiring on Korriban, the capital of the Sith was eventually shifted to the planet Ziost.
Given enough time, the conflicts on Korriban came to a conclusion, allowing the Sith to reorganize themselves, attempting to follow Adas’s concept of how others can gain power from the strength expressed by the leadership of another.
After all the time without a King, Hakagram Graush would ascend to become the new Sith’ari and rule over those among Korriban until the Dark Jedi brought his rule to an end.





Nearly twenty-one thousand years after the death of King Adas, around 6900 BBY, a group of Dark Jedi exiles led by Ajunta Pall would make themselves known on the Korriban.
By demonstrating their extreme prowess in The Force, the Dark Jedi would be praised as Gods among the Sith, so much so that the exiles were perceived by the Sith to be even more powerful and influential than the previous Sith King Adas.
By conspiring with the Shadow Hand, the second in command of the Sith monarch, Ajunta Pall was able to gain the trust of Hakagram Graush and execute him.
Sorzus Syn, another exile, studied the philosophies and culture of the Sith, which included the very history of Adas that was stored in a holocron preserved by the native species for many years that assisted Sorzus Syn in creating the many philosophies of the Sith such as the Code of the Sith.
