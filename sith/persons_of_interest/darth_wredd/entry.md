# Section 1

Darth Wredd was a male Sith Lord who was part of the One Sith Order.
He would fight in the Second Imperial Civil War as well as being a former force sensitive warrior from his home planet of Mala.

# Section 2

The man who became “Darth” Wredd would be born just over a century after the Galactic Civil War.
He would be force-sensitive and use this to his advantage to protect his people.
This earned him  a good reputation  and he was famed for never missing a target while hunting with an arrow.
Darth Wredd would adore the Jedi’s and wished to join but due to the purge at the Jedi Library on Ossus the Jedi were forced underground.
Nevertheless this wouldn’t stop Wredd from following the Jedi ways.
He was described as  humble and protective of his people and always sought  justice to those who used the ways of violence.

# Section 3

Even though the man who became “Darth Wredd” may have been able to stand his ground if anyone threatened his people and had force-sensitive abilities, this did not stop everyone from harming his people.
During the final years of the Second Imperial Civil War, the Galactic Empire and One Sith Order would invade the planet.
In the onslaught, Wredd would come to fight a Sith Lord in a 1-on-1 duel.
The Sith Lord would defeat Wredd but ultimately spare him, noticing his potential in the force.
The Sith Lord would decide to take Wredd as his apprentice and force him to watch his world be used for testing a bioweapon.
Ultimately, the planet would be knocked off its course.
The Sith Lord would force Wredd to wear a mask and adopt the name of Darth Wredd.
Wredd would never forgive his master for these actions, and deep down, he swore he would kill his master.

# Section 4

Wredd would notice an opportunity to kill after the death of Darth Krayt on Coruscant.
A Triumvirate ship would enter the Surd Nebula, where Darth Wredd and his master would be waiting on their flagship.
Wredd would ultimately convince his master to open fire on the Triumvirate ship, ultimately making it crash on the rogue planet of Mala.
There they would kill the remaining Triumvirate crew and duel an Imperial Knight.
During the duel, Wredd’s master would overpower the knight, who was about to do the killing blow until Wredd struck him down.
Wredd would imprison the knight on the planet and take the knight's armor, impersonating him as an Imperial Knight.
Due to these actions, Wredd would cut all ties to the One Sith Order.

# Section 5

Wredd would impersonate an Imperial Knight but ultimately be caught due to his mischievous actions.
Wredd would set his eyes on destroying the One Sith Order, and he would create his own order.
Wredd created a plan to lure the Fel Empire to the rogue planet of Mala and trap them.
Ultimately, the imperials would fall for the bait, but the One Sith Order caught wind of this and decided to end both the Fel Empire and the Darth Wredd insurgency at the same time.
The One Sith Order would invade with a massive force, outnumbering the Imperial Knights and Wredd’s forces.
The Imperials and Wredd’s forces would team up and make a final stand against the One Sith Forces.
Ultimately the Imperial Knights combat prowess saved the day and One Sith Order was no-more.
When Empress Fel was distracted by treating a wounded soldier, Wredd would take his chances on assassinating the Empress.
He would be intervened by his “supposebly” apprentice, Jao Assam.
Wredd would be pursued by Jao to the edge of a cliff, who would chop off both of Wredd’s hands in his anger.
Wredd would taunt Jao to kill him, as that was the final step to the darkside.
Jao realized what Wredd was up to and decided not to  kill him.
Wredd would plead with Jao to kill him, as that would end the Sith Order.
Wredd’s wishes would ultimately be granted as he was shot by a new-found friend, Ania Solo.
With Wredd gone, the Sith Order was no more for now.
