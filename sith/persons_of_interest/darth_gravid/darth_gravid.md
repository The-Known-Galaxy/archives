During his selection as a Sith Lord, Gravid accepted a Twi'lek female as his apprentice, aponting her Darth Gean.
he destroyed the majority of Sith lore and started to believe that the Sith's commitment to the Dark Side was flawed.
He was murdered by his apprentice, Darth Gean, who managed to overthrow him despite being unarmed.
The consequence of Gravid's actions would be felt by the Sith for generations after his demise.
