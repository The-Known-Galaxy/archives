# \[The Beginning\]

Naga Sadow was a master alchemist and Dark Lord of the Sith who in 5000 BBY, led the Sith in an attempt to dominate the galaxy in an event known as the Great Hyperspace War.
He was born roughly 200 years after the Second Great Schism that saw the Dark Jedi exiled.
Sadow himself was an heir to the legacy left behind by the original Dark Jedi, as he was a Half-Human Half-Sith hybrid, and bore one of the pureset Jedi lineages amongst the Sith Empire.
He preached a philosophy of expansionism, which put him at odds with other Sith due to the Empire’s policy of isolation.
At the death of Dark Lord of the Sith, Marka Ragnos, Sadow immediately began preparations to take the position for himself.
Sadow had grown angry at his fellow Sith due to them doing nothing other than enjoying their vast riches.
He believed this would lead to Stagnation.
Sadow’s chance to change things was the death of Marka Ragnos.

# \[The Middle\]

During Marka Ragnos’s funeral, a grand procession was undertaken through the Valley of the Dark Lords, lead by Sadow’s biggest rival, Ludo Kressh, who also sought the position for himself.
Sadow arrived late to the tomb, and ascended the steps to Ragnos’ new tomb.
Ludo Kressh ordered him to step back, stating that he was shaming the memory of the Dark Lord.
Sadow refused, stepping up to declare himself Dark Lord of the Sith.
Kressh immediately opposed his claim, and the 2 Lords in accordance to tradition, decided to battle.
The Lord's duel in front of the tomb quickly became a fight to the death, as it showed neither would back down.
However, neither side took victory as the spirit of Marka Ragnos appeared, warning the two to stop at once.
He declared that the Golden Age of the Sith would soon end, and unnecessary fighting would only harm the Empire.
The very next moment, two Republic explorers would discover Korriban.
They were immediately imprisoned upon arrival.

# \[The End\]

Sadow staged the escape of the two explorers, using the opportunity to make it seem like a Republic operation.
He used the widespread suspicion, paranoia, and fear to prepare the Empire for a war.
During his preparations, he eliminated Kressh’s forces, leaving no challengers to his authority.
Sadow then gathered the other Sith Lords, forming a massive military and navy in order to destroy the Republic.
When the time was right, Sadow’s forces launched a surprise attack on the Republic, striking many planets, including Coruscant, the capital of the Republic.
Sadow commanded his forces from an isolated meditation sphere.
The invasion was initially highly successful with him almost claiming victory until one of his apprentices turned on him, attacking his meditation sphere leaving his forces without commands.
While Sadow managed to kill his rebellious apprentice, his forces were in dessary, forcing him to return to Korriban.
When he arrived, he found his rival, Ludo Kressh, thought to be dead, with an army waiting for him.
After winning the conflict with Kressh, he found himself without an army, when a Republic invasion was imminent.
Seeing the fact that he had no chance of winning, he fled into permanent exile on Yavin 4.
