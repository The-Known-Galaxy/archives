# Overview
Darth Venamis, which was a title he gave to himself, was a male Bith, who followed Darth Bane’s Rule of Two and served as the apprentice of the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Tenebrous.
Tenebrous was teaching Venamis that it was approved to disobey the Rule of Two because Tenebrous had a second apprentice, who despised Venamis and believed that the only reason Tenebrous took him in was because they had to be biologically related.
Tenebrous’ second apprentice was the famous Darth Plagueis, who took in the legendary Darth Sidious as his apprentice.
One day Venamis and Plagueis got into a duel so that Venamis could truly claim the title Darth.
Sadly, Venamis was defeated by Plagueis and he then forced Venamis to eat a coma-bloom, which was a very rare and exotic bloom that had the power to put him in a coma, so that Plagueis could use him as an experiment in measuring midi-chlorians and then kill him.
Venamis deemed himself a worthy opponent in this duel by using powerful lightsaber skills that his master taught him, which forced Plagueis to use different tactics and to ultimately destroy him with the Dark Side of the Force.
Venamis also was skilled in Force lightning and could levitate himself during a duel.
