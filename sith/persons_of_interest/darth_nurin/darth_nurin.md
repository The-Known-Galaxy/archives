# Overview
Darth Nurin was a female human Sith Lord who served in the reconstituted Sith Empire’s Imperial Fleet.
She spent most of her time in the Operations Center on the Ziost Shadow.
Nurin was said to have a single apprentice, the Zabrak Sith Lord Velnine.
Her most notable task was when she helped aid the Empire by trying to convince the Tion Hegemony to ally with them and during this time a Doctor named Lorrick released a deadlier version of the Rakghoul Plague which he created as a weapon.
This sent the Hegemony people into chaos due to their fear of death and since their world could be doomed.
Nurin knew she needed to stop this virus, so she invented a new strain and sent a few Imperials to prevent the chaos of the Battle of Kaon.
She then sent them to deal with Doctor Lorrick, who was hiding in his lab on the planet Ord Mantell, so they could support the Hegemony and they could ally themselves with the Empire.
