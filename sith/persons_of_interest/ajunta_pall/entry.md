# Introduction

Not much is known of Ajunta Pall before his path to the Dark Side.
A Jedi Master who discovered the secrets of what would later be called Sith Alchemy, he and his followers would be declared heretical by the Jedi Order, resulting in the Hundred Year Darkness that would see his Dark Jedi exiled from the Galactic Republic.

These Exiles would eventually come across Korriban, a world teeming with the dark side energies, and it's inhabitants, the Sith, who were naturally attuned to it.
After a short war, Pall would find himself declared Jen'ari, or Dark Lord in the Sith tongue.

# Section II

Taking the Sith language for his own, and encouraging interbreeding between his Dark Jedi followers and the conquered Sith, the result would become the Sith Order, a new collective dedicated to the Dark Side of the Force and its rituals.

Pall would create the framework for an Empire, expanding into neighboring systems, and settling Ziost as the capital world, while Korriban would become a tomb-world for Sith Lords, as well as the location of the Sith Academy.

After leading the Empire for decades as Dark Lord, he passed away, his body being placed in the massive Tomb of Ajunta Pall, the first tomb of many which would become the Valley of the Dark Lords.
