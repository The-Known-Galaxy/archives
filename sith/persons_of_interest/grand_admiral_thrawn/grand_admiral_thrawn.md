# Introduction
Grand Admiral Thrawn, known as Mitth’raw’nuruodo to his people, and his core name simply Thrawn, was a male Chiss born on the planet Csilla most known for his cutting-edge brilliance in martial logistics, erudite, and his renowned skill in warfare.
His rise across the Imperial ranks despite the infamous speciesist military policies of the Empire is a true testament to his capabilities.
He was the only alien Grand Admiral to have ever existed at any point in time.

# Biography
His long span of career first began in the Defense Force of the Chiss Ascendancy where he served as an officer, fervently displaying his brilliance in logistics, tactics, and martial skill sets.
Despite his natural talent, many among the Ascendancy would abhor the idea of pre-emptive and or preventive strikes, even with the early presence of Yuuzhan-Vong already appearing from amongst the Unknown Regions.
With his constant incursions beyond Chiss territories, he would encounter the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, who had the double identity of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine.
After the two came to know the extent of the danger posed by the Unknown Regions, they would effectively agree to silence the Republic movements in the region by destroying the Republic exploration ship Outbound Flight, killing many Jedi in the process as they may draw the ire and attention of the Yuuzhan-Vong.

"This one is constantly thinking, analyzing, and strategizing.
He showed no fear, but was curious, studying me in turn."
-Emperor Palpatine



# Biography II
Due to his repeated offenses, Mitth’raw’nuruodo would be exiled from the Chiss Ascendancy into a far-flung uninhabited planet within the fringes of the Ascendancy’s borders, eventually being encountered by Navy Officer Voss Parck in the Unknown Regions and brought to now Emperor Palpatine.
Having taken note of Thrawn’s adept experience within the Ascendancy, he would approve his admission into the Imperial Navy despite the ongoing speciesist policies of the Empire limiting aliens to a bare minimum.
As the Galactic Civil War sparked and went ahead, Thrawn would rapidly rise through the Imperial ladder, eventually reaching the rank of Grand Admiral.
He was fully aware that defending the Ascendancy as an Imperial officer would be far less difficult and more coordinated than returning to the Chiss altogether.
He would form a secretive empire of his own in the Unknown Regions amassing men and resources as a bulwark to the Yuuzhan-Vong.

"But..
it was so artistically done.."
-Grand Admiral Thrawn, in his final words



# Legacy
By the year of the Battle of Endor, Thrawn would still be heavily occupied in the Unknown Regions as the Emperor fell, the Imperial officers disintegrated into shambling warlords, and the Second Death Star’s fall.
He would return in 8 ABY, bringing an armada of 6 Imperial Star-Destroyers among other ships forming a military confederation on the fringes of the fledgling New Republic’s borders launching devastating raids and attacks upon the important worlds and assets of the region.
Any hope of restoring the Empire would not come to be with his very untimely death in 9ABY at the hands of his Noghri bodyguard Rukh.
Despite this, there are many rumors surrounding his empire in the Unknown Regions and tales of his clones in hiding, preparing to defend the known galaxy from threats in the unknown.



# Overview
Thrawn was a male Chiss who served under the Chiss Ascendancy and Galactic Empire, more specifically the Imperial Navy.
He was famous for being a tactical genius, and employed many unique and effective strategies against his foes during naval battles.
Once the Empire was fully dismantled by the New Republic after the Battle of Jakku, and the subsequent conquest of Coruscant, Thrawn would come to control a large portion of its remains.



# Section I
In his early years, Thrawn served under the Chiss Ascendancy.
The Chiss Ascendancy was a separate faction that operated in the unknown regions.
He quickly rose through its ranks, becoming a well-respected naval officer.
Those who were aware of his genius deeply respected him.
However, this was not the only faction he would serve under.
While on a mission somewhere in the unknown regions, he encountered a colony of Neimoidians.
They warned him of the Empire’s tyranny, and begged that he convince the Chiss government to go to war with the Empire.
However, he was hesitant to trust them, and informed the Chiss Aristocra of the incident.
It was decided that Thrawn would fake his exile, and go undercover in the Empire to weaken it, or attempt to form an alliance.



# Section II
Sure enough, Thrawn was eventually captured by the crew of an Imperial Venator known as the Strikefast, and brought back to Emperor Palpatine.
During their first encounter, Thrawn offered to exchange information about the unknown regions.
He also stated that Jedi Anakin Skywalker could vouch for his abilities, and was somewhat disappointed to hear that Anakin had perished before the conclusion of the Clone Wars, but he had spoken highly of Thrawn before he died.
The Emperor and Thrawn would have many discussions about the unknown regions, which were sparked by Palpatine’s deep interest in the topic.
Thrawn would also later be assigned to train at the Imperial Royal Academy, where he would be formally admitted into the Empire as an officer.
He faced discrimination within the academy, but he eventually graduated to receive the rank of Lieutenant.



# Section III
As a Lieutenant, he served on a Gozanti-class Cruiser named the Blood Crow.
During these first few years of his service, he would deal with minor tasks across the mid and outer rims, such as taking care of smuggling, aiding distressed ships, and occasionally defusing political situations.
He would later be reassigned.
After several other notable incidents, such as the Dromedar hijacking and the Battle over Umbara, Thrawn had come to rise the Imperial ranks quickly, and would eventually find himself back in the Emperor’s throne room, where he would be offered the rank of Grand Admiral by Palpatine himself.
At first he was hesitant to accept the promotion, and was still rather concerned that the Empire could try to use the Death Star on the Chiss.
However, the Emperor reassured him that he had no intent to use the weapon on the Chiss people, and Thrawn accepted the promotion, becoming the secret thirteenth person to ever hold the prestigious position.
It was also at this time when Thrawn first met Darth Vader.
The two briefly exchanged formalities, with Thrawn seemingly having no idea that he had already met him, however different he was at the time.



# Section IV
After receiving his promotion, he was stationed on Lothal to help local forces defend against a rebel cell in the area.
He led forces in several engagements, both on the ground and in space, to mild success.
The rebels he was battling employed very unusual battle tactics that worked to their favor, and as a result were able to escape each encounter with the Grand Admiral.
While he was stationed on Lothal, Thrawn also proposed a new design for a TIE fighter known as the TIE defender.
It was to wield strong shields, and more advanced weapon systems than its predecessor.
However, the design never completely passed its testing phase.
His final stand against the Rebel Alliance occurred on Lothal, and ended with his Star Destroyer, the Chimaera being forced to jump to an unknown location in hyperspace with rebel Jedi Ezra Bridger still on board, as part of his plan to sacrifice himself to win the battle and liberate Lothal from the Empire.
He succeeded in this plan due to having a large group of purrgil, a species of “space squids” who had the natural ability to jump to hyperspace and attach to Thrawn’s ship, and pull it with them when they jumped.



# Section V
Following this, Thrawn’s location was left to speculation as the Empire continued to fight the Alliance to Restore the Republic.
On some occasions, it was rumored that Emperor Palpatine would’ve preferred to assign the Grand Admiral to accomplish certain missions, however was brought back to a disappointed state once he remembered that he went missing years before.
It would not be long before the Empire fell to the Rebel Alliance after their crushing defeat at the Battle of Endor, which resulted in the destruction of the Second Death Star, the death of the Emperor, Lord Vader, and a huge portion of the imperial military.
However even after the New Republic fully replaced the Empire, it’s remains still operated in the shadows, with rumors that Thrawn would be the one to take command of it’s remaining military forces, and exact his revenge on the New Republic, with him even unofficially taking the title of Heir to the Empire.



# Section VI
The Grand Admiral’s military prowess was undeniable, and he employed several tactics that when executed correctly, could devastate enemy forces.
He thoroughly believed that the key to victory lay in learning about opponents, understanding their strategies, culture, and even art.
Thrawn even came to have his own sort of art collection, which consisted primarily of works that related to war campaigns he had led in the past.
He devised strategies involving the use of hyperspace and gravity wells, to strategically place his ships where they could be most effective in naval combat.
The Grand Admiral was also skilled in hand-to-hand combat, often practicing with training droids.
In conclusion, Grand Admiral Thrawn was a brilliant and effective military leader, whose efforts bolstered the success of the Galactic Empire greatly.
