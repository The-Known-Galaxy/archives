# History
Darth Hadra had murdered her opponents and enemies to achieve her position.
A rival of Darth Mekhis, Hadra presided over Dromund Kaas in addition to the Sphere of Technology.
Hadra got her position on the Dark Council after a Republic Strategic Information Service operation resulted in Mekhis's disappearance.
When her forces discovered an ancient Sith shrine near Kaas City, she attempted to claim it as her territory, but Darth Arctis, the Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, protested her claim and became embroiled in a conflict with Hadra.
During the year 3640 BBY, Hadra and Dark Councilor Darth Acharon traveled to the planet of Corellia to reinforce Darth Decimus, head of the Sphere of Military Strategy, in the war effort there.
Darth Hadra along with Acharon and Decimus were called via holo to an emergency Dark Council meeting by Darth Baras, who wanted to claim the position of Emperor's Voice and was struck down by the Emperor's Wrath.Hadra and the rest of the Dark Council pledged their loyalty to their Emperor's Wrath.
During the Republic push on the Legislature Building, Hadra locked herself in the safe room with the Corellian Council.
When a Republic Hero arrived to oppose her, she stated that the Council joined the Empire willingly, and her death would not change that.
After an intense fight, Hadra was defeated and killed.
