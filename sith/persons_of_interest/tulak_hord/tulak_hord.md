# Introduction

Tulak Hord was an ancient Dark Lord of the Sith who would become known as one of the greatest lightsaber duellists in galactic history.
The Dark Lord would utilize his lightsaber with such speed and ferocity that even in his earliest days as a student within the Sith Empire, the young Sith aspirant would inspire fear amongst his peers and those above him, leaving in his wake a legacy of destruction and power unrivalled by even the most powerful Dark Lords who would come after him.

# Part I

Tulak Hord began his life as a Sith student within the earliest version of the Sith Empire.
He displayed a natural mastery of the Force and martial combat that allowed him a swift ascension through the Sith Academy.
His skills were so great that it even caused his instructors to fear him, and none of his peers stood any chance of rivalling him.

Before Tulak Hord became a Dark Lord of the Sith he would duel and defeat a Dashade named Khem Val.
This is no small feat as the Dashade species had a notable immunity to the Force and had garnered a reputation as ruthless assassins and feared warriors.
Defeating Khem Val gained Tulak Hord his eternal respect and undying allegiance.
This gave Tulak Hord an even greater advantage during his early Sith career, granting him access to one of the deadliest assassins and warriors in the galaxy.

# Part II

The specifics of Tulak Hord’s rise to power are unknown, but we do know of one action that gained him the reputation as the most feared warrior in the galaxy.
During the early days of the Sith Empire, even before the Dromund system was conquered, Tulak Hord would be forced to deal with rebellion.
Sith rule at the time was barbaric and almost tribal in nature, as so many planets had a habit of rebelling against lesser Sith Lords who governed them.
Tulak Hord would put the terror of the dark side in these rebellious planets, amassing an army of Sith loyalists, Tulak Hord along with his right hand warrior and general, Khem Val, travelled to the worlds of Yn and Chabosh and waged a campaign of terror against the rebels.

During the reign of Tulak Hord he would go on to conquer the Dromund system which would later serve as the capital of the Sith Empire and seat of Imperial power.
During this time, Jedi and Sith alike both challenged Tulak Hord’s power but his mastery of lightsaber combat and almost unnatural mastery of the dark side allowed him to cut down swaths of Jedi and Sith with little effort.

# Part III

Tulak Hord was unique amongst Sith warriors in that he maintained a mastery of the Force and dark side alchemy that was typically unheard of by those so gifted in lightsaber combat.
When Tulak Hord was not waging war he would study alchemy, create holocrons of teachings and even write various books and journals regarding his experiences and what he’s learned.
Tulak Hord was a staunch traditionalist, being known for participating in the ancient Sith tradition called the ‘’Kaggath’’.
He was an honourable warrior despite being a Sith Lord and would expect the same from his Generals.

When a Sith Lord requested to become a General in Tulak Hord’s army he was initially dismissed, but the Sith Lord would challenge Tulak Hord in a Kaggath to which the Dark Lord was forced to accept.
Upon defeating the General, Tulak Hord granted the young Sith Lord his deserved honour and made him a General in his army.
Tulak Hord was not above deception however, often utilizing his follower, Khem Val to conduct assassinations against rivals and threats.

# Part IV

After conquering the Dromund system, Tulak Hord believed it was time to take an apprentice, an heir worthy of succeeding him as Dark Lord of the Sith Empire.
This was perhaps his greatest mistake.
Tulak Hord chose a young Sith named Ortan Cela who was particularly deceptive in nature and was not naturally gifted or exceptional in any particular way.
Tulak Hord would pass on many teachings to Ortan Cela but in typical Sith fashion, Ortan Cela betrayed his master.
Tulak Hord was so feared and so powerful that Ortan Cela would be incredibly foolish to challenge his master.
Knowing this fact, Ortan Cela would stab Tulak Hord in the back, killing the most feared warlord in the galaxy in perhaps the most controversial fashion.

It is unknown what became of Ortan Cela, but due to Sith tradition at the time it is unlikely Ortan was strong enough or considered worthy enough to take Tulak Hord’s mantle.
The death of the Lord of Hate caused a power struggle and plunged the Sith Empire into one of its most natural states, that of civil war.

# Part V

Tulak Hord was considered to be the greatest Sith blademaster for millenia, his teachings and abilities being renowned and studied even during the days of the Cold War and Old Republic.
Most of his journals, holocrons and belongings would be hidden and spread across the galaxy prior to his death and many Sith believed Tulak Hord had discovered immortality before he died.

His teachings and belongings would be sought after for centuries.
His lightsaber would end up in the hands of Darth Marr prior to his ascension to the Dark Council.
Some of his holocrons and even his terrifying mask would end up in the possession of Revan.
And his tomb stood forever as one of the grandest in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban.

The spirit of Tulak Hord would return on Yavin IV for a short while, alongside many other Sith Lords such as Freedon Nadd, Naga Sadow and Exar Kun.
But the purpose of the spirit’s existence is unknown, though likely sinister.
