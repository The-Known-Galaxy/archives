# Overview

Durge was a male Gen’dai bounty hunter born in 2022 BBY.
He was known for being ruthless and formidable, due to a combination of skill, experience, and his species.
Gen’dai were an extremely rare species, composed entirely of nerves and muscle, making them formless, and essentially able to take any form they needed to.
In addition, they possessed incredible regenerative abilities, being able to regrow their bodies at will.
They also could not die of old age, so Durge was blessed with thousands of years of experience in bounty hunting.

# History

Born in 2022 BBY, Durge was born on the unnamed Gen’dai homeworld.
From a young age, Durge was already in great physical shape and possessed an aggressive nature, unbecoming of most Gen’dai.
After witnessing bounty hunters on the job, Durge became obsessed with the profession.
He later left his tribe to explore the galaxy, training under several different bounty hunters along the way.
At one point, Durge met Jaing, a mandalorian bounty hunter who taught the Gen’dai everything about mandalorian combat skills and tactics.

Some time later, the two were approached by a doctor who offered to give the bounty hunters cybernetic enhancements.
Fearing they would become obsolete in combat without them, Durge and Jaing agreed to let the doctor give them the cybernetics.
The cybernetics essentially merged with their suits of armour with the new cybernetics.
Eager to test out their upgrades, Durge and Jaing engaged in a sparring match, but were interrupted by the doctor.
The doctor informed the bounty hunters that his facility had been breached by a clan of Mandalorian bounty hunters loyal to their enemy Ung Kusp had breached the door in search of a Sith artifact.
In the ensuing battle, Jaing was incapacitated by a thermal detonator, leading Durge to believe him dead and swear vengeance on the Mandalorians.

Durge would go on to fight in the new Sith Wars, facing off against multiple Jedi and learning several ways to kill them.
After the defeat of the Sith, Durge went into hiding.
100 years before the Battle of Naboo, Durge was hired to assassinate the then-Mandalore.
He was successful, but was also captured and tortured by the Mandalorians.
He eventually escaped, but it took him a century to recover from the torture, 60 of which were spent underground.
Durge re emerged at the time of the Clone Wars, only to be disappointed that most of the galaxys Mandalorians had died.
Durge was later invited to join the CIS by Count Dooku himself.
Durge took up the offer after learning that the Grand Army of the Republic was composed of Jedi and clones of a Mandalorian bounty hunter, giving him a second chance at revenge.
Durge would fight in several battles of the War, slaughtering countless Jedi and clones along the way.
Late in the war, Durge successfully managed to lure Obi-Wan Kenobi and his protege Anakin Skywalker to the Karthakk system aboard a stolen ship.
Believing Asajj Ventress was on board, Kenobi and Skywalker boarded the ship, only to be met with several explosives strategically placed along the way.
After being wounded, Kenobi was beaten mercilessly by Durge, only being saved when Skywalker stepped in.
Kenobi left in search of clues to Ventress’ whereabouts while Skywalker engaged the Gen’dai in combat.
After having his helmet destroyed by Skywalker, Durge went into a fit of fury, which Skywalker managed to exploit, throwing the Gen’dai into an escape pod and guiding it through the force to collide with the nearest star, disintegrating the pod and Durge with it.
