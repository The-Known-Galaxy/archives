# Overview

Darth Bane was a dark lord of the Sith in his own Sith order.
He witnessed the extinction of the Sith order, which he was a Sith Warrior in.
Bane, after witnessing the death of many Siths and developing a loneliness feeling, decided to make his own order along with the Sith philosophy, the rule of two.
He trained his apprentice, Darth Zannah in the ways of the Sith and later Zannah killed him.
Although it was a tragedy, Bane wanted this to happen because once an apprentice kills their master it proves that the apprentice is obviously stronger but also he will train his apprentice to become stronger than him and the cycle continues for a long time.
Many Sith killed their master.
One of the most common stories is how Darth Sidious killed his master Plagueis and after that there isn’t much about apprentices killing their masters because the rule of two is ignored.
The thousand year old philosophy almost ends with Sidious training Maul as his apprentice when there are already two Sith lords, which is him and his master Darth Plagueis.
However, Darth Sidious still trained Darth Vader and obeyed the rule of two up until his death.
Darth Sidious and Darth Vader were basically the last Sith lords who obeyed the rule of two.

During the Clone Wars, Yoda ventures to Moraband in order to gain immortality and along the way he encounters Darth Bane which is the one of the 1st times he was mentioned in a canon story.
Darth Bane had a weird helmet/mask and armour.
This is called Orbalisk armour and he wore the helmet in his sleep in order for him to prevent the Orbalisk from growing into his facial parts and smothering him.
Bane used the Orbalisk as power by feeding it his dark side energy so that the Orbalisk could help him heal and grow more powerful.
The Orbalisk is a poisonous creature and inflicts pain in its host if it is normal but luckily for Bane he had the force and could feed it so it’ll work in his favour.

# Insight into Bane's Legacy

Darth Bane was a magnificent Sith.
He was the founder of one of the most well-known sith philosophies, the rule of two.
Bane was a dark lord of the sith and was born on the ancient sith home planet, Moraband, modern Korriban.
Darth Bane is the so-called “founder of the modern sith”.
He was lurking in the shadows waiting to strike the Jedi and rise to power so he could rule the galaxy.
He was a human male who was the one and only Sith to survive the Jedi-Sith war and went into hiding.
Bane, having witnessed the greed and blindness for power the sith craved, decided to start a new sith tradition that states there can only be a master and an apprentice.

Once the apprentice was strong enough they’d often kill their own masters and claim the title.
Darth Zannah, Bane’s apprentice, did this along with many other sith.
This tradition was put in place so the Sith wouldn’t make the same mistake as the brotherhood of darkness did and so the Sith had a chance to defeat the Jedi by training those who have the capability to become a powerful sith lord and continue the cycle.
The rule of two was first broken when Darth Sidious trained Darth Maul as his apprentice even though he was still learning from Plagueis.
However, many Sith before Palpatine obeyed the rule of two and continued Bane’s legacy to dominate the galaxy and the Jedi with it.

# Personality, Traits and Abilities

Darth Bane was a pale-skinned male Sith lord with yellow eyes, or Sith Eyes, who believed people with strength should be dominating those who are weak in order to gain power.
He was a visionary and philosopher who witnessed the downfall of the Sith.
However, he made a new Sith order and invented the rule of two.
Bane studied many Sith documents to invent this philosophy and he saw the loneliness some Sith felt and he did something about it, which was the inventining the rule of two.
Bane was a Sith Warrior in the old order and was a skilled combatant with the ability to create impressive military tactics and to wield the force powerfully.
Although he was a powerful Sith his weakness was diplomacy, Bane wasn’t a diplomatic Sith lord he relied on military tactics and like many other Sith, he inflicted fear into the hearts of many beings.

Darth Bane used form II, which is also known as Makashi, in lightsaber battles.
He believed that with the lightsaber hilt curved it’ll fit better in the wielder’s hand and combat would be easier, which was accurate because Count Dooku who was one of the best lightsaber wielders on both sides during the clone wars also used makashi form and had a curved hilt lightsaber.
Darth Bane could control his Orbalisk infection by wearing a mask during the day and his sleep.
He used the Orbalisk and its armour to help him heal himself and grow stronger because he fed it his dark force energy.
The Orbalisk gave Darth Bane adrenaline in his bloodstream which allowed him to draw out his dark side power allowing him to grow stronger.
Although it had its perks for him, if Bane couldn’t control his anger he’d go into a mindless rage.
The Orbalisk had a weakness, it's believed that electricity could impact the Orbalisk but Darth Bane and his Orbalisk could absorb that energy.
Darth Bane’s Orbalisk was removed from his skin and was made into armour hence why he wears the mask and armour.
This had the same benefits but Darth Bane wouldn't have to worry about it growing in his face.
