# Overview
During the Draggulch Period around 2000 BBY, Darth Ruin, formerly known as Phanius, was a male Umbaran who ruled as a Dark Lord of the Sith at the beginning of the Draggulch Period.
Formerly an esteemed Jedi Master,  Phanius gained notoriety within the Jedi Order due to the fact that he firmly believed that his will would have precedence over everything else in the universe.
Phanius diverged from the Jedi ideology, leading him on an alternative path that led him to the dark side-the way of the Sith, which ultimately led him to abandon the Jedi Order in pursuit of his individualistic ideology.

 Trying to create a new empire by re-igniting the Sith, Phanius rallied various Sith clans under his leadership to formalise this new Sith empire.
Quite a few years later, under the new name of Darth Ruin, the former Jedi Master declared himself to be a Dark Lord of the Sith.
Additionally, fifty more Jedi were converted as a result of the Fourth Great Schism.
With Lord Ruin's final act of resurgence and the emergence of the New Sith Wars, the Sith resurgence has culminated in a galactic-scale conflict against the Jedi Order and the Old Republic.


Due to the Dark Lord's own ruthless egomania, which was a direct result of the Dark Lord's own ruthless egomania, the reign of Darth Ruin ended in untimely death following the assassination of the Dark Lord.
Though Ruin had tragically perished, the bloody legacy of his machinations has endured for a millennium.
The Sith crusades, despite their frequent disagreements and back stabbings, have continued for a millennium in his absence, and have brought galactic civilization to the brink of extinction.

# Darth Ruin's Legacy
As a result of the actions of the late Darth Ruin the Sith have been given a new era of expansion and renaissance.
While he was not around, the New Sith Wars continued for thousands of years despite his absence.
A number of prominent Dark Lords rose to power during this time and were brought to prominence through various destructive campaigns against the Jedi and the Republic, pushing the latter to the brink of collapse.
It was Darth Rivan, the infamous Sith Lord who had at one time possessed a text passage titled the "creed of ruin" which was reminiscent of Ruin's solipsistic philosophy which was among these leading figures of the Sith.


The treachery which had originally led to Ruin's death continued to plague the Sith ranks despite the string of crushing victories Ruin's successors achieved, with many subsequent Dark Lords succumbing to the same fate as their predecessor.
The Sith finally turned against one another at some point during the Republic Dark Age, which began in 1100 BBY, causing the empire founded by Ruin to fracture.
After the remnants of the Sith were reorganised into the Brotherhood of Darkness in 1000 BBY, they succumbed to the New Sith Wars and ultimately perished.


Darth Bane, a lone survivor from the Brotherhood, went on to establish a revised conception of Sith doctrine to combat the traps which destroyed Ruin and his successors, and Bane explained the study of the Sith in the Book of Sith, a compilation of historical evidence.
Ruin's legacy was portrayed with a very grim view by the Jedi Order in a guide titled The Jedi Path, arguing that his revival of the Sith nearly led to the demise of the galactic civilization.
Jedi historian Tionne Solusar compiled an encyclopaedic compendium about the Force in 40 ABY, a volume in which she outlined Ruin's former life as a Jedi Master as well as his motivations for leaving the Order to establish the New Sith.



# Personality & Traits
In addition to being one of the most charismatic and talented Jedi in his time, Master Phanius was also a pale blue-skinned member of the Umbaran species.
Despite the challenges, however, the Jedi Master stirred controversy with his intellectual pursuits.
He was especially fascinated with the philosophy of solipsism during this period.
Phanius was ambitious, abstract, and believed that what he saw as the essence of all existence was actually made up of his own perceptions, meaning that from his perspective, he was essentially the universe's all-embracing essence.
As a result of his self-centred attitude, Phanius came to resent the Jedi Order, which he felt was a hindrance in his vision.
He believed the Jedi teachings were one of the things that was hindering the Umbaran from recognizing the totality of who he was in reality.
Phanius became determined to obliterate these inhibitions and so he took on the identity of Darth Ruin as a dark lord, a path that would take him down the dark path of the Sith.
He became increasingly consumed by his individualistic obsessions as he sought to revive the Sith, gradually connecting with his Sith followers only in a way that was detachable from their actions.
As a result of Ruin's ruthless ambition and ruthless impulses, he became a widely despised leader, an assassination target, and he eventually fell from grace.
However, that did not stop the Dark Lord from remaining unwaveringly confident in his monomaniacal pursuit, leaving him completely blind to the treachery which would eventually bring about his death
