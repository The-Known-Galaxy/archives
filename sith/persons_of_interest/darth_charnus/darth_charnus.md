# Overview
Darth Charnus was a human male Sith Lord who served the reconstituted Sith Empire as the right hand of the cunning Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Decimus.
Charnus wasn’t as cunning as Decimus, but he made up for it with his cruelty.
His skills were noticed by other Sith, for he could easily interrogate prisoners.
His interrogation skills were so well-known that he was frequently assigned tasks to investigate secret communities that sought to kill the Emperor.
The main organisation he investigated was the Order of Revan, built by the followers of the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Revan.
Charnus and his apprentice, Emic Sandor, defeated this organisation during some time between the Cold War and Galactic War.
As always they were successful and didn’t leave a single traitor alive.
Unfortunately, Charnus killed a lot of innocent people, which he tried to avoid because he wanted to keep the damage he caused to a reasonable amount.
At the start of the Galactic War, Charnus was sent to the Battle of Corellia so he could aid their resistance.
He got there via his own dreadnought ship, which was combined with the Centurion-class battlecruiser Tears of Taris.
This ship was indeed present and named after the bombardment of the planet Taris before the Empire got its hands on it.
It was very useful and served the Empire for over three hundred years.
