# Introduction
Darth Marr was a Human Dark Lord of the Sith and member of the ruling Dark Council during the Great Galactic War, Cold War, and the Galactic War with the Galactic Republic.
Darth Marr was born in 3702 BBY and would later assume his seat on the Dark Council in his early twentys.
Darth Marr would lead the Sphere of Defense of the Empire during the Great Galactic War as he would drive back Republic offensives.
Darth Marr would later watch the numbers of the Dark Council dwindle due to some members dying out on the battlefield and others dying due to infighting amount the Dark Council.
Due to this Darth Marr would later be put as the sole leader of the Imperial Military until his Death.

# Early Career
Darth Marrs History is shrouded in lots of mystery.
Darth Marr decided to train down the path of a Sith Warrior.
Darth Marr adopted an armored-type battlesuit with a mask and hood the mask he wore was emotionless thus invoking the idea of a monstrous sithspawn creature.
Darth Marr recovered his Lightsaber from the ancient  Sith Lord Tulak Hord on the planet Dromund Fels shortly before he would take his seat on the Dark Council.
Around the year 3678 BBY Darth Marr and several other Dark Council Members would head to Korriban to confront the Sith Lord Calypho.
Later the Sith Lord Calypho would be arrested for heresy.



# Defender of the Empire
Darth Marr would also take part in the Great Galactic War.
During this time he would earn a fearsome reputation among both Empire and Republic.
Darth Marr would lead countless forces in the conquest of Republic planets as well as lead the defense forces of Korriban and Ziost two planets the Republic tried to invade however Darth Marr would repel each invitation by the Republic.
Later as the Great Galactic War would come to an end and peace between Empire and Republic was forged tensions between both sides were still very high.
Darth Marr took it upon himself to build up and strengthen Imperial holdings on planets so the Empire would be well prepared for the next Galactic War.



# Empire on the Brink
In 3638 BBY Darth Marr would get word of Hutt Cartel's activity on Makeb.
Darth Marr would call upon the Empire Hero’s to help in the matter as the Emperor was absent and he himself needed to attend to the war.
While Darth Marr was attending to the war he tasked the Hero’s and their small team to recover the Hutt’s supply of Isotope 5 so Imperial ships could be powered by it.
Darth Marr would later find that the Hutt’s had used all the Isotope 5 to build a Droid Army.
With the Isotope 5 all used up Darth Marr tasked the Hero’s team to find a way to get Isotope 5 or they would face his wrath.
Later on, the Hero’s and their team would find a way to stabilize Makebs core and continue mining Isotope 5.



# Against the Emperor
Later during the War Darth Marr and the Empire would enter into an uneasy alliance with the Republic in order to stop Reven and his Order from bringing Emperor Vitiate back to life.
Reven sought to bring the Emperor back to life to finally kill the Emperor once and for all.
What was unclear was that all the death and destruction on Yavin 4 brought the Emperor back to life just like Reven wanted but not how Reven envisioned Reven brought the Emperor’s spirit back and unleashed it on the galaxy causing lots of problems.
Emperor Vitiate would later attack the planet of Ziost wreaking havoc and possessing millions of people of equipment killing thousands before finally taking all life on Ziost.
From this point, Darth Marr would lead the Empire and Republic coalition force to find and kill the Emperor.
These events would lead him and the Empire’s and Republic’s Heros to Wild space in which a probe would come out of hyperspace and fly around Darth Marr’s ship thus showing his location and allowing the Eternal Fleet to drop out of hyperspace on top of him.
Darth Marr’s ship would later be destroyed by the Eternal Fleet he would be captured alongside the Empire’s and Republic’s hero’s.
After Darth Marr’s capture, he was brought to the Throne room of the Emperor of the Eternal Empire.
Darth Marr would know right off the bat that this Emperor Valkorian was Emperor Vitiate in a different body.
Emperor Valorian would offer Darth Marr the chance to rule alongside him as long as Darth Marr would kneel.
Darth Marr refused to kneel claiming “I will never again kneel to you” and then promptly went on a small rampage killing a few Knight’s of Zakuul before Emperor Valkorian would fire a powerful surge of force lightning killing Darth Marr instantly.



# Post-Mortem
Even though Darth Marr had died in the Throne room above Zakuul his restless spirit would not move on and be at peace.
Darth Marr’s force ghost would move to seek out old enemies and later ally Satele Shan who both later in life would save the alliance commander and try to help him by giving knowledge and insight on Zakuul and it’s power.
Darth Marr would later tell the alliance commander that he needed to gain new insight and new weapons if he was going to be the Eternal Empire.
Darth Marr’s final stand was in helping the alliance commander in destroying Tenebrae the old Sith Emperor
