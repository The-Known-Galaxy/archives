# Biography:

Darth Vindican was a male Pureblood Sith Lord, trained by Darth Ikora.
Vindican was quickly ranked Sith Master and took in the young and ambitious Sith Lord, Darth Malgus.
Vindican taught Malgus everything he knew, and Malgus would soon become a more powerful Sith Lord than Vindican ever would.
Malgus would join the Dark Council and create his own Empire, which didn't last long.
Vindican and his apprentice were a part of the fleet that reclaimed the Sith home planet, Korriban.
During this takeover, Vindican and Malgus boarded a Republic dock and fought off two powerful Jedi.
Vindican was incapacitated during this fight and Malgus killed the Zabrak Master.
The Master’s apprentice survived and escaped to become the powerful Grand Master of the Jedi order, Master Satele Shan.
Vindican had the upper hand for most of the battle until his helmet was cut off, and he was stabbed by Darach.
However, the two were successful in reclaiming Korriban.
Vindican was proud, but Malgus was angered by Satele’s escape, so he blamed it on Vindican, who stated it was only the beginning.
Malgus cut the Sith Lord’s head off as Vindican was gazing at their success.
Darth Vindican was trained by the legendary hero of the Sith, Darth Ikoral, who believed that Vindican was his best student yet.
Darth Vindican was an aggressive Pureblood, who was powerful in the Force and a skilled lightsaber-wielder.
Before he died, Malgus referred to him as a failure for allowing Satele Shan to escape but Vindican was positive that the Sith would emerge once more to take over the galaxy.
With this being said, Malgus welcomed his Master home and sliced his head off.
Vindican used a double-bladed lightsaber in his duel with Darach and could deflect missiles sent by Republic troopers.
He was a powerful Sith Lord, who learned from one of the best and taught one of the best.
