# Section I

One of the most important faces within the Sith, Darth Jadus was a male Human assumed to be born on Dromund Kaas, in 3688 BBY, later on serving as a Sith Lord during the reconstituted Sith Empire times.

He was known for keeping a kind and willing personality to the Empire; he showed no sign of weakness or rage, a surprise to many because of his position within the Dark Council, ruling the Imperial Intelligence sphere.
He went so far to the point where he began wearing a mask to hide his rage, as it might be a weakness.

Eventually, his good affinity to the Empire would end as he would resort to betraying and overthrowing his other councilors so he can unite the Empire and pass on the techniques and methods to its citizens because of the constant civil wars and xenophobia bothering his mind.
He was revealed to be the mastermind behind the terrorist organization, Eagle network.

Nothing much was known of his fate besides his disappearance within the galaxy as a whole.
His daughter and apprentice Zhorrid took after his legacy and became Imperial Intelligence's dark counselor.

Many years later, Jadus was assumed to be active and in power, believed to have led the War on lokath.

# Powers & Abilities

Jadus, being in second-in-command, was insanely strong.
He was known to be able to cast strong force abilities such as teleportation, force choke, force lightning, force corruption, and force healing.
He was also great at dueling, only wielding a single-bladed Sith lightsaber, let alone his dark side aura that could cause people great distress and anguish.

His potency was further acknowledged by Dread Master Raptus and other members of the Dread Masters.
