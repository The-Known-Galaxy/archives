# Overview

Darth Ikoral was a Pureblood Sith Lord who served the reconstituted Sith Empire.
Ikoral was able to track his ancestry of Pureblood Sith and learned that he is related to Purebloods that date almost as far as King Adaâ€™s time.
Ikoral was able to survive perilous events many times.
His survival tactics managed to impress the Sith Emperor himself and Ikoral claimed that this was because the Pureblood Sith race were superior.
Darth Ikoral was determined to find any Pureblood Siths that escaped Korriban during the Great Hyperspace War and never went to Dromund Kaas, so he decided to ask the Dark Council for their permission for him to host an expedition to find them.
Once he returned, his popularity grew and they all knew his name for the sacrifices he made for the Sith Empire.
Darth Ikoral found thousands of Purebloods, but after seventy years of looking, the Empire changed and made peace with the Republic.
This infuriated Ikoral so he and his Purebloods wreaked havoc upon the galaxy in protest.
The Empire sent a strike team, led by Darth Malgus who was the apprentice of lord Vindican who was a former apprentice of Ikoral.
The strike team found Ikoral in his personal sanctum on his flagship, the Red Reaper, and they engaged in combat.
Ikoral was defeated by the powerful Malgus even though Ikoral used the Purebloods as an experiment so he could gain more power.
