# Overview

Karness Muur was one of the eight fallen Jedi that were exiled to Korriban to pursue the ways of the Dark Side of the Force.
He was in charge of leading the Sith species on Korriban as a Sith Lord along with Ajunta Pall and XoXaan.
Muur possessed his own device known as the Muur Talisman, a Sith artifact that allowed Muur to dominate the body and mind of whoever wore his device when he was dead.
Karness died when he tried to go against Cade Skywalker’s will through the Muur Talisman, but was defeated when Cade overwhelmed both him and his Sith artifact with Force energy.

# History

Throughout the Hundred-Year Darkness, Karness Muur served as a Sith Lord along with Ajunta Pall and XoXaan in the Sith Order.
After enslaving the Sith in Korriban, Sorzus Syn, one of the eight Dark Jedi, gave Karness Muur the Muur Talisman artifact.
This artifact allowed Karness to possess the being of the person who wore his device.
Karness Muur’s knowledge and power eventually gained him new enemies, one of them being Remulus Dreypa, who captured and put him into his oubliette along with his Muur Talisman.

Karness Muur survived by binding his spirit to his Talisman device.
During 3963 BBY, Muur’s spirit bonded with Jedi Master Celeste Morne through the Muur Talisman.
Zayne Carrick, who was in the same place as Celeste Morne, placed her in Dreypa’s oubliette so she couldn’t cause any problem while controlled by the ancient Sith Lord.
Four thousand years later, Vader discovered the Muur Talisman device, but unfortunately for him, it was inside of an oubliette.
He opened Dreypa’s oubliette, but while he tried to take the Talisman artifact, he woke Muur and Morne up.
Karness noticed that the new Dark Lord of the Sith’s power was incredible and begged Morne to let him wear the Talisman, but Celeste ignored him and fought the Sith Lord.
Celeste Morne turned Vader’s clone troopers into rakghouls, making them go against Vader.
This decision made Muur mad, as he was imprisoned in a weak Jedi’s body.

Twenty years later after the meeting of Vader and Celestia, Karness Muur saw a new opportunity to get into a new being’s body, and the candidates were Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa.
Muur tried to dominate Leia, but unfortunately for him, Celestia took the Muur Talisman out of Leia’s neck.

A century later, Celestia Morne and Karness Muur traveled to Had Abaddon.
There, they met Darth Krayt and Cade Skywalker, who went to Had Abaddon to ‘negotiate’.
The deal they both made was actually a trap against Darth Krayt.
Darth Krayt was considered dead as he was stabbed by Azlyn Rae, so Muur decided to go against Cade Skywalker.
Cade Skywalker killed Celeste Morne and made her disintegrate, leaving the Muur Talisman.
Karness’ device went to Cade’s arm, but the Jedi revealed to Muur that the trap wasn’t only for Darth Krayt and overwhelmed Muur and his Talisman device with Force energy, killing him forever.
