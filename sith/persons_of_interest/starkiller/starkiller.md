# Overview

Born in Kashyyyk, Galen Marek or also known as Starkiller, was a Force-Sensitive human male who was strong with the force.

Galen was Darth Vader’s secret apprentice due to the Rule of Two.
Since Vader was still Sidious’ apprentice, Galen couldn’t consider himself a Sith until Darth Vader killed the Emperor.
Although he was extremely loyal to his mentor, he was betrayed by Darth Vader after Sidious confronted them.

# Training under Darth Vader

After being taken by Darth Vader as his “secret” apprentice, Starkiller fulfilled the role of Vader’s secret assassin.
As part of his training to become a Sith, he was subjected to brutal training against PROXY, who would try to keep him sharp during every session.
During a sparring duel in 3 BBY, at the end of said fight, Vader ordered Starkiller to kneel before him to recognize Galen as his new apprentice.
His first test was to go to Nar Shaddaa to kill Jedi Master Rahm Kota.
Vader also ordered him to not leave any witnesses in the shipyard Rahm Kota was attacking by killing everyone in it.

Once Starkiller arrived at the shipyard, Jedi General Kota felt disappointed because he expected to meet Darth Vader instead of a little boy.
After a short talk from Kota, Starkiller decided to start the battle with a Force Lightning attack, and the fight began.
After a tough duel, Rahm Kota noticed he was being surpassed by the young apprentice, and decided to leave by dropping his lightsaber and unleashing a telekinetic blast.
Following this decision made by Rahm Kota, Starkiller took the Jedi General’s lightsaber and gave it to his master after getting out of Nar Shaddaa.
After this mission was finished, Starkiller kept training and being loyal to Darth Vader by following his orders.
His new mission was established; he had to go to Raxus Prime and kill Kazdan Paratus, who was way stronger than the young apprentice.

After a very long trip to Raxus Prime, Starkiller arrived in his search for the Jedi Master.
After making his way into the Jedi Temple, he was attacked by Paratus’ droid sentries who he killed easily.
Following this, a Golem Tore attacked Starkiller and started a fight that moved to Paratus’ mock Jedi Council.
Eventually, he disabled the Golem, where he later met Kazdan Paratus, and the fight started.

During this duel, Starkiller took advantage of Paratus’ mock Jedi Council mannequins, and threw Yoda’s one at him, leaving the Jedi Master distraught.
After this, Starkiller took control of the battle, evading Kazdan’s telekinetic assaults.
In the attempt to kill Starkiller, Paratus threw a machinery chunk at the young apprentice, who in turn caught it and threw it back, killing Paratus and completing his mission successfully.

# Betrayal

The Emperor, Darth Sidious, noticed Darth Vader had been training an apprentice behind his back and obligated him to assassinate Starkiller.
Once the Apprentice arrived at Vader’s chambers, he stabbed him from the back with his lightsaber.
Starkiller was confused because he thought Darth Vader lured the emperor, but instead, he was there to see him die.
After Sidious left, Vader ordered his droids to get his apprentice’s body back to the Dark Lord’s science vessel from the vacuum of space.
After Starkiller woke up, he accused his master of trying to kill him, but Vader said he was obligated by his master, Darth Sidious.
Vader offered Starkiller to keep being his secret apprentice, and he accepted because his other choice was to die.

As his last betrayal, Starkiller was called by Darth Vader to notify him about the Rebels' situation.
Juno was worried and questioned Vader’s intentions, but Starkiller told her everything would be fine.
A meeting between Starkiller and other Rebels was interrupted by the Imperial Military along with Darth Vader.
Vader ordered the Troopers to keep the rebels alive, as they were going to get killed personally by the Emperor.
After Vader defeated Kota and all the Rebels surrendered, he advanced on Starkiller, accusing him of revealing his status as the Dark Lord of the Sith’s secret apprentice.
Vader afterward threw the stone table at Starkiller, making him go to the snow.
The young apprentice managed to survive the fall due to his body rebuild and asked Darth Vader why he interfered with the meeting when he agreed not to.
Vader responded by saying not only his mission, but his apprenticeship was a lie.
Starkiller told him that without him, he would never be free.
Following this, Darth Vader was prepared to strike and kill his disciple but was saved by PROXY, who was using Obi-Wan Kenobi’s combat module.
Starkiller went through a lie the entire time during his training under Darth Vader and was ready to make his former master pay.
