# Overview

Darth Stryfe, a One Sith member, has an obscured childhood.
His rank ascended to Sith Lord within the order, and eventually, he became Darth Krayt's hand.
During a confrontation with Cade Skywalker and his allies on Abbadon, Stryfe was defeated, and his master was killed, though he wasn't aware of this at the time.
Darth Wyyrlok, Krayt's killer, tricked Stryfe into pledging allegiance to his galaxy unification plan.
Stryfe embarked on a mission to Dac, but was unsuccessful.
His retreat was prompted by the unexpected arrival of the Empire-in-exile, who came to assist Admiral Stazi with evacuation.
When Stryfe discovered Darth Krayt was alive, he eliminated the traitor and regained his status.
His life ended on Coruscant after a victorious but costly battle against Jedi Master Wolf Sazen, whose inflicted injuries ultimately led to Stryfe's death.

# Biography

Darth Stryfe, a One Sith member under Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, took control of Ossus in 137 ABY to locate a hidden temple.
Despite initial failed efforts due to the Jedi's intervention, Stryfe's potent force sensitivity signaled the Jedi's presence, resuming the search.
An attack on the found Jedi Academy led to injuring Jedi Master Kâ€™Kruhk, though the Jedi fled to the Hidden Temple.The same year, Cade Skywalker's escape from captivity prompted Stryfe's promotion to Krayt's hand.
Skywalker's assassination attempt on Krayt at a Sith Outpost resulted in his mutation into a Rakghoul.
Stryfe decapitated the mutated Skywalker while defending the outpost.
Following these events, the spirit of ancient Sith Lord Karness Muur manipulated Celeste Morne, a Jedi from the Old Republic era, using the Muur Talisman.
Muur offered Krayt his dark side healing knowledge and captured Cade Skywalker to lure Krayt to Had Abbadon.
A heated battle ensued, which Stryfe joined, defending Krayt and eventually clashing with Skywalker.Post-battle, Krayt was presumed injured but was actually killed by Darth Wyyrlock, who then initiated an unsuccessful attack on Dac.
When Krayt's survival was revealed, he quickly reclaimed power, eliminating the traitor Wyyrlok.
With knowledge of the Hidden Temple's location, the Sith launched an attack, which was thwarted by the Empire-In-Exile.
Retreating to their Coruscant temple, they were followed by Skywalker, who along with Jedi Master Wolf Sazen, confronted Stryfe and Darth Talon.
Despite Stryfe's victory over Sazen, the battle injuries he suffered caused his death.

# Personality and traits

Darth Stryfe, characterized by his black and red tattoos, black hair, and orange irises, was a brutal and ruthless Sith.
His military prowess earned him fear and respect, making him Darth Krayt's hand due to his unmatched competency.
This honor instilled in him an unshakeable loyalty, even to the point of laying down his life for his master.
However, his overconfidence led him to dismiss Saarai as a non-threat, a miscalculation that contributed to his downfall.
He also had a quick temper, losing focus when goaded, a weakness that was exposed during his duel with Cade Skywalker.

# Powers and abilities

Known for his usage of raw power, intensity and a one handed lightsaber, Darth Stryfe was capable of sweeping through hordes of rakghouls without breaking a sweat.
Against tradition in the One Sith, he used a smooth and metallic hilt contrary to the coral hilts his peers used.
However, what differentiated him from the rest was his proficiency with the force.
With a wide range of abilities such as telekinesis, force sense and Force Lighting.
With these three Stryfe could overpower almost any opponent, but it wasn't enough to save him from defeat at the hands of his apprentice Saarai.
