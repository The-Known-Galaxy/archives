# Overview
Ennix Devian was a Male Human who was the Supreme Commander of the Restored Empire, a splinter faction of the Imperial Remnant, in 13 ABY.
Having previously worked as an assassin for the Galactic Empire during the early days of the Galactic Civil War, a rebellion that lasted from 4 BBY to 5 ABY that resulted in the defeat and disbanding of the Galactic Empire.
Devian was also known to be the personal hitman of the late Emperor Palpatine, Ennix having been trained by none other than Darth Vader himself.
Following the Empire’s collapse, under the rule of Carnor Jax and the Imperial Interim Ruling Council, Devian sought to reform the Imperial Remnant, who at this time were losing to the New Republic, with the same vision that the late Emperor Palpatine had for his Empire during his reign.


Devian established his faction the Restored Empire, as a rogue third faction and contender in the ongoing conflict between the Remnant and Republic.
Amassing a military force composed of renegade Imperial officers and soldiers, including the forces of one General Vota, along with some discarded hardware of the Galactic Republic discovered on the barren world of RZ7-6113-23, where Devian had made his base of operations upon.
Devian had devised a plan to bring about the destruction of both the Remnant and Republic with the use of a volatile and explosive substance known as Zinethium, planning large scale terror attacks on the galactic capital of Coruscant to coerce the two factions into continuing the conflict, with the hope of the two obliterating each other.

In order to plant the Zinethium on Coruscant, Devian had offered Kir Kanos, a former member of the Emperor’s Royal Guard, the chance to join the Restored Empire.
However, Kanos’ conflicting sense of honor, due to his views of Devian’s often extreme tactics, prevented him from accepting Devian’s offer, but Devian had foresaw something like this happening and had let Kanos escape, knowing he would go to Coruscant to warn the New Republic.
Devian had planted the Zinethium in the shuttle that Kanos had stolen beforehand, however, the plan had failed due to the intervention of the Jedi Master, Luke Skywalker, of the New Jedi Order and the forces of the New Republic discovering Devians base on RZ7-6113-23, forcing him to abandon the base and to accelerate his plans.


Devian, in accordance with his plans, had sabotaged peace talks between the Imperial Remnant and the New Republic, which resulted in the death of a wealthy Imperial leaning Barons daughter, Feena D’Asta the daughter of Ragez D’Asta.
Framing the attack on the New Republic, Devian launched a full-scale assault on the Imperial capital of Orinda, which was left undefended as Imperial forces engaged in a retaliatory strike against the Republic on Coruscant.
When the Imperial fleet, commanded by Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, was able to regroup at Orinda, Devian was able to capture the admiral and attempted to force him to surrender, however, Devians plans had collapsed when the fleets of the D’Asta family arrived to help reinforce their Imperial allies.
The Baron, Ragez D’Asta, was informed of Devians involvement in his daughter’s death by Kir Kanos.
In the chaos of the battle, Devian fought Kir Kanos in one-on-one melee combat, to which Devian lost the duel and was slain by Kir Kanos.

# Biography
Ennix Devian was a Male Human that grew up in the alien slums of the planet Abregado-rae, before the times of the Galactic Empire.
When Devian grew up, he would join the Commission for the Protection of the Republic, which would later become COMPNOR, the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order.
Devian would later enter into the Imperial Security Bureau, where his talents had come under the scrutiny of Emperor Palpatine himself.

Devain had come to be known within Imperial circles as a talented assassin during the Galactic Civil War, working directly under the Galactic Emperor, and Dark Lord of the Sith, Palpatine.
Palpatine’s apprentice and enforcer, Darth Vader, had selected Devian to be trained in deadly duels usually against darksiders, such as Antinnis Tremayne.
Inone duel, within the arena known as The Squall, Devain was able to kill his competitors, but had lost his right eye to the Dark Lord, which he had quickly replaced with a cybernetic eye.


As an additional reward for surviving The Squall, Darth Vader also gave Devian a prominent scar of his left arm.
Devians last test was to survive alone on the planet of Honoghr while being hunted by a party of Noghri Death Commandos.
When Ennix Devian had passed, he became the personal hitman of Emperor Palpatine, being given the nickname of Palpatine’s Kaarenth Impaler and being known to the Imperial Court.

Following the formation of the Imperial Remnant, the remains of the Galactic Empire after their defeat at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Devian had become dissatisfied with the leadership of the Imperial Ruling Council, under both Xandel Carivus and Carnor Jax.
Following the splintering of the Imperial Ruling Council, Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon had taken the reins of the Remnant.
Many Imperials, including Devian, thought of Gilad as a disgrace to the Imperial name and Devian felt that the Imperials had to embrace their old roots again.
As such, Devian had proclaimed himself as the Supreme Commander of a splinter faction, the Restored Empire, in 13 ABY.
Supreme Commander Devian’s charisma and conservative Imperial views allowed him to attract many followers within the Imperial Remnant, including that of General Vota and his forces.


After Devian’s spy network, which included Zam Basdor, a dignitary of Pellaeon and a member of his inner circle, uncovered plans to sign a peace treaty in order to officially end the Galactic Civil War between the Imperial Remnant and New Republic, Devian launched into action, organizing a complex plot to destroy both factions.
Supreme Commander Devian made his base of operations on the barren planet of RZ7-6113-23 within the Chopani Sector, which had a large storage of discarded Clone War Era military hardware.
Using the resources found within the base, Devian was able to amass a fleet of Venator-Class Star Destroyers and Acclamator-Class Assault Ships.
By Devian’s order, the New Republic frigate, named the Endor, was destroyed by the planetary cannon on RZ7-6113-23 when it was investigating the Chopani Sector.

Phase One of Devian’s plan was to send a group of assassins to kill the Solo family within the Imperial Palace on Coruscant, while Phase Two of the plan was to damage New Republic and Imperial Remnant relations through sabotaging peace talks by launching a series of terror attacks on Coruscant.
In order to improve his men’s morale and improve the legitimacy of his cause, Devian hired the famed bounty hunter, Boba Fett, to track down the former Imperial Royal Guardsman, Kir Kanos, who Devian had described as both the living artifact and embodiment of the late Emperor Palpitine’s ideals, however, this was only a means to his true goal.
While Devian had hired Fett to retrieve Kanos to bring back to the headquarters of the Restored Empire, Devian’s benefactor, Nom Anor, hired a group of thieves to infiltrate a Class-3 toxic weapons dump on the planet Nyara, in order to retrieve chunks of a substance known as Zinethium.

Devian wanted to use this volatile and explosive substance to destroy the Imperial Palace on Coruscant and to eliminate the entire New Republic government.
He had planned on using Kir Kanos to plant the substance, since Devian knew that Kanos would reject his offer to join him and would immediately attempt to turn himself over to New Republic custody in order to save the person Kanos loved, Mirith Sinn.
However, after Phase One of the plan had failed, Devian had brushed off the setback and proceeded with Phase Two of the plan.


Boba Fett had successfully retrieved Kir Kanos and brought him to the Empires headquarters, where Devian presented Kanos with the traditional Imperial Royal Guard uniform and acquainted him with his ideals over a dinner Devian hosted in his honor.
Kanos, however, viewed Devian as nothing more than a dishonorable thug, an opinion which was reinforced by Devian slaying his own soldier, Lonkin, in order to prove his worth in combat.


Devian then proceeded to explain to Kranos his plot to destroy Coruscant with Zinethium and as expected the guardsmen refused his offer to join.
Devian would have him imprisoned to help him rethink his decision before being forced to execute him, which Devian did to create an illusion for Kir Kanos, but while Kanos was in a cell, Devian planted the Zinethium on a prepared shuttle he expected Kanos would use to flee off-world.
Kanos was able to escape from his cell, using an improvised explosive from a blaster he was able to secretly take off of Devian during their conversation, kill some of Devian’s stormtroopers, which Devian sacrificed in order to maintain the illusion that Kanos was really freeing himself, and took the shuttle to depart immediately for Coruscant to warn the New Republic, all according to Devian’s plans.

The attempted Zinethium attack on Coruscant was stopped, however, by the Jedi Master of the New Jedi Order, Luke Skywalker, who flew the shuttle into orbit before the Zinethium could detonate.
Soon after Kanos’ “escape”, a New Republic warship, under the command of Captain Lar Ndigo, was detected entering the Chopani system, which was investigating the earlier disappearance of the frigate, the Endor.


Due to this unforeseeable event, Devian was forced to abandon his base of operations and had a squadron of starfighters engage Republic forces.
The ship's crew was able to raise their shield in time before the planetary cannon could fully charge its shot and were also able to scramble out starfighters of their own.
The warship was able to land a direct shot on the planetary cannon before it could fully charge its second shot, after which ground forces were sent to the planet's surface to investigate, however, this was all a distraction planned out by Devian and Vota so they could evacuate their navy and forces from the system and rigged the base to explode, killing the Republic ground forces inside the base.
          

Meanwhile, a peace summit between the New Republic and Imperial Remnant was being held, with the goal of signing a peace treaty, with Feena D’Asta, the daughter of Baron Ragez D’Asta, Mirth Sinn, and Kir Kanos attending the summit.
This didn’t last long, however, as Devian’s stormtroopers were able to raid the summit, successfully preventing the signing of the treaty, but during the assault Feena D’Asta was killed, as with all the stormtroopers, by Kir Kanos’ hand.


Upon investigation of the stormtroopers corpses, Kanos had discovered the emblem of the Restored Empire tattooed on the attackers wrists, which prompted Kanos to immediately contact Republic command on Coruscant to explain Devian’s role in the attack.
While the Republic decided to investigate Devians role in this, Grand Admiral Pellaeon, unaware of the Restored Empires existence at this time, felt that the Republic was involved and launched a retaliatory assault on Coruscant in order to maintain Ragez D’Asta’s loyalty to the Imperial cause.
This left the remnant capital of Orinda practically undefended, allowing Devian to move his fleet in for an assault on the planet.


Devian’s assault on Orinda was promptly stalled, however, by the sudden arrival of Pellaeon’s fleet, who had reversed course from Coruscant after receiving word of Devian’s assault.
Devian and his forces were able to board Pellaeon’s flagship and killed off his personal guard, forcing him into a surrender, but Devian offered the Grand Admiral a chance to join the Restored Empire by abandoning his plans of peace with the New Republic and helping with the reconstruction of a stronger Galactic Empire.
Devian also showed the Grand Admiral that Zam Basdor was a traitor within his ranks, who was promptly shot by the enraged admiral.
The admiral was seized by Devian’s order and was thanked by Devian for tying up a loose end, Pellaeon responded to Devian by offering him a chance of surrendering to him, which the Supreme Commander laughed off, however, Pellaeon revealed that reinforcements, in the form of Baron Ragez D’Asta fleet, had arrived in the sector and were destroying Devian’s fleet as they spoke.

The Baron arrived on Pellaeon’s flagship with Kir Kanos, Mirith Sinn, and a force of stormtroopers by his side.
Ragez D’Asta revealed that he had three fleets waiting behind the moon of Orinda, catching the forces of the Restored Empire by surprise.
The Baron acquainted Devian with a clone of his daughter, which he had grown during the days of the Imperial Ruling Council, passing her off as the original, he explained to Devian that the attempt made on his daughter's life had failed and attempted to force him into surrendering.
In the ensuing confusion, General Vota attempted to execute Gilad Pellaeon, but was gunned down by Mirith Sinn before he could.
A massive firefight then broke out and during the fight, Devian attempted to execute the admiral as well, but was disarmed by Sinn.
Being outnumbered and in a losing battle, Devian attempted to flee in a Lambda-Class shuttle, but was confronted by Kanos who was wearing the Royal Guard uniform Devian had given him during their initial meeting.

Kanos swore death to the Supreme Commander.
Devian ordered a group of stormtroopers to kill the guardsman, as he was only one man, but Kanos easily dispatched them with a blaster rifle.
Devian realized then that it would be more honorable to have a duel to the death with Kanos and unsheathed his vibro-lance for a final battle.
Kanos managed to cut Devian’s vicro-lance in two and knock him unconscious with a kick to his face, however, Devian was able to regain consciousness before Kanos could deliver the killing blow and also cut Kanos’ weapon in two.

Both of them were trained in combat by Darth Vader himself, and Devian claimed that he knew all of Kanos’ tricks.
Devian kicked Kanos in the chest, knocking the wind out of him, and using this opportunity, Devian impaled Kanos on the left shoulder.
Believing himself the victor, Devian revealed to Kanos that his loyalty and service to Palpatine was all a ploy to serve his own ambition and that he would die with that information.


Devian tried to deal a final killing blow to Kanos, however, Kanos was able to gather enough strength to break the blade off of Devian’s vibro-lance and impaled him in the heart with his own weapon, thus killing Devian and collapsing both the Restored Empire and Devian’s vision.
Devian died without ever realizing that he himself was a puppet to his benefactor, Nom Anor, who was an agent for the extragalactic species known as the Yuuzhan Vong who sought to destabilize the galaxy by continuing the Galactic Civil War for as long as possible.



# Personality and Traits
Devian was known within Imperial circles as something of a thug that worked directly under Palpatine.
Devian had committed various acts of violence in which he took pleasure in doing.
Later in his life, following the merciless slaying of Lonkin in an effort to prove his worthiness in combat to Kir Kanos, Devian tried to rationalize his action by claiming he would not have killed the man if his weapon had not touched him, Emperor Palpatine had taught him to overcome all opposition with overwhelming force.

Devian was also an ultranationalist, claiming to have unquestionable loyalty to the late Emperor’s ideals and based his vision of a Restored Empire around this mentality.
However, he would later reveal to Kanos that his loyalty to Palpatine was all fabricated and only used his connections with Palpatine to advance his own ambitions.



# Skills and Abilities
Devian was personally trained by the Sith Lord, Darth Vader, in the arena known as The Squall as an assassin and was a master of vibro-lance combat, he also considered himself on-par with Kir Kanos himself.
As such, during their final showdown over Orinda, Devian was able to hold his own against Kir Kanos for sometime while also showcasing his familiar combat style and knowledge of the tricks taught to him by Darth Vader, however, he would be killed by Kanos during the final showdown between the two.
