# Introduction
Mara Jade, later known as Mara Jade Skywalker, was a force-sensitive human female.
She was born at 17 BBY and died at 40 ABY.
During her adventure through the galaxy, she was a smuggler, the Emperor’s right hand, and later on one of the greatest Jedi, being one of Skywalkers.

# Under the Emperor's wings
Mara was raised to be a servant and assassin that served Darth Sidious, the Galactic Emperor.
She was one of the best at her job; Jade killed many rebels and corrupt workers of the Empire.
She kept serving Emperor Palpatine until his death.
Minutes before dying, he gave a command to Mara, which ordered to kill a Jedi Master, Luke Skywalker.
The death of Darth Sidious caused Mara to go down the rogue path, where she joined Talon Karrde, becoming one of the best smugglers in Karrde’s command.



# Mara's path in the Jedi Order
Because of being hunted down by Grand Admiral Thrawn, Mara was forced to work with Luke Skywalker.
As she spent more time with him, she started to give him respect.
She gained Skywalker’s respect through her display of being an amazing fighter and blaster user in the fields.
The relations with Skywalker have gotten better, she started to train in his Jedi Praxeum, which was located on Yavin IV.
The relation between Jade and Skywalker grew to that point where they married, which resulted in Mara taking the surname of Skywalker.
After marrying him, she devoted her life to the New Jedi Order, as a Jedi Master.
Right before the Yuuzhan Vong War, she fell ill because of deadly Coomb spores.
The illness was removed from her body after giving birth to her son, Ben Skywalker.
Following her promotion to Master, she took her niece as her Padawan, successfully leading her to Knighthood.



# Second Galactic Civil War
Mara fought alongside the Galactic Alliance and her husband Luke.
She faced a new threat with her husband - the Sith Lady Lumiya and a fallen Jedi, and after fighting them, the Sith fled.
However, Jade’s nephew, Jacen Solo, had killed her later on because she found out his identity as a Sith.
He emerged as a powerful threat to the Galaxy and the Jedi Order.
