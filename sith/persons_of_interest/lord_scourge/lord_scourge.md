# Overview

Lord Scourge was a male pureblood Sith who served as a Lord in Vitiate’s reconstituted Sith Empire.
He later became the Emperor’s Wrath, a title that made him one of the highest ranked members of the Sith Empire.
The Emperor’s Wrath was a title given to one by the Emperor to help the Emperor by being his personal enforcer.
The Emperor’s Wrath was one of the very few people who could actually talk face-to-face with the Emperor.
Lord Scourge was an advanced Sith for his time.
He excelled in the Sith Academy and served under the legendary Darth Revan.
He was sent to Dromund Kaas to help find the one who attempted to assassinate Darth Nyriss, a member of the Dark Council.
He later found out that it was Darth Xedrix and then he killed him.
Nyriss was deceiving him in order to test his loyalty to the Emperor.
Nyriss showed Scourge the Emperor draining life from his home planet, Nathema.
Fueled by anger Scourge joined Jedi Masters Revan and Surik but soon he figured out that a different Jedi was going to kill the Emperor, through a vision and so he betrayed the two Jedi.
Scourge served as the Emperor’s Wrath for three centuries killing the Emperor’s enemies.
Only when the Galactic War started did Scourge find the Jedi destined to kill the Emperor, the Hero of Tython.
Scourge pledged his allegiance to the Jedi and betrayed the Sith in order to kill the Emperor.
Since he had an important role in the defeat of the Emperor, Scourge was awarded the Republic’s Cross of Glory.

# Loyalty

He started by pledging his loyalty to the Sith but later changed.
Scourge was a young Sith and already excelled at the Sith Academy which proved to the Dark Council that he was already a powerful and knowledgeable Sith.
The Dark Council chose him to find the one who tried to assassinate Darth Nyriss because of this and only to show Scourge what the Emperor did to Nathema.
This was when Scourge started to oppose the Emperor but obviously he didn’t have the power to kill such a powerful immortal.
Scourge had a vision that showed him of a Jedi who would kill the Emperor and so he joined forces with Masters Meetra Surik and Revan.
He served under Revan until he realised that Revan wasn’t the Hero of Tython who’d kill the Emperor and so he went back to serving the Emperor and for three centuries he slaughtered all of the Emperor’s enemies serving as the Emperor’s Wrath.
Scourge ended up encountering the Hero of Tython and joined forces with him to get his revenge on the Emperor.
He went to the Jedi Masters on Tython, which included the Grandmaster Satele Shan, and he informed them of the Emperor’s plans.
He joined the Jedi and obeyed the order Grandmaster Shan set him and completed the tasks to prove his loyalty.
Scourge feared that if he went to help the Hero kill the Emperor he would fall under the influence of the Emperor again so he could only offer to fly the Hero and his crew to him and from there the crew fought their way through to the Emperor and the Hero killed him.
Scourge refused to join the Jedi and couldn’t return to the Sith because of what he did so he remained an ally of the Hero’s, who became a Jedi Master, and helped him in battles amid the Galaxy.

# Personality and Abilities

Scourge was an ambitious Sith who starved for power before he became an immortal.
He was arrogant but powerful and had dignity.
These, however, were the only emotions he showed and possibly had.
The Emperor performed a ritual on Scourge which stripped his emotions and humanity in order to make him an immortal.
Scourge finally got his emotions back after the death of the Emperor and remembered what companionship felt like.
Scourge despised selfishness and greed and was intelligent and cunning.
He also thought of the Jedi as weak due to their merciful actions.
Unlike most Sith Scourge devoted himself to things that were bigger than himself and didn’t require personal gain.
Scourge was a natural at torturing and interrogating people and so he used the Dark Force to help him torture foes.
He could sense people around him and used a lot of telekinesis powers in combat.
He used the Force to boost his speed and agility to help in combat and used the Dark Force to conceal himself from his enemies and keep himself warm.
He used the Force to guide his lightsaber when he threw it in order to kill his target enemy.
Scourge was an expert in lightsaber combat and in the ways of the Force.
He mastered the forms Soresu, Joyu and Ataru.
During combat he would hit his foes with two handed strikes, sweeping blows and he could unarm his opponents with his lightsaber.
He transferred lightning to his fist so that he could punch his enemies and deal critical damage.
He was so skilled with lightsabers that in the academy even the instructors feared duelling him.
But most of all Scourge could gain strength from his foes' emotions and devour their fear and anger.
Scourge couldn’t gain strength when fighting droids because they had no emotions so he had to overcome his weakness and was able to fight droids just as well as any other Sith.
