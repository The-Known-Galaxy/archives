# Overview

Kreia or Darth Traya, the Lord of Betrayal as she would come to be known, was a remarkable Jedi Master and Historian who later on became the most controversial and even unorthodox member of the Jedi & Sith, as her ideas and teachings became imperative towards gaining an understanding of the Force.
Her notion of cutting off every single living being from the Force by splitting their bonds with it would become a prominent idea in defining her teachings, as she sought to end the endless cycle of war and feuding across the galaxy and end the constant strife that has left both Jedi and Sith reeling.
To this end, many individuals who would reflect on her later life would deem her an idealist and hypocritical much like the ‘False’ Jedi Master Atris.

# Exile and Embrace

As a Jedi Master and Historian, Kreia would be very accomplished.
Her career would be highlighted with her training of Revan as a Jedi Padawan, where she would placate her unconventional and even idealistic ideas too which would nonetheless reflect on Revan’s later betrayal of the Jedi.
The betrayal of her padawan against the Jedi and the Republic would leave her the scapegoat of the Jedi Council, who would deem Kreia’s exile necessary to ensure the stability of the Order as a whole following a mass exodus by Revanites and fallen Jedi.
In turn, this would leave her indifferent to ideas she once held with respect, doing away with the Jedi and their ways.
She would open herself up to the Dark Side of the Force, which would leave her scarred following Revan’s destruction of Malachor V with the Mass-Shadow Generator as the wound in the Force would overcome her.

This would transform her into a Sith Lord, Darth Traya, the Lord of Betrayal.
She would embrace the Dark Side and take upon the endeavor of forming a Sith Order under her own rite, training two apprentices who would later become Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion; powerful in their own rite forming the Sith Triumvirate.
Their presence would endure across the galaxy, as they would hunt down the Jedi and strain their presence in the Force or purge them, dwindling their numbers down to a handful of individuals.
Despite this, she would later be betrayed by both her apprentices as their insatiable hunger for power would drive them strained.

# Conflict and Truth

She would eventually discover the Jedi Exile, Meetra Surik, and would form a close bond with her to the point of becoming symbionts; people who’ve formed a deep bond by the Force and are able to feel each other’s pain with their lives forever intertwined.
As she would take on Surik as a student, she would also plot to split the individuals who’ve corrupted the Force’s will such as the remaining Jedi Councilors and her former apprentices, Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion.
Surik would eventually locate the Jedi Masters who’ve managed to survive the purge conducted by the Triumvirate in hiding due to their fears of the Sith and their dogmas, at which Kreia would split the connections of the Jedi Masters from the Force enraged at their blindness, causing them to perish due to their attachments to it passing from the Living to the Cosmic Force.

After this, she would locate Jedi Master Atris’ hidden academy on Telos IV and expose her hypocrisy, compelling her to admit her fall to the Dark Side of the Force accepting the darkness within her.
Surik would then destroy Darth Nihilus over Telos as she would accept her human self and embrace it.

# Reflection and Death

Surik would travel to Malachor V to confront her former master and companion, facing her final test against the renewed Darth Traya.
Traya would subdue Sion, asserting her dominance over him.
She would seek to bring about her final goal, to rid the galaxy of the Force’s influence as we know it.
Her plot in the betrayal of both Sith and Jedi would be a defining moment, as the Jedi Exile would fight her in the core of Trayus.
Surik would be compelled to fight Treya as per her ultimatum; the Exile’s death or hers.

```
Treya and Surik would battle in Trayus, with the Jedi Exile eventually triumphing over her former master in Trayus Academy, where Treya had once trained Sith of her own.
```

Despite her feelings and overcoming emotions, Surik would grant her master’s wish of death.
Before Traya passed on, she would grant Surik visions of the future as she would escape the fabrics and seams of the Force and see through it all at the end.
