# Overview

On the planet Concord Dawn, a planet in the Mandalore sector of the Outer Rim Territories, Jango Fett was born in the year 66 BBY.
During the last years of the Galactic Republic, Fett was known as the top bounty hunter in the galaxy and was skilled in both unarmed and ranged combat.
He used Mandalorian armour equipped with a number of weapons and devices such as a flamethrower, two WESTAR-34 blaster pistols, and a jetpack.
The Firespray-31 class patrol and attack vessel Slave I served as his personal spacecraft.

# Biography

The Grand Army of the Republic used Jango Fett as a model for its clone army.
He was a well-known Mandalorian human male bounty hunter.
Although he claimed to be from this Mandalorian realm, Fett enjoyed the fact that his precise past was still a mystery.
After his parents were killed, Fett was adopted by the Mandalorians, who raised him as a foundling and trained him to become a Mandalorian warrior.
He was instructed by a guide.

On Mandalore itself, in 42 BBY, Fett took part in the Mandalorian Civil Wars.
This is proven as he received his first set of distinctive Mandalorian armour during the conflicts.
He eventually decided to pursue a career as a bounty hunter, though, as a result of his time spent with the Mandalorians.
Prime Minister Almec of the New Mandalorians denied any connection to Fett, saying that he was simply a bounty hunter who had kept his Mandalorian armour.

# Personality and Traits

The top bounty hunter in the entire galaxy and a superb combatant, Jango Fett was renowned for his cool, analytical, and quiet mercenary skills.
His friend, Hondo Ohnaka said he was an honorable man.
Jango was well-known for covering his scarred face with a Mandalorian mask.
He carried a jet pack since his combat style was distinct in that he preferred it to be quick and high in the air; this provided him an advantage in many fights and made him the most feared bounty hunter.

# Skills and Abilities

Fett was regarded as the greatest soldier and developed his reputation via his extraordinary talent.
Fett's abilities were particularly special because he was able to achieve great success despite only being a human.
His specialty was engaging in physical confrontation.
In addition to being a skilled pilot, Fett also taught his son Boba Fett how to fly.
His proficiency with a blaster allowed him to kill Coleman Trebor, a Jedi Master and High Council member, but not Mace Windu, who quickly dispatched the bounty hunter.

# Equipment

Throughout his career, Jango Fett flew Slave I, a customised Firespray-31-class patrol and attack ship, which his son Boba inherited.
He also donned a pair of electrified beskar Mandalorian armour.
A huge variety of equipment was also carried by Fett.
He employed a Z-6 jetpack with a built-in missile launcher and had a pair of heavily modified Concordian Crescent Technologies WESTAR-34 blaster pistols with hollowed-out grips for a speedier draw and pricey dallorian alloy coating to allow for sustained fire without fear of overheating.
When he battled Obi-Wan Kenobi on Kamino, this jetpack was damaged.
From that point on, until his death on Geonosis, Jango wore a JT-12 jetpack, a lighter version of the Z-6.
He employed several tools that were concealed in his gauntlets, including a ZX tiny flame projector, whipcord thrower, wrist mounted grappling hook, and retractable vibroblades.
