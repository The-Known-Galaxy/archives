# Biography

A young Nomi Da-Boda marries Andur Sunrider and adopts his husband’s surname.
At the start she was continuously surprised by her husband’s connection with the Force but he assured her she also had it.
They lived together on the planet of Darada and then moved to H'ratth after being invited by Master Chamma.
There she gave birth to her daughter Vami and after various years, Andur learned everything he could.

They left the planet and arrived at a hyperspace terminal but were attacked by Bogga the Hutt's gang.
Andur, who had been protecting the Adegan crystals, was killed by a gorm-worm.
Sunrider, now in grief and anger, is forced to defend herself and her daughter.
Andur, now as a ghost, advises Sunrider to continue her journey to Ambria and find Master Thon, who will train her in the Force ways.
Sunrider agrees to follow her husband's final wishes and uses the Force to find her way to Ambria.

Sunrider, determined to find Master Thon, arrives in Ambria and finds a strange and mysterious lake and hears voices warning her of death and chaos but hears one calm voice.
She follows the calming voice and eventually finds a small house with a young Vultan.
Sunrider believes this is Master Thon, and he leads her and her daughter back to his home.
Sunrider talks about her husband's murder.
Bogga the Hutt Had followed Sunrider and attacked the ship, but the Vultan Jedi defended his home and family.
Despite being overwhelmed, the Vultan beast manages to defeat the criminals, and are obligated to retreat.
After the battle, it is revealed that the young Vultan is actually a Jedi apprentice of Thon's, Oss Wilum.
Wilum advises Sunrider that Thon will teach her the Force and that her journey as a Jedi is just beginning.

Sunrider, in grief over her husband's death, meditates on her future as a Jedi.
Sunrider's instinct to learn battle meditation is strong but it is a difficult skill even for experienced Jedi Masters.
Sunrider learns the ways of the Force but refuses to build or wield a lightsaber.
Master Thon explains the true reason behind the lightsaber, stating that a lightsaber is not just a weapon for attack and defense but also a focus for the mind and a connection with the Force.
Thon shows Sunrider an ancient holocron, lent to him by Master Arca Jeth, and teaches her the history of the Jedi's fight against the dark side.
Sunrider still sees the lightsaber as a tool of death and distances herself from it.
Nevertheless he gives Sunrider his personal lightsaber, which he had constructed while learning under his Master.
Sunrider reluctantly accepts the gift and is tasked with retrieving the Adegan crystals from Bogga's gang.
Master Thon and Sunrider rush back to Thon's home to join the pirates' attack.
Sunrider refuses, but Thon convinces her to focus her Force powers on the pirates to save him and her daughter.
Sunrider realizes that the lightsaber is the weapon of a Jedi and that she is a Jedi.
She uses her Master's lightsaber to rescue Thon and the pirates flee back to their ship.
Sunrider completes her training under Master Thon and is placed under Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas, who guides her in creating her own lightsaber.

Sunrider, under Master Baas, was studying on Onderon.
The Jedi, led by Master Arca Jeth, faced a new dark side power called the Naddists, who attacked the procession responsible for taking the sarcophagi of Freedon Nadd and Amanoa to Dxun for burial.
The Naddists stole both sarcophagi and retreated to their underground headquarters.
Master Jeth was captured by King Ommin and subjected to torture.
Sunrider, along with other Jedi, led a team to relieve Qel-Droma.
They charged against the enemy soldiers, using Force battle techniques and a lightsaber.
Sunrider was found among the rubble of the battle by Ulic Qel-Droma.
They led the other Jedi against King Ommin's stronghold, but Ommin halted the attack by concentrating on his hatred.
Qel-Droma charged Ommin, disarming and neutralizing him.
Sunrider and Qel-Droma freed Master Jeth from his captivity.
The remains of Freedon Nadd and Amanoa were transported to and entombed on the jungle moon of Dxun, hoping to dissuade anyone from stealing them again.

The Freedon Nadd Uprising provided a brief relaxing moment for Sunrider and other Jedi, who were taught how to ride native flying beasts of Onderon.
Master Arca Jeth informed them of the escalating troubles in the Empress Teta system due to the rise of the Krath, a secret society founded by dark side adepts.
The Jedi Order and the Republic were ordered to inform the combined leadership of the Jedi Order and the Republic about their encounters on Onderon and the situation in the Empress Teta system.
A joint task force was formed to aid Koros Major, the last planet resisting the takeover.
The joint fleet was attacked by massive space grazers, but Sunrider discovered that the space grazers were actually illusions created by one powerful Force-user, Aleema Keto.
Sunrider managed to invade Keto's mind, causing her to lose concentration and fading the illusions.
However, the Krath realized that the battle was one step away from being turned against them, ordering their ships to act as living missiles and ram the Republic/Jedi ships.
The Krath tactic caused havoc among the joint fleet's ships, causing damage to the Republic command ship Reliance I and Qel-Droma's wounds.
Sunrider tended to Qel-Droma's wounds, and the joint fleet was ordered to retreat from the Empress Teta system.

In the aftermath of the battle of Koros Major, thousands of Jedi convened on Deneba to discuss the ongoing Krath attacks.
Sunrider announced Qel-Droma's plan to infiltrate the Krath, aiming to bring them down from within.
However, many Jedi, including Arca Jeth and Master Shayoto, opposed Qel-Droma's strategy.
During the battle, young Vima was snatched by a war droid, but rescued by Sylvar.
Qel-Droma, devastated by his master's death, decided to infiltrate the Krath.
Sunrider and Qel-Droma's bond grew, and they shared a passionate embrace and kiss before Qel-Droma's departure.

Sunrider learns to improve her Force skills under the guidance of ancient Jedi Master Odan-Urr.
She learns to combat the Force using an ancient technique used against the Sith in ancient wars.
After her teachings, Sunrider travels to Coruscant to investigate reports of a rogue Jedi Knight leading attacks on Republic shipyards.
The Jedi, led by Master Baas, prepare to let the Jedi Order handle the renegade Jedi Knight.
However, it turns out that it was Ulic Qel-Droma who was leading the attacks.
The Battle for Coruscant turned into a brutal battle between the Jedi and Mandalorian forces.
Qel-Droma captured the Republic command center and was forced into captivity when immobilized with light side energy.
Sunrider and other Jedi challenge Qel-Droma for control of Coruscant, but Qel-Droma defies the Jedi's orders and refuses to renounce his allegiance to the Sith.
The trial ends when Exar Kun, Mandalore, and a legion of Massassi warriors arrive, casting a Sith immobilization spell over the attendees.
Sunrider begs Qel-Droma to renounce his allegiance, but Qel-Droma warns her that if she doesn't stop interfering, she will be forced to hurt her.
Qel-Droma and his allies leave Coruscant to continue their war of conquest.

Sunrider and her daughter Vima visited Master Thon on Ambria for healing and training.
However, the peace was disrupted when agents of Exar Kun, Oss Wilum and Crado, arrived and called forth deadly hssiss to kill the three Jedi.
Sunrider, Sylvar, and Thon defended each other, eventually killing all of the hssiss and capturing Oss Wilum.
Sunrider and Sylvar eventually purge the Sith magic from Wilum's system.
As the Sith War grew, hundreds of Jedi, including Sunrider, descended upon the library world to evacuate Jedi lore.
However, Cay Qel-Droma sensed Qel-Droma approaching the planet in a personal starship.
Sunrider, overcome with grief, unleashed her powers upon Qel-Droma, cutting him off from the Force.
Qel-Droma repented and agreed to help Sunrider and the other Jedi end the war.
After Qel-Droma returned to Exar Kun's secret temple on Yavin 4, Sunrider and the other Jedi created a wall of light side energy to combat the dark effects of Exar Kun's Sith magic.
However, their efforts had unforeseen effects, as the light side wave turned the planet into a blazing inferno.
The Jedi departed the jungle moon and set about rebuilding the Republic and the Jedi Order.

After the Great Sith War, Sunrider and the Jedi began rebuilding the Order and Republic.
Sunrider became the Grand Master and called the first Jedi conclave since the war.
She hoped that the gathered wisdom would help rebuild the Republic and assure those gathered that the Order was being rebuilt under her guidance.
However, the conclave went awry when Sylvar led the Jedi into a discussion on Ulic Qel-Droma's fate.
Sunrider's daughter, Vima, had run away from Exis Station and left her mother to find a Jedi master.
Sunrider, reflecting on her career as a Jedi, realized that it was not her choice to become a Jedi but rather her forced decision to pick up where her husband had left off.
She realized that Vima had made her choices of her own free will.
She realized that there was no better example for young Vima than Ulic Qel-Droma to show her the cost of being a Jedi.
Sunrider and her daughter, Vima, find Qel-Droma and her daughter training in a frozen fortress.
Qel-Droma, now her master, understands Sunrider's arrival and offers her the opportunity to take her back as an apprentice.
Vima demonstrates her progress by carving an enormous sculpture in her memory of her late father, Andur.
Sylvar, seeking Qel-Droma for his past crimes, arrives on Rhen Var and Nomi senses a clash between the two.
Sunrider and her daughter witness the final stages of the fight, and Qel-Droma's chest is ripped apart.
Sunrider holds Qel-Droma's body and there realizes that her daughter's love showed Qel-Droma the path to redemption.
After Qel-Droma's death, Sunrider and her daughter return to the Republic with a new commitment to the Force, helping them accept their destinies.

# Personality and traits

Nomi, experienced love throughout her whole life.
Firstly, falling in love with a fellow Jedi, Andur Sunrider and with whom she’ll eventually get married.
Their love brought to the world a beautiful daughter named Vima.
After the loss of his husband and grief that lasted various years, she met another young Jedi, however as fate would have it, he fell to the Dark side and the two men who Nomi had loved had abandoned her.
Her love wasn´t just for men as her daughter was Nomi’s most precious gift.
Nomi had protected her daughter even during the Sith War but when Vima got into her teenage years she decided to seek training from the man who brought happiness to her mother when sadness was all she could see.
Qel-Droma trained her even after Sunrider had gone to see if she was safe and indeed she was.
They both bonded like father and daughter and eventually Vima left to go to her mother's side once again.
During Qel-Droma’s path to redemption he was killed and they both felt it, leaving the two women of his life in grief and pain.

# Powers and abilities

Nomi’s potential as a Force sensitive was clear from a very young age however the Jedi Order didn't pick her for unknown reasons and it wasn't until her husband insisted that she started her training as a Jedi.
Her connection, under Master Thon’s tutelage, deepened to the point in which she could make her enemies kill themselves, by using the very rare and acquiring the extremely difficult achievement of mastering the art of battle meditation.
She was also capable of disabling Sith spells and illusions, using Force deflection and using Tutaminis.
Later, after changing of Master, under Master Urr tutelage,  she learned the rare ability of combating a Sith use of the Force by  essentially cutting them off from the Force targeting the users midi-chlorians and she did it with only a single session of training.
But perhaps her most unique and powerful ability was that of conjuring pure raw light out of her own warmth for those she cared about.
At the start her usage of the lightsaber was pretty poor but after her Husband’s death her skills with it just kept getting better.
She improved so much that at a certain point she was considered to be a master at all forms.
Nevertheless, she always expressed her preference using the Force over a lightsaber in a fight against a Sith.
