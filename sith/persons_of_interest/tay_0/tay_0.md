# Biography
TAY-0 was a Safa Toma Classic droid racer during the Imperial Era in 19 BBY.
He competed in Riot Races for hundreds of fans at Serolonis' Safa Toma Speedway with his modified 12 series speeder repulsorcraft.
TAY-0 chose offence over defence, and with a policy of almost no rules, he outfitted his speeder with blaster cannons to destroy any competition.

Omega and Scaleback were on a balcony watching the Nikto racer Bosco "The Mad Bomber" Brix fire down a Seven Duece Blaster when Scaleback presented the idea of Riot Racing to Omega.
speeder piloted by the droid racer "Hyper" Rod, with TAY-0 instantly gaining the lead over them.
He pushed past Brix to claim victory in the race.
TAY-0 and Scaleback's crew made a bad first impression at his pit droid station, where TAY-0 did no more than gloat.
