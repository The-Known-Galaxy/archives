# Overview
Aga Awaud was a member of the Awaud Clan in the Mandalorian’s homeworld, Mandalore, and worked as a freelancer in the Outer Rim Territories.
During 1058 BBY, the Galaxy was the victim of the Candorian plague, a disease caused by the Blue Shadow Virus.
This virus was fatal, and it ended with numerous planets and families, including Aga Awaud’s family and most of his clan.
Along with this, the Mandalore sector was under attack by invaders from lawless planets.

Aga then decided to make a movement that is known historically as the Return, where he called Mandalorians around the galaxy to show up and defend their sector.
After this event, Aga Awaud proclaimed himself as the new Manda’Lor under the name of ‘Mandalore the Uniter’ for his achievement of saving the Mandalorian sector from all the chaos that was going on around the galaxy.
Following the exploit of the Return, the Mandalore planet prospered and offered security to near-star systems.
