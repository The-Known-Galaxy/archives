# Overview:
Darth Venemal was a human male Dark Lord of The Sith Order and the Reconstituted Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War.
Both him and Darth Malgus served during the attack of The Empire on the planet Ord Radama, which was successful at the beginning.
Nevertheless, the Sith forces led by Venemal and Magnus were not replenished, and their fleet was attacked by Republic Vessels.
While Magnus tried to help in the battle, Venemal died with the population of the capital Livien Magnus when an Imperial ship crashed over there.
Magnus could feel his pain and death, along with the habitants of Liven Magnus.
The Empire had to retire from the battle of Ord Radama, and Malgus recieved partial blame for Venemal’sl death.
