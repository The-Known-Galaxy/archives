# Introduction

Mission Vao was a female Rutian Twi’lek.
She was born in 3970 BBY, which was during the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War.
She was a member of the Ebon Hawk, which was owned by a former Sith Lord, Revan.
She was his company during his search for the Star Forge.

# Vao's Childhood

Vao grew up as an orphan alongside her brother, Griff.
Griff was a gambler and a scammer; he always was borrowing credits, which left him in many debts.
When Vao was five, she moved to a planet named Taris.
They got there by hiding in a starship’s cargo crate.
She and her brother were living in the Lower City of Taris.
She assisted a man named Zayn Carrick, a man who was accused of murdering four Jedi Padawans that were helping in Taris’ authorities with maintaining law and order.
Later on, Mission was abandoned on Taris by her own brother as he had met a woman named Lena and wished to leave Taris with her.

# On her own

When Vao was alone, she met a Wookie named Zaalbar.
Zaalbar was an outcast from Kashykk, who was harassed by a Lower City gang called the Black Vulkars.
Vao and Zaalbar managed to beat up its members and scare them off, ending the harassment.
Vao and Zaalbar became best friends and never had any arguments; they had a nice relation between each other and she even gave him a nickname of “Big Z”.

In 3956 BBY, Mission and Zaalbar met Revan, a former Sith Lord.
Mission provided Revan with much information about Taris because of him being a newcomer.
Zaalbar was kidnapped by Gamorrean slavers, but Revan managed to free him.
After the whole situation, Zaalbar and Vao became members of Revan’s crew - they were going to help him against the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Malak.

# Adventures with Ebon Hawk

Mission and Zaalbar had a big bond with the Ebon Hawk’s crew and Revan.
They helped him to find and destroy the Star Forge.
Subsequently, she found out why her brother abandoned her.
While the Ebon Hawk crew searched for the Star Map, they encountered Griff, Mission’s brother.
She forgave him and accepted him for the way he was.

Later on their adventure, Revan had revealed his identity to the Ebon Hawk crew.
He was the former Dark Lord of the Sith.
Mission noticed that Revan was nothing of a Sith anymore and was a completely different person.
Following him to the end of the Star Forge, Mission became one of the saviors of the Republic.
Later on, when Revan left for the Unknown Regions, Mission departed from the Ebon Hawk crew.
