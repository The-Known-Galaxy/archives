# Overview
Reva was a force-sensitive female human who served as an Inquisitor with the title of Third Sister.
She served during the early reign of the Galactic Empire and was Grand Inquisitor for a short period.
Before the Galactic Empire began its reign, The Third Sister served in the Jedi Order as an Initiate.
While she had no problem working with the Empire, her true goal was to kill the infamous Lord Vader as revenge for the slaughter of her fellow friends in the Jedi Academy.
Despite being generally disliked by many, including her fellow Inquisitors, she still rose through the ranks at an incredibly fast pace.

# Anger
Reva was only a youngling during Anakin's ruthless invasion with the 501st.
She watched as her friends were brutally murdered while playing dead within a pile of bodies.
Years after the events of The Great Jedi Purge, she set out to join the Inquisitorious, a group of Jedi killing force users.
After being accepted, she went on a journey of vengeance knowing that she would be granted an opportunity to kill Lord Vader.
She planned to lure Anakin's former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, out of hiding, and use him as a distraction while she killed Vader.
Reva, on her ruthless path of vengeance, ended up being disliked by most of the Inquisitorious.



# Vengeance
Reva began her plan to lure Obi-Wan by kidnapping the young Princess Leia Organa.
Sevander knew that by kidnapping her, Obi-Wan would be forced to come out of hiding to save her.
She was correct, as the old Jedi master did come to save her.

Right before she could succeed in his capture, The Grand Inquisitor blocked her path, sick of her foolishness.
Reva, who was completely rage-fueled at this point, stabbed the Inquisitor in the stomach, leaving him to die.
Unfortunately for her, it was too late; both Obi-Wan and Leia had taken a ship and fled off-planet.



# A Better Opportunity
Not long after this, Vader learned of his old master's resurgence, and how it occurred.
Vader offered Reva the position of Grand Inquisitor if she was able to successfully locate Kenobi.
She ended up finding him and sent Vader to fulfill his long awaiting goal.
With the successful location of Kenobi, she was awarded the title of Grand Inquisitor.
Vader launched a final attack, where Reva and Kenobi spoke.
Ben offered to act as bait after discovering Reva's true intentions.
She agreed and thus set out to complete her true goal.
While Vaderwas distracted she tried to strike him, with no success.
Vader completely outmatched Reva, and hit her, leaving her to die just as she did with the Grand Inquisitor.



# The Last Resort
While lying on the floor, Reva found a transmitter that detailed Luke Skywalker and how he could be in danger of being found.
A completely rage-fueled Reva set out to kill Luke as a final act to avenge her friends who were killed by his father.
She set out to Tatooine and upon finding Luke, released the anger that had been building up since the most traumatic event of her life.
Cowering over him, she raised her saber as a final blow before realizing that she was becoming just like Vader.
Heartbroken, she picked up an injured and worn-out luke and brought him to his caretakers.
She decided to take Kenobi's words to heart, and she set out to live a new life, leaving her fate unknown.
