Mand’alor the Avenger, also known as Shae Vizla, was a famous Mandalorian and one of the Mandalores of the Old Republic Era.

Shae Vizla was mostly known for helping the Dark Lord named Malgus on the strike of Alderaan and eventually the Sacking of Coruscant, marking her name forever in history, however it was not the last time she did so.

After a few years as a Bounty Hunter or helping Imperial Forces, Shae retired along with her Aliit, also named Aliit Vizla, settling themselves on the planet of Rishi, attempting to stay far from any large scale galaxy wide conflicts or events, only caring about her Aliit and even taking less and less contracts as a bounty hunter.

However, that retirement wouldn’t last, as after a few years, the Revanites and Nova Blades managed to create a fleet on top of Rishi moon, which postponed her retirement for a few times as she learned of the Republic and Sith Empire forming a coalition to take down the Revanites and Revan himself, a Dar’jetii.

Shae Vizla, only planning for it to be a short term out of retirement, was wrong, as it turned out, the Eternal Empire made an appearance, shortening her hopes for the battles to be, eventually leading her to take part in a major role into the war.

Sadly, within the war that occured, Mand’alor the Vindicated fell in combat by skytroopers of the Eternal Empire.
Upon hearing of this, Shae Vizla was proposed as the next Mand’alor, postponing her retirement even longer as she reluctantly accepted, making her thus, Mand’alor the Avenger.

Shae gained countless battles with her people against the Eternal Empire, eventually being invited to the anti-Zakuul Alliance, where she led her people to more glorious victories.

As the war ended, Shae Vizla led her people as the Mand’alor, doing so until her death.
Her death is still unknown to this day, however it is claimed that she retired with her clan on the now peaceful planet of Rishi.
