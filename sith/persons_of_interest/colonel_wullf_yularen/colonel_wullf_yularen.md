# Overview
Wullf Yularen or Admiral Yularen, later known as Colonel Yularen was an intelligent human male.
He served both the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Empire as a high-ranking Officer.
Wullf Yularen fought in the battles of Christophsis, Kaliida Nebula, Geonosis, and many others during the Clone Wars.
After the Galactic Republic was transformed into the first Galactic Empire, Yularen resigned due to his eagerness in becoming a Colonel for the Imperial Security Bureau (ISB).
Yularen eventually became Colonel and a major part of the ISB, after becoming the leader of the Naval Intelligence Agency (NIA).
Yularen quickly became allies with the Chiss Naval Officer, Thrawn.
Yularen helped Thrawn rise through the ranks of the Imperial Navy until Thrawn reached the rank of Grand Admiral.
Unfortunately, Yularen was assigned to remain on the Death Star after the devastating battle of Scarif, where the Rebellion gained the plans for the Death Star.
Sadly, with the destruction of the first Death Star, Yularen died during the destruction.

# Serving the Galactic Empire
Yularen was quite a vital aspect of the Empire, briefly serving as an Admiral during the Republic’s transition into the Empire and then later serving as a Colonel.
After he resigned as an Admiral, Yularen chased his dream career of becoming Colonel of the new Imperial Security Bureau.
He achieved this goal pretty quickly and was assigned his first mission, which was to lead a division whose main purpose was to expose any instances of sedition in the Imperial Senate.
Five years after the Galactic Empire was formed, Yularen was appointed the head liaison of the  Imperial Security Bureau and Naval Intelligence Agency.
He was tasked with making sure that all members cooperated with each other.
A little while later, Yularen’s rival, Vice Admiral Rancit, was killed at Carida and so the Emperor himself gave Yularen his spot as Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Agency.
Yularen continued his task for Commander Gallius Rax until he returned to the  Imperial Security Bureau and served as Colonel again.
Once he returned he accompanied Senator Renking, Senior Lieutenant Thrawn, and Ensign Eli Vanto, Thrawn’s aide, at the Alisandre Hotel during ascension week.
Renking introduced these men to his aide, Arindha Pryce, and Yularen told them the story of Thrawn capturing a pirate crew.
Yularen had to leave the party early and before doing so he introduced Thrawn to Imperial Officers and Senators.
Yularen and Thrawn found themselves working together on the secret case of Nightswan.
Soon Yularen, Thrawn, and Eli started to inspect dojos and found out that the Yinchom dojo might have something to do with a new case about the higher skies advocacy.
After this incident, Thrawn met with Pryce to discuss higher skies.
Pryce tempted Moff Ghadi with illegal information higher skies had on his enemy, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin.
Tarkin then agreed to promote Pryce to Governor of Lothal and finally promoted Eli Vanto to Lieutenant Commander.
Yularen and other  Imperial Security Bureau members arrested the higher skies advocacy members and the Yinchom dojo.
A long time after this, Yularen had participated in many missions, such as the Batonn insurgency and carnage at Creekpath.
One of his final missions was to help Grand Admiral Thrawn find a Rebel spy, whose codename was Fulcrum.
Yularen interrogated several Imperial Officers in the Lothal sector aboard Thrawn’s flagship, the Chimaera.
They soon learned who Fulcrum was, Yularen’s favourite pupil, Agent Kallus.
Kallus framed Yogar Lyste, but Thrawn was smarter than that.
Thrawn, however, allowed Kallus to continue working as Fulcrum so he could lure the Rebels.
Not long later, the former Lothalian Governor Ryder Azadi impersonated Colonel Yularen so that an Imperial Officer could comply with Protocol 13.
Unfortunately, this plan worked because of Yularen’s rank in the Empire.
The Imperial garrison on Lothal was then trapped and then destroyed.
This also led to the disappearance of Thrawn and his Seventh Fleet, which made Lothal free of the Empire.
Sadly, a while after this event, Yularen was assigned to the first Death Star during the Rebellion’s attack and he was killed.
However, Yularen left a legacy behind him.
Yularen was known as one of the Emperor’s most valuable personnel and members of the Empire were quite devastated that he could’ve survived instead of a TIE fighter pilot.
