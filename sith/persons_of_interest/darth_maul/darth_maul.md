# History

Darth Maul was born in 54 BBY when the Galactic Republic was around.
He had two brothers and one of them would play a key role in the future.
He began his apprenticeship at 40 BBY when he was still a child.
He was raised in a way to despise every single Jedi Knight who served within the Jedi Order.
He desired to see the Jedi Order fall, thanks to his master he desired it so much that he started training for the day where the Sith would take revenge on the Jedi.
Afterward, he encountered Master Qui-Gon-Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi He managed to defeat the Jedi Master, but he was defeated by the Padawan.
Thanks to Opress and Nightsister Mother Talzin, he managed to survive.
Despite that Darth Tyranus was his former master - Darth Sidious - new apprentice, he still thought he was a Sith Lord.
Shortly after, he began planning to conquer the planet Mandalore, overwhelming their Mandalorians and installing a ‘’Death Watch’’ as the new ruling government.
But there was a problem lurking, Maul was getting more and more recognized as a threat within the planet, forcing him to resign his reign over the planet until being overthrown by the GAR (Grand Army Republic).

Somehow, Maul managed to survive until the end of the Clone Wars, as he witnessed the Great Jedi Purge, the rise of the Order 66, and Sidious rising as a Galactic Emperor.
He abandoned his mantle in the Sith hierarchy and started focusing on building his empire, ‘’the Crimson Dawn’’, controlling criminals from the underworld.
He had a huge desire for revenge, on his master who left him and Kenobi, the very Jedi who defeated him in a battle.
In the end, his rival defeated him, and he died awaiting to be avenged.
