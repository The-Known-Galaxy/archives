# Overview
Darth Scabrous was an ambitious human male Sith Lord who served as the orchid’s caretaker of the academy on the planet Odacer-Faustin.
The academy was constructed by a powerful Sith Lord, Darth Drear, who created a powerful elixir that turned those infected by it into zombies.
Scabrous would end up finding a formula for this disease.
Just like Drear, Scabrous sought immortality, which led to his search for Drear’s Holocron, which contained a formula for the zombie virus.
The virus leaked and spread all over the academy, turning those inside into zombies, including those who had already died.
The Sith that were resurrected turned into cannibalistic zombies who were controlled by Scabrous himself.
Scabrous attempted to kill a Jedi by using his knowledge as the orchid’s caretaker, the Jedi was Hestizo Trace, so he could sacrifice her and eat her heart so he could gain a high midi-chlorian count to fully make himself immortal.
Trace managed to escape while his brother, Rojo, killed the Sith Lord.
