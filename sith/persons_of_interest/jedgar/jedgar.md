# Overview

Jedgar, initially a Jedi youngling with the ability to foresee the future, faced rejection from the Jedi Order due to his dark dreams.
Disillusioned, he turned to the dark side and became the apprentice of Dark Jedi Kadann.
As Kadann rose to power, Jedgar became the second-in-command among the Prophets of the Dark Side, advising the Emperor.
After witnessing the downfall of the Empire, Jedgar encountered challenges from false prophets and continued his pursuit of training Force-sensitive individuals, resorting to deception and manipulation.

# Biography

Jedgar's journey began as a troubled Jedi youngling on Coruscant, haunted by dark dreams that foreshadowed the Clone Wars and the Great Jedi Purge.
Despite his talent, he was rejected by Jedi Knights and Masters, leading him to abandon the Jedi Order.
Later, he joined forces with Dark Jedi Kadann, who became his master.
Together, they advised the Emperor during the height of the Galactic Empire's power.
However, Kadann foresaw Luke Skywalker's victory and the Empire's downfall, prompting them to seek refuge on Bosthirda.
During the rise of false prophets after the Battle of Endor, Jedgar was confined on Bosthirda by Kadann, unable to confront the impostors.
Undeterred, he shrouded himself in the cloak of darkness, assuming the guise of a maleficent Jedi, skillfully entwining the minds and abilities of Force-users under his sway.
Those who refused his teachings became his adversaries, whom he eliminated at opportune moments.

# Personality

Jedgar possessed an insatiable ambition for power, distinguishing him as the most ambitious among the Prophets.
Unlike Kadann, he desired immediate power and would employ any method to achieve his goals, regardless of consequences.
Frustrated by Kadann's superiority, he refrained from open opposition but remained arrogant, cruel, and impatient.
His impulsive nature often led to mistakes and further defeats, as he would prematurely seize victory before his plans fully unfolded.
He took pleasure in his Dark side abilities, frequently employing armies of Force Wraiths and his lightsaber in combat.

# Physical Appearance

Tall and slender, Jedgar had a bald head, a bearded chin, and hooded eyes.
Like other Prophets of the Dark Side, he wore traditional star-covered robes reminiscent of deep space.
Always armed with a sickly glowing green-bladed lightsaber, its distinct electronic hum resonated with aggression.
Jedgar also used hssiss creatures to dampen his Force presence.
