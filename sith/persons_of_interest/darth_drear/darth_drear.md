# Overview

Darth Drear was a Sith Lord of human or Sith Pureblood descent who served the reconstituted Sith Empire and created an academy on the planet Odacer-Faustin, which was a Sith academy that would last thousands of years.
Drear was the head of this academy and forced his students to construct the Sith academy to the point where they died.
Drear had a secret temple underneath the academy’s library where he practised Sith alchemy and searched for immortality by developing a special elixir, spreading a nasty disease that turned the infected into zombies.
Unfortunately, Drear was in his temple studying alchemy when the virus spread and infected him.
He was up to the final stages of the virus when this happened and was turned into a zombie before his death.
Drear may have died, but his formula for the virus was kept safe in his Holocron.
This Holocron was later found by Sith Lord Darth Scabrous, who was the headmaster of Drear’s academy hundreds of years later.
Scabrous attempted to use the virus to make himself immortal.
However, this also backfired for him because the virus spilled, and the entire academy was infected.
Hestizo Trace, a Jedi, later killed Scabrous.
Sidious’ Empire found this weapon and infected an entire star destroyer’s crew.
