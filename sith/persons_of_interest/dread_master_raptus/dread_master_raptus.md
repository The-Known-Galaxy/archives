Known as “The Weaver of Nightmares”, Dread Master Raptus was the leader of the six renegade Sith known as the Dread Masters.
The Dread Masters were a powerful group of Sith Sorcerers that induced fear into any man they encountered.
Raptus wielded a purple lightsaber.
Raptus believed the Dread Masters were being used by the Empire and the Sith Emperor, eventually deciding that their power as prophets, advisors, and generals was being wasted on an empire with no Emperor.
Raptus and his Dread Masters then began to take on the galaxy as rogue Sith Lords, and from this point, everything goes uphill.
Dread Master Raptus, being the unofficial leader, would lead his fellow Dread Masters to a planet called Denova to conduct an attack on both the Republic and the Empire.
