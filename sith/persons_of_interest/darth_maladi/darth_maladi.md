# Biography
Darth Maladi, born as Malincha on the planet Devaron, was the child of a Devaronian Jedi.
When she was young, Darth Krayt, the Dark Lord of The Sith, killed her parents and took her as his apprentice.
Under Krayt's guidance, Malincha embraced the dark side of the Force and became Darth Maladi, a prominent Sith Lady specializing in science, Yuuzhan Vong bioengineering, and espionage.
During the Sith-Imperial War, Maladi sabotaged the Ossus Project, a joint effort between the New Jedi Order and Yuuzhan Vong to restore devastated planets.
She manipulated the Empire's High Moff Morlish Veed to ally with the Sith and orchestrated an attack on the New Jedi Temple on Ossus, leading to the fragmentation of the Jedi Order.
Maladi and Krayt then focused on supplanting Emperor Roan Fel and installing Krayt as the ruler of the Empire.
Maladi's next objective was to find Cade Skywalker, a descendant of the Skywalker family known for their strong connection to the Force.
She believed that turning Skywalker to the dark side and utilizing his healing abilities could benefit the Sith Empire.
Through interrogating and torturing captured Jedi, she obtained information about Skywalker's whereabouts.
However, Imperial Intelligence agent Nyna Calixte, secretly Skywalker's mother, betrayed Maladi and sought to protect her son.
Maladi, unaware of Calixte's true intentions, appointed her as the head of Imperial Intelligence but ordered her to report all matters to Maladi and the Sith.
Maladi's search for Skywalker ended when he and Jedi Knight Hosk Trey'lis were captured while attempting to rescue each other.
Maladi tortured Skywalker, hoping to exploit his abilities and turn him to the dark side.
Meanwhile, Maladi discovered Fel's location on the planet Bastion.
Unable to attack directly due to its defenses, she devised a plan involving Imperial Governor Vikar Dorn and Sith Lord Darth Kruhl.
However, Fel thwarted the plan, killing Kruhl and the crew of the Star Destroyer Dauntless.
In the end, Maladi's capture of Skywalker and her attempts to eliminate Fel set the stage for further conflicts within the Sith-Imperial War.
