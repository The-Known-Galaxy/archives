# Biography

Tahiri, born on Tatooine, was raised as a Tusken Raider and had a pet bantha named Bangor.
She was adopted by the tribe's leader Sliven and later found by a Jedi Master.
She was brought to Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 at nine standard years old.
Tahiri and Anakin, the youngest of the Solo children, became close friends.
They discovered the Golden Globe and the ancient Kushiban Jedi Master Ikrit, which contain trapped souls.
They encountered native predators and discovered ancient carvings in a cave that revealed the Golden Globe contained the souls of the Massassi children imprisoned by Dark Lord Exar Kun.
Tahiri and Anakin returned to Tatooine, where they discovered their real parents are Tryst and Cassa Veila, Force-sensitives.

In the year following the first Death Star duel, Jedi historian Tionne discovered that Darth Vader had saved Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber and kept it at Bast Castle on Vjun.
She informed Master Skywalker at the Jedi Praxeum about the artifact and invited Tahiri, Anakin, Uldir, and Ikrit to accompany her.
They encountered a group of mercenaries and pirates, led by Orloc.
The Jedi pursued them, but Orloc's subordinates defeated Ikrit and deceived Uldir into believing he could awaken the Force powers within him.
Uldir stole Ikrit's ship Sunrider and two Jedi artifacts.

Uldir found Orloc at Exis Station, where he became his master.
Orloc had no Force powers but used tricks to deceive others with demonstrations of "Force power." Tionne, Ikrit, Anakin, and Tahiri tried to convince Uldir that Orloc was a fraud, but he attacked the four Jedi with his gimmicks.
During the duel, Tionne was wounded, and Ikrit joined Anakin and Tahiri in the fight.
Uldir realized Orloc was a liar.
The Jedi defeated Orloc, removing a threat to the growing New Jedi Order.

Tahiri, a Jedi Knight, played a crucial role in destroying the voxyn queen in Myrkr.
Despite her depression, she remained determined to defeat Lord Nyax.
She was deemed a Jedi Knight and led the Barefoot Squadron.
However, her greatest trial with the Yuuzhan Vong came from within.
When Han and Leia Organa Solo took her and Jaina Solo to re-establish communication, the Riina personality resurfaced, causing mental turmoil.
Tahiri and Jaina Solo merged to survive, but remained loyal to the Galactic Alliance.
She teamed up with Corran Horn to extract Nen Yim, Harrar, and the prophet Yu'shaa from Coruscant and became Corran's Jedi apprentice.
She participated in the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, mastering the Vongsense taught by Jacen.

Tahiri, Tekli, and Danni Quee stay on the planet to help the Yuuzhan Vong adjust to their new home.
They receive a Force-call from the Unknown Regions, which leads them to discover the creature that once was their fellow Jedi Raynar Thul, transformed into the Prime Unu of the Killik species.
Tahiri becomes a "Joiner" and becomes influenced by the Prime Unu's control of the Colony.
She binds with Tesar Sebatyne and Lowbacca, who reveal Raynar's survival to Aryn Dro Thul.
Luke Skywalker views this as a betrayal of the Jedi Order and exiles them to Dagobah to meditate on being a Jedi.
Jacen accidentally reveals his knowledge about Tesar and Lowbacca's actions, leading Luke to accuse him of using her to spy on fellow Jedi.

In 40 ABY, Tahiri Veila returns from exile to counter the Corellian-led secessionist movement, which threatened the Galactic Alliance's primacy.
She is placed in command of Team Tauntaun, which aims to remove the Corellian Head of State, Thrackan Sal-Solo, and apprehend Five World Prime Minister Aidel Saxan.
However, the mission is compromised when a traitor leaks information about the Alliance's plan to the Corellians.
YVH droids are placed in defense of Corellia's secessionist leaders.
Despite the setbacks, the team manages to turn a major defeat into a minor victory.

Jacen Solo, who pledged allegiance to the Sith after submitting to Lumiya's teachings, later recreates himself as Darth Caedus, the new Dark Lord of the Sith.
Caedus believes that Veila could be useful to him in other capacities if she could convince her to sever old loyalties to the Jedi Order.
He uses Flow-walking, a rare Force technique, to allow Tahiri Veila to witness their past, including their last encounter with Anakin Solo.
However, Caedus' intentions are less altruistic, as he causes her emotional pain by reminding her of how she allowed Anakin to die without admitting to loving him.

Darth Caedus' ploy was successful, as Tahiri Veila submitted herself to him as a spy within the Jedi Order.
Caedus corrupted her and allowed her to see Anakin again through flow-walking sessions.
He nurtured her addiction and reliance on him, intensifying her dependence on him.
Throughout their time together, they grew closer and possibly engaged in a physical relationship.
Veila was a valuable asset to Caedus, serving as his spy within the Jedi Order.
She fought in the Second Battle of Balmorra and the early stages of the Battle of Kuat, relaying information on Jedi activities to Caedus.
During the Battle of Kashyyyk, Veila witnessed Caedus' orbital bombardment on the Wookiee homeworld and attempted to arrest Caedus' parents, Han and Leia Organa Solo.
However, her actions led to her arrest and confiscation of her StealthX.
Caedus's loyalty to Veila was primarily driven by her obsession with flow-walking and Anakin Solo, but her dependence on Caedus worked to his advantage.
After returning to the Galactic Alliance, Caedus continued to flow walk with Veila to ensure her loyalty.
However, the Jedi eventually discovered her new allegiance, ending her role as an undercover agent before she could discover the secret base.

Darth Caedus, after unsuccessfully converting Ben Skywalker into a Sith apprentice, focuses on Tahiri Veila, who becomes his right-hand subordinate.
Veila is intellectually cunning, competent, and trustworthy, and becomes more formal around the Dark Lord, who becomes Joint-Chief of State alongside Admiral Cha Niathal.
Caedus enjoys Veila's company more than Skywalker's.

The Sith Lord and his apprentice travel to Fondor on the Anakin Solo, a GAG Star Destroyer named in honor of Caedus' late sibling.
Caedus is determined to break Veila's longing for a dead boy.
As Fondorian starfighters approach, Caedus orders the shields deactivated, leaving the flagship in a precarious situation.
Veila decides to fire on the Fondorians or risk allowing them to attack first.
Caedus orders a hasty withdrawal to Coruscant, saving lives but is haunted by her decision.

Upon returning to Coruscant, Caedus recruits Veila as a junior lieutenant within the Galactic Alliance Guard.
She wears a dark blue uniform with black military-issued boots and has her hair pinned up to match her military uniformity.
Veila earns Caedus' confidence and becomes Caedus' representative to the Imperial Remnant.

Veila, a young woman, meets with Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon at the Imperial Palace of Ravelin to discuss the advantages of joining forces with the Alliance.
Pellaeon, who dislikes Darth Caedus and Yuuzhan Vong, is surprised to see Veila's strategy.
They both agree that the Moffs would benefit from joining forces with the Alliance.
Veila's performance on Bastion was met with praise from Caedus, who was pleased with her performance.

Despite her inability to locate the Jedi's secret base, Veila continues to devote herself to the task.
She witnesses interactions between Caedus and Niathal, which initially baffled her.
She becomes privy to the Dark Lord's plans and inner thoughts, and serves as the gatekeeper for access to Darth Caedus.
Some of Anakin Solo's crew suspect their relationship is romantic, while Niathal views it as a "gang boss and junior henchman" nature.
Darth Caedus, the Joint-Chief of State and popular leader within the Galactic Alliance enlists Tahiri Veila to monitor the activities of Niathal and Pellaeon.
Veila serves as a liaison and spy on the Alliance's Imperial allies, and Caedus instructs her to remain vigilant of the Grand Admiral's actions.
Veila, however, remains committed to the Dark Lord's cause and is unsure of her true intentions.

When Niathal betrays Caedus, the Galactic Alliance Defense Force is split in two, with Caedus being more popular among soldiers.
The Dark Lord retains the majority of the Galactic Alliance's war fleets, leaving Niathal with only a small minority of supporters.
Pellaeon's personal opinion of the Dark Lord influences his decision to support Niathal and her fellow traitors.
The senior Moff commanders on the Bloodfin object to Pellaeon's betrayal of Caedus, and Veila shares their concerns and becomes determined to convince the Grand Admiral to recommit the Remnant to Caedus' cause.

Tahiri Veila, a former Imperial, tries to convince Pellaeon to reconsider his decision to destroy the Galactic Alliance.
She believes that the Alliance's self-destructive nature would lead to the Corellian secessionist movement.
Veila believes that Darth Caedus can bring victory to the Galactic Alliance and that Fondor must be shown as an example.
Veila offers the Grand Admiral one last chance to live in exchange for joining Caedus.
When Pelleaon succumbs to a fatal wound, the Moffs assume overall command and direct the Remnant back to Caedus' side.
The majority of the Imperial Remnant, except for the Bloodfin's crew and the Maw Irregular Fleet, support Caedus.

Darth Caedus congratulates Veila on saving the Galactic Alliance and showing her lack of enthusiasm for killing an old man like Pellaeon.
He also acknowledges her as his apprentice and promises to rescue her, even at the risk of his own life.

Darth Caedus returns to Coruscant as the Chief of State of the Galactic Alliance, while Niathal and her supporters are recognized as traitors.
The Dark Lord consolidates his rule on Coruscant through secret police activities of the Galactic Alliance Guard.
Lieutenant Tahiri Veila resumes her search for Luke Skywalker and his fugitive Jedi, despite her earlier disobedience.
Ben Skywalker leads a Jedi team to discover Darth Caedus' whereabouts, but Captain Lon Shevu, Skywalker's friend and spy, reveals Caedus' location on Nickel One.
Veila incapacitates Skywalker, and she and Leia Organa Solo attempt to rescue him.
As Darth Caedus oversees the war, Veila interrogates her Jedi prisoner, using torture and seduction techniques to gain information on the Jedi Order's secret base.
Shevu, a traitor in league with the Jedi, is used as a pawn to capture Skywalker.
Veila accidentally overuses her powers, electrocuting Shevu to death, and Skywalker uses her distraction to his advantage, incapacitating the Sith long enough to escape from Coruscant.

After Skywalker's escape, Veila returns to her master, Caedus, who had been interrogating Mandalorian prisoner Mirta Gev.
Veila revealed that Prince Isolder had been captured and could possibly possess knowledge of the Jedi Order's secret base.
Caedus discovered that the Jedi had relocated their base of operations to the planet Shedu Maad.
Veila suggested disfigurement to make Gev more cooperative, but the Mandalorian refused to cooperate.

The Sith Lords' interrogation was disrupted by the arrival of a female Human lieutenant, who asked Gev to collect a sample of Gev's blood for the Moff Council to create a nanovirus that would target and kill those connected by blood to Boba Fett and his family.
Gev agreed to cooperate if Caedus promised to heal her and prevent the nanovirus's creation.

Tahiri Veila, a Sith, meets Darth Caedus as the Second Galactic Civil War approaches.
Caedus discovers the Jedi Order's secret base and leads an assault on the Jedi and their allies from the Anakin Solo bridge.
Anakin Solo suffers damage and is nearly destroyed by a shadow bomb.
Veila suggests that her master could prevent losses by altering the past through the flow-walk ability.
However, Caedus reveals the true nature of flow-walking to his apprentice, allowing her to believe that the past could be changed through it.
This betrayal of trust leaves Veila embittered and hateful towards Caedus, who has betrayed the Order and committed murder on behalf of her Sith Master.
Despite the rift between the master and apprentice, Caedus instructs Veila to embrace her anger and hatred to become even more immersed in the dark side's power.
Despite her loyalty, her commitment to Caedus' cause is undermined, and her resolve as a Sith is weakened.

Tahiri Veila, a former Sith apprentice, was sent to Shedu Maad with stormtroopers to infiltrate and destroy the Jedi base with a baradium bomb.
However, she was intercepted by Ben Skywalker, Taryn Zel, and elite Hapan soldiers.
Skywalker tried to convince Veila to reconsider her decision to detonate the bomb and that she was not a Sith in her heart.
Veila renounced her allegiance to Darth Caedus and the Sith, but when Skywalker offered to lie on her behalf, she rejected it.
She surrendered unconditionally and was taken into Jedi custody.
Jaina Solo, who had also infiltrated the Anakin Solo, killed Darth Caedus in cold blood.
The Second Galactic Civil War ended with the dissolution of Lumiya's Sith Order and the acceptance of the Galactic Alliance's primacy.
Veila provided information about the final actions of Darth Caedus and the Moffs, and the Jedi learned that Mandalore had been infected with a nano-killer virus.

Tahiri Veila, a former Jedi apprentice, faced indecision and uncertainty over her purpose in life after losing Anakin Solo and betraying the Jedi Order.
She chose to pursue a bounty hunter life to come to terms with her actions in the Second Galactic Civil War.
The Jedi Order was threatened by Anti-Jedi Natasi Daala, who pursued policies that hindered freedom.
Jaina Solo founded Darkmeld, a clandestine organization, to recruit former Jedi Tahiri Veila.
Veila refused to rejoin the Jedi Order, and the Daala administration sought to attach an observer to her.
Veila was put on trial in the Ninth Hall of Justice to defend herself against the Anti-Jedi laws.
The Court of Justice sided with Veila, citing the inability to monitor the entire Jedi Order and those with a strong affinity to the Force.
The outcome of Veila's trial and the Court's rejection of Daala's attempt to impose limitations on ex-Jedi through "guilt by association" were hailed as a victory for the Jedi Order and demonstrated that Daala had not yet gained absolute control over the legal system.

Tahiri Veila resigned her membership to Darkmeld after recovering from Seff Hellin.
She was arrested by Alliance military officers for the murder of Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon two years earlier.
Veila was brought to trial in the Court of Jedi Affairs, where Galactic Alliance Judge Arabelle Lorteli presided.
Veila fired her lawyer, refusing to betray the Jedi again.
Daala's attempts to convict her on the basis of her assistance in Caedus' rise to power were seen as a double standard.
Daala attempted to counter the criticism by arresting Niathal, leading to the Mon Calamari's death by suicide.
Jaina Solo persuaded Imperial Head of State Jagged Fel to hire a more efficient defense attorney for Veila.
Bothan Eramuth Bwua'tu, uncle of Admiral Nek Bwua'tu, represented the Galactic Alliance as the prosecutor.
The Falleen Judge Mavari Zudan presided over the rest of the trial.
With Bwua'tu as her lawyer, Veila made progress in the court, but she felt worried about her position.
Bwua'tu argued that her client was bound by military duty to obey her superior officer's orders.
Despite her emotional response, her lawyer's plan successfully garnered the sympathy of the jury.

In 44 ABY, Tahiri Veila's trial came to a close, and the Jedi Council formulated a plot to overthrow Chief Daala before her regime could fully turn against the Jedi Order.
The Jedi stormed the Executive Building and arrested Daala before her security forces could react.
The Triumvirate was created as a temporary constitutional replacement for the Chief of State's executive office.
The Jedi Council hoped to rescind the Galactic Alliance's case against Veila using its new executive authority.
However, Sebatyne was reluctant to leave Veila to her fate, fearing favoritism and losing their legitimacy as rulers.

The Jedi Council was aware that they needed the support of the Senate, military, and people, and if they showed favor to Veila, they would be accused of favoritism and lose their legitimacy.
The jury found Veila guilty of the murder of Gilad Pellaeon, and sentenced her to death.
Veila was deposited in the Armand Isard Correctional Facility, where she briefly encountered Daala, the deposed leader of the Galactic Alliance.

In response to the overthrow of the Daala administration, Mandalorian bounty hunter Boba Fett infiltrated the facility and retrieved Natasi Daala to use her against the Jedi Order.
Veila used the opportunity created by her enemies as a chance to escape from prison, becoming a homeless fugitive.
As most Jedi were away from the Temple and unable to count on the Council's support, Veila took comfort in her freedom and went barefoot once more.

After escaping, Veila turned herself over to Han and Leia Solo for help.
Despite avoiding execution, she was eventually turned over to Head of State Jagged Fel, the leader of the Imperial Remnant.
Veila was framed for the assassination of Gilad Pellaeon during Darth Caedus' reign.
The Imperial-Alliance conspiracy was ultimately destroyed by the Lost Tribe of Sith, who infiltrated the Galactic Alliance government.
During this time, Moff Tol Getelles discovered Natasi Daala's plot to usurp control of the Imperial Remnant.
He informed the High Moff of the conspiracy and the secret location of Daala's Maw Irregular Fleet.
Veila accompanied Fel to the Exodo system, where the battle continued between the Imperial Remnant and the Maw Irregular Fleet.

Veila escaped and required help from Han and Leia Solo.
She was eventually sent to Jagged Fel, the Imperial Remnant leader.
Despite being framed for Gilad Pellaeon's assassination, the Imperial-Alliance conspiracy was destroyed.
