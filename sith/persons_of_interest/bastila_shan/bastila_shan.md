# Overview
Bastila Shan was a female human and an extremely talented Jedi Master.
Bastila Shan started as a Jedi Sentinel and progressed through the ranks after saving Darth Revan, who was corrupted by the Eternal Emperor.
Revan and Bastila figured out that they shared an extremely powerful Force bond that kept each other alive.
Bastila was born on the planet Talravin.
Her mother was Helena Shan and her father was an obsessed treasure hunter.
Helen left the Jedi Order to give Bastila the best possible life and her father also cared dearly for her but he wanted to take her out on his treasure hunts.
However, Helen disapproved of this and told Bastila’s father that the hunts were too dangerous.
When Bastila joined the Order she was in charge of a Jedi strike team to save the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Revan, and his apprentice, Darth Malak.
They boarded Revan’s ship and then cornered Revan.
After turning Revan, Revan defeated Malak and redeemed Bastila when she turned to the Dark side.
Revan and Bastila got married and two years later Revan went to eliminate Sith threats in the unknown region.
Unfortunately, Revan left Bastila and his unborn child due to the fact he wanted the best life for his kid.
Bastila then went into hiding with her kid to raise him normally.

# Dark Lord's apprentice
Malak eventually captured the Ebon Hawk crew and put them in several different cells.
They knew that Revan cared for Bastila so they tortured her even worse than the others to make Revan tell him where the Jedi Enclave was located.
Revan refused to tell them leading Bastila to an immense amount of torture.
The crew was freed and on their way out they fought Malak’s forces.
Saul Karath told Carth Onasi about Revan’s true identity, which led Onasi to a confused and frustrated state.
He demanded that Shan tell him answers but she told him she would tell him later.
Malak stopped them from boarding and informed Revan of what his true identity was, and how he was mind-wiped by the Jedi Council.
Bastila fought off Malak to allow Onasi and Revan to escape and find the Star Forge.
Unfortunately, Shan lost the duel and he imprisoned her so that she could turn on the Jedi and become Malak’s apprentice.
Malak eventually convinced Shan that the Council was using her and holding her back, so she developed a hatred towards them and became his apprentice.
Shan reunited with Reva, Jolee Bindo, and Juhani and informed them that she was Malak’s new apprentice and that she would help Malak take over the galaxy.
Shan couldn’t stand a chance against the three Jedi and then she realized that Revan was extremely powerful and deserved to be the real Dark Lord of the Sith.
Shan tried to convince Revan to reclaim his title as Dark Lord by using the Force bond they shared.
Revan then realized that Bastila was more to him than a Force bond and Shan denied this.
She believed the only thing that they were was Force and power so she begged Revan to help her defeat Malak.
Revan was unsure whether or not to trust her again after betraying him and joining Malak.
Shan had no other choice than to accept her love for him and claimed that they could rule the galaxy as master and apprentice or something more perhaps.
Shan said to Revan that she’d be “utterly yours”.
Revan chose to follow the Jedi code and denied Shan.
Shan retreated to the Star Forge and Revan and she had their last battle.
Shan got the upper hand but couldn’t defeat Revan so she returned to the Jedi and confessed her love for him.
Shan helped the Republic win the war and Revan killed his former apprentice.
The Jedi then destroyed the Star Forge and the Ebon Hawk crew were honored by the Republic.
Afterward, Shan and Revan settled on the planet Coruscant and got married.
The Council didn’t agree with this so they left the Order.
Two years later Revan went to find the remaining threats in the Unknown Regions and left Bastila and his child because he believed it was too dangerous for them...
Shan then raised the child on her own.
