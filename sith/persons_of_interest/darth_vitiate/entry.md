# Overview

To the Old Sith Empire he is known as Darth Vitiate, to his “Eternal Empire” he is known as Emperor Valkorion but his real name is Tenebrae, son of Lord Dramath.
Tenebrae was a male that was a part of the Sith pureblood species and was born on the planet Medriaas.
At a young age Vitiate tortured his mother for weeks and snapped his step-father’s head off just by thought.
He later found a host, Vitiate, who he entered and he became known as Darth Vitiate.
Vitiate, unlike many Sith, actually survived for centuries over thousands of years.
He was unstoppable, every time someone killed him he’d find a different host until it got to the point where he tried to take over Grand Master Satele Shan but was destroyed by Revan and a few other souls.
Darth Vitiate once performed a very unique ritual where he lured the remaining Sith Lords after the Great HyperSpace war to the planet Nathema and then drained all of their life essence in order to expand his life span and his abilities.
He then started his own Sith Empire and after centuries of expansion the Emperor came across the lost planet Zakuul and encountered the Eternal Fleet which was a powerful source of unimaginable technology.
He encountered a warrior on Zakuul named Valkorion and divided his consciousness into him.
This was when he created the Eternal Empire.
He then sought a ritual that would allow him to consume everything in a galaxy.
This wasn’t enough for him.
Vitiate desired Immortality.
He was so powerful afterwards he orchestrated the Mandalorian war, one of the worst wars in lore.
Unlucky for him, Jedi knights Revan and Malak found him and Vitiate possessed their brains and turned them to the dark side but then they overthrew him.
Being the most powerful being Vitiate survived and hid but Revan a few years later swore that he would not die until the Emperor did and he eventually did.
Darth Vitiate was also killed by the hero of Tython but his spirit survived.
Vitiate went back into hiding after the desolation of his Empire and he lived for another couple of millennia until 67 BBY when people assumed that he died from a Jedi Knight.

# Abilities, Personality and Traits

Darth Vitiate was a powerful Sith whose abilities first showed themselves when he was six and he used this power to snap the head of his step-father/adoptive father’s head off and torture his mother for weeks only feeding his powers off her pain.
He started to go around torturing people in public so he could feed his powers and grow stronger.
One day when Vitiate was ten he stripped his real father, Lord Dramath, a powerful Sith, from the force and made him go insane.
At thirteen the current Dark Lord of the Sith at that time, Marka Ragnos, took him in and gave him the title Lord Vitiate.
He then spent years studying the dark side of the force; some called him a scholar since he was that knowledgeable.
In a few years he became the most powerful Sith of his time and any before and he used this power to strip the force from the planet Nathema and the Sith Lords on it.
Vitiate was able to forge giant force storms and use the force lightning during battles and could transfer his consciousness to other bodies.
He used this to possess children so he could make an army of force wielders and used the same mind trick of Revan and Malak, making them his puppets.
He was so skilled at telekinesis that he didn’t even need hand gestures to help just by thinking he could throw Revan across the throne room.
Although he was powerful with the force he was also very skilled with lightsaber combat however he rarely used it because of his force powers.
Vitiate also had Immortal powers; it was around five thousand years after his birth that he died but his legacy continued...
