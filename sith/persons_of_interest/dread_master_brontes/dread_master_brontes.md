Brontes, also known as the “Architect of Fear” was a Sith Sorceress of immense power belonging to the Dread Masters.
She was one of the Dread Masters that dealt with most if not all things related to artifacts, finding their purposes.
Unlike most of the Dread Masters, she wielded no lightsaber, instead using her absolute mastery of the dark side of the Force.
With her insight into the nature and purposes of Sith artifacts, the Emperor soon ordered an expansion of a Sith tomb into the Dark Temple not long after the Emperor’s arrival on Dromund Kaas in 4980 BBY.
By her orders, the Dread Forces on Oricon were developed with technological enhancements and weaponry.
Dread Master Brontes was an inquisitive, strategic, and powerful foe.
