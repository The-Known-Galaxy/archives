# Overview

Darth Arctis was a male Dark Lord of the Sith who served as the Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge for he had a seat on the Dark Council.
During the Cold War, Darth Hadra, who was the Overlord of the Sphere of Technology and a fellow Dark Council member that ruled Dromund Kaas, discovered an ancient Sith shrine and attempted to claim it for herself.
Darth Arctis challenged her and claimed that it was the property of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and negotiated with her.
Darth Thanaton, who later became the Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, wanted to punish Darth Zash for killing his friend, Darth Skotia.
Arctis refused his request and sided with the Dark Council to ascend Zash to the rank of Darth.
Darth Arctis’ death has always been a mystery, but it happened right after Zash’s ascension.
Due to his death, Thanaton ascended to the rank of Dark Councillor and Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge.
