# Overview

Tenn Graneet is a human born before 50 BBY, although his exact birthdate and the planet he was born on are unknown, his actions are what made him stand out.
Tenn Graneet was one of the best-trained gunners in the Imperial Navy, even serving in the Clone Wars.
Due to his skills, he was assigned as the Master Chief Gunnery Officer of the Death Star, commanding and operating the space station's superlaser crew.
Tenn Graneet was initially loyal to the Empire, he mistakenly believed the Death Star would not be used on civilian planets and instead used to shut down any rebellions.
Tenn Graneet first fired the superlaser at a rebel ship and soon on the planet of Desparye.
The Death Star soon moved in on the planet of Alderaan and Tenn Graneet was assigned the task of firing the Death Star's superlaser on max power.
Soon after the destruction of Alderaan, Tenn Graneet doubted his loyalty to the Empire as he had been ordered to kill billions of innocent lives.
After some time, the Death Star arrived at Yavin-4 and he was given the task of firing the Death Star's superlaser.
He knew what happened on Alderaan and hesitated as he would be destroying another planet with innocent lives.
His hesitation is ultimately what led to the destruction of the Death Star and the huge rise in popularity of the Rebel Alliance.
Tenn Graneet's very actions killed billions but saved countless more in the future.
