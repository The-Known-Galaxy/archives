# Overview
Skere Kaan was a Jedi Master, he served during the end of the New Sith Wars.
He eventually defected and became a Dark Lord, creating the “Brotherhood of Darkness” within the Sith Empire.
Due to this, he earned himself the title of “The Dark One”.
After a decade of his rule, Sith started to leave his brotherhood, they even saw flaws in his beliefs.
Darth Bane used Kaans own thought bomb to destroy whatever remained of the Brotherhood of Darkness.
That is where he set up his own Order using the “Rule of 2”, one master, 1 apprentice.

# Early Life
Skere was born during the dark age of the Republic, he was born unknown.
He was eventually found by the Jedi Order, he trained and as time passed he became a Jedi Knight.
Because of his knowledge and fleet command, he was also a beacon of hope for the Jedi High Council to defeat the Sith.
Since he mastered the art of “Battle Meditation” he was considered a high-value asset.
The Jedi High Council awarded him the title of Jedi Master to control his extremist views.
He took a handful of Knights and ran away from Coruscant forming the “Brotherhood of Darkness”.
During this time, the Sith were crippled, they were claiming the title of Dark Lord and starting campaigns against each other which lasted a while.
Kaan decided to unite all the Sith by forcing them under his rule and killing anyone who doesn’t abide by his rule.
Kopecz and Qordis, which were the 2 most powerful Sith Warlords at the time, pledged themselves to Kaans’ cause.
Jedi Lord Hoth deemed Kaan a threat and left Coruscant to make his own little army.
Kaan made everyone a Dark Lord, however, he did not let anyone take the title of Darth because only he held that title.

Jedi Lord Hoth formed the Army of Light, their purpose was to hunt Sith, this war lasted a decade.
It was considered an all-out war, but the Republic deemed it as a series of battles against an illegal organization.
The Sith retook their home by winning the “Battle of Korriban”.
Kaan Re-established the ‘Sith Academy’.
He placed Sith Warlord Qordis there to oversee the training of the next generation of Sith.



# Nearing the End
Kaans’ next target was Ruusan, he had the Sith fleet lay a devastating blow on the planet, the planet had weak defenses which allowed an easy first victory during the Battle of Ruusan.
During the second Battle of Ruusan, the Sith pushed the Jedi back, and Kaan decided to launch an invasion of the Bormea Sector.
However, the Jedi weren’t at the core, Jedi Lord Hoth decided to gather the Army of Light and launch a full-scale attack on Ruusan to finish off the Brotherhood.
By the time of the Fourth Battle of Ruusan, Kaan was outnumbered but still believed they could pull through.
Jedi Githany defected and gave the Sith vital information on the Jedis’ attack strategy.
Bane was against Kaans’ strategies, he believed that Kaan was acting like a commander more than a Dark Lord of the Sith, and also believed he wasn’t using the dark side properly.
Lord Kaan tried killing Bane, unfortunately, it didn’t work and Bane survived.
Lord Kaan eventually accepted Bane’s advice, and the members of the Brotherhood meditated and focused their energy on Bane.
Lord Kaan and other members became overconfident and decided to break their meditation because they believed the Jedi were weak and they could just finish them off.
He also believed Bane was taking advantage of them.
