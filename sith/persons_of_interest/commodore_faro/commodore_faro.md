# Overview

Karyn Faro, or Commodore Faro, was a female human who served the Galactic Empire by working for the Imperial Navy as Commodore and second-in-command of the Chimaera, the capital Star Destroyer within the Seventh Fleet, led by the famous Chiss tactician Grand Admiral Thrawn.
Faro was a skilled leader who participated in many battles and defeated Grand Admiral Savit.
With her ascension to Commodore, Faro was promised Task Force 231, but Thrawn saw her potential and recommended they put her in charge of a fleet.
The Imperial High Command approved of this and promoted her to Commander of the Eleventh Fleet.
Faro was a brilliant tactician like Thrawn, and serving as Thrawn’s second-in-command made her tactical skills even better.
Her major flaw was that she was very blunt to Imperial high ranks, except Grand Admiral Thrawn and his friend, Eli Vanto.
Faro was very ambitious and sometimes disagreed with Thrawn, but never ceased to surprise  her.

# The Seventh Fleet

Faro, when Thrawn was a Commodore himself, was very sceptical of his motives and strategies.
Despite this, Thrawn gained Faro’s approval due to his intelligence as a tactician, and in return, earned Thrawn’s respect because of her own tactics and honesty.
The two ascended their way through the ranks and found themselves on a very important mission requested by the Emperor himself.
With the supervision of the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader, the Chimaera and its crew were sent to the planet Batuu, so they could eliminate the disturbance the Emperor felt in the Force.
Whilst Thrawn and Vader investigated what was happening on the planet, Faro was placed in charge and dealt with possible threats in space.
They learned of a species called Grysks, who were supposedly hiding in the separatist droid factory on Mokivj.
Vader and his Legion went to infiltrate the factory while Thrawn and Faro remained on the Chimaera.
Thrawn soon alerted them of the Chiss children who had the capability to use the Force, they weren’t as strong though.
Then Thrawn demanded all TIEs destroy the Grysks ships and they left no survivors.
Once Faro returned she contact Imperial High Command about why she never received her task force and the Chimaera crew were called by Grand Moff Tarkin, Director Krennic, and Grand Admiral Savit to discuss Thrawn’’s TIE defender idea.
Faro was laterinformed that it was Grand Admiral Thrawn who denied her request for the task force because he didn’t want her to be completely alone.
Soon, the Chimaera was sent on another mission and teamed up with Chiss.
They worked with the Chiss to defeat the Grysks by tracking down their base and once they reached the system there were two defenseless ships, which they believed were a trap.
They successfully defeated the Grysks.
Eventually,Faro went up to Thrawn to discuss her task force, and his response shocked her.
Thrawn denied the task force because he believed she was capable of commanding an entire fleet.
He put the request through to the Imperial High Command, who approved it and appointed Faro the commander of the Eleventh Fleet.
