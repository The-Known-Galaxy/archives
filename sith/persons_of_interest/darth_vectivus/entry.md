# Early Life

Darth Vectivus was a Force Sensitive human male.
During adulthood, he lived an average life, with not much going on.
He had a family in which he cared for, and a good handful of friends.
During his life, he worked in the business industry as well as trade.
He learned much from trading, utilizing anything he learned into his business practices.
He was an administrator of a mining facility in the MZX32905 system, which was located in the Kanz sector, near Lorrd and Bimmiel.
His mining facility was designated the Jonex Mine Eight Eleven B mining facility.
He settled his base of operations on an asteroid named, “The Home”.
This asteroid was affluent in metal ores, which his company accumulated.
To him, his peers, and employees, they did not know that this planet was infused with the dark side of the Force.
The outcome of the dark side of the Force being on this planet engendered a sentient mynock-like species, which were extinct.
The species had astronomically immense triangular yellow ocular perceivers, and communicated utilizing telepathy.

Over time, being on the asteroid corrupted the minds of the workers.
As for Force Sensitives who resided on the planet, they would optically discern abstruse visions.
They commenced to comport much akin to the mynock-like species that resided on the planet afore them.
After time, Darth Vectivus, who was also Force Sensitive, commenced to experience the aberrant sensation and visions the other Force Sensitives had.
Conscientiously and mutely, he silenced any aberrant and odd reports, ceasing any activity that the Jonex Mining Facility was doing.
He utilized his spare time to devote himself to experimenting with incipient things with the dark side of the Force.
He developed and created new and different Force abilities and techniques while doing so.

# Sith Lord

After shutting down the operation located on the asteroid, he persuaded people to evade the asteroid, seeming as if nothing deplorable transpired.
Following the recent event, he wandered the galaxy, hoping to find the Sith who could teach him the dark side of the Force and his incipiently found facilities.
His mission was prosperous, as he was able to find a Sith Master, in which he became the Apprentice to and learned under them and their erudition.
He had gained so much knowledge of the Dark Side that he progressed further than he could learn.
After concluding his training under his master, he inherited the role of the Dark Lord of the Sith, going under the incipient designation, Darth Vectivus, a denomination that only a few would fear.
Although he became Sith Lord, he still had the same morals as he did when he was a businessman.
He maintained the morals he had, which obviated him from becoming corrupted and zealous for triumph, unlike his peers and those who came before him.
Darth Vectivus was heavily more of a librarian than a combatant or a dictator.
He relished reading and circumvented himself with erudition and lore of the Dark Side and Sith culture.
As a plenarily-fledged Sith Lord, he arrived back at the mine, which he worked at.
He built a sizably voluminous mansion inside of the core of the asteroid.
He did so in order to be further connected to the dark side, which contaminated the asteroid.
In case he ever physically died, he created a personal Sith holocron.

This holocron contained all the knowledge he learned after the years, and business skills, which one could use to become rich and invest well.
Not only did it contain these things, but it gave a detailed explanation of empowered projections.
Which Darth Vectivus created himself.
These projections, which he nicknamed Phantoms were apparitions that the Force could control and altar.
The Phantoms required a healthy soul of a living host to serve as the anchor of the person who created the apparition.
The anchor allowed the physical embodiment of the user to be locked in the physical plane, without accidentally moving to the spiritual plane.
If one apparition were to be destroyed or killed in any way, the other apparitions would follow after them and perish.
Darth Vectivus was so strong with this ability he created that he was able to conjure hundreds of these phantoms, with barely any work.
Darth Vectivus died at “The Home”, surrounded by those who cared for them.

# Lumiya

A millennia after Darth Vectivus’s death “The Home” was now the base of operations of Lumiya, who was a Force Sensitive human female and the Dark Lady of the Sith.
“The Home” became a sanctuary where Lumiya studied different topics that Darth Vectivus held within his library.
She would study the history of the Sith, the Force and what could do with it, and also Darth Vectivus.
During Lumiya’s time living in “The Home” she encountered the spirit of Darth Vectivus.
His spirit was found lingering in the bowels of the asteroid.
From his spirit, Lumiya was able to master the ability to create and control Phantoms and apparitions to a great extent.
She was so powerful with this ability that she could send these apparitions across the universe to do her bidding, whether it be to spy on someone, tell them something, or even attack them.

Circa 40 ABY, Lumiya started to believe that the galaxy was slowly descending into a state of chaos and destruction.
She thought that the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, the current reigning government, was unable to maintain peace and prosperity throughout the galaxy and the citizens.
She felt as if the morals and beliefs of the late Darth Vectivus was needed in order to maintain the stability and peace that the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances were unable to uphold.
Through this vision that she saw, she hoped to transform the Jedi Knight, Jacen Solo, into the Sith leader that no one else could become.
Under the name “Brisha Syo” Lumiya was able to lure Jacen Solo, Ben Skywalker his cousin, and Nelani Dinn, a female Human Jedi Knight to “The Home.” Whilst in her base of operations, she was able to split up Jacen Solo from his trio of friends and started to manipulate him into becoming what she believed was the perfect Sith, Darth Vectivus.
After time, Jacen became convinced by Darth Vectivus’s morals and beliefs, much to Lumiya’s plan.
Chaos struck, as the Second Galactic Civil War followed after Jacen Solo fell to the dark side.
From this, he changed his name from Jacen Solo into Darth Caedus, who would become a Dark Lord of the Sith.

# Alema Rar

Following the death of Lumiya, the residence was left unoccupied for a short time.
After the time of “The Home” being unoccupied, a Twi’Lek Dark Jedi named Alema Rar took control of the domain.
Alema Rar traveled to the Sith homeworld of Korriban in order to meet with members of a secret Sith Order.
There, she was presented with Darth Vectivus’s holocron in which he made himself, in order to deliver it to Darth Caedus as a gift.
Rar believed that the information within the holocron would be useless to Darth Caedus.
In doing so, she did not give him the holocron, holding onto it.
After the final days of the Battle of Kashyyyk Rar traveled back to “The Home”.
When she arrived back, she started to learn and practice Darth Vectivus’s Phantom-creating ability.

# The Destruction of The Home

Darth Vectivus’s asteroid became aware to others, which cause people want to head there in order to gain knowledge on how to create the powerful apparitions which he and a few others once were able to make.
A female Sith lord named Dician was informed that Alema Rar was in possession of “The Home” which was the base located on the asteroid on which Darth Vectivus once lived.
Although most were unknown about Vectivus, he was mainly known for his ability to conjure the apparitions, which struck fear in those who were weak and wanted to learn these techniques.
After a discussion, the Sith Order decided it was best to destroy the asteroid and “The Home” in order for no one to be able to learn how to create the apparitions.
A shuttle crew from the “Poison Moon” traveled to the asteroid.
They planted fission bombs in multiple locations, destroying the asteroid, obliterating everything on the asteroid, including “The Home” and the information stored within it.
