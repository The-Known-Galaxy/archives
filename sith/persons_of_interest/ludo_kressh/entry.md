# Overview

Ludo Kressh was a male half-breed Sith species born in the Outer Rim territories.
He was classified as a Sith hybrid because his parents were different species.
Ludo had light red skin and red eyes and he trained a secret apprentice, Skarok-Nur.
Kressh was a very powerful Sith Lord and was constantly in battle with his arch nemesis, Naga Sadow.
Sadow and Kressh, after the tragic death of Dark Lord Marka Ragnos, were fighting for the title of Dark Lord of the Sith.
Sadow, trying to claim the title in order to expand the Sith Empire and go to war with the Republic, tricked Kressh into believing that there was a Republic attack and he sent Sith Lords Horak-Mul and Dor Gal-ram, his most trusted allies, to defend against them.
Sadly Horak and Gal both died by their own crew who were secretly working for Sadow the entire time.
Infuriated, Kressh attacked Sadow’s fortress on the planet Khar Delba.
Kressh was outsmarted by Sadow yet he would survive the confrontation by faking his death.
Sadow then was titled Dark Lord of the Sith and staged an attack against the Republic thus starting a Great Hyperspace War.
Sadow’s attack failed and once he returned, Kressh revealed himself and informed Sadow that he faked his death.
Sadow was then infuriated and sent one of his ships on a suicide mission to clash into Kressh’s ship.
Unfortunately for Kressh, the ship crashed into them and killed Kressh.
Ludo had a son, Elcho Kressh also known as Kressh the younger, who he adored and believed they shared many of the same traits.
Ludo was scared that Sadow would come for his son so he designed a device that could prevent anyone from touching him without his will; it was known as the gauntlet of Kressh.

# Personality and Abilities

Ludo Kressh was a very passionate Sith Lord and was determined to be crowned Dark Lord of the Sith.
He believed in the Sith Empire’s welfare and didn’t want to stage an attack on the Republic and instead he wanted to wait for them to attack the Sith so the Empire’s defence could be stronger.
He was very cautious and cunning.
He cared very little about his slaves and his alcoholic influence was negative on the slaves.
He’d beat his slaves and drive them insane.
The only thing he truly cared for was his son.
Kressh was trained in the manipulative ways of the Dark side of the Force and possessed bits of knowledge on Sith alchemy but an even broader knowledge on Sith Magic.
Through alchemy and magic he created the special device for his son’s safety.
Kressh was able to use battle mind powers and could regain his strength, speed and ferocity by accessing his rage through the Force.
He could speak a few languages like Massassi, the old Sith language and he was good at combat.
He would use the Force and connect that with his Sith sword in order to make it more powerful.
When he duelled Naga Sadow they both had the same wounds and both had the upper hand at one point.
Therefore Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh were equally skilled at combat, hence why they both went into more manipulative ways in defeating each other from Sadow’s false atack to Kressh’s false death.
The two of them showed extreme power and wit during the rivalry.
Kressh was later buried after his death in a cave in the upper section of the Valley of Dark Lords.
