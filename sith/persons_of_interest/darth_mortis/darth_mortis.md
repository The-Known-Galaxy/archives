# The Beginning

Darth Mortis was a male human who had risen to the rank of Sith Lord within the resurgent Empire by the time of the conflict with the Galactic Republic.
The older man was sufficiently powerful enough to be granted a seat on the Empire's ruling Dark Council, and united with the twelve Dark Lords of the Sith he controlled the Sphere of Laws and Justice within the Empire.
As head of the Sphere, Mortis was charged with overseeing the Imperial justice system and folk branches of the Empire that maintained the law within its society.
By the simplest of the conflict, Mortis had also begun training a Sith apprentice named Zavrasha, and he dispatched her to the neutral moon of Nar Shaddaa to confirm that Admiral Ange's efforts there didn't endanger the peace caused by Treaty of Coruscant.
The Sith Lord Darth Gravus, who was placed responsible for the invasion of Taris, was a political ally of Mortis.

# The Middle

As the Galactic War broke out with the Republic, Darth Mortis and also the opposite members of the Council were summoned by fellow Councilor Darth Baras to their meeting chamber on Korriban.
Darth Decimus, Hadra, and Acharon were overseeing the Battle of Corellia, which the three attended via hologram.
Darths Marr and Ravage were present on Korriban with Mortis, where Baras attempted to declare himself the Voice of the Emperorâ€”the public extension of the Sith Emperor's will and thereby the ruler of the complete Empire.
However, Baras was disturbed by the arrival of Vowrawn and Baras' former apprentice.
The Sith Warrior, who had been appointed because of the Emperor's Wrath after Baras had betrayed his student, and thus battled the false Voice before the rest of the Council.

# The End

After the Wrath killed Baras, Darth Vowrawn led Mortis and so the others in acknowledging the actual fact of the Emperor's support for the warrior, accepting that the Wrath wasn't bound by the Council's wishes.
When the Wrath departed, Darth Thanaton brought his own matter before his fellow Councilors: the best of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge was engaged in an exceedingly Important Kaggath, an ancient Sith ritual duel, against his rival/subordinate Lord Kallig.
After being bested by Kallig on Corellia, Thanaton appealed to Mortis, Ravage, Vowrawn, and Marr to eliminate the upstart slave, though the selection Dark Councilors refused to interfere when Kallig arrived to continue their battle.
After Kallig defeated Thanaton and made him submit, Mortis rose from his seat and apologized to his fellow Councilor before breaking his neck with the Force.
Acknowledging Kallig as the victor, the four Dark Councilors present rewarded the young Sith Lord with Thanaton's now-vacant seat on the Council, which they ignored the newly-appointed Darth Nox's query when the Emperor would be meeting with the Council.
Because the Council adjourned, Mortis advised Nox to return Dromund Kaas and ensure the loyalty of their followers, promising to summon Nox the next time the Dark Council congregates.
