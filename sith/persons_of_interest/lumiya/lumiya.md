# Overview
Shira Elan Colla Brie, also known as Lumiya, was a Force-sensitive Human who later switched sides and joined the Dark Lady of the Sith after serving the Galactic Empire.Palpatine was born on the Imperial Center at the time when his control over the bulk of the galaxy was at its height.Brie pledged her support for the imperial New Order's ideology.
The young woman's advancement in a variety of Imperial-sponsored programmes, including her enrollment in the Intelligence Academy of Carida, was hastened as a result of the Sith Lord Darth Vader, Palpatine's chief enforcer, becoming aware of this.

# History
After graduating with the greatest honours and being promoted to the rank of major by Darth Vader, Brie was assigned a top-secret mission to infiltrate the Rebel Alliance and either assassinate or cause the exclusion of Rebel hero and Jedi Luke Skywalker among his peers.
However, the same events that brought disgrace upon Skywalker also left Brie gravely crippled and perilously close to death.
When Darth Vader discovered her, he gave her cybernetic substitutes that closely resembled his own.
Brie then began getting training from Vader in the evil side of the Force while posing as Lumiya, Dark Lady of the Sith.


The Emperor's Hands were trained assassins who reported directly to Palpatine, and Lumiya was one of them while she studied covertly as Lord Vader's Shadow Hand.She set out on a journey to the planet Ziost, where she made her own lightwhip.
However, during that journey, both Palpatine and Darth Vader were killed in combat at Endor, and as the most prominent of their students despite her incomplete training, she assumed the title of Mistress of the Sith.
She apprenticed Flint, a former stormtrooper, and supported the extragalactic Nagai species' conflict with their mortal Tof adversaries out of a desire for vengeance against Luke Skywalker and the Alliance for the deaths of her Sith Masters.
 
Early in her campaign, The Sith Lady experienced a crucial setback that necessitated the replacement of her armour.
It also saw the debut of a triangle headgear, which, together with her lightwhip, later became her identifying feature.
While still assisting the Nagai, she faced up against her sworn adversary, Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, and ultimately fell short.
But as the Nagai-Tof War got underway, the Dark Lady broke out of Skywalker's custody and vowed to wreak havoc on him when they next crossed paths.
She, therefore, dissolved her alliance with the Nagai in favour of the Tof resistance, but their quick demise at the hands of the combined Alliance, Empire, and Nagai forces signalled the end of the conflict.
The majority of the galaxy believed Lumiya to be dead, so she withdrew to the Outer Rim with vengeance always on her mind.

The Dark Lady built a fleet while she was concealed in order to launch an attack against the New Republic, the authority that replaced the Rebel Alliance.
After the strange passing of her first pupil, she once more collaborated closely with Imperial Intelligence and took on Carnor Jax, a former member of the Imperial Royal Guard.
The final remnants of the Prophets of the Dark Side cult were destroyed by Lumiya and Jax working together.
In response to a potential threat to the Sith Order, she then tasked him with infiltrating the Imperial Ruling Council while she personally negotiated with Imperial Regent Ysanne Isard for more resources.
    

Jax attempted to betray Lumiya, but his fledgling ambitions drove him astray.
Kir Kanos, a fellow former Royal Guardsman, assassinated Jax, leaving the Dark Lady without an apprentice once more.
With the ancient Sith oracle stone artefact in her control, she went back to the planet Korriban to make plans while continuing to keep an eye on events happening across the galaxy.
But by 25 ABY, Lumiya had left the outer rim in favour of Vectivus's former asteroid home, where she had mastered the making of his dark side-enhanced Force phantoms.
On Korriban, she considered accepting an offer from a new Sith order that wanted to adopt the Dark Lady, but on the way there, she was stopped by extraterrestrial Yuuzhan Vong advance scouts who were preparing for a galactic invasion.
She avoided captivity and made her own covert attempts to thwart the Yuuzhan Vong offensive.

Lumiya came to believe that order and stability could only be imposed by the supreme will of a Dark Lord of the Sith as the galaxy plunged more into anarchy.
When she encountered the Fosh ex-Jedi turned Sith Vergere while fostering such views, Lumiya's training was completed thanks to the latter's greater understanding.
By creating and elevating the next Sith Lord, they planned to bring the galaxy back to harmony.
As Lumiya and Vergere worked to bring Jacen Solo, the grandson of Darth Vader, full circle in the Sith tradition of the Skywalker family, she turned down a second offer of partnership from those on Korriban.

She and Vergere helped the Yuuzhan Vong, with whom Vergere had made friends, capture Solo, and the Fosh started the training that Lumiya would finally complete.
Vergere passed away three years into the Yuuzhan Vong War, and her part in the situation concluded, but it took Lumiya another twelve years to be ready to fulfill her end of the contract.
She carried out her plan to seduce Solo in 40 ABY by escalating the already tense relationship between the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances and the Five Worlds government of the Corellian system.
This was done against the backdrop of a new conflict that she had secretly instigated.
A planned series of events brought Solo to Lumiya's house, where he decided to follow the Sith path.
She and Vergere assisted the Yuuzhan Vong in capturing Solo while the Fosh began the training that Lumiya would eventually complete.
