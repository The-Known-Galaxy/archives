# Advocate for peace
Senator Riyo Chuchi was more of a diplomatic senator, she’d rather resolve issues with negotiations or peace treaties rather than violence.
The Pantoran Assembly sought to establish a base on the planet of Orto Plutonia in case of any attacks by Independent Systems, and so they requested permission from the Galactic Senate and the Grand Army of the Republic.
The Grand Army of the Republic already had a base on Orto Plutonia, however, recently their base had lost communications, which led to Chairman Chi Cho of the Pantoran Assembly and his military leaders along with Chuchi, Skywalker, Kenobi, and the 501st legion to investigate the strange disappearance of the clone outpost communications on the planet.
The Jedi accompanied them to act as liaisons between Pantorans and the Jedi Order.
Although Chuchi was present, Chairman Cho only brought Chuchi along with him so she could act as Cho’s representative within the senate, because Chuchi had more authority over the Jedi being a senator and Cho exploited this to his advantage in hopes that the peaceful Jedi would not interfere with his interaction with the Talz.
Once Cho realized that the Talz already inhabited this planet, he immediately viewed them as “trespassers” and as an enemy, and due to his history within the military he wanted to fight off the Talz, but the Jedi and Chuchi were reluctant.
Due to Cho’s arrogance and hatred towards the Talz, he began a small and short battle with them, which led to his demise.
After Cho’s death, Chuchi requested to the Jedi that she’d contact the Speaker of the Assembly about Cho’s actions.
The Assembly decided to revoke Cho’s status as Chairman and gave Senator Chuchi full authority on this matter.
Senator Chuchi then approached the scared Talz tribe in hope that she could declare peace with them.
Cho’s final words were directed to Chuchi to kill the Talz tribe, Chuchi refused to do this and instead sought a more diplomatic way to resolve the issue.
She approached the Talz tribe’s Chieftain Thi-Sen, with the help of the famous C3-PO as her translator, and agreed to leave Orto Plutonia in the hands of the native Talz tribe and that she and the Pantorans would withdraw from the planet because she’d rather live and serve her people than die for war.
The Chieftain was pleased that they’d be leaving and let Chuchi and the Republic forces leave Orto Plutonia.
Chuchi returned to Coruscant and continued her duties as a Senator.
Not long after this, Chuchi met Anakin’s Padawan, Ahsoka Tano and the two became allies.

# Attacks and Blockades
During the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine requested that the last Zillo Beast be studied and used for armor, however, the Zillo Beast escaped and attacked the Senate building, Chuchi survived the attack whilst some other senators died.
Not long after all these events, Senator Chuchi was faced with another big crisis, Chairman Notluwiski Papanoida’s daughters were kidnapped and the Trade Federation made a blockade above Pantora.
The small moon owed the Trade Federation numerous amounts of debts.
Unfortunately, Pantora was experiencing Anti-Republic behavior and considered siding with the Separatists.
After her encounter with Orto Plutonia, Chuchi became a stronger voice and stood up for what she believed was right.
She protected her people and tried so hard to plead with the senate to side with Pantorans and oppose the wild accusations being thrown at them by the Trade Federation.
The Chairman’s daughters were kidnapped by the Rodian Bounty Hunter, Greedo, and another Bounty Hunter hired by the Trade Federation.
They were trying to push the Chairman into joining the Independent Systems and the Separatists.
With the lack of progress being made, Chuchi decided to take the matter into her own hands and with the help of her friend, Ahsoka Tano, she went to search for the Chairman’s daughters and confront the Trade Federation.
They decided to board the Trade Federation vessel and searched around for the daughters.
Ahsoka played the role of a servant of Chuchi and the two met a few personnel and then began searching.
They snuck into the Ambassador’s Officer and heard the sounds of chatter, they hid under the table and eavesdropped on the conversation.
Their suspicions were confirmed when they overheard the two personnel discussing the kidnapped daughters.
Then, they tricked the guard protecting the detention block and freed one of the Chairman’s daughters, but they were caught.
Ahsoka destroyed the droids and the personnel were quick to realize she was a Jedi.
With her newfound knowledge of the Federation, Chuchi used it to convince the Federation to remove the blockade over Pantora and stop Pantora’s commercial isolation.



# The dawn of the Empire
Towards the end of the war, the infamous Bounty Hunter, Cad Bane, and his crew invaded the Senate building and took several Senators as hostages.
Many senators were voicing their opinions of the Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill and met with each other under the influence of Senator Philo, Chuchi was one of them.
Bane and the Bounty Hunters imprisoned the Senators and found the daring Skywalker trying to ruin their plan.
Earlier, Anakin met with Senator Padme Amidala to discuss a vacation and handed her his lightsaber to prove his love for her.
Senator Organa intruded on their conversation, leaving Anakin to hide and Padme to meet with the senators.
Without his lightsaber, Anakin was vulnerable and was knocked unconscious by the Bounty Hunters.
He was then taken to the senators and was tended to by Chuchi and Padme.
Bane then blackmailed the Chancellor in order to release Zirro the Hutt in exchange for the senators’ freedom.
After this event, Chuchi was on the Jury of Ahsoka Tano’s trial and was in favor of urging the Republic’s attack on the Inner Galactic Banking Clans.
After the Chancellor took control of the banks, the final act of the Grand Plan of the Sith was put in place and the Jedi were about to witness the Revenge of the Sith.



# Clone Advocate
Finally, Chancellor Palpatine informed the clones to Execute Order 66, and the thousands of Jedi in the Galaxies were killed by their once-trusted clones.
With the Jedi gone and the attack on his life, Palpatine destroyed the Republic and replaced it with the first Galactic Empire.
The senate remained intact but the Jedi Order crumbled and the Grand Plan and the Revenge of the Sith were finally completed, the Jedi were purged from the Galaxies.
Admiral Rampart sought to decommission the clone troopers and requested an Imperial Defense Recruitment Bill.
Chuchi voiced her concerns to the senate and acted as the senator for the clone troopers, she wished to improve their lives for Rampart was ruining them.
What no one knew was that the recent “storm” on Kamino was an attack led by Rampart to destroy the cloning facilities.
Chuchi was on the verge of discovering this when a rogue clone approached her whilst she was taking suggestions from other clones about how they wished their lives to be.
Chuchi encountered Senator Bail Organa who sought to help her and the clone to expose Admiral Rampart for his treachery.
The vote was postponed and Senator Chuchi was targeted by a clone assassin because she now knew the real way the cloning facilities were destroyed.
Chuchi requested that the clone speaks against Admiral Rampart as a witness but the clone was killed and Chuchi was on the run.
The assassin almost had her when Captain Rex stepped in and saved Chuchi.
Rex and Chuchi then hid whilst waiting for the skilled members of Clone Force 99 (The Bad Batch) to arrive.
Once they arrived, Rex briefed them on the plan to steal the command logs from Rampart’s Venator and Omega accompanied Chuchi in convincing the ex-Kaminoan Senator Balle Burtoni to speak up against Rampart.
The pair convinced Burtoni and went to the meeting.
The Bad Batch encountered many difficulties but managed to get a hold of the command logs and raced to deliver them to Chuchi, who was trying to further delay the vote.
With little time left, the Bad Batch gave the logs to Omega who ran to deliver them to Senator Organa.
The senator gave the evidence to Chuchi who exposed Rampart for destroying Tipoca City.
The senate went from loud murmuring to complete silence when the Emperor, after being absent from these meetings for a while, finally made it.
Palpatine twisted the senate into believing that Rampart was to be arrested and that the clones that obeyed his orders were weak.
He was several steps ahead of everyone again and used this information to enact his Imperial Stormtrooper program.
Chuchi and the clones headed back to the Underworld of Coruscant and bid their farewells.
Chuchi promised them all that she wouldn’t stop advocating for the clones and that she would be a voice for the voiceless, which was the act of a brave and true senator, until they got the same rights as normal citizens, something they’d deserved for a long time.
She continued to serve the senate but nothing else has been revealed about her after this event.
