# Overview
Darth Zavakon was a male Dark Lord of the Sith of Sith Pureblood or Human race.
He was one of the very first members of the Sith Empire to have a seat upon the Dark Council and was the founder of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge.
Darth Zavakon eventually noticed that the Sith within the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge were not providing all their knowledge to the Sith Empire itself, and this would cause the downfall of it.
In order to solve this, Zavakon sent a team to search through ancient Sith ruins and retrieve anything that might be full of knowledge.
The Emperor approved his idea and authorised the Imperial Reclamation Service.
This division’s purpose was to retrieve any lost artefacts and preserve the knowledge of the Sith.
