# Overview

Lana Beinko was a female human Sith Lord of the reconstituted Sith Empire and served as an advisor to the Dark Council member, Darth Arkous, and served in the Sphere of Military Offense.
Lana helped save the galaxy in many different battles.
She helped expose the deceitful Darth Arkous, battle the Revanites, helped defeat Revan to prevent Emperor Vitiate from returning, and helped defeat the Zakuul Eternal Empire.
At one point she became the Minister of Sith Intelligence.
With her new rank she fought the Eternal Empire and defeated many other enemies.
Later on, Lana learned that Theron Shan had been working with the Alliance as a double agent and traitor so she hunted him down.
After this, Lana decided to join the Galactic Republic.

# Return of Revan:

During her time as an advisor, Lana learned of Arkous’ scheme to betray the Empire because he was a part of the Order of Revan.
Lana made a team, consisting of Theron Shan, the Wookie smuggler Jakarro and a few others.
The team tracked down Arkous and his revanites on the planet Rakata Prime and killed them.
With the death of Arkous and his followers, the great Dark Lord of the Sith, Revan, was raised from the dead and attacked Lana and her team.
Unfortunately, Lana couldn’t return to the Empire because she was considered a traitor.
Lana, Theron, and Jakarro continued to hunt the Revanites until they arrived on Rishi.
On Rishi, Lana learned that the Dark Lord, Darth Marr, was present.
She told Marr of Revan’s plan to resurrect the dangerous and deceiving Sith Emperor, Vitiate.
Once learning of this, Marr joined forces with Lana’s team and surprisingly also did with the Jedi Grand Master, Satele Shan.
The allies learned that the powerful Dark Lord of the Sith and Marr’s fellow Dark Councillor, Darth Nox, was present.
Nox joined them and together they went to Yavin 4 to face Revan.
The allies struggled to defeat the determined Dark Lord but with the combined power of the team, they managed to defeat Revan and Revan reunited with his Light Side self and became one with the Force.
Unfortunately, Revan’s defeat managed to wake up the Emperor so Marr appointed Lana the Minister of Sith Intelligence and with the help of a few members of the team that took down Revan, she went to defeat the Eternal Empire.

# The Eternal Empire:

Lana and her team, which now consisted of an exiled Zakuulan naval officer, Koth Vortena, and Senya Tirall, managed to free the one people called the Outlander from carbonite and escaped the pursuit of the legendary Eternal Fleet on the Gravestone.
Lana called her contacts from the Sith Empire, Republic and criminal underworld to meet her on the planet Odessen where she created the Alliance to take down Eternal Emperor Arcann.
Lana wanted to go through with the plan made by the droid SCORPIO to get the GEMINI captains to take control of the Empire.
SCORPIO then took the throne for herself.
This led to the battle of Odessen and a duel with Arcann until Senya, Arcann’s mother, took him away.
Amongst all this, Arcann’s deceiving sister, Vaylin, allied with SCORPIO and took the title of Eternal Empress.
Lana then allied herself with the Commander and fought off Vaylin’s forces on the planet Voss who tried to take back the Gravestone but instead found the lost planet Lokath.
Lana then joined the forces that invaded the Grand Festival of Empress Vaylin and acquainted herself with the Commander on a mission to Nathema.
Vaylin launched another attack on the Odessen and the Commander managed to fight with Vaylin and killed her, the Commander then claimed the Eternal Throne and transformed it into the Eternal Alliance.
