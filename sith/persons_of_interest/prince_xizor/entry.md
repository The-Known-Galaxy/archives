# Overview

During the Galactic Civil War, Xizor was a Falleen Prince of House Sizhran and the head of Black Sun, an illicit operations group.
His base of operations, dubbed Xizor’s Palace, was situated on Coruscant, the capital planet, and demonstrated his extravagant monetary status.
He was known to be an extremely competitive businessman and was very highly regarded by the high society, rivaling even the Emperor, Lord Vader and the Galactic Empire, with whom he had an economic partnership.

# Early life

On Falleen, Xizor was born as the heir of a rich royal family.
His spoiled personality was made clear from a very young age.
He was the leader of his planet’s transport system and had already reached the trillionaire status before the start of the Clone Wars.
To demonstrate his power, he built his palace in the middle of the ecumenopolis of Coruscant, burning to ashes the Farfalla Skyscraper that was there and rivaling the presidential villa situated west of the palace.
During this time, he also rose to the inner circle of an underground organization named Black Sun; the organization nearly disappeared approaching the end of the Galactic Republic due to the breaking of a deal with the Hutts.

# Black Sun

A little while after the establishment of the Galactic Empire, there were two contenders for the Vigo position inside the organization, a role which directly reported to the Underlord - Xizor and a Nedji assassin whose known name was Kaird.
To determine the Vigo, the Underlord Dal Perhi gave each a mission.
Both set decoys and set-up each other in order to win, even lying about the mission given to make the other lose the Lord’s favor.
The prince won the little competition or so he thought, and was sent for a last mission to reclaim 10-4TO, a droid that was pursued by both the Galactic Empire and a resistance organization named Whiplash.
The true purpose this mission had was for Kaird to kill Xizor since he represented more of a danger to the Underlord’s throne.
However, the attempt on his life failed and a turn of events saw the capture of Kaird by the prince.
There, Whiplash also appeared, led by Jedi Knight Jax Pavan.
Soon, Xizor revealed his true plan of murdering the current Underlord, which unbeknownst to him, had already failed after the assassination of his scientist team.
A few moments later, Nick Rostu helped the prince find Pavan’s group and incapacitate them.
At the brink of ending the Jedi Knight’s life, Rostu betrayed and attacked him, although the assault was easily deflected.
In the distraction, Jax Pavan was able to use the Force and compelled the Falleen to escape.

# Family Tragedy

The instauration of the Empire came with consequences for Falleen.
Previously home to one of the richest families in the galaxy and one of the most stable economies throughout the Mid Rim, the focus shifted to a laboratory for Lord Vader.
However, a breach in the laboratory caused a biological weapon to reach the population nearby.
To keep this concealed, Vader ordered a bombardment upon the world and this murdered millions, including various Xizor’s family members.
Making the prince’s cold blood boil, he would promise to kill the Sith Lord, yet never revealed this publicly.
To masquerade his secret, he seemingly helped the Darth hide the Bombardment of Falleen under the guise of gaining the Emperor's favor.

# Hutt Politics

As a fan of money, he was interested in the Hutt clan, knowing they had monopolized the illegal market for decades.
An opportunity to have a partnership arose, after a sudden confrontation occurred between two Hutt clans, the Besadii and Desilijic.
Following the death of the Besadii clan’s leader, Xizor offered himself to its heir.
The agreement consisted of ridding the internal threats upon the heir, and in doing so, maintaining his succession for the whole clan, in exchange for acquiring a certain amount of spice operation profits on Ylesia.
Years later, he would earn an even higher percentage by providing Black Sun security for the Ylesian enterprise.
His connections even spanned to an economic relationship with Jabba the Hutt, leader of the Desilijic clan.

# Death

After a failed attempt to seduce Leia Organa and the subsequent destruction of his palace, he used his StarViper and tried to shoot down the Millenium Falcon.
However, a Rebel fleet appeared to assist them, which prompted the prince to request aid using his skyhook.
Unbeknown to him, Darth Vader, who had previously told him not to attack the Falcon, intercepted his comms and heard him say the name Skywalker.
The Sith sent TIE Fighters to attack the Falleen ship, first giving him an ultimatum - cease the attack or die.
No response was given and the ship was destroyed, killing Xizor and also destroying the skyhook.
His death led to his niece taking over the Black Sun.

# Personality and Traits

It is assumed that the Falleen Prince depended too heavily on his ability to read others.
This ability was truly magnificent but made him believe to be superior to everyone else.
This superiority complex made him underestimate the Force itself.
His body was capable of creating certain pheromones that affected females and made them easier to seduce.
He also maintained his body at peak condition, not by exercising but instead with the usage of Myostim units and martial arts.
He was a man of high life, enjoying priceless expenses and even pardoning rivals if they gifted him well.
The prince’s superiority complex was also fueled by his emotional control, considering those races influenced by their emotion, inferior.
He even stated that whilst those races searched for revenge instantly, he meticulously enacted every step he took.
