# Introduction
Grand Moff Odile Vaiken was one of the many victims of the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order’s counter-attacks after the Sith Empire’s fall in 5000 BBY.
After a long retreat from Republic territory alongside the rest of his fragmented Sith Empire, he would grow to become an asset to his people and an instrument in establishing the first Imperial Military.

# Part I
Odile Vaiken was part of The Exile fleet who were attempting to flee their old worlds after the fall of the Sith Empire.
The Galactic Republic and Jedi Order believed the Sith to be too much of a menace to remain as a functional society.
As a result, the Jedi Order took charge of a Republic Military campaign to eradicate the remnants of the Sith Empire after The Great Hyperspace War.
As a result, most Sith loyalists and Sith themselves would be forced to run from their homes in an attempt to escape the oncoming genocide.
Odile Vaiken, like many others, would be forced to flee from Korriban itself.
This would engrave a deep sense of patriotism in Vaiken.


The Exile fleet would have to undergo a 20 year drift through space before discovering Dromund Kaas, an ancient and forgotten Sith colony.
During this 20 year period, Odile Vaiken would distinguish himself as one of The Exile fleet’s most capable pilots and would learn much about naval techniques.
When the surviving Sith arrived at Dromund Kaas, the newly dubbed Sith Emperor, Darth Vitiate, would establish a Dark Council to rule in his place.
However, recognizing the capabilities of his non-force sensitive loyalists, the Emperor would name them Imperials in his newly formed Sith Empire and charge many of his Imperial loyalists with high ranking positions amongst the newly established Imperial Military.


One such recognised officer would be Odile Vaiken, while not yet a Grand Moff, the Emperor would charge Vaiken with bringing order to the new Imperial society.
As a result, Imperial society became extremely regimented and national service became part of normal life.
Under the supervision of Odile Vaiken the Imperial Army would become an extremely competent fighting force and would prove so during its successful campaigns on Dromund Kaas against the planetary wildlife and on campaigns against the surrounding planets of Dromund Kaas.


In his later life, Odile Vaiken would undertake the insurmountable task of establishing the Imperial Navy.
For his efforts he would be the first Imperial to be granted the honorary position of Grand Moff.
The newly minted Grand Moff Vaiken would die in 4904 BBY, upon the bridge of one of his greatest accomplishments, a Prototype Star Destroyer.
The same starship that would serve as the backbone of the Imperial Navy over 1000 years later.



# Part II
Grand Moff Vaiken was a particularly staunch patriot who was dedicated to the idea of taking revenge against the Republic for the genocide of his people.
He was entirely loyal to his Sith Overlords and dedicated the majority of his life to laying the foundations of what would become the Reconstituted Sith Empire.


Despite knowing he would never see or truly know if his ideas and efforts would ever achieve anything in the future, Odile Vaiken would still be a stalwart defender of Imperial society and be one of the few Imperials respected and recognised as truly beneficial by the Emperor and Dark Council.


Not only was Odile Vaiken a capable combatant on the ground, but he was a lethal starfighter pilot.
Regardless of his combat prowess, it would be his engineering skills and strategy efficiency that he would be remembered for, his ideas having lasted over a millenia and being an instrumental part of the Imperial Military doctrine.



# Part III
Grand Moff Vaiken would forever be remembered as the father of the Imperial Military.
It was his ideas and their implementation that shaped the prowess of the Imperial Military and also established the very nature in which Imperial society functions.


Odile Vaiken’s legacy would live on for centuries within the deep roots of Imperial society.
The largest Imperial space station would be named the Vaiken Spacedock and a memorial torch would remain constantly alight amongst the trees of the deep Dromund Kaas jungle.


It was a rumour amongst Imperial society that it was Grand Moff Vaiken who created Imperial Intelligence, but no real proof of this ever came to light.
Though very impressive if true and still a compliment towards the Grand Moff if not.
