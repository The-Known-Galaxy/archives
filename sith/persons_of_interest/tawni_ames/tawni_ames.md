# Biography

During the Clone Wars, Tawni Ames and her homeworld of Desix supported the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
When Senator Mina Bonteri of Onderon put forth a peace initiative between the Galactic Republic and the Separatist movement, Ames supported her.
Nevertheless, the treaty's revocation occurred due to the bombing of the Republic capital and the subsequent assassination of Bonteri.
This failure convinced Ames that the Republic never intended for the war to end, strengthening her faith in the Separatist Count Dooku's movement.
After the rise of the Empire, Ames led her planet into independence and refused to surrender to the first Imperial governor, Grotton.
She ordered her army to take him and his stormtrooper escort into custody, resulting in her kidnapping of Grotton.
When news of this reached Coruscant, Crosshair and Cody were sent to extract Grotton and restore Imperial order to Desix.
Despite Ames correctly guessing the mission's military nature, Crosshair and Cody were able to reach the Bell Tower where Ames was holding Grotton hostage.
Cody convinced Ames to release Grotton, but Grotton ordered Cody to execute Ames, which Crosshair did.
