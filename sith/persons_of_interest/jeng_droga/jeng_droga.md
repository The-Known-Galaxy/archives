# Biography
Being the most trusted out of the Hands, he oversaw any dangerous operations the Emperor partook in while being the captain of his master’s personal vessel, the Emperor’s Shadow.
Additionally, he shared a psychic link with Palpatine, a testament to his undying loyalty.
Still, he would be frequently exploited to do the Sith Lord’s bidding.
For example, Palpatine made his disillusioned servant accompany clones of himself on missions.
In 0 ABY, the Emperor demanded secrets of the dark side from undead Sith Lords, which aggravated them and, in response, threatened him.
Droga came to rescue his master, and they both returned to the Imperial Center on Coruscant.
Following the explosion of the second Death Star and the death of the Emperor, Droga felt immense pain for his master and delved into insanity, rampaging at his crew aboard the Emperor’s Shadow and causing the ship to crash into Kaal.
Unannounced to him, Palpatine’s spirit survived the calamity and fused with Droga, causing him to become even crazier with dark energy.
Grand Vizier Sate Pestage was able to subdue him by separating Palpatine into one of his clones.
The Emperor had fallen victim to another explosion in 10 ABY, this time aboard the dreadnought Eclipse, which forced him to possess another one of his clones.
However, Dark Side Adepts, Nefta and Sa-Di, previously loyal to the Emperor, sought to erase the remaining Palpatine clones and sabotaged the genetics of the last clone.
Requiring a new body, he planned to capture Anakin Solo, grandson of Darth Vader, in 11 ABY, which Droga advised against for his master’s safety.
Discovering another Hand, Sarcev Quest, was responsible for destroying Palpatine’s clones, Droga placed a 100,000-credit bounty on him in 23 ABY to finish him.
Meanwhile, the Emperor had seemingly been resurrected and controlled the second Imperium.
Loyal to his master until the end, Droga fought at the Third Battle of Yavin, only to learn of the treacherous, which was that the return of Palpatine was merely a hoax.
Droga became so deranged, causing him to carelessly engage the Jedi in battle and be killed by Jedi Battlemaster Kyle Katarn.
