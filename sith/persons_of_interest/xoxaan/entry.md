# Overview

XoXaan was one of the twelve Dark Jedi who were exiled to Korriban to pursue the ways of the Dark Side of the Force.
XoXaan served as a Sith Lord and Marchioness of Ajunta Pall’s new Sith Empire.
The reason for her death is unknown, but she kept her spirit inside her Holocron and taught A’Sharad Hett the philosophy of the Dark Side.

# History

Not much is known about XoXaan’s time in the Jedi Order, but it was said she was one of few members that disagreed with the philosophy of the Light Side of the Force due to it being an utter lie.
This discord, alongside her betrayal, got XoXaan exiled from the Jedi Order following the incidents of the Hundred-Year Darkness.
XoXaan, along with other Jedi Knights such as Ajunta Pall and Sorzus Syn, were exiled and arrived on the planet Korriban and named themselves the rulers of the planet.
After enslaving the native Sith species on Korriban, Ajunta Pall proclaimed himself as the supreme leader of his new Sith Empire.
XoXaan, along with other Sith Lords, were given the role of Pall’s Shadow Hands.
During her time in the Sith Empire, XoXaan developed and improved by far her healing abilities, acting as a healer in every war.
As well, she saved most of her knowledge in her Sith Holocron, alongside her own spirit.

Almost three thousand years later, after Ajunta Pall created his Empire, a bounty hunter known as A’Sharad Hett arrived on Korriban to kill his target, Resk.
XoXaan guided the former Jedi Master to her tomb because she sensed the darkness on the bounty hunter.
After entering her temple and tomb, Hett discovered XoXaan’s Holocron and opened it, releasing her spirit after activating the Holocron.
Although Hett only wanted to be a Sith Acolyte, XoXaan offered A’Sharad her teachings so he could reach his goals.
A’Sharad would then ascend to the rank of Dark Lord of the Sith after creating the One Sith through XoXaan’s teachings.
