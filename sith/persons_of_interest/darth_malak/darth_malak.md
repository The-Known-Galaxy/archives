# Introduction
Alek, a human male of Queliian descent, would escape his home planet after it would be ravaged and destroyed by the Mandalorians.
His life would be hard, he’d eventually succeed as a Dark Lord of the Sith, next to his comrade and master, Darth Revan.
However, Alek would begin his life on Dantooine being trained as a Jedi Padawan at the Jedi Enclave after the Galactic Republic had found him to be Force Sensitive.
Alek was nicknamed “Squint” by his mates in the Jedi Enclave, he found solace by befriending another Padawan who would soon be known as “Revan”.
Revan was known to be the stronger of the two, but Alek sought after knowledge rather than strength.
Both of them would receive the rank of Jedi Knight around the time of 3964 BBY.
Around the time they became Jedi Knights, the Mandalorian Wars had begun after the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders launched an attack against the Republic.
Jedi Master Draay had sent Alek to look for his Padawan, named Zayne Carrick.
After attempting to capture the Snivvian black marketeer, Marn Heirogryph, Carrick fell into the cityscape only to be rescued by Alek.
Alek attempted to recruit Carrick into the Revanchists after having a conversation about the ongoing Mandalorian Wars, however, the Padawan refused the invitation, he claimed that the Taris Jedi Masters believed the Sith were the Jedi’s business rather than the Mandalorians.
Carrick would be forced into hiding sometime later after the Jedi Masters on Taris had a vision from the Force of an upcoming Sith Lord within the Jedi Order, the Jedi Masters then murdered their Padawans to prevent the rise of the Sith Lord.
Carrick was framed for their murders, and was forced into hiding afterward.

# Section II
Revan and Malak traveled to a planet called Cathar, where the Mandalorians’ had devastated the entire planet and got rid of the Cathar people, Revan was trying to find proof of their destruction along with Alek.
A group of Jedi tracked and followed Revan, Malak, and the Revanchists to Cathar, and attempted to tell them to disperse as the Masters had believed the Mandalorians were no threat to the Jedi Order.
However, Revan, during the discussion, noticed a Mandalorian helmet underneath him and picked it up.
It turned out to be a female’s battle armor, and once some light struck the helmet, a vision was seen by all the Jedi in the vicinity describing the efforts that the Mandalorian female had made to stop her own people from slaughtering the people of Cathar.
She had tried to convince Cassus Fett, who led the attack on Cathar, to stop killing the Cathar people as they had already been defeated by the Mandalorians.
Cassus Fett refused, turning to the Mandalorian female and ordering his men to kill the remainder of the Cathar people and cause devastation to their planet, killing the Mandalorian female as well.
Revan made a promise to defeat the Mandalorians after witnessing the events that unfolded before all of their eyes.
However, even after witnessing the vision, the Jedi remained true to what the Jedi Masters had told them, still believing Malak and Revan were headed down the wrong path.
The Jedi Council allowed Revan, Malak, and the Revanchists, with the proof they had found, to participate in the Mandalorian Wars.
Both Revan and Malak were promoted to General.



# Section III
Many conflicts later, Revan and Malak were on a mission in the Unknown Regions, where they had possibly encountered the Dark Lord of the Sith, known only as the Sith Emperor, Darth Vitiate.
While there, the two Jedi, Malak and Revan were posing as mercenaries to learn whatever information about the Sith Emperor they could possibly learn.
They became quite knowledgeable in the fact that the Emperor was raising an army to invade the Republic once again, but they were led into a trap after agreeing to be snuck into the Imperial Citadel by an Imperial Guard, who was bound to the Emperor’s will.
Malak and Revan were overwhelmed by Vitiate’s power after attempting to take him on in a fight, The Emperor managed to break their wills and granted them both the title of “Darth”, successfully transferring them over to the Dark side of the Force.
Vitiate requested them to find the Rakatan Star Maps and locate the Star Forge.
In order to construct his Sith Armada in a timely manner, the Sith Emperor would use the Star Forge in order to do so.
However, the power and will of Revan and Malak were far greater than Vitiate had thought, in which they both began to believe they were acting on their own accords, and were able to block their memories of the Sith and the Emperor.
Revan and Malak found three additional Star Maps on the Sith tomb world of Korriban, the desolate desert planet Tatooine, and the Selkath’s oceanic homeplanet Manaan.
