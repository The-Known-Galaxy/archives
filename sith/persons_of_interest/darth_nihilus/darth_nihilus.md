# Introduction
Not much is known about the past life of this infamous Dark Lord of the Sith, only that he was present with his family on Malachor V during the final days of the Mandalorian Wars and that he was created as a result of the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator.
It is known that his family and many of his friends were present on Malachor V, suggesting that he lived there, though what became of Darth Nihilus after this event is well documented.

Considered by many as the most terrifying of all the Sith, Darth Nihilus is perhaps one of the most unique beings in galactic history, primarily being a dark side aberration fuelled by an unquenching hunger for life, Darth Nihilus’ very existence is considered an abomination, an entity that consumes all in his path regardless of its affiliations or nature.

# Part I
The being known as Darth Nihilus was created on Malachor V, when the planet was torn apart by the Mass Shadow Generator and all but a few survivors on the planet were left, the very hatred within Nihilus fuelled his will to survive.
So much so that he consumed the very life of many of his fellow survivors.
In those brief moments of consumption the pain and hatred for Nihilus had ceased, but he felt discomfort at what he had done.
Each time Nihilus consumed a living being his hunger grew more stronger and the pain grew larger, forcing Nihilus to consume life not as a desire, but as a necessity to feel what can only be described as relative comfort.

Nihilus would eventually be found by Darth Traya, once a Jedi Master and teacher of the legendary Jedi Knight Revan, Darth Traya recognised the potential of Nihilus and took him as an Apprentice within her Sith Academy.
Nihilus would rise throughout the ranks of Traya’s Sith Academy and become one of three ruling Sith within the now known Sith Triumvirate.


Despite having been dubbed a Dark Lord of the Sith, a Darth and a leader of the Sith Triumvirate, Nihilus held little regard for the teachings of the Sith or their philosophies, Nihilus would utilise the resources the Sith Triumvirate offered to achieve his only goal; to consume every living being in the galaxy.
Darth Nihilus would travel from planet to planet, consuming all life he could.



# Part II
Darth Nihilus alongside his fellow Triumvirate leader, Darth Sion, would betray their once Master Darth Traya.
Darth Nihilus personally severed Traya’s connection to the Force and fed upon her life essence, leaving her weakened and almost entirely stripped of her powers.
Once this was done Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion would commence a purge of the Jedi Order, while Darth Sion would use the conventional tactics of battle, Darth Nihilus carried out his part in the purge by consuming the lives of the Jedi he encountered.
Eventually as a result of their purge the Jedi Order had less than 100 survivors.


It was at this point Darth Nihilus’ body was essentially non-existent, he would go on to entirely encase his essence within his mask and robes.
His human form would fade away and he would exist merely as a presence of dark side energy.
He would now be considered a wound in the Force itself, often considered the dark side’s version of a Force ghost.



# Part III
Darth Nihilus would later be lured to the world of Katarr by Jedi Master Atris.
In an effort to stop Darth Nihilus numerous surviving Jedi including some of the remaining Jedi Council rallied to Katarr to prepare for battle, though when Darth Nihilus arrived there was no battle to be had.
When Darth Nihilus spoke his presence was so overwhelming it fed on everything on Katarr’s surface, the nature, the people, the Jedi survivors, everything save but one Miralukan; Visas Marr.


Visas Marr would be taken by Darth Nihilus as his Apprentice and Shadow Hand, their bond would be so strong that it would serve to strengthen each other in battle, it is theorised that despite Darth Nihilus no longer being of human nature, he still held emotions other than hate and pain due to this unique bond.
This bond can be compared to a Force bond like the one Meetra Surik and Traya shared.
It would be at this point that Darth Nihilus would reveal that he believed his hunger would provide order and stability to the galaxy, as during a Force vision shown to Visas Marr, Darth Nihilus envisioned a galaxy in which all beings were cut off from the Force and each other, Nihilus believed that this was true order.



# Part IV
So strong was Nihilus’ vision and his power in the Force that upon witnessing it, Visas Marr’s eyes were carved out of her head and her ability to see through the Force was greatly reduced.
Those in Nihilus’ presence were often in great pain but physically and mentally.
The slave crew he kept aboard his flagship the Ravager were consistently in agony, Visas Marr herself would beg Nihilus to be allowed to die in his presence, and his very hatred kept his flagship from falling apart, as it was a badly damaged cruiser from Malachor V.
These passive abilities only go to prove the true power this Sith Lord held, even unintentionally.


Darth Nihilus’ Sith Order became experts in hunting down not only Jedi, but Force users everywhere across the galaxy.
During Darth Nihilus’ life he would sense the Force and would use his hunger to destroy multiple planets.
While the ability to consume life on such a scale could not be taught, the ability to sense the Force could.
Darth Nihilus trained many Sith Assassins in his own ability to sense the Force and sent them into the galaxy on his behalf to do so.
For many of these Sith simply being in the presence of Nihilus would enhance their ability to detect the Force, this would make Darth Nihilus the greatest threat to the future of the Jedi Order and at the time, the greatest threat to the galaxy.



# Part V
Darth Nihilus would be defeated above Onderon, by the Jedi Meetra Surik, his ex-Apprentice Visas Marr and Mand’alor the Preserver.
The duel that took place seemed impossible due to Nihilus’ ability to drain the Force but the Jedi Meetra Surik had a similar ability, she was able to draw upon the Force of those around her and did so through her allies.
Visas Marr during the battle would offer her life so that Nihilus could be defeated and this particular show of devotion by one Nihilus had such a strong Force connection with stunned him long enough for Visas Marr to sever her connection with him, allowing the trio of allies to defeat Nihilus.
Despite him being defeated Darth Nihilus was never truly killed, his spirit remained attached to his mask and robes which were later buried on Korriban.
The combined dark side energy of Korriban and the spirit of Nihilus allowed him to remain as a Force essence on the planet for thousands of years.

The story of Darth Nihilus would be told for generations to come however it wasn’t until 137 ABY that he would yet again be encountered.
This time by Darth Krayt.
Darth Krayt wished to learn how he could prevent Yuuzhan Vong creatures from consuming his body, though in the fashion of Darth Nihilus, he simply spoke in his own language.
The spirits of two other Dark Lords were also present, Darth Bane and Darth Andeddu who both agreed with Darth Nihilus, seemingly understanding him; all three agreed Darth Krayt was unworthy of being called Sith.
This was the last interaction with Darth Nihilus recorded in galactic history.
