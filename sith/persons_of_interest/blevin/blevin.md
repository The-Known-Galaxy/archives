# Overview:
Blevin was a human male who served the Galactic Empire as a Lieutenant-supervisor of the Imperial Security Bureau.
He was informed about the incident on Ferri, involving Cassian Andor, and reported the incident in an ISB meeting led by Major Partagaz.
Blevin was a skilled agent, and was entrusted with supervising six different Imperial sectors.
He was viewed as a very capable member of the ISB by Partagaz.
During the meeting, Blevin informed Partagaz of the lack of ability the corporate security showed during the incident.
Afterward, Blevin went to investigate what really happened on Ferrix and who was behind it.
He made his way to corporate security headquarters on Morlana One.
He pulled aside the Chief Inspector, Deputy Inspector and the Sergeant co-led the team.
Blevin informed them that they would be transferred and they were forced to hand over all their corporate security items.
The newly appointed ISB Lieutenant-supervisor, Deedra Meero, heard about this incident and thought that the Starpath unit recovered on Ferrix was linked to the stolen one from the Steergard Naval Yard, which was a sector of hers.
Deedra requested all information on the Ferrix incident, but Blevin denied it.
Deedra tried convincing Blevin to allow her the information but he kept denying it, so she went to Partagaz.
Blevin, Deedra, and Partgaz all met in the meeting chambers.
Blevin and Deedra argued about the incident on Ferrix until Partagaz concluded it by saying Blevin had authority over Ferrix and then dismissed Blevin.
