# Overview

Arguably one of the most renowned and distained individuals to ever live, Revan was known to many names.
The Revanchist, honored as the Revan, reviled as Revan the Butcher, dreaded as Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Revan, and praised as the Prodigal Knight.
Revan was once one of the most important people in the galaxy for both Jedi and Sith, who took a prestigious and essential part in the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War.

# Life and Conflict

Revan was born on the Outer Rim sometime during the year 3994 BBY, joining the Jedi Order and training under a subsequent number of Jedi Masters as a Jedi Padawan.
Few of these notables would be Jedi Master & Historian Kreia, who would have a profound impact on his philosophy and ideas as a Jedi.
He would later meet a fellow Jedi student and aspirant named Alek, quickly becoming very close friends and even confidants.
He would soon become a Jedi Knight and also become one of its most vocal and charismatic members as a very outstanding critic of the Jedi Order’s inactivity and relative isolation from the Galactic Republic’s conflict in the Mandalorian Wars against the Mandalorian clans.

In opposition and defiance of the Jedi Council, he would take up the name Revan and don the mask of a fallen Mandalorian who opposed Cassus Fett’s genocide, leading the Revanchists in aiding the Republic’s military arm subsequently being appointed Supreme Commander.
He would be a renowned tactician, strategically outweighing the brutal offensives of his adversary, Mandalore the Ultimate.
Eventually, he would lure the Mandalorian forces into a decisive battle off the planet of Malachor V in 3960 BBY, slaying Mandalore the Ultimate aboard his ship and destroying the Mandalorians with the Mass Shadow Generator.
This victory would leave him in disdain and he with his friend Alek, now known as Malak, would venture to the Unknown Regions in search of the True Sith upon which they would discover the Sith Emperor and his remade Sith Empire, who would turn them to the Dark Side of the Force converting them into new Dark Lords of the Sith, Darth Revan, and Darth Malak.

The new Sith Lords would begin their sweeping conquests unto the Republic, eventually breaking free of the Emperor’s control over their minds and seizing the Star Forge; an ancient superweapon made by the Rakata fueled by the Dark Side which allows for the production of an armada of ships and weapons, Revan and Malak would ignite the Jedi Civil War with their advances unto the Republic which at its climax, would result in Malak’s betrayal against Revan and Revan’s subsequent capture by Jedi Knight Bastilla Shan, who would form a Force bond with her captive.

# Rebirth and Death

With his memory gone and erased, Revan would be given the identity of a Republic soldier on board the ship Endar Spire, which would soon find itself under attack by Revan’s former apprentice, Darth Malak.
Malak’s attack on Taris would be an attempt to capture Bastilla Shan however to no avail.
Revan and his companions along with Republic officer Carth Onasi would find Shan and escape Taris successfully before Malak could level the surface of the planet.

Upon escaping Taris, Revan and his companions would head to Dantooine, retraining as a Jedi Padawan within the Jedi Enclave there.
He would be tasked with locating the Star Maps, ancient relics made by the Rakata to illustrate the path to the Star Forge.
However, soon Malak would capture the group and reveal Revan’s true identity, as well as take Shan captive.
This would force Revan and his companions to locate the Star Forge by themselves which would be successful.
Aboard the Star Forge, Revan would confront a corrupted Shan and bring her back to the Light Side of the Force, revealing his love for her and successfully defeating Malak.
This would earn Revan the Cross of Glory and the title of Prodigal Knight.

Revan would marry Shan and live a life of relative obscurity hidden for several years until his memories would return to him prompting him to leave his wife and unborn child behind to once again begin his search in the Unknown Regions.

The Sith would capture and hold him imprisoned for three years until his former lieutenant and unofficial apprentice, Meetra Surik, would break him free with the help of the Sith Lord, Scourge.
Their attempt to kill the Sith Emperor would fail and he would be kept under constant torture for three hundred long years until he would be freed by Republic forces.
With this, he would take control of a Rakatan Foundry, building an army of extermination droids to end the Sith Empire once and for all, before he was promptly killed by an Imperial strike team.

# Revenge and Legacy

Despite his death, Revan persisted.
His torture at the hands of the Sith Emperor during those three hundred years would shatter and split his mind into two, the Light Side of Revan would try to be one with the Force, however, his Dark Side would stubbornly resist clinging on to life as he rejected and cheated death fully embracing the Dark Side of the Force.
He would take control over the Revanites or the Order of Revan, with the goal of ending the Sith Empire and bringing back the Sith Emperor into a physical form to kill him.
Seeing the possibilities of this cataclysmic plan, the Republic and the Empire would join forces to stop Revan and his Order, with the Light Side also taking part in the coalition as it wished to acclimate to the Cosmic Force.
The Sith Emperor would regain his strength, and the two halves of Revan would merge into one; dying one last death.

```
Revan’s spirit continued to aid the struggle against the Sith Emperor which would in the end succeed once and for all, ending the turmoil and allowing for Revan to be one with the Force.
```

His legacy would not end there, as subsequent Sith Lords such as Darth Rivan; a mistranslation of his name would attempt to take up his mold, and Darth Bane would travel to the planet of Lehon in seeking out Revan’s holocron, which would become fundamental to his development of the Rule of Two.
