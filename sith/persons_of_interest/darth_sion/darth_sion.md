# Introduction
The Lord of Pain, otherwise known as Darth Sion, was a human Sith Lord who lived during the Old Sith Wars around 4000 BBY.
Darth Sion in his later years would become a part of the most feared group of Sith known as the Sith Triumvirate, which consisted of Darth Nihilus, Darth Traya, and Sion himself.
Sion had been susceptible to pain and infirmity for a long time as any other person, but he chose to use his pain as his uniqueness among other Sith Lords, becoming the Lord of Pain.
Sion would begin as a Sith Marauder in Exar Kun’s Sith Empire in 3996 BBY.
Sion sought out death, seeking to fight every Jedi he’d seen, but surviving each encounter.
His mindset changed until he believed he was immortal, building a greater and greater tolerance for pain.
Sion eventually received a blow that struck him down, but instead of receiving the face of death, the pain inside of him welled up to agonizing levels, driving Sion to strike down his aggressor with all of his hatred and anger.
With his body decomposing, he held it together using the dark side of the Force.
This process caused excruciating pain which fueled his anger even more.
Exar Kun ended up losing the war, however, Sion would survive the fall of his Empire.

# Section II
Under a new Empire created by Darth Revan, Sion emerged a new Sith Lord, along with Darth Malak, Revan’s apprentice.
However, the next few years would be dangerous, Sion saw Revan as a traitor for succumbing to the Jedi Council and turning back to the Light.
Malak was killed by his old master, and with his death, came the fall of the Empire.
The Lord of Pain would watch as the Sith turned against each other one by one while he was in the Academy on Korriban.
Many Sith Lords declared themselves Warlords as the Empire fell apart, claiming their own domains and slaughtering old comrades.
Others would flee to the unknown regions of the galaxy.



# Section III
Many other Sith Lords that remained in the galaxy would eventually come together, including Revan’s former Jedi Master, Kreia, otherwise known as Darth Traya now.
In an attempt to find new Sith Lords to assist her in her goals, she had come across Sion and another Sith Lord: Darth Nihilus, the Lord of Hunger.
Sion, Traya, and Nihilus would form a Sith Triumvirate secretly, which began on Malachor V, they sought the annihilation of the Jedi Order and wanted to bring back the Sith Order into the power it once held in the galaxy.
Sion learned much from Traya, in which she was clearly the more powerful of the two.
However, there began a new conflict among the three Sith Lords, they grew discontent with Traya, they began getting stronger than her.
Eventually, Sion and Nihilus would conspire against Traya, seeking to get rid of her from their future endeavors.
Sion and Nihilus closed in on Traya as she was meditating in the core of the Academy, Sion beat her mercilessly and the two Sith Lords sapped her energy before Nihilus eventually severed her connection to the Force, leaving her an outcast.
Sion began his killing spree of Jedi, he would be killed many times in the process, returning from death and slaughtering more.
The Jedi would remain almost completely extinct after the two Sith Lords claimed their stake on the galaxy.
Eventually, around 3954 BBY, Sion and Nihilus would unify the remnants of the old Empire, creating and becoming the most unified force of Sith in their lives.
In 3952 BBY, Nihilus would attack a Conclave of Jedi on Katarr, slaughtering the remainder of the surviving Jedi.
In order to escape Nihilus and Sion, the Jedi Order disbanded and went into hiding to escape Sion’s Assassins.
In order to find Sion, a Jedi Master by the name of Lonna Vash came to the Academy on Korriban, but fell into a trap and was imprisoned by Sion in the abandoned Sith Academy.



# Section IV
Sion returned to Malachor V, soon joined by Kreia, who now reclaimed her previous title of Darth Traya.
Traya betrayed Meetra Surik, and also led Darth Nihilus to his death.
After eliminating the remainder of Sion’s assassins, Traya joined Sion in the Trayus Core.
Sion made threats with Traya, exclaiming he’d kill her, but Traya ordered Sion to treat Surik with every amount of respect that she deserved once she arrived at the academy.
After fighting and killing most of the Sith forces throughout the abandoned academy, Surik managed to come face to face with Sion at last.
Sion warned Surik to leave, knowing that if she attempted to attack, Traya would strike her and break her just like she had done to Sion.
At last, Surik and Sion fought, but with the power of Malachor inside of Sion, he kept rising again after being struck down.
He fell once again after another fight, but Surik tried to convince Sion that Kreia was using him, that Kreia did not respect him, and was using him as a tool for her own benefit.
Sion kept fighting, knowing if he won, Traya would have to complete Sion’s training as her true apprentice, but Sion knew that Surik was a powerful enemy.
Traya was an interesting Sith who admired and respected those who could let go of the Force, but not Sion, who relied on his connection to bring him back from death.
As he accepted death, he warned Surik that Traya would break her, and that Surik was Traya’s weakness.
Sion then allowed himself to let go of the Force at last, leaving the living world behind and becoming one with the Force.
