# Biography
Bendu was an individual who represented the equilibrium between the light and dark side of the Force.
Residing on the planet Atollon, Bendu was a large creature of unknown origin who advocated for neutrality, believing that he should not directly involve himself with conflicts.
He did not concern himself with directly influencing Jedi or Sith ideals, and rather just assisted any force-sensitives by providing them with guidance and wisdom.
This is demonstrated with his actions towards Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus and his Padawan Erza Bridger, guiding them onto the path of success.

# Mentoring the rebels
Bendu was awoken on Atollon after years by Kanan’s imbalance and stress from the thought of Erza turning to the dark side.
After losing his sight to Maul in the Mission of Malachor, Kanan Jarrus was given knowledge by Bendu on how to use his other sensory abilities to replicate his vision.
To assist Kanan with his sight, Bendu had him confront multiple krykna, which were spider-like predators native to Atollon.
Kanan’s fear caused creatures to attack violently, but after careful concentration he was able to subdue and befriend them.


Bendu also served as a guide to Erza Bridger on multiple occasions, providing him with a warning of the consequences of converging a Jedi and Sith holocron.
The quest he sent both the Jedi Knight and his Padawan on to retrieve the Sith holocron from the caves allowed them to bond further, teaching Erza to forgive himself and to make peace.



# Personality and abilities
Although Bendu maintained his composure and generally expressed insightful advice, he could have regular emotions which was shown by his anger towards Jarrus for calling him a coward.
This was in reference to Grand Admiral Thrawn’s attack on Atollon, where Jarrus pleaded for his assistance where Bendu initially refused.
Bendu also believed that only the individual was capable of change, and objects like Holocrons could not influence one towards good or evil.


Bendu possessed the ability to sense nearby Force wielders, and could teleport himself at will across the entirety of Atollon.
Manipulating lightning strikes was also extremely easy for Bendu, as he used it to destroy multiple AT-AT walkers.
He is not invulnerable however, as cannon fire from walkers was able to subdue him on the ground.
Bendu could also predict events like Thrawn’s defeat at the hand of Erza Bridger on Lothal.
