# Overview

During the New Sith Wars, Darth Rivan, a male Zelosian, served as a sith Lord.
He adopted this Sith moniker after reading a tainted Sith document that misidentified Rivan as Darth Revan, the Dark Lord of the Sith who reigned during the Jedi Civil Wars.

# Biography

Despite Almas' hostile atmosphere, Darth Rivan visited the unexplored Cularin system during the New Sith Wars and made it his home.
He constructed a castle there with the intention of exploring the dark side's mysteries.
But creating Sith battlelords was really Rivan's motivation for building the fort.
Rivan's vision for this elite new corps was rooted in the dark side's fundamentally conflictual character.
Every time a large group of Darksiders got together, some of them would either perish or turn against one another.
Darksiders did not value enlightened inter-cooperation as a virtue.
It became Rivan's goal to eradicate disobedience among the Sith, and he designed the battlelord to do just that.
If a soldier attempted to harm their commander, the intended wound would instead be inflicted upon the soldier, thanks to the battlelord's Force bonding capabilities.

The Darkstaff, a potent artefact that can sap the Force-essence from a living thing, was a weapon that Darth Rivan was renowned for using.
In order to change the planet's surface and climate and make it breathable, Darth Rivan also invented the Kaluthin grass.
Almas was transformed by the Kaluthin into a garden-like environment, but it would never have an entirely pure atmosphere because they were unable to get rid of the toxic local gases.

Before the year 1250 BBY, Rivan spent many years residing in Almas before the Jedi Knights forced him to leave.
Rivan's fortress was completely destroyed by the Jedi during the Battle of Almas, although the blaster-proof core tower managed to withstand the attack.

It became clear in the end that Rivan's attempt to achieve physical immortality was never fully successful.
Initially, it was thought that Darth Rivan, who had been forced off Almas by a tremendous Jedi/Republic assault, had narrowly averted death before being betrayed by a fellow Sithâ€”specifically, his own apprentice, Darsin.

However, in reality, Darsin was left behind by Rivan when he left the citadel, and Darsin passed away before Rivan, his body having been altered by Rivan's alchemies to create a slave Force spirit.
When the Jedi Army of Light and the Sith Brotherhood of Darkness clashed several millennia later, Rivan was able to use the Darkstaff's strength to summon a Force storm that carried him through time and space to the planet Ruusan.

# Power and abilities

The ability of Rivan to create the Sith battlelords was well known.
Rivan's fortress is a testament to how hard he worked at taming the evil side.
The Kaluthin grass, which Rivan developed to make the atmosphere of the planet Almas breathable, is his most notable invention.
