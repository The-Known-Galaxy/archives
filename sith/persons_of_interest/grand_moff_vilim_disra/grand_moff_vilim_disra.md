# Overview
Vilim Disra, a Human male politician, held significant positions within the Imperial Remnant.
By 19 ABY, he served as the Grand Moff and was responsible for the Braxant sector.
Additionally, Disra held a seat in the Council of Moffs.
Interestingly, he formed a secret triumvirate consisting of himself, Grodin Tierce (formerly an Emperor's Royal Guard Major), and a con-artist named Flim.
This alliance aimed to create internal conflict within the New Republic by exploiting the Bothan's involvement in the Caamas Document issue.
Their goal was to prevent Fleet Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, the Supreme Commander at the time, from achieving a successful peace agreement with the New Republic.
Prior to this, Disra had been a member of the Central Committee of Grand Moffs, supporting Trioculus's claim to the Imperial throne.

# Value
Vilim Disra embarked on his career as the Chief Administrator of the Shelsha sector.
In 3 BBY, he served under Governor Barshnis Choard but eventually betrayed him when Choard sought to secede from the Galactic Empire.
Disra collaborated with Choard and a mercenary named Caaldra to unite pirate gangs under the BloodScars and prepare them to target specific Imperial installations.
He also feigned allegiance with the Rebel Alliance, promising their assistance in defending Shelsha.
However, Disra had ulterior motives and planned to betray Choard, Caaldra, and the Rebels.
He orchestrated events to have Choard captured by Darth Vader and positioned himself as a hero to the Empire.
Disra's plan succeeded, but Emperor Palpatine refused to grant him the governorship of Shelsha.
In the post-Endor period, Disra was initially a member of the Central Committee of Grand Moffs but was subsequently demoted, possibly for supporting Bertroff Hissa and Trioculus.
He played a role in the assassination of Grand Admiral Rufaan Tigellinus, enabling him to secure a position on the Committee.
By 11 ABY, Disra began searching for someone to successfully impersonate Thrawn as part of his plan to overthrow the New Republic.
By 19 ABY, he had become one of the eight members of the Council of Moffs.
During the Caamas Document Crisis, Disra hired the con artist Flim to portray Grand Admiral Thrawn, forming a triumvirate with Major Grodin Tierce to consolidate Imperial military power.
Under Disra's nominal leadership, they devised a plan to sabotage Bothawui's planetary shield and manipulated tensions arising from the discovery of a datacard implicating the Bothans in the Caamas bombardment.
Disra also enlisted pirate gangs, particularly Captain Zothip's Cavrilhu gang, to attack New Republic convoys.
Disra used the pirates as pawns to deplete the New Republic's resources while gaining Preybird-class starfighters in return.
However, Disra's control over the triumvirate was limited, as Tierce manipulated the group from the beginning.
Disra intended to betray Tierce and Flim, but Tierce had already uncovered Disra's plan.
As conflict escalated over Bothawui, it was revealed that Tierce was an unstable clone.
Talon Karrde provided information that exposed Disra's scheme, resulting in his arrest on charges of treason.
Ephin Sarreti replaced Disra on the Council of Moffs.
