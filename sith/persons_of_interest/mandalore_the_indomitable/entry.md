# Overview

As his name suggests, Mandalore the Indomitable was a Mandalorian Taung male who led the Mandalorian Crusaders after his ascension to Mand’alor before 4000 BBY.
He and the Mandalorian Crusaders followed Ulic Qel-Droma’s will after Mandalore the Indomitable was defeated by the Sith Lord.
The loyal Mand’alor died in the Battle of Onderon during the Great Sith War.

# Serving under Lord Qel-Droma

Ulic Qel-Droma acted as a ‘commander’ of the Mand’alor and his crusaders.
The reason for this dates back to 3996 BBY when Ulic Qel-Droma challenged the Indomitable to a fight.
The Sith Lord told the Mand’alor that if he lost, he and his crusaders would have to swear loyalty to him and the Dark Lord of the Sith.
This fight took place on the planet Kuar, and unfortunately for the Indomitable, Qel-Droma had beat him.
Mandalore offered Qel-Droma to kill him and his forces, but Qel-Droma refused.
Instead, he and his crusaders would have to work for him and his army.
Mandalore the Indomitable was, in fact, devoted to Ulic Qel-Droma’s will.
He helped the Sith Lord many times by rallying his forces in many engagements.
However, his loyalty was put to test after his commander was captured by a group of Jedi during a battle in Coruscant.
At first, Mandalorians and another group known as Krath were informed about Lord Qel-Droma’s death after they reunited, but this was false.
Ulic Qel-Droma was going through a trial organized by the Galactic Senate for his crimes against the whole galaxy.
While this trial was ongoing, Mandalore the Indomitable and Exar Kun united forces and went against the Senate to rescue Qel-Droma.
After clearing the trial chambers thanks to Exar Kun’s Sith Magic and Massassi warriors, the Mand’alor spoke to his commander by asking him to forgive him for taking too long.
Ulic was mostly surprised by how devoted Mandalore the Indomitable was.
After this event occurred, Mandalore the Indomitable was given a new task; invade Oderon.

# Death

During the Battle of Onderon, Mandalorian the Indomitable and his crusaders were ordered to capture the Royal Palace of said planet.
This was a hard task as the rulers of Onderon, Queen Galia and Oron Kira, unleashed the Beast Riders.
Although the Mandalorian forces were too powerful, they could not manage the Republic and Onderon team.
Realizing the battle was over for him, Mandalore the Indomitable ordered his crusaders to move to Dxun’s moon for safety.
However, the Beast Riders kept chasing him until they found the Mandalorian alone and with no support.
Although he was ready to fight the Beast Riders by himself, he was overwhelmed and killed by them.
