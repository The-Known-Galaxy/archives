# Overview

Darth Zannah, formerly known as “Rain” during her childhood, was a Sith Lord originating from the planet Somov Rit.
Zannah began her apprenticeship and journey to the Dark Side under the only remaining Dark Lord of the Sith from the New Sith Wars, Darth Bane.
Instituting the Rule of Two, Darth Zannah was the first to initiate this rule under Bane and an important figure to carry this rule out.
A skilled duelist and practitioner of Soresu while utilizing a double-bladed lightsaber, her strongest aspect was her usage of Sith Magic and Alchemy, becoming one of the strongest Sorcerers in Sith history.
She’d equal Bane in strength and become his successor after their final duel on Ambria.

# History

Currently known as “Rain” in her youth, Rain possessed no signs of force aptitude, however, was recruited along with her Cousins to combat the Sith after manipulating (with assistance) The Force around her.
As the battle raged on Ruusan, Rain’s starship was attacked by Sith Forces causing her to be lost in the forest below.
She’d befriend a “Green-Furred Bouncer” named Laa.
Laa would be killed by Jedi Scouts, inducing Rain into a rage and killing them both; Darth Bane would take notice of Rain's display of anger and potential and take her as his Apprentice.
Rain would then embrace her name of birth, Zannah, as everyone that knew her as Rain were all dead.

Zannah would be taken to the planet of Ambria to start her preliminary training, which involved ancient Sith magic that Zannah would grow incredibly prestigious in.
She’d undergo numerous missions under Bane such as: manipulating the terrorist Anti-Republic Liberation Front (where she’d use the name “Rainah”)  into a botched kidnapping attempt on former Supreme Chancellor Tarsus Valorum to further incite Anarchist movements, recovering information about the origins and creation of holocrons., as well as infiltrating the Jedi Temple archives on Coruscant to obtain information about the orbalisk creatures.
During this mission, her presence would be revealed and she’d flee to Tython where Bane would await her.
The Sith Lords were pursued and outnumbered by the Jedi, ultimately the numbers would prove to be futile as they were Slain.

The Sith relocated to Ciutric IV, and over the course of ten years, Zannah grew to be an accomplished Sith sorceress who equaled Darth Bane in strength.
Under Bane she had greatly increased her power in every aspect, she wielded a Double-bladed lightsaber primarily using Form III (Soresu) and was extremely versed and powerful in Sith Magic and Alchemy.
She now found an apprentice of her own, Set Harth, replaced later by Darth Cognus and Zannah’s eventual successor.
Bane and Zannah had their first duel end in a stalemate, due to the collapsing of a passageway in Stone Prison.
However, their final encounter would be on the planet Ambria where her training had begun.
Bane was defeated in their duel and in a last ditch effort, used Essence Transfer into Zannahs body where they’d now fight a battle of wills.
She’d become victorious and banish his spirit into the Void of The Force.
Darth Zannah would successfully go on to continue and enforce the Rule of Two, with her Apprentice Darth Cognus succeeding and continuing it further where it’d be firmly established for many Millennia to come.
