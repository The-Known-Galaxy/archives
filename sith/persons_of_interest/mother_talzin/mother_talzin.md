# Introduction |
Mother Talzin was the leader of a Nightsister clan on Dathomir, living from the end of the Old Republic until the Clone Wars.
She has come into conflict with the Sith Order on numerous occasions, varying between friend and foe.
She is also extremely strong in the force, her Nightsister Magicks allowing her to rival the power of the Sith Emperor, Darth Sidious.

# History |
Around the end of the Old Republic, Talzin was born into a Nightsister Clan and continued to live for hundreds of years, serving as a spiritual guide to her sisters.
In 54BBY, she gave birth to her first son who was known as Maul.
Over the years, she gave birth to two other sons; Savage Opress and Feral.
One day, a man known as Darth Sidious visited the planet, as her dark side abilities had caught his eye.
The two talked and intermingled their differing abilities, Talzin showing off her magic while Sidious displayed his knowledge of the dark side of the force, He then claimed that he would take on Talzin as his apprentice but he instead abducted her son, Maul after sensing his potential for the dark side.

Ever since that day, Talzin wished to take revenge on Palpatine but decided to lead her clan in the meantime.
Her opportunity for revenge eventually came in the form of Asajj Ventress, a Dark Jedi Assassin who was originally a member of her Nightsister clan and was sold into slavery to protect the clan.
After taking her back in and healing her, she discovered that Ventress had been betrayed by her master, the Sith known as Count Dooku also known as the apprentice of Darth Sidious.
Using this to her advantage, Talzin plotted a scheme to kill Count Dooku.


Firstly, she sent Ventress and two other Nightsisters to attack Dooku’s castle on Serreno, having them disguised as Jedi.
They were not meant to kill him, but instead strike fear in him so that he’d desperately look for an apprentice.
With the plan going successfully, she meets with Dooku to negotiate; giving him a new apprentice.
After Ventress hosted a trial between the Nightbrothers of Dathomir to decide on the apprentice, they selected her middle child; Savage Opress.
They enchanted Savage with enhanced strength and delivered him to Dooku, waiting until the right moment to have him strike.
The scheme eventually failed whenever Savage betrayed both Dooku and Ventress, the two Dathomirians retreating from Dooku’s ship.

Savage returned to Talzin injured.
She then gave him a mystic amulet to help him find his brother Maul, who had been supposedly killed after a duel with the Jedi on Naboo.
While Savage was on his journey, Ventress returned to the planet as well and she was given a proper baptism to make her a true Nightsister.
They celebrated the ceremony afterward, but the planet was suddenly attacked by the Separatists that serve Dooku.
As the Nightsisters battled to protect Ventress and their clan, Mother Talzin visited Old Daka, another sorceress in the clan to summon the undead sisters.
As her followers forced the Separatists back, Talzin used a lock of Dooku’s hair she had previously obtained to perform a voodoo ritual upon him for insurance.
Eventually, the Separatist leader, General Grievous broke through the defenses of the Nightsisters and breached Old Daka’s hidden room, killing the sorceress and forcing Talzin into retreat.
Nearly all of the Nightsisters were massacred, apart from Ventress and a few others.

Savage Opress returned to the planet with a deranged Maul in hand.
She met with her son and took him to an altar to heal Maul, explaining the tragedy that had taken place.
Luring him to the altar, she incapacitated Maul and performed a ritual to cleanse his mind of corruption and give him better cybernetic legs.
Once her job was done, she vanished into the aether to continue her work.

She started working with the Fangrawl Cult of Bardotta, assuming the role of ‘The Great Mother’.
She plotted a scheme to harvest the living force from the Daogoyan Masters in order to give herself a stronger connection to the force, as the Bardottan people are strongly connected to the living force.
She met with her followers on the moon of Zardossa Stix to perform a ritual involving the Bardottan Queen Julia, extracting her living force to give her unlimited power.
This ritual was disrupted by Jedi Master Mace Windu and Junior Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar Binks.
During the ritual, the crystal ball containing the living force of the Dagoyan Masters was shattered and unleashed a massive explosion which resulted in Mother Talzin’s physical form becoming compromised and vanishing.

Mother Talzin’s final scheme took place when she informed Maul that he was being used by Darth Sidious to track her down.
Maul followed her orders and eventually found Count Dooku, bringing the Sith Lord to Dathomi and forcing him into a ritual where his body was sacrificed to Talzin to possess.
While the ritual took place, both General Grievous and Darth Sidious arrived on the planet.
Maul dueled Grievous while Sidious fought the possessed Dooku.
Talzin soon left his body as she had attained her full strength again, engaging Sidious in a duel of force lightning.
Once recovered, Dooku assisted his master in fighting her and after saving Maul’s life, Mother Talzin grew weak which allowed General Grievous to bypass her forcefield and strike the witch down.
