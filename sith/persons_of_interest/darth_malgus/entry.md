# Overview

Darth Malgus was born with the name Veradun on a system under the rule of the Sith Empire, raised by his adoptive father.
He would become prominent as a Sith Lord who served within the Empire during the times of the Great Galactic War all the way to the Third Galactic War.

# History and Conflict

Darkness would be imbued into Veradun from a young age, killing his Twi’lek servant in his father’s estate.
This prompt incident would reveal his sensitivity to the Force and he would subsequently be taken to the Sith Academy in the Empire's capital of Dromund Kaas to study the ways of the Sith, becoming a successful Sith Warrior and a commander of the Imperial Military.
In his venture to the planet of Geonosis, he would discover a Twi’lek slave by the name of Eleena Daru.
His affections would take hold as he would fall in love with her despite her being subservient to him.
He would take her in, as they fought together in many battles across the Great Galactic War with the Republic.

```
He would take up the name Darth Malgus doing away with his former name and thus his former self.
```

He would take part in the Sith recapture of the planet of Korriban,
a planet bearing much importance to the Sith.
În this battle he would battle Jedi Master Kao Cen Daragh, who would gravely wound his own master, Darth Vindican.
Master Kao Cen Daragh’s apprentice, the future Grandmaster Satele Shan would escape from the battle in the Ebon Hawk.
As his master Darth Vindican lay injured, Malgus would kill him in a single stroke.
At the pinnacle times of the conflict, Darth Malgus would lead the sudden strike unto the Republic’s core world of Alderaan, where Republic forces would match his in a sudden ambush on the planet’s surface, ensuing a great battle.
In this battle, he would once again meet Satele Shan, his archnemesis from Korriban.
He would be severely injured from the battle forcing him to wear a respirator permanently.
By 3653 BBY, the Empire would enter peace talks and negotiations, in truth, however, these were nothing more but mere lies to lower the Republic’s guard and allow for the Sith to bring their plan to fruition; the capture of the Republic’s capital of Coruscant.

# Fruition & Betrayal

Darth Angral would select Darth Malgus as the commander of the Sith strike force that would begin their attack upon the capital, taking charge of the initial spearhead of Sith forces unto Coruscant.
His sudden attack upon the Jedi Temple on Coruscant would force the Jedi into a pinpoint, eventually losing the Sith as they are overcome by their numbers and surprise advantage.
Malgus himself would be successful in killing scores of Jedi defenders, the most reputable of whom would be Jedi Master Ven Zallow, renowned as Malgus’ most prestigious kill.
With this, the Sith armada would arrive and level the planet’s surface bringing chaos and pandemonium to Coruscant itself.

```
This sudden strike upon the capital of the Republic itself would leave it humiliated and its forces off-guard and without morale, as the Jedi Order themselves are left in utter chaos with their Temple on the capitol destroyed, most of the Jedi High Council killed and the Senate effectively rifted with the Order, with their reputation not recovering for some time.
```

Malgus believed that the Imperial Armada would use this advantage to level the world itself to decimation and desecrate the capital of the Republic; however, the Empire only used this victory to ensure peace negotiations in Alderaan.
This disappointed Malgus, however, he would be given command over the Sith’s orbital security ensuring the occupation on the planet.

```
The Sith Lord defied his superiors, instead, choosing to go after a renegade Jedi Aryn Leneer, apprentice of his prized kill, Master Ven Zallow.
```

Leneer’s attempts to kill Malgus would not come into fruition, however, this then instigated distrust and soon dread against the Empire within Malgus, who would begin to disagree with Imperial policies and its adherence to the true ways of the Sith.
He also began to see his affections with Daru as a weakness to himself, an obstacle to ascension.
He kills his Twi’lek lover as a result and utilizes his power and position to ‘cleanse’ the Empire of politicians and bureaucrats whom he blames for the failure of allowing the Republic to retain its sovereignty.

Malgus continued on to gain command over the Sith forces tasked with expansion into the Unknown Regions, capturing and conquering territories unknown to the Empire’s boundaries.
Soon after, the presumed death of the Sith Emperor and with his ascension to the Dark Council, he declared his own Sith Order in opposition to the former hierarchy; an Order free of the Dark Council.
This of course never passed as he would be defeated by both the Republic and the Empire.

```
He then serves under Emperor Vowrawn’s Sith Empire in their Third Galactic War, participating in the Invasion of Ossus as a military commander.
```

Due to his distrust and the attack on the Meridian Complex, Malgus soon went rogue against the Empire, aiming to break his limitations and attain acclimation.
