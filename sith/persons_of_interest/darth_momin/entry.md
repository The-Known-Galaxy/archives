# Early years

Darth Momin, or simply Momin, was a Force-sensitive dark side scholar, sculptor and Sith Lord who from a young age found out about his abilities and connection to the Force, he would use his Force abilities for the creation of sculptures which would make his name known in the galaxy.
Momin’s principles at a young age were based on the belief that fear and pain were the only true and pure emotions in the galaxy.
These principles were reflected in his sculptures; he believed that his creations were only a success when people were horrified or afraid when viewing his sculptures; otherwise, he had created nothing.
These sculptures soon got him arrested and locked away.

Momin was freed by Darth Shaa whilst locked away; Darth Shaa took him up as her apprentice and taught him about the dark side of the Force, along with giving him a pair of lightsabers which he used to sculpt his mask, as well as sculpturing and disfiguring his face before wearing the mask.
He acquired the title of Darth during his training and learned a lot about his true self with the freedom he now had, he had however decided to kill his master as he found the title of apprentice and having to call her ‘Master’ to be offensive and thus disposed of her.
After the death of his master, he continued gaining knowledge about the dark side of the Force and the Sith through his own research.

# Superweapon

Darth Momin would never take it upon himself to have an apprentice; Instead, he pursued knowledge on his own and wished to create works of art that would satisfy only the dark side of the Force itself.
Through the knowledge gained from his research, the visiting of many sites, the addition of listening to the Force, he believed that his work of art would be a city.
For this, Momin would create an engine with his followers and acolytes; they constructed a superweapon powerful enough to obliterate cities.
He wanted to create a work of art by using the Force in unity with the engine to freeze time and capture the fear and pain to be the expression of all its inhabitants forever, thus becoming his work of art.
The Jedi found out about his plan and boarded the ship, resulting in him losing control over the engine and vaporizing only his own body.

# The Mask

Even though Darth Momin's body was destroyed, his spirit remained contained within the mask.
With all of his teachings and records covered up, the Jedi stored and held Momin's mask hidden inside a secret Jedi vault.
During a fight with Vader, the Jedi master Jocasta had fled into the vault before being slain, resulting in Sidious learning about the mask's existence.
He would, in turn, take the mask for his collection; the mask with Momin’s spirit would reveal his past to Sidious upon examination.
Sidious gave the mask to Vader for dark side knowledge and guidance on Mustafar; Together with a team of imperial architects, Vader went to Mustafar for the fortress' creation.
The chief architect's aide, Lieutenant Roggo, would become possessed by Darth Momin, finalizing the design and killing the chief architect, which would cause Vader to find out about Darth Momin

Vader would take Momin’s mask to a cave and reach into it with the Force, Mormin would show the past to the Sith Lord, but Darth Momin would attempt to possess Vader, which failed.
Vader would allow Mormin to possess bodies furtherly to continue his work on the construction.
The design of Momin for the fortress was based on dark side energy and focusing spires channeling the energy; Vader approved the construction of it with Momin’s promise that Vader would be able to resurrect his loved one again through the doors and the portal of dark side energy.
During the construction, many of his attempts would fail due to too much dark side energy going through the focusing spires of the fortress, which would make the dark side uncontrollable and result in many natural disasters occurring.
Eventually, the fortress was finished with small disasters and infestations remaining.

Whilst Vader was distracted by an attack against the fortress, Momin would use the dark side door and channel the dark side energy of the fortress to resurrect his original body.
Vader would win the battle and return to the chamber where Momin was waiting; a fight would ensue as the weakened Vader would initially seem to lose, Momin cutting off his dueling arm as he claimed victory and stating he was immortal by the dark side.
Vader would mock Momin with his claim, then use his Force powers and overwhelm the other Sith Lord as his body was destroyed flat against the cave wall.
Although the promise of the dark side door and portal were true and Momin did design these dark side creations, Vader would never be able to resurrect Amidala due to her not wanting to go with him.

Yet the mask still held the spirit of Darth Momin; Sidious would have it placed in his ship, guarded by two royal guards who were quick to be possessed by Momin.
The rebels infiltrated the ship, the royal guards were killed by the rebels, yet two of the infiltrators became possessed by Momin; which caused the rest of the infiltration team to abandon the ship and instead blow it up in its entirety, thus also destroying the mask and spirit of Momin contained within.
