# Introduction

D'harhan, a male Niordi bounty hunter from Niorde in the Unknown Regions, faced a crisis when his planet was attacked by the Leech Legions during the Clone Wars.
These attackers were hired by a neighboring planet engaged in a century-long war with Niorde.
To protect their planet, D'harhan and a group of Niordi underwent cybernetic enhancements, transforming themselves into living artillery weapons.
Despite their powerful advantage, the Niordi ultimately lost the war, leaving D'harhan as the sole surviving living weapon.
Throughout his life, D'harhan shared a significant history with Boba Fett, and both held each other in high regard.

# Biography

D'harhan, the Near-Human Niordi, had an eventful life filled with transformations and alliances.
Born on the mysterious planet of Niorde in the Unknown Regions, D'harhan belonged to a species engaged in a centuries-long war with a neighboring planet.
The Clone Wars introduced a new threat as the Leech Legion mercenaries were hired to attack Niorde.
In response, D'harhan and a select group of Niordi scouts underwent cybernetic modifications, turning themselves into living weapons to defend their homeworld.
Undergoing a complex surgery, D'harhan's head was replaced with a cannon, and his brain was placed in a heavily-armored box on his chest.
His limbs and spine were reinforced, and a tail was added to mitigate recoil.
Following the operation, D'harhan became the sole surviving living weapon, as Niorde fell to the Leech Legions.
He later ventured into the field of bounty hunting, forging a long-standing relationship with the renowned bounty hunter, Boba Fett.
During their collaboration, D'harhan and Boba Fett embarked on various missions together, including the pursuit of fugitive Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ferus Olin on the planet Bellassa.
Their partnership was marked by shared respect and a deep understanding of each other's abilities.
In the Bounty Hunter Wars, D'harhan was recruited by Boba Fett, alongside IG-88B, Bossk, and Zuckuss.
Their mission took them to Circumtore, where they confronted the treachery of the Shell Hutts.
Despite initial tensions among the group, D'harhan played a crucial role in the battle against the Shell Hutts' mercenaries, using his cannon to devastating effect.
However, the physical strain of his cybernetic enhancements eventually overwhelmed D'harhan.
He suffered severe injuries, and Fett had to take over the weapon.
In a moment of sacrifice, D'harhan allowed Fett to use the cannon to annihilate their enemies.
Mortally wounded, he expressed regret for trusting Fett but acknowledged the bounty hunter's need to persevere.
D'harhan's life ended in Fett's arms, leaving behind a poignant reminder of their shared history.
Despite D'harhan's passing, his legacy lived on in the memories of those who crossed paths with the Niordi bounty hunter.
Years later, Fett recounted the story of D'harhan's transformation to the Assembler balance sheet, highlighting the tragic yet significant role he played in their intertwined lives.

# Weapon System

D'harhan's radical transformation into a walking cannon occurred during the war on his planet.
The surgical procedure involved the removal of his entire head, which was replaced with the cannon itself.
Bolted to his collarbones and anchored into his chest, the cannon had  primitive gear for vertical movement.
Power cylinders and cables were integrated into his body, while a saurian-like cybernetic tail provided stability during firing.
D'harhan's cannon was outfitted with precise targeting sensors and indicator lights that were seamlessly integrated into his nervous system.
Acting as his eyes, the sensors followed his gaze, while the indicator lights conveyed his moodâ€”yellow for standby, orange for danger, and red when he was ready to fire.
D'harhan's brain was relocated to an armored box in his midsection, protected by a thick chest plate.
Communication became a challenge as he no longer had a mouth, relying instead on a small box attached to his belt.
This box contained a speaker and a screen for silent word display, and a keyboard enabled him to communicate slowly with others.
It was revealed by Boba Fett that cyborgs of the same type, including D'harhan, could communicate through an internal com-link network connected to their nervous systems.
Even during his "sleep" or standby state, the cannon remained active, tracking movements and allowing D'harhan to sense approaching individuals and listen to conversations around him.
