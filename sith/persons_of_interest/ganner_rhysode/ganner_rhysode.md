# Biography

Ganner Rhysode, born Force-sensitive, was recruited to attend the Jedi Temple on Yavin 4 and there he developed his skill.
He was considered a promising Jedi Knight and was attracted to Jedi Master Kyp Durron, who believed in using the Force to fight injustice.
He saw himself as a leader of a new generation of Jedi Knights who would deliver justice without being restricted by the old Jedi code.
The sudden appearance of the Yuuzhan Vong in 25 ABY provided an opportunity for Rhysode to press war against the invaders.
Rhysode was present at the reunion Skywalker called on Yavin 4 to address the threat and discuss the need for an organized response.

Skywalker assigns Rhysode to investigate a case in Bimmiel, an uninhabited world in the Yuuzhan Vong territory.
There they discover the remains of a fifty-year-old Yuuzhan Vong.
After a week of storms, Rhysode and Horn go on a scouting mission to recover the remains and they find a Yuuzhan Vong camp.
The students analyze beetles from the Yuuzhan Vong site and discover that one produces synthetic stink and another produces carbon dioxide.
Rhysode and Horn decide to eliminate the Yuuzhan Vong themselves in combat and form a plan to free the students while others extract them and lace the camp with the virus and synthetic kill scent.
Horn and Rhysode distract the two warriors and Horn uses his ability to project feelings.
Horn, injured, offers to stay behind while Rhysode uses telekinesis to float the students out.
Instead, Orlanis shoots the top of the grashal while he levitates Horn out and safely escapes with the entire team.

After returning to the Jedi, Rhysode, and Horn were assigned to infiltrate Garqi with six Noghri commandos and two civilians.
They prepared for the mission and launched from Ralroost aboard Lost Hope.
During the battle, the Lost Hope suffered an engine explosion, allowing the concealed shuttle Best Chance to escape.
Rhysode had to use the Force to set off damaged charges, helping separate the Best Chance from its shell.
They landed safely and spent a week scouting and making their way across the land.
Horn proposed capturing some slaves to understand the Vong's actions.
They drove the Yuuzhan Vong back, allowing them to escape with a few captives.
They headed to the Pesktda Xenobotanical Garden.
The Yuuzhan Vong arrived and ordered them to surrender.
Rhysode challenged their leader, but the battle ended swiftly.
Horn burned the garden, preserving the valuable knowledge, and they made their way back to the Best Chance in time for its liftoff.

In 27 ABY, the Yuuzhan Vong unleashed voxyn creatures, prompting Rhysode to study them.
Cilghal learned that the voxyn were coming from Myrkr, where they were cloned from a queen.
Anakin Solo suggested a group of young Jedi Knights be turned over to the Yuuzhan Vong, who would carry them behind enemy lines.
Master Skywalker suggested he lead the team.
They captured the YVH droids and secured the ship, capturing Rhysode.
They found the worldship Baanu Rass orbiting it, but Anakin Solo sensed Jedi aboard it.
They were ambushed by a cruiser, and Rhysode fired a baradium missile at the cruiser.
They made an emergency landing on the surface, while Kore piloted the Exquisite Death away as a decoy.
They withdrew through the training warren, where the voxyn were trained to hunt Jedi.
The team fought through the training warren, battling against the Yuuzhan Vong's slaves and voxyn.
They eventually escaped the warren, but were ambushed by the voxyn.
Rhysode helped hold the passage, but Besa and Drark were killed, and Anakin Solo was badly wounded.
The voxyn queen escaped, and Anakin Solo gave himself over to the Force.
They withdrew and had Sebatyne track the queen while they holed up.
They were interrupted by Anor and Vergere, who offered to guide them to the escaping voxyn queen.
Solo killed the queen near Jaina's crashed ship, while the others captured the frigate Ksstarr.
Jacen was captured, and Rhysode had to flee with the survivors of the team.

Rhysode attended Anakin Solo's funeral and joined Han and Leia Organa Solo in the Millennium Falcon for the Jedi base at Eclipse.
They eventually traveled to Borleias, where General Wedge Antilles led the world's defense with the Skywalkers.

Rhysode heard a rumor that Jacen Solo was alive on Coruscant.
He shares this with Jaina Solo, who dismisses it as nonsense.
Rhysode pursues the rumor, eventually arriving on a refugee ship over Bothawui.
He enters a room where he is tricked into believing he is a Jedi in alliance with the Yuuzhan Vong.
The man, disguised as Yuuzhan Vong, reveals himself as Jacen Solo and renders Rhysode unconscious.
Rhysode is brought back to Coruscant with Solo, where he is held in a state of semi-consciousness, hearing Solo, Anor, and Vergere discuss sacrificing him.
He is awakened by Solo, who praises the Yuuzhan Vong gods and explains that he was not a traitor.
Rhysode is unsure of his trustworthiness, but Solo insists that his death inside the Well could be meaningful.
Rhysode, confused and terrified, is led to the site of the sacrifice and confronts Solo for his weakness and failure to be a hero.
After being picked up by the Force, Rhysode escapes through secret tunnels used by senators.
He decides to use his lifelong dream of being a hero and holds back the Yuuzhan Vong to give Solo time with the World Brain.
Rhysode challenges the Yuuzhan Vong in single combat, defeating them in large groups.
He eventually remembers his desire to act as a hero and destroys the senate dome and tank beast with infantry support.

# Legacy

Ganner's last stand made it possible for Solo to flee the planet and escape the Yuuzhan Vong army.
This sacrifice was later proved to be essential during the war as Solo, later killed the leader behind Yuuzhan Vong and made them leave Coruscant intact.
Ganner’s sacrifice was made a myth even by Yuuzhan Vong, ”an invincible Jedi giant called the Ganner who guarded the gate to the land of the dead, keeping the dead from leaving to harm the living” and was named a liberator for the shamed ones as part of the Jeedai heresy.
His sacrifice was not only remembered by Yuuzhan Vong.
He had the highest kill count in the war and the Jedi named the conference room in Ossus and a squadron after his name.

# Personality and traits

Rhysode was confident from a very young age, even more after becoming a Jedi and an Adult.
His expertise in the Force and his good looks made this confidence rise even higher.
Since childhood, he always wanted to be a hero and impress others with his power.
When he became a Jedi, he saw himself as a member of a less restricted newer Jedi generation that was capable of giving justice to those that needed it.
He was also known to be very flirtatious but the truth was he did this to lie about his true feelings.
His arrogance and confidence were struck after a certain mission during the Yuuzhan Vong War, where he suffered an injury that left him scarred.
From that point on he started respecting his fellow peers, not underestimating his opponents, and accepting there are better Jedi than him.
Ganner eventually decided to change his appearance as proof of his change, now letting his beard grow and becoming a true adult.

# Powers and abilities

Ganner had a natural connection with the Force and his unknown usage of it during his youth made him have a very casual approach to it.
His expertise lay in telekinesis and mind tricks however he was also capable of using the Force as a shield or to make a controllable bubble around him.
During his mission to save Jacen Solo, he entered the state of Oneness with the Force and used his rage to kill hundreds of Yuuzhan Vong warriors and destroy multiple structures to let Solo escape.
