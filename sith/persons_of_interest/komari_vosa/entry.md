# Biography

During the final century of the Galactic Republic, Komari Vosa, a female Human Force-sensitive, was usually conscripted by the Jedi Order as a young kid.
She ultimately completed her basic training and was appointed as Count Dooku's padawan.
Despite her volatile demeanor, Vosa had demonstrated a phenomenal mastery of the ways of the Force, earning the attention of her Master, who saw Vosa as a valuable pupil.

In 44 BBY, she was tasked with annihilating the True Mandalorians.
She practically decimated their adversaries in the Battle of Galidraan by personally killing twenty seasoned troopers with her extraordinary lightsaber abilities.
Vosa's Master barred her from competing in the Jedi Trials, thereby ruining her promising future in the Jedi Order.
Vosa's hidden fascination with her Master was made known to the Jedi Council and Dooku.
Because of her obsessive fixation and frequent disrespect for directions, the decision was obvious.
Vosa stormed out of the Jedi Temple in rage after seeing what she saw to be a betrayal by her Master and the Council.
She later joined a task force of Jedi tasked to disrupt Bando Gora activities on Baltizaar, a mission that went disastrously wrong.
She was being held captive by an intriguing cult on Kohlma, a graveyard moon that circled Bogden.
Komari Vosa changed as a result of great misery and sorrow.
As a result, she became the Bando Gora's new leader.
The Sith Lord-in-training was given orders to eliminate the Bando Gora and discover a suitable genotype to serve as the foundation for a massive army of clone troopers.
Jango Fett, a mandalorian bounty hunter, would be chosen later.
The former Jedi Padawan and the Mandalorian bounty hunter met in Komari Vosa's royal suite.
Fett had to rely on his survival instincts to stay alive due to Vosa's better competence.
Vosa was eventually defeated, but he chose to spare her life because the prize was the same whether she was alive or dead when she was apprehended.
Darth Tyrannus, her old lord, assassinated her.
Despite his disappointment at losing a talented pupil like Komari Vosa, Tyranus congratulated Jango Fett on winning the competition.
He promised to pay even more than the five million credits if the bounty hunter consented to come to Kamino to be cloned.

# Personality and traits

Komari Vosa was renowned as a gorgeous female Human with sharp, angular features during her tenure with the Jedi Order.
Her expression changed as a result of the pain she was feeling.
Her jawline and upper torso were scarred by the Bando Gora, while the evil side bleached her blond hair bone white and her irises yellow.
Vosa, as a Jedi Padawan, had a strong feeling of aggressiveness and a desire to fight.
She was a tough pupil who was impatient yet extremely skilled in Jedi techniques.
Her master overlooked her flaws because he was confident in her growth.
She got overwhelmed in rage as a result of his master's blatant treachery.
Vosa lost her sanity and endured a major personality transformation after being subjected to physical and psychological anguish by the Bando Gora.
She became evil and vengeful.

# Powers and abilities

A Jedi with a feeble intellect who is a competent saber-to-saber combatant.
A dangerous Jar'Kai combat form wielder who is also talented in Soresu.
Vosa's approach was maybe not confined to Soresu.
There is also proof of her use of ataru and shien, which she demonstrated during her bounty pursuit.
Her lightsabers displayed curved hilts like her former instructor Dooku's, hence she may have studied Makashi.
Despite her frail intellect, Vosa had a high degree of proficiency in the force, which gave her speed and agility.
She could also use telepathy and has a vast range of force abilities.
Her deep dive into the dark side gave her a lot of resistance.
This made her reckless since she repeatedly abandoned her defenses and launched herself at Fett, allowing the bounty hunter to gradually tear her down until she was defenseless.
She spoke Huttese, Kaminoan, and the old Sith language alongside the Galactic Basic Standard.
