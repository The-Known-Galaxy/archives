# Overview
Waffle was a male human Death Trooper, who served the Imperial Navy under the command of Grand Admiral Thrawn.
Waffle was one of Thrawn’s special Death Trooper guards, handed to Thrawn by Palpatine himself.
Unlike most Death Troopers, Waffle was tasked with a special mission to guard a traitor.
He and his colleague, Death Trooper Pik, helped Eli Vanto and Assistant Director Ronan in locating a missing freighter.
His mission was on the planet Aloxor and one of its cities, Tiquwe.
Waffle was loyal to Grand Admiral Thrawn and was as talented as Pik.
Waffle was so loyal to Thrawn that he even protected Ronan, who he despised because of his political views and disrespect towards Thrawn.
