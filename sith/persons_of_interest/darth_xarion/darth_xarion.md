# Overview
Darth Xarion was a male Dark Lord of the Sith, he served as a member of the Dark Council and as the Overlord of the Sphere of Galactic Influence, which was a new Sphere that oversaw the Spheres of Intelligence and Expansion & Diplomacy.
Xarion despised Darth Anathel and the two fought in the Stygian Caldera nebula and the conflict disturbed the Imperial trade, which led negotiators to beg them to fight somewhere else.
Agreeing to their request, the two Sith moved to the Outer Rim Territories.
The conflict turned out to be a draw and both Dark Lords were placed on the Dark Council and were Overlords of new Spheres that oversaw previous Spheres.
