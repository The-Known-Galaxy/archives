# Introduction

Zayne Carrick, a member of the Jedi Order, was a human male and padawan during the Mandalorian Wars.
His abilities as a Force-Sensitive were mediocre at best, and he lacked the confidence to ever become a true Jedi.
His bad luck made him see something he shouldn't have and hence commenced a galactic manhunt for him.
After clearing his name, he left the order and decided to live as a bounty hunter.
During his manhunt, he met Jarael, a girl who would later become his companion.
He would solve various problems throughout the universe and eventually return to Coruscant, where he would continue living and developing his relationship with Jarael.

# Biography

Zayne, a young Jedi Knight, was discovered by an unknown Jedi Knight and brought to the Jedi Order.
He was accepted to the Jedi Academy on Dantooine, where he was trained by Master Vandar.
However, his Jedi abilities did not advance as far as hoped.
He struggled to keep up with his fellow Padawans and was interested in the Mandalorian Wars and other issues affecting the Jedi Order.

After encountering Squint, the Padawans on Taris faced a challenge.
Zayne felt isolated and doubted his ability to become a Jedi Knight.
The Masters' fears about their Padawans led them to desperate measures, as they hated the Sith.
They announced a knighting ceremony, but the ceremony was a trap.
Zayne, running late, discovered his Masters in the midst of their crime and managed to escape.
Zayne's ineptitude saved him twice.
Instead of taking Gryph to the authorities, he quickly went to the Jedi Tower.
The Masters confirmed his knighting with a swift made-up story about his alleged "special relationship" with the Force.
Shad grew suspicious of the Masters' treatment of Zayne and urged them to strike preemptively.
Zayne and Gryph flee from the Jedi Masters, who have framed them for the Padawan massacre.
They encounter the aging mechanic "Camper" and his friend Jarael, who attack Zayne with their shockstaff skills.

They descended to the rogue moon to find clues to the Padawan Massacre, revealing the destroyed droid that might have had information about the Masters' murder of their Padawans.
However, before they could locate its information, Lucien Draay and the forces of the Republic descended to the moon's surface to capture Zayne.
Zayne returns to Taris, where he encounters Mandalorian ships and a Mark II assault droid.
He discovers a Hidden Bek hideout, where Brejik and gang members attack Zayne.
The Mandalorians arrive, and Zayne and the Hidden Bek gang retreat.
During their conversation, Zayne encounters a Twi'lek girl named Mission Vao, who reveals she has a pet.
They follow Griff, who kidnaps the missing Constable of Taris' children.
Despite Gadon's anger, the Hidden Beks can negotiate with the Taris Resistance and join them.

After Raana's death, the Taris Resistance leader, Zayne, and Gryph left the Taris Resistance and entered the Undercity.
They were forced out of the village by Rakghouls.
They encountered Jedi Master Celeste Morne, who was sent by the Jedi Covenant to recover the Muur Talisman and bring the fugitive Padawan in.
Morne discovered the Padawans were the supposed killers, but they were unable to kill them due to their noise.
Blasting interrupted their journey, and they fell through the floors.
Celeste followed them.

Zayne and his companions, excluding Alek and Shel, landed on Odryn to uncover the Covenant's misdeeds.
They hid in Del and Dob Moomo's laundry hamper and entered the Sanctum of the Exalted, documenting Sith artifacts recovered by the Covenant.
Zayne discovered that Covenant researchers analyzed the artifacts and had enough evidence to show the Jedi Council.
They encountered Feeorin Borjak, who questioned Zayne's intentions and revealed that the Feeorins had broken down since the Padawan Massacre.
The unexpected arrived, surprised Zayne and Gryph, and ordered Feln to destroy the Sanctum of the Exalted.
Feln agreed to kill Zayne, but Zayne tried to convince Borjak and the Feeorins that Feln was using his people for his own benefit.
Despite Feln's attempts to kill Zayne, he managed to escape and avoid Feln's attack.
Borjak reported that the Moomo Williwaw was approaching Odryn, and Zayne's friends were planning to raid the Sanctum.
Zayne witnessed Feln's detonation, causing the Sanctum to explode, burning the village.
Feln blamed Zayne for the devastation and promised to strike him with his lightsaber.
Gryph swapped the lightsaber, and Borjak and the other Feeorins turned against Feln, ending his life and rule.
Later, Borjak found Zayne's lightsaber and proposed rebuilding it.
Zayne agreed, believing it would be better for Borjak and his people.
However, Zayne lost evidence against the Covenant when Jarael revealed that the Moomo Brothers had smuggled Sith artifacts from the Sanctum onto their ship.

After Operation Vindication, Zayne left for Dantooine to help his deceased Padawan friends.
He founded the Rogue Moon Project, which aimed to help those abandoned by the Jedi Order and the Republic.
During his time away, Gryph devised a plan to destroy the planetary exchange market on Metellos 3.
He recruited Rohlan and Jarael to pose as natives of Italbos and ferry him to the moon.
Gryph disguised himself as a professor of law, but the leader of the planetary exchange, Chevin Nunk Plaarvin, grew suspicious and wanted to rid himself of the three.
Zayne saved Gryph by cutting down the droids.
They went to the "Negotiation Room" and showed the Hot Prospect, which was bought by Slyssk.
They dressed Slyssk up as a member of the Syndicate and tricked Nunk into believing the Syndicate knew about the credits he was laundering.
They sent Nunk to the devastated planet of Jebble, allowing the Chev slaves to work free.
Despite Jarael and Rohlan's warnings, they emerged unharmed and learned about Jarael's Force-sensitive nature.
Zayne tried to tell the truth at the auction, but they bought Gryph's story and bought the planet anyway.

The crew of the Hot Prospect travels to Wor Tandell to rest and discuss Jarael's slavery origins.
Jarael was kidnapped by the Crucible and forced to fight in slave pens to train for dueling.
She was eventually rescued by Camper.
Zayne offers to help her track down the Crucible, but she refuses.
Zayne later visits the town of Gantra Lea and meets Ferroh, a Cathar Jedi who tells him about joining the war against the Mandalorians.
Ferroh discovers that his entire species vanished, and the Revanchist leaders, Revan and Malak, investigate the planet.
They are told the Cathars likely left due to disease and should quit their investigation.
As they disperse, Revan and the rest of the Jedi have a vision of a massacre of Cathar refugees by Cassus Fett and his Mandalorian Crusaders.
The Mandalorian forces herd the Cathar into the ocean, killing the Cathar and one Mandalorian.
Revan takes up the fallen Mandalorian's mask, claiming to take up the deceased's cause and take the moniker Revan.
After the revelation of the genocide, the Jedi High Council grants the Revanchists permission to join the war.
Malak and Rohlan were battling in the Hot Prospect when Zayne, Ferroh, and Telettoh returned.
Malak tried to recruit Jarael to the Revanchists' cause, but Rohlan disapproved.
Malak attacked Rohlan, causing him to be disabled.
Zayne agreed to be his ally but later kissed her.
Malak and Gryph were surprised, as they had different plans for the war.
Zayne helped Jarael run from the Covenant and prepare for it, allowing him to refuse Malak's recruitment.
The two agreed to go after the Crucible, and Zayne had contacts to help finish the slaving organization.

After the events on Volgax, Jarael, and Rohlan left the Hot Prospect to testify against the recently reawakened Demagol.
Carrick learned that certain members of his crew were keeping secrets from him, including Elbee's secret about Rohlan's escape from Flashpoint.
Zayne decided to break Rohlan out of custody, as the rest of the galaxy was under the impression that the prisoner was Demagol.
During the trial, Rohlan broke his restraints and was recruited by Malak.
The Mandalorian was questioned by the Jedi, who appealed to the crowd's emotions by demonizing the Mandalorians.
The Mandalorian was eventually taken away to a security speeder for his protection.
The two guards accompanying Rohlan revealed themselves as Carrick and Hierogryph, who needed his help to stop Demagol.
Demagol, originally named Antos Wyrick, was a Zeltron who was abducted by Iskalloni slavers and later freed by a Mandalorian raid.
Wyrick took the DNA of Arkanian Jedi Master Arca Jeth and began experimenting on children, creating Force-sensitive individuals.
He later became a Mandalorian Crusader under the alias of Doctor Demagol.
As Rohlan finished his tale, Shel Jelavan and Slyssk arrived, bringing replacement armor for Rohlan.
Zayne informed Gryph of the existence of the Rogue Moon Project and showed the organization's plans.
Shel gave Zayne his lightsaber, now engraved with the names of his former classmates.
Slyssk recalls a microtag from Demagol's vessel, revealing a double-bladed lightsaber.
Carrick discovers Demagol and Jarael are on Osadia, but lacks planet coordinates.
To capture Dace Golliard, Carrick asks Rohlan to contact Cassus Fett, hoping to repay his debt.

Eventually, they end up finishing the mission and rescuing Jarael.
They, together, returned to Coruscant to return Jarael to her family.
Zayne returned to his planet for a few days but ultimately came back for his beloved.

# Personality and Traits

He was very dedicated to the Order but was unsure about his position.
He believed in the Order's ideals and was willing to sacrifice himself for his peers.
However, both times he faced death, he willingly surrendered to evict it.
He did not like using violence; he was capable of doing his missions without suffering a loss or producing a loss.
With time, he grew and matured, making him more confident and decisive in battle.
His confidence even grew bigger after he lied to Malak by kissing Jarael and making him believe she would join them.

# Powers and abilities

From a young age, Zayne's clumsiness, and inaptitude with the Force were clear; however, he possessed the ability to make friends, something that would help him in the future.
During his training as a padawan, he learned a very rare skill: a natural connection to the Living Force.
He also had the possibility of foreseeing the future very clearly.
Unlike most Jedi, whose capacity was limited from the moment they were born due to Midichlorians, Zayne didn´t possess that limit.
His natural connection to the Living Force made him capable of continuously becoming stronger.
He even learned to use telekinesis.
However, his very poor starting point in the Force, made him unable to properly train with lightsabers and never actually learn properly.
