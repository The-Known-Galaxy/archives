# Overview
Luthen had gray hair, light skin, and a specialty in picking out valuable items from stacks.
He had a burning passion and was willing to travel anywhere in the galaxy to find a part he needed.
He was a master of disguise and had many exotic and specialty tools to assist him in his crafts

Luthen Rael was the owner of the Galactic Antiquities and Objects of Interest, which was located on Coruscant in the galactic capital.
His supposed love for the Empire was actually a ploy, as he would be secretly leading efforts against it with Senator Mon Mothma.
He ran a spy operation with another rebel who acted as a messenger and enforcer of the rebellion.
Rael traveled to the planet Ferrix after being contacted about a sale for a Starpath unit.
He ran into Andor, who claimed that he stole the Starpath from an Imperial base, which Rael then admitted that he had actually traveled to the planet to recruit Andor, rather than have him arrested for the theft.
