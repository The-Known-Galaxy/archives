# Introduction
Sariss never knew that she was the daughter of Lord Cronal, one of the Prophets of the Dark Side who raised her in the dark ways of the Force on Dromund Kaas.
There, Sariss first met her future master, Jerec of the Inquisitorius in the Galactic Empire.
Because Cronal held to a creed of violent nihilism, the mere existence of his daughter constituted a shocking offense, as it was a tribute to creation instead of destruction.
Consequently, Sariss was disavowed by her father in the most horrid way he could conspire; Cronal not only allowed his fellow Prophets to freely engage her in carnal relations against her will, but he also partook himself.

# Biography
Sariss's life was shrouded in tragedy and darkness, beginning with her upbringing as the daughter of Lord Cronal, a prominent figure among the Prophets of the Dark Side.
Raised on the desolate world of Dromund Kaas, Sariss underwent rigorous training in the dark arts of the Force.
Little did she know that her existence as Cronal's daughter was seen as an affront to his nihilistic beliefs, leading to her disavowal and subjecting her to unspeakable abuse at the hands of her father and his fellow Prophets.
Seeking refuge on Tatooine, Sariss assumed the persona of the "Prophetess," working alongside local Governor Tour Aryon.
While her cover as a fortune teller allowed her to gather information, she also served as a spy for the Secret Order of the Empire.
During her time on Tatooine, Sariss encountered Wuher, a person she claimed was the reincarnation of Cedo Partu, and engaged in a game of manipulation and deception.
Driven by her allegiance to the Empire, Sariss eventually abandoned her post to become a Dark Jedi under the tutelage of Jerec.
Although she outwardly professed devotion to the Empire's Church of the Dark Side, Sariss secretly trained as a disciple of Jerec, seducing and manipulating individuals to further her own goals.
One such instance involved engaging a wealthy Epicanthix mineral baron and his son, Yun, whom she eventually convinced to murder his own father.
Sariss presented Yun to Jerec as an Apprentice, solidifying her loyalty and furthering her own ascent.
With the death of Emperor Palpatine, Sariss and Jerec worked to rebuild the crumbling Empire while simultaneously searching for the legendary Valley of the Jedi.
Their efforts led them to Dorlo, where they pursued Jedi Master Qu Rahn, who possessed knowledge of the Valley's location.
In a series of encounters, Sariss and her fellow Dark Jedi engaged in battles with Rahn and his Rebel allies.
Despite their initial setbacks, Sariss and her companions regrouped and eventually captured Rahn.
Following their success, Sariss and her allies embarked on a mission to gather the hidden map fragments that would lead them to the Valley of the Jedi.
They traveled to Sulon, where they recovered the map pieces hidden within the Katarn homestead.
Sariss dismissed the concerns of her comrade, Boc, who sensed a powerful presence watching them, believing it to be nothing more than their own significance drawing attention.
As their search progressed, Sariss reported their progress to Jerec.
The digitized map was transmitted and the original destroyed, thwarting the efforts of another Jedi, Kyle Katarn, who sought to reach the Valley before Jerec.
Upon identifying Ruusan as the location of the Valley of the Jedi, Jerec promptly mobilized his forces to establish an excavation site there.
During the course of their mission, Sariss interacted with Yun and entrusted him with assignments.
However, tragedy struck when Sariss attempted to execute Kyle Katarn, resulting in Yun sacrificing himself to save the Jedi.
Witnessing her Apprentice's selfless act, Sariss realized the truth in Yun's final words, acknowledging Katarn as a true Jedi of the light side.
Enraged by the loss of Yun, Sariss engaged Kyle Katarn in a lightsaber duel.
Despite initially holding the advantage, she ultimately fell victim to Katarn's skill and was fatally wounded.
Sariss's death marked the end of her journey as a Dark Jedi, while Kyle went on to rescue his partner and defeat the remaining members of the Dark Jedi cadre.
Sariss's tragic story serves as a reminder of the destructive path one can be led down when consumed by darkness and manipulation.
Her journey highlights the consequences of loyalty to power-hungry masters and the fleeting nature of allegiance in a galaxy torn apart by conflict.



# Personality and traits
Sariss possessed an average height and adhered to a fashion style similar to Jerec, always dressed in black with a striking red collar, while also applying red lipstick and nail polish in line with human female trends.
Notably, she maintained short hair, resembling the style commonly seen among human males.
Among Jerec's assembly of ruthless Dark Jedi, Sariss stood out for her insatiable hunger for power, a quality that earned her Jerec's trust and placed her in a close position among his trusted lieutenants.
She held a unique distinction as the only one to address Jerec as "My lord." Displaying a cunning nature, Sariss would stealthily eavesdrop on her fellow Dark Jedi's discussions and opportunistically interrupt them.
In moments when Yun was caught off-guard, she would reprimand him, attributing his lack of sensing abilities as the cause.



# Powers and abilities
Despite her quiet and reserved demeanor, Sariss proved to be an incredibly formidable adversary, particularly in combat situations.
Among the seven Dark Jedi, she was widely recognized as the most skilled lightsaber fighter, relying heavily on her exceptional fencing abilities rather than relying on a wide array of Force powers.
Notably, Sariss possessed a unique technique known as Deadly Sight, which granted her a distinct advantage by enabling her to execute ranged attacks against her opponents.
This rare ability further emphasized her versatility and prowess as a Dark Jedi.
