# Overview

Darth Wyyrlok III was a Male Chagrian Sith Lord and Loremaster of the One Sith, also known as the New Sith Order.
He was the most trusted and loyal servant of the founder of the One Sith, Dark Lord Darth Krayt, to whom only Wyyrlok was second to when it came to both power and knowledge.

# Section 1

The Male Chagrian Darth Wyyrlok was the third to use this name as it was a hereditary title that carried on from his grandfather, the first Darth Wyyrlok and his father, the second Darth Wyyrlok.
His duty as Darth Wyyrlok was to attend to Darth Krayt, the leader of the One Sith, as a servant.
Prior to the Yuuzhan Vong War, Darth Krayt was implanted with a Yorik-Kul by the Yuuzhan Vong which allowed him to utilize their technology, but simultaneously they continued to grow, which made Krayt fear that one day they would consume his entire body which led to him spending time in Stasis for years on end.
Even by the time of Darth Wyyrlok III, Krayt wasn’t fully healed which meant that Wyyrlok had to tend to his master during that time and take care of him.
At some point, Wyyrlok had a daughter whom was sent to Korriban for training in the ways of the Sith, during this time as Wyyrlok was the closest to Darth Krayt, he was not only an attendant and servant but also a spokesman and friend to him; acting as the Dark Lord's confidant.

Once Darth Krayt started his plans for galactic dominance, Darth Wyyrlok was by his side for the entire Sith-Imperial War which lasted over three years.
This led to Darth Krayt becoming an Emperor,however, he complained to his servant that his body was failing him, whereas Wyyrlok suggested a Healing Trance or Stasis once more but Krayt refused stasis as he believed he needed to show people he was strong as an Emperor.

# Section 2

Seven years after the Sith-Imperial War, Darth Krayt was once again put in stasis.
This caused Wyyrlok to fear for his master's life, this led the One Sith to the capture of a Jedi Healer known as Hosk Trey’lis, but even their methods were inefficient.
A skilled healer, Cade Skywalker, went on a rescue mission to save Trey’lis but was captured and tortured.
This was done in order to bend Skywalker and eventually break him as Darth Krayt believed he would be the one to cure him of his affliction.

Krayt decided to try indoctrinate Skywalker into the One Sith even though Wyyrlok disapproved of this decision, which in the end, Wyyrlok was correct where at the first opportunity that he got, Cade Skywalker attempted an escape in which he severed Darth Nihl’s arm and injured Darth Krayt.
He escaped unscathed on a ship known as the Mynock.
This injury forced Wyyrlok to put his master Darth Krayt into stasis as he was fearing for his life.

# Section 3

Over the coming years, Darth Wyyrlok III stayed by Darth Krayt's side while looking for ways to heal him of the affliction, like finding the secrets of Lord Andeddu.
Wyyrlok was also by his master's side during the massacre at Dac, and  even went to help his injured master at Had Abbadon.
However, he decided on something else entirely and proceeded to use Force Lightning on his master, killing him.
Darth Wyyrlok then recovered his master’s body and escaped.
He convinced the galaxy that Darth Krayt was in fact injured and in Stasis once more, which gave him the opportunity to take control, where he decided to deceive the people around him so that he may act as regent in the Emperor’s stead.
The only person that saw through it was Darth Maladi, who believed the ruler should have experience in leadership as well as power to bend the Sith to their will, and so she began constructing a weapon that would stabilize the One Sith by making them fear the Dark Lord's power.

# Section 4

A short time later, Darth Wyyrlok returned to Korriban to inspect the place where his master’s body was kept, where to his surprise; the body was gone, as if it disappeared without a trace.
After some time, it became very clear that Darth Krayt was in fact alive and was heading to Coruscant.
Upon hearing of this, Wyyrlok decided to spread the news that he actually  killed Darth Krayt, where he did this in order to further deceive the One Sith, as his old master succumbed to illness and could no longer serve and act as Emperor, and further stated that the living Darth Krayt all Sith felt in their mind was not Darth Krayt but rather, an impostor.
Shortly after, Darth Krayt arrived on Coruscant with Darth Nihl, Darth Talon and 2 masked Sith Troopers in order to get rid of the Usurper to the throne, where they carved their way into the throne room where the Dark Lord of The Sith, Darth Krayt, and Sith Regent, Darth Wyyrlok III, engaged in a duel.
Darth Wyyrlok proceeded to use Sith Sorcery to show Darth Krayt the torments of his long life while claiming it was him and his ancestors that kept the One Sith functioning, while the Dark Lord was suffering from his affliction.
As Darth Wyyrlok stood over Darth Krayt believing himself victorious, Darth Krayt proved otherwise by plunging his sabers into Wyyrlok’s chest.
Darth Wyyrlok collapsed while clinging onto the arms of Lord Stryfe, who left him to die in order to take his place as regent.
This marked the end of Darth Wyyrlok III.
