# Overview
The story of Lord Nyax was an old Corellian tale, that was a part of a greater collection of Corellian mythos.
A tale that was told to boys and girls, that he would come to kidnap them in their sleep to foster compliance and obedience, more so towards misbehaving kids.
As time passed, the tale of Lord Nyax would become synonymous with Darth Vader, due to his secret mission of kidnapping children with Force-Sensitivity on Corellia, and would eventually spread from the planet to the wider galaxy.

Throughout galactic history, other beings had their identity assimilated to that of the evil spirit.
During the Galactic Civil War, a Corellian cult, known as the Cult of Lord Nyax, carried out acts of horrendous terror, including terrorism, against the local Correllian population in the name of their Lord.
During the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion, the Dark Side Adept Irek Ismaren had assumed the identity of Lord Nyax, after hearing his name in the minds of his victims he’d tortured.

# History
In times that were considered ancient by 27 ABY, the evil entity known as Lord Nyax was referred to by Corellian parents to their children in order to frighten them into more compliant behavior.
Lord Nyax was described as being either a pale ghost-like figure or a man shrouded in a dark cloak with sickly yellow eyes, a hooked nose, sharp teeth, and long nails.
The entity's depiction shared many similarities with the appearance of the Galactic Emperor and Dark Lord of the Sith, Palpatine, and also shares these similarities with the appearance one takes with the cosmetic effects of Dark Side corruption.

Shortly after the Clone Wars had ended, the story of Lord Nyax became associated with Darth Vader, as he would also appear at night to kidnap and execute any Force-Sensitive children, as it was assumed they could potentially grow to become Jedi and be a threat to the New Order.
Following this, the legend of Lord Nyax had spread from Corellia to all of the known galaxy during the early years of the New Order.

At the time of the Galactic Civil War, several Corellian sects had honored Lord Nyax as their deity.
By 1 ABY, a sect called the Cult of Lord Nyax had formed that worshiped him.
The cultists donned dark cloaks, as Lord Nyax is mentioned, wearing something similar, and committing a number of terror attacks in his name.
The leader of the cult had taken the name of Lord Nyax upon himself, however, he would eventually be killed by an unknown spacer.
The followers of Nyax, another sect that worshiped Lord Nyax, adored the evil entity and promoted radical anti-Jediism, and when Darth Vader was on Corellia fulfilling his task of kidnapping any Force-Sensitive children and executing them, along any remaining Jedi on the planet, the Followers saw him as a reincarnation of their god.

In 12 ABY, a mentally damaged Dark Adept-in-training, named Irek Ismaren, assumed the name of Lord Nyax, after he had read it in the minds of his terrified victims.
He understood this as a recognition of his status, as Nyax sounded quite unique and Lord, to him, meant he was more important than everything else.
Under his new identity, Ismaren brought terror to Coruscant, the capital planet of the New Republic, after it had fallen into the hands of the Yuuzhan Vong, a species of extra-galactic invaders.
Irek Ismaren, or Lord Nyax in this case, was assumed to have died by being crushed to death by falling boulders inside the Jedi Temple ruins, however, later reports also suggested that he may have survived.
