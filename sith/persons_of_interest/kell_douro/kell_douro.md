# Overview
Kell Douro was an assassin and a spy that worked for the New Sith Order circa 41.5 ABY.
His first task as Darth Wyyrlok I’s personal assassin was to travel to the backwater planet of Fhost.
The Sith Lord advertised to him that in Fhost, he could find the ‘enlighted being’ that would feed him.
Once the Anzat assassin arrived on Fhost, he noticed that Jedi Knight Jaden Korr’s fate lines were intertwined with his fate lines.
He secretly followed him, but during his search for the Anzati soup, he engaged in a fight with Khedryn Faal, who also followed the Jedi to Fhost.
After defeating Faal, the Anzat assassin kept looking for his victim, Jaden Korr, who was tired, as he fought an Alpha clone prior to the meeting with Kell Douro.
Due to Korr’s fatigue, it wasn’t hard for Douro to feed himself with the Jedi Knight.
However, while he was feeding himself, Khedryn Faal, who wasn’t dead, grabbed an E-11 from the floor and shot the assassin in the head.
