# Overview

Darth Iratus was a human male Sith Lord who served in the reconstituted Sith Empire before the Cold War.
Most of his life was spent on Belsavis and Balmorra, where he performed rituals that could heal his body.
He wrote about these rituals until his death.
The most iconic ritual he performed was the Force-walk ritual.
After he performed this ritual, Iratus had so much power that his body started to decay.
Like many Sith, Iratus placed a lot of his power and teachings in a special holocron, which Darth Thanaton would later discover.
Iratus had to find the Rakatan cure for this dreadful curse, but he died to the Rakatan guardian droids.
His teachings were later found by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Nox, in Thanatonâ€™s private library.
Nox suffered the same Force-walk curse but survived.
