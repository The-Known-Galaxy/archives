# Introduction |
Aloysius Kallig was a male Sith Lord of the Old Sith Empire.
Like many ancient Sith of his time, his name was nearly all but forgotten in the annals of time.
While very few writings of history are still intact from the time of the Old Sith Empire, there is a text still intact written by the Dark Lord of the Sith Tulak Hord, who held him in respect as the greatest of his rivals.

# History |
According to the writings of the Dark Lord of the Sith Tulak Hord, Aloysius Kallig was a Force-sensitive male born into a wealthy family of the Old Sith Empire.
Although Kallig had immense wealth, he abandoned his inheritance and his family in everything but name and went to train on the Sith homeworld of Korriban.


Through his many years of training at the Sith training grounds, Kallig would rise to be the best in his class, he would study military tactics and become a master military strategist, and in his lightsaber skills, he would be just about unbeatable.
Once finishing his training at the Sith training planet of Korriban, Aloysius Kallig would pursue his goal of serving the Sith Empire alongside the Sith Lord Tulak Hord.


It was in the midst of Tulak Hord’s invasion of the planets Yn and Chabosh that Aloysius Kallig would express his interest in joining Tulah Hord for the invasion, however, Kallig would be outright dismissed by Tulak Hord, for the Dark Lord did not see any value in the would-be Sith.
It would not be until Kallig killed Tulak Hord’s highest appointed general, that the Dark Lord would see the worth in Kallig and appointed him as the top general of his army, thus anointing him as Lord Kallig.

Through Tulak Hord’s campaigns, Aloysius Kallig’s infamy and power would grow to a terrifying level, so much that even Tulak Hord would grow to be frightened of the influence and power Kallig could unleash if he so wished.
Thus this led to Tulak Hord arranging for his death, when Aloysius Kallig was assassinated his family, his wife, and his children fled and sought shelter and protection from the Dark Lord.
As Kallig’s family fled, his body was left and entombed on Dromund Kaas.


Although Lord Kallig’s spirit would remain in the mortal world, he would remain restless, clinging to his desire for revenge on the Dark Lord whom he once saw as a dear friend.
Aloysius Kallig would roam the place of his entombment for millennia his spirit broken in his desires for revenge, and would not awaken to his former self until he would sense a disturbance in the Force, the source he would later discover would be his own descendant, who would in later years be anointed the new Lord Kallig and eventually become known as Darth Nox.
