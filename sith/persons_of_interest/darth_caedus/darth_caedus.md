# Overview
Darth Caedus, born Jacen Solo, was a human male Sith born to parents Leia Organa and Han Solo in 9 ABY.
Early in his life, Jacen found himself the target of several kidnapping plots due to the fame of his parents.
At the age of 14, he and his sister Jaina Solo attended the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4.
Here, they were trained in the ways of the Force by their uncle Luke Skywalker.
He befriended many people throughout the galaxy, including Tenal Ka Djo, a Hapan Princess, with whom he would later have a child with.

Following the outbreak of the Yuuzhan Vong War, the young Jacen found himself in the middle of a personal crisis.
Jacen objected to the idea of using violence to fight violence, but he felt obligated to volunteer for the Strike Team against the voxyn queen.
During the mission to defeat the queen, Jacen’s younger brother Anakin Solo was killed, forcing him to lead the attack himself.
The mission was a success and he managed to eliminate the threat before being taken captive by the Yuuzhan Vong.

Solo spent nearly a full year in captivity, facing harsh torture for weeks at a time.
His captor, Vergere, wished to convert the young Solo to the dark side.
Solo did eventually fall to the dark side, but only briefly, before coming up with the idea to show the universe unconditional love.
He eventually escaped before rejoining the war effort against the Yuuzhan Vong.
In the final battle of the war, Solo defeated Onimi, a Yuuzhan Vong who had taken control over the mind of Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane.

# History
Following the end of the war, Jacen Solo set out in search of mentorship from various force sects around the galaxy.
His travels led to him meeting Luminya, who later revealed herself to be a former apprentice of Darth Vader.
He also met the Mind Walkers, with whom he trained for a while.
During his time with the Mind Walkers, Solo experienced a vision of a dark figure (later revealed to be Darth Krayt).
He returned to the Jedi during the Dark Net Crisis.
Hoping to find a way to prevent another galactic war at the hands of the Krillik and to protect his infant daughter Allana.
In addition, Jacen received a vision of himself killing Luke Skywalker and plunging the galaxy into chaos.
In order to avoid this, Jacen Solo agreed to become the Sith apprentice of Luminya, slowly turning against his former allies over the span of one year.
Jacen eventually took control of the Galactic Alliance, killed Mara Jade Skywalker, tortured Ben Skywalker (his former Jedi padawan and son of Luke Skywalker), committed several atrocities, took a Sith apprentice of his own, and ascended to the position of Sith Lord, becoming Darth Caedus.
After all this, Caedus was eventually killed at the hands of his twin sister, Jaida.
