# Overview
Born on Tatooine, Anakin Skywalker was a legendary Force-Sensitive human male.
In the Jedi Order, he held the rank of Jedi Knight and was seen as the chosen one due to his high mid-chlorian count.
Although he turned to the Dark Side of the Force as Darth Vader, the persona of Anakin Skywalker rebirthed after saving his son, Luke Skywalker, from the Emperor’s Force Lightning attack.

# History
From a young age, Anakin was showing emotions such as fear that led to the Dark Side, this is shown when he was brought to the Jedi Council, and Master Yoda, along with Master Mace Windu, asked him about his feelings and his mother.
The young Skywalker asked how was such a question relevant, and Master Yoda sensed fear in Anakin.
Besides this, after Qui-Gon Jinn died, the chosen one was taken under Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon’s former Padawan.


Obi-Wan Kenobi’s job was hard because as Anakin grew, his arrogance and emotions grew too.
Anakin thought Obi-Wan wasn’t a good master, but if he wanted to become a true Jedi, he had to get along with him.
That thought of Anakin eventually changed, and he considered him a father rather than a master.
During his time as a padawan, Anakin Skywalker was given the task of protecting Senator Padmé Amidala from an assassination attempt.
While Padmé and Anakin were in Naboo, he decided to return to Tatooine because he had constant nightmares about his mother suffering.
After finding her in a Tusken camp, Anakin saw his mother heavily damaged.
Without being able to say anything, Shmi Skywalker died in his son’s arms.
Anakin was furious and decided to kill every Tusken Raider in the village.


One of the missions Obi-Wan and Anakin went on together was the First Battle of Geonosis, where they fought against Darth Tyranus.
As a result, Obi-Wan ended up with minor injuries, while Anakin’s right arm was cut.
Both master and padawan were saved from death because Jedi Master Yoda entered the secret hangar and fought Dooku.
After the event of Geonosis, Anakin and Padmé married in secret, because the Jedi Order didn’t allow it due to emotions such as jealousy and fear of loss that could lead to the Dark Side.


Anakin Skywalker went through everything during his time as a Jedi Knight, such as seeing how his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, was exiled from the Jedi Order and how the Jedi Council denied him the rank of Jedi Master.
Anakin’s faith in the Jedi Council was lost, but suddenly Obi-Wan notified Skywalker that the chancellor required his presence.
Once Anakin arrived at Palpatine’s office, the chancellor talked to him about the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise, and how the power of the Dark Side of the Force could save his wife, Padmé Amidala, from death.


Anakin then notified Jedi Master Mace Windu that the chancellor Palpatine was the Sith Lord the Jedi were searching for.
Mace Windu, along with Agen Kolar, Saesee Tiin, and Kit Fisto, confronted Sidious.
Unlucky for Mace, his three teammates died against Palpatine and he was the only one left.
After defeating Palpatine, Anakin arrived at the Emperor’s office and noticed Mace Windu attempting to kill the Emperor.
He tried to convince Mace Windu that the Emperor was needed alive.
However, the Jedi Master didn’t listen to the chosen one and tried to attack Palpatine.
After swinging his saber, Anakin betrayed Mace Windu and cut his hand, allowing the Emperor to project a Force Lightning attack on the Jedi Master.
After clearing the Emperor’s office, Anakin was officially a Sith under the name of Darth Vader.



# Rebirth of Anakin
From Darth Vader’s point of view, the persona of Anakin Skywalker was erased from his memory.
However, Vader still remembered his life as a Jedi.
Upon this, he also discovered he had two kids: Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa.
His goal was to convert Luke Skywalker into a Dark Side user.

After his son arrived in Endor, Luke Skywalker told Vader there was still good in him and that his true self was still alive.
Vader responded that his past as Anakin didn’t have any meaning for him anymore, and escorted his son to the death star.

Once Vader and Luke met the Emperor, Vader’s son tried to kill Darth Sidious, but he was stopped by Darth Vader, and the battle started.
Luke Skywalker defeated Vader by cutting his hand, but after being requested to kill his father by Darth Sidious, he threw his lightsaber away and said he didn’t want to join the Dark Side.
Palpatine, mad about this, projected a Force Lightning attack on Darth Vader’s son to torture him.
Darth Vader then lifted the Emperor and threw him to the reactor of the dead star.
Vader was heavily injured because the Emperor’s Force Lightning got stronger when his apprentice lifted him.
After saving his son from death, he redeemed himself as a Jedi.
After Anakin Skywalker died, he turned into a Force Ghost and completed his task of bringing balance to the Force.
