# Introduction
Uthar Wynn was a humanoid Male and the Headmaster of the Sith Academy.
Uthar was a very respected teacher of the Academy and trained most of the Hopefuls looking to become a worthy Sith and train under the Rite of Passage.
Uthar was also known but unaware of the training of former Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Revan who was presumed dead due to a betrayal of Revan’s apprentice Darth Malak who shot down Revan’s Cruiser while battling Jedi Knight Bastille Shan.
Uthar's time in the Academy was lost due to the Dark Lord being turned back to the Light.

# Early Life
Uthar wasn’t always a Headmaster, he was also a student himself and was a very well-informed Student as well.
during his time as an Acolyte, he would devote his life to the studies of the Dark Side and the Sith Philosophy, this led to his hand-picked selection by the Headmaster at the time “Jorak Uln” who was a crazy man who devoted a lot of time into the tomb of Tulak Hord.
Jorak would be forced by his Apprentice Uthar to further commit his studies in the Tomb of Tulak Hord resulting in Jorak’s final descent towards psychotic behavior and officially losing his ability to teach and run the Academy.
This allowed Uthar to secure his spot as Sith Knight and ascend as the new Headmaster of the Sith Academy.



# The Deceitful Lie
During the Jedi Civil War a young Jedi padawan named Dustil Onasi and son of the republic war hero Carth Onasi, was deceived by Yuthura Ban, Uthar’s new Apprentice who was assigned to acquire the talented Force-sensitives for the Sith Academy.
Uthar found Dustils talents very useful to the Sith and looked to get him prepared for his initiation into the Order.
However, Dustil fell in love with another Hopeful named Selene and altered Dustils performance towards the Dark Side of the Force.
To resolve this problem Uthar saw to it that selene was to be removed from the Sith Academy….
Permanently.
He eliminated Selene in secret and made sure that Dustil would be informed that Selene was eliminated at the Valley of the Dark Lords.
A much-needed Lie to have only the most powerful Sith.



# The Hopeful
In the year 3956 BBY Uthar would be given the opportunity to train a new Hopeful, this hopeful was however a self-claimed former Jedi and was also known by the name Darth Revan.
Uthar unfortunately was Oblivious to his identity due to Darth Revan always having a mask on, resulting in this Hopeful being able to hide his identity from Uthar and the Sith.
Uthar became inspired by the Hopeful and honored Revan with Prestige to ascend to the trials of getting his Sith Lightsaber Uthar was ultimately betrayed once Revan passed due to Revan and Uthar’s Apprentice Yuthura Ban working together to betray him and attempt to take Uthar’s spot as Academy Headmaster.
