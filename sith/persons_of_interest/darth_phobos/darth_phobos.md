# Overview
Thousands of years before the Clone Wars began, a female Theelin Sith Lord named Darth Phobos was born on the planet Korriban.
Because Phobos was devious, deceptive and killed many of her Sith brethren in an effort to obtain power, the remaining Sith rallied against her to destroy her.
The Sith dubbed Phobos "The Hidden Fear" when she survived an assassination attempt and amassed a passionate cult that idolized her.
Phobos then used her follower to launch attacks against both Sith and Jedi.
Phobos' survival stories spread like wildfire, and the Jedi Trials used her figure as a prop for its Trial of Insight.

# Biography
Phobos was alive sometime before 2040 BBY.
She was a cunning person who honed her mental abilities, utilizing the Force to subjugate the weak and make them follow her orders.
Phobos killed a lot of her competitors in her struggle for dominance.
Assumed to be dead, she had actually lived in hiding.
The Sith eventually started to believe Phobos had come back from the grave and started referring to her as "The Hidden Fear." Seriously threatened by Phobos and her cult, both Jedi and Sith factions reluctantly banded together to defeat them.
This saw the ultimate demise of the Darth by these warriors, although her cult persisted for a considerable amount of time afterward, whose extinction occurred around the start of the New Sith Wars in 2000 BBY.



# Legacy
The Phobos simulation was the ''Trial of Insight,'' which took place inside the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant, the capital of the galaxy.
It was designed to educate Padawans how to see through deception and to confront their innermost fears.
Even after Operation: Knightfall in 19 BBY, which resulted in the temple’s destruction, the program continued to run.


During the Imperial Era, the Darth Phobos’s doppelganger met Starkiller, Galen Marek, as he entered the deserted Temple Archives.
She was disguised as Imperial Captain Juno Eclipse, whom Marek cherished,faking to be in distress.
The bait was taken; the simulation launched at Marek with a double-bladed lightsaber.
It claimed to have felt Starkiller's fear of the Captain's death and used it against him during their battle, making realistic versions of Eclipse.
For the last time, it begged the Sith apprentice to spare her.
The simulation was put to an end by Starkiller, who saw through the hoax and stabbed the figure in the back with his lightsaber.



# Personality and traits
Theelin in origin, Darth Phobos had musty-green skin, topped with blue hair, and a distinct set of yellow-colored irises.
She was skilled at influencing other people and she killed anybody in her way without a doubt, finally turning her fellow Sith against her.
She put up a fanatical cult and killed several Jedi and Sith alike in an effort to exact revenge for the assault on her life.
Although the Sith first thought she was dead, after a series of killings, they started to assume Phobos was responsible and gave her the moniker "The Hidden Fear." Even after Phobos's actual shortfall, there were long-lasting suspicions that she was still alive, and Jedi Padawans began to tell ghost stories about her.
The simulation of Phobos that fought against Starkiller was designed as a replica of the Sith Lord’s personality, intent on inducing fear into the mind of the Sith apprentice.



# Powers and abilities
Darth Phobos has strong mental abilities that she could use to exert control over the minds of the helpless and compel them to carry out her orders.
She benefited from others' fears and was bolstered by her own.
From how Starkiller was tricked into believing he was seeing many versions of his fear throughout their combat, it could be assumed that Phobos had a similar ability, taking away one’s sense of direction.
She was skilled in several types of telekinesis, including Force Repulse and Saber Throw, and used a potent Force lightning.
The artificial image had a double-bladed lightsaber and was skilled with it.
She could instantly teleport from one place to another and occasionally utilized Force speed and jump to boost her agility.
Presumably, these were combat attributes described about her through rumors and legends.
