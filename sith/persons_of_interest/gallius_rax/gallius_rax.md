# Overview
Gallius Rax, a guy who had previously gone by the name Galli and Operator, rose to the position of Counselor to the Empire in the latter stages of the Galactic Civil War.
Rax rose through the Imperial Navy ranks under the guidance of Sith Lord and Galactic Emperor, Darth Sidious, eventually taking command of the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Ravager.
The Contingency, a covert order to overthrow the Galactic Empire in the event of Sidious' demise, was  his true mission as the Emperor's protégé.


When he first met Sheev Palpatine, the personification of Darth Sidious, Galli was an orphaned youngster who had been born on the desert planet Jakku.
During the Age of the Empire, he assumed the name "Gallius Rax" and rose to the rank of decorated Imperial officer.
When the Emperor was murdered at the Battle of Endor, Rax was acting as an admiral, which led to the Contingency and his involvement in its execution.
He took steps to stabilize the Empire on the surface, like establishing the Shadow Council.
Rax, however, compromised the Empire by secretly leaking information to the New Republic.
By excluding Grand Admiral Rae Sloane and Grand Vizier Mas Amedda, he was able to gain more influence.

# Biography
Gallius Rax, a man, was born in or about the year 42 BBY on the arid planet Jakku.
Gallius, an orphan, was first known as "Galli," and he worked for the Anchorite Kolob during his first twelve years of life.
Rax resented being in Kolob's service and yearned for an existence in the outside world.
He stowed away on the Imperials in 30 BBY when he was twelve years old in an effort to get away from Jakku after witnessing Adviser Yupe Tashu command a droid to start digging somewhere on the Plaintive Hand plateau.


Sheev Palpatine, the persona Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith, assumed in public, detected Rax's presence during the journey and gave him the option of taking his own life immediately or accepting the fate Palpatine felt was in store for him.
Palpatine handed him his first assignment when he decided to go with the latter of the two options, which was to return to Jakku and use any means necessary to defend the excavation site and keep an eye on the droids doing the digging.
Palpatine introduced himself as Sheev and said that they would be on first names terms before sending young Galli back to Jakku, adding that "an Emperor must have friends, after all."
