# Introduction
The Corellian Human called Dengar or Dengar the Demolisher was a bounty hunter during the early times of the Clone Wars.
Dengar took various kinds of tasks including ones assigned by the Grand Hutt Council.
After the Clone Wars Dengar was still a Bounty Hunter and was even hired once by Darth Vader in order to capture Han Solo.
Due to his extraordinary lifespan, Dengar carried on as a bounty hunter following the time that the Galactic Empire was vanquished at the Battle of Endor.

# Section 1
Dengar was a male human who came from Corellia born circa.
22 BBY.
But not much was known about his upbringing.
He competed in the swoop racing scene of Corellia as a child, racing swoop speeder bikes.
Moreover, he participated in swoop racing with a friend of his named Hill Purpura.
Subsequently, they would dispute each other over who had won more frequently.
Later on, Dengar would say that he had raced swoop bikes professionally.
Dengar was a gladiator before he turned into a bounty hunter.
It was thought that Dengar's bounty-hunting career peaked during the Clone Wars, a galactic conflict in which he achieved an incredible record.



# Section 2
Dengar participated in a mission as a member of Krayt's Claw with hunters Boba Fett, Bossk, Latts Razzi, C-21 Highsinger, and Oked.
The chief of the Quarzite Belugan people, Otua Blank, engaged the hunters to guard a subtram carrying precious cargo.
Asajj Ventress, a deviant dark side user, killed Oked during preparations for the mission in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina.
Ventress then volunteered to replace the deceased hunter on the mission list.



# Section 3
Later, Dengar worked as protection on Nal Hutta for the Hutts, along with Latts, Embo, and Sugi.
They were there when Pre Vizsla, the leader of Death Watch, and the rebel Sith Lords Maul and Savage Opress came to join forces with the Hutts.
The four bounty hunters launched an attack when the scheme backfired, but the Mandalorian's flamethrower propelled them.



# Section 4
In addition, he served as a source of information for Vader when he joined Beilert Valance's bounty hunters, who were employed by the Hidden Hand to kill Vader.
Dengar and the rest followed Valance onto the Broken Wing, where Fetya on Arvina gave them weapons.
Vader's star destroyer opened fire on Fetya, saving them despite their double crossing.



# Section 5
The Galactic Civil War finally came to a close with a New Republic triumph at the Battle of Jakku at 5 ABY.
Jas was able to obtain full pardons for Dengar, Embo, and Jeeta as well as some cash from the New Republic once the Galactic Concordance was signed.
The money, albeit little, was sufficient to deter them from killing her and persuade Dengar and the other hunters to stay on as Jas' crew.
This development especially thrilled Dengar, who said that they had to watch out for one another because things were changing.
