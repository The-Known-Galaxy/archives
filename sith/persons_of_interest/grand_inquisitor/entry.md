# History

The Grand Inquisitor was a well-respected and known leader of the Jedi Hunters known as the Inquisitors also known as Inquisitorius.
In the Grand Inquisitor's early life he was a Jedi Temple Guard, a group of Jedi Temple guards sworn to protect the temple at all costs, they showed no emotion and could only say disperse.
He was a species known as Pau'an and was a very intelligent Jedi with an eager mindset to learn much knowledge of the Jedi Archives.
During his studies, he would be confronted by a Jedi Master called Jocasta Nu who would neglect him to learn anything as she saw him as unfit to learn the knowledge.
This would create the first start of anger in the Grand Inquisitor and would later down his path hate her for discriminating against him for wanting to learn.
Eventually, during the time of Order 66, he would be one of the few survivors of the Jedi’s demise, during his time at this event the Emperor also known as Darth Sidious would give him an offer as he knew how great the Grand Inquisitor was, The offer would involve him leading the new Jedi Hunter program, the Inquisitorius and would be trained personally by his apprentice Darth Vader, one of the most powerful Force sensitives in the galaxy.
With his new training, he would begin his missions of hunting down the remaining Jedi that survived for so long, this would lead to his hunt for the Jedi Kanan Jarrus which also lead to the hunt for his padawan, Ezra Bridger who would be a pain for the Grand Inquisitor for the remainder of the hunt.
Eventually, Ezra and Kanan would be put into a duel against the Grand Inquisitor and come out victorious, The Grand Inquisitor would be put into a position where he was hanging on a ledge unable to get up unless Kanan saved him, which  he did offer to but the Grand Inquisitor would not accept facing Darth Vader unsuccessful so he let go on the ledge and ultimately fell to his doom.
However, this would not be the end for him, the Grand Inquisitor would be turned into a Sith Ghost, but his ghost would be taken last second from Vader to serve the empire for the rest of his life.
Instead of his peaceful transition to the afterlife, he would be forced to serve the empire by being stuck to a pole in the Jedi temple where he would be forced against his will to keep anyone from learning the Jedi secrets.
The Grand Inquisitor eventually got faced with a duel with Luke Skywalker, Vader's son who bested him in the duel leading to Vader becoming angered by his failure and would lead him stuck in eternal pain for the rest of his life.
