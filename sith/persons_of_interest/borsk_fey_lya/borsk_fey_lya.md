# Introduction

Borsk Fey’lya, born to the Bothan species, was a political activist, whose career played out throughout the New Republic Era.
He was one of the Alliance's main figures that helped restore the Republic.
He led the government as Chief of State, during Yuuzhan Vong's invasion of the galaxy.
During the weaker days, when Coruscant was conquered, he became a martyr by suiciding and taking 25000 invaders with him.
During his political career, Borsk earned a lot of friends but also enemies.
His most notorious enemy was Admiral Ackbar.
His reputation was not the best, as his lust for power and the fear to lose it, his bad relations with the New Jedi Order, and his emotionless behavior didn’t make him the best of candidates.
It was made even more clear when he wasn't capable of maintaining order during the Thrawn Campaign.

# Biography

Borsk Fey'lya, a young Bothan colony world member, turned to politics at a young age due to his lack of abilities in any other thing.
He gained political support through deals and eventually became Chief Councilor of the Bothan Council.
Fearing the Empire's laws with certain species, Fey'lya joined the Bothan Spynet and became a diplomat.
After the end of Emperor Palpatine's rule, Fey'lya joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic.
He led a large group of Bothans in fleeing Kothlis and joining the Alliance.
Fey'lya became one of the most important figures in the Alliance.

Fey'lya aimed to gain recognition.
He secretly planned to re-establish Bel Iblis' position, but failed.
He then led a delegation to meet Alliance Fleet members before the Battle of Endor, but did not gain Bel Iblis' alliance.
He was escorted to a Star Cruiser, but was attacked by mercenaries.
The Bothan Spynet supported the rebel cause, with Borsk involved in the theft of the Death Star II plans.
His rise to power was fueled by the information he gained that revealed the existence and location of the second Death Star.
He signed the Declaration of the Alliance of Free Planets and became a member of the New Republic's Provisional Council and Inner Council.
He was an effective administrator and always debated Ackbar on every decision or proposal he brought to the Council.

Fey'lya attempted to monopolize power by dominating the New Republic's response to the Krytos virus.
Fey'lya wanted to remove Ackbar as a rival during the war against Grand Admiral Thrawn.
He suggested that the loss of an Elomin task force was a sign of Ackbar's lack of ability as Supreme Commander of the military.
His actions were carried out to annoy Ackbar, and his position as a member of the Inner Council allowed him to do this all too often.

Fey'lya regained power as the New Republic reorganized, becoming Head of the Justice Council and a member of the Ruling Council.
After Leia Organa Solo's resignation, Fey'lya was elected as the successor to the Chief of State.
He faced challenges in maintaining peace, diplomatic relations with the Yuuzhan Vong, and controlling Luke Skywalker's Jedi.
Fey'lya initially rejected the existence of the Yuuzhan Vong but eventually accepted their existence.
He was also suspicious of the New Jedi Order, as they had already failed to prevent the rise of the Empire and Darth Vader.
He wasn’t alone, as over an entire generation had grown up with no memory of the Jedi being considered champions of justice and peace.
Fey'lya eventually gave up and sent the Republic to war, but his bad relations with the Jedi and the military severely reduced their winning possibilities.

Eventually, he was forced to accept that there was no way of making peace with the Yuuzhan Vong and finally understood that the Jedi were the only hope.
The Yuuzhan Vong launched their attack on Coruscant, forcing its evacuation.
Believing that he had lost everything, and that he only had a life of shame waiting for him if he lived, he stayed behind, attaching a bomb to his heart.
He was killed when he refused to surrender and this detonated the bomb, killing over twenty-five thousand Yuuzhan Vong Warriors.
Although the invasion was a success for the Yuuzhan Vong, their losses were heavy.

# Legacy

No one can actually say he was a good person, his reputation was irredeemable indeed however no one can question whether he died a hero.
He earned the respect not only of his people but also of his enemies, even Yuuzhan Vong recognized him.
