# Overview
Darth Minax was a female Sith Pureblood who served as a Sith Lord for the reconstituted Sith Empire.
She served the Empire during the Cold War and the Galactic War, and was stationed on the planet Balmorra.
Soon, Republic and Jedi forces came to steal the Barrage design notes.
She witnessed this act of theft and quickly became fearful of the Republic’s interest in it.
She realised that Doctor Carsiri was involved, and threatened to kill him.
Unfortunately, not long after this, she was killed by these Republic forces.
Not much else is known about Darth Minax except that she, because she was stationed in Balmorra, might have served Darth Lachris.
