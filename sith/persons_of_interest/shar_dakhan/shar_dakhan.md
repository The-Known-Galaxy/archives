# History of Dakhan
Dakhan was a male who belonged to the Sith species.
He was a Sith lord and ruled over the Sith World of Ch’hodos up to the Great Hyperspace War.
Sith Lord Naga Sadow became Dark Lord of the Sith after defeating Ludo Kressh and the death of Marka Ragnos.
Naga Sadow announced plans to go to war with the Galactic Republic, and Dakhan donated his entire fleet for the cause.
Soon after the pledge, Dakhan hosted a war rally at his fortress on Ch’hodos, with legions of Massassi caste soldiers, warships, and behemoths, with Dakhan riding a large green Sith war rhino.

Dakhan followed Sadow into the Great Hyperspace war, where Sadow instructed an invasion force led by Dakhan to capture the planet of Coruscant.
Dakhan managed to force the outnumbered Jedi defenders to the Senate Hall steps.
Sadow aided Dakhan by using Sith illusions to make Dakhan’s army appear stronger.
The Jedi held out until Sadow broke concentration, and Dakhan’s army appeared to dwindle.
This boosted the Jedi's confidence, allowing them to defeat Dakhan’s forces, without killing Dakhan himself.
Dakhan was pursued by the Republic with his remaining army, which led to the second battle of Korriban, which resulted in the fleeing of Naga Sadow and Dakhan becoming acting Dark Lord.

A counter invasion by the Republic was launched after the Great Hyperspace War, where Dakhan managed the defence of the Sith Empire.
Suicide attacks on the Republic forces managed to remove them from the Horuset system, allowing Sith survivors from Republic occupation to emerge from hiding.
After a break in the fighting, a Sith Lord named Vitiate gathered the eight thousand Sith Lords in preparation for Sith magic to destroy the Republic.
