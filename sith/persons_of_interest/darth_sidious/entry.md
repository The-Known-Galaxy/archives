# Introduction

Darth Sidious was a powerful Dark Lord of the Sith.
He began his life on the planet of Naboo where Sidious would be born and raised by the House of Palpatine.
Through his time on Naboo Sidious also known as Sheev Palpatine would collect many Sith Artifacts and would be confronted by a Muun called Hego Damask also known as the Dark Lord, Darth Plagueis.
Plagueis would task the Young Palpatine into eliminating his father, and without hesitation, Palpatine would agree to this task and be officially named Darth Sidious.

# His Appearance during the Sith

Darth Sidious was a very awful look for a Sith, during the Clone Wars he had a fierce battle against the Jedi and Master of the Order Mace Windu, which resulted in him almost taking out everyone but lost in combat to Mace Windu, Luckily he would be saved by Darth Vader but unfortunately, his face and body became scarred and wrinkled due to his desperate attempt of Force lightning was reflected into him burning him and making his face pale with many veins and wrinkles, and his use of the Dark Side affected his eyes turning them Dark Red, He was always hooded as his appearance would surely scare the residence and give discomfort towards the galaxy.

# House of Palpatine

Sidious was born to a wealthy and powerful family on the planet of Naboo.
Born to Cosinga Palpatine He was known to be early into the politics of the Naboo system however he also contained a kind of Insane mentality and would be known to have the urge to eliminate many people without hesitation.
This frightened his Father and allowed the fall of Sheev Palpatine and learned about the true nature of the Dark Side, through finding and collecting many Sith Artifacts.

# The Slaughter

During Palpatine's time in an academy for politics, He was confronted by a muun named Hego Damask, This Muun would later be known as the Sith Lord Darth Plagueis and would convince Palpatine that he was strong in the Dark Side of the Force and would attempt to lure him by any means necessary.
Cosinga Palpatine would learn of his son's treachery and would ban Plagueis from entering House Palpatine, This enraged Sidious and would allow Plagueis to fuel Sheev into finally snapping on his family allowing him to go deep into the Dark Side slaughtering the family and guards that protected the House.
This would cement Sheev’s legacy,  officially known as Darth Sidious.

# The Nabbo Crisis

Darth Sidious began an alliance with the Trade Federation, a money-hungry and deceitful organization that looked nothing better than to trade many goods whether it was illegal or not.
This alliance led them to start trading into the Naboo system resulting in war against the Naboo resistance and the Gungans.
Palpatine during this time had gotten himself a new Apprentice by the name of Darth Maul, a Powerful Zarbrak who could maul his way through any Jedi and army.
During the war the Jedi got involved with the war resulting in the defeat of the Trade Federation and the end of Darth Maul, however, this was all a part of Palpatine's plans for the better of the wars to come.

# The Chancellor

Darth Sidious began his journey as a Sith Lord in secret, He lived both lives as Sheev Palpatine who was an Ambassador, representing Naboo, and live the life of Darth Sidious who was a very deceitful and manipulative Lord and would play a role in both sides of the coming wars to follow.
he orchestrated the Naboo Crisis and resulted in the manipulation of Queen Amidala to allow Palpatine to not only be allowed to be elected for Chancellor but to also be known as the leader of the Republic.
Palpatine would orchestrate this entire course of action involving his true intentions to be set in the journey to come, He would plan the future wars and showcase a manipulation from both the Trade Federation, soon to be the Separatist, and the Republic.

# The Clone Wars

The coming wars that would begin under Sidious’s influence were immeasurable.
The coming wars would be started on both sides through Sidious who both led the Separatists and the Republic.
In time the wars would lead to Sidious getting himself a new apprentice after the fall of his former apprentice Darth Maul, his apprentice would be far more powerful and leadership worthy and was a former Jedi Master known as Count Dooku, now known as Darth Tyranus.
Through Tyranus’s help, they would orchestrate the new war through a clone army.
They would attempt to make the Jedi feel desperate for an army which led to the formation of the new clone wars.
a war that resulted in the many ongoing battles between the Republic and the Separatists.

# The Order

The clone wars would be fierce in the coming times to come, in the last final days of the clone wars, the Jedi were on the brink of victory and was letting their guards down until, the commanding officers of every clone squad began the following order, the execution of Order 66, a horrifying time for the Jedi but a glorious day for the Sith, Order 66 resulted in manipulating the Clone Army through chips stored in their brains at birth allowed their brains to be tricked into believing that the Jedi were traitors of the Republic and they fired their blasters at every Jedi they laid their eyes upon.
This would bring the end of the Jedi Temple and result in the fall of the Jedi as a whole, very few Jedi survived, and if they did, they were hunted down by Darth Vader, Sidious’s new apprentice.

# The Empire

The last days of the Jedi were enough to allow Darth Sidious, now titled Emperor Palpatine, to bring order across the galaxy and bring everlasting peace to the people of the galaxy.
Because of Emperor Palpatine's new rule his new apprentice Darth Vader would now be tasked with eliminating the Jedi without the disapproval of the citizens of the planets.
resulting in very easy eliminations of the many Jedi Vader would meet.
Through Palpatine's time as Emperor, he would begin construction of the newly created space station, the Death Star, a powerful station capable of destroying entire planets.
through the time of the Death Star, however, the newly formed Rebel Alliance would foil the Death Stars capabilities and result in the very early destruction of the Death Star.
With this knowledge, Palpatine would play a very risky attempt to destroy the Rebels and finally bring Order back to the Galaxy.
Ultimately this would result in his demise as while building another Death Star, he would attempt to turn Luke Skywalker, Vader's son into the Dark Side, which would be unsuccessful and resulted in Palpatine attempting to eliminate Skywalker with Force Lightning.
Vader however could not watch his son be eliminated in front of him, so Vader turned to the Light side and eliminated Darth Sidious.

# The Final Chance

Darth Sidious was eliminated that day, but he saved himself by attempting one final force move that was a very dark power, very ancient as well, he used the Dark Side of the force to transfer his Spirit into a whole new body.
This resulted in Sidious becoming a Clone with force sensitivity.
With the new body, Sidious would attempt one last time to turn Luke to the Dark Side, He was successful this time and it resulted in the redemption of his former life.
However Luke was very quickly turned back to the Light and Palpatine was eliminated again, with one final attempt he used the Dark Side again to transfer himself into Luke's Nephew Anakin Solo, but would ultimately fail as a fallen Jedi by the name of EmpatoJayos Brand would intercept his spirit and drag him into the Depths of the Force finally removing Sidious from the face of the Galaxy.
