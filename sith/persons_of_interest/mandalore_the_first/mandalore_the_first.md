# Description
Mand’alor the First was the first founder of the Mandalorians, originally being a group mostly made out of Taungs coming from Coruscant, a now extinct species.
They left their planet to eventually settle on Mandalore, the now harsh and deserted planet.
They conquered it’s harshness and dangerous grounds and forests, proving themselves along with their Mand’alor as great warriors for facing the mighty Mythosaurs and leading them to extinction, believing that it was a planet only made for true Warriors.

Although Mandalore the Ultimate formed the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders in 7000 BBY, Mandalore the First was officially known as the first one to form Mandalorian Crusaders in 24000 BBY.

Not much is known of Mand’alor the First, however it is said he fell as a great Warrior in a duel with the next Mand’alor, Mand’alor the Conqueror.
