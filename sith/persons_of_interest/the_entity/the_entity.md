# The Entity

The Entity was a female Sith spirit that originated from Corellia and would soon be enslaved by a soon-to-be Dark Councilor and Sphere of Military Offense, Darth Baras.
Baras would use The Entity to accommodate his power towards his ascendance to the Dark Council with her powers of precognition and farseeing.
The Entity was known for almost eradicating the Jedi Order centuries before the Great Galactic War.
Dark Councilor Darth Vowrawn of the Sphere of Production and Logistics had mentioned that the Entity was as old as the Force itself and was an embodiment of the Dark side.
Darth Baras would come to indenture and bind the Entity to himself on Corellia sometime before the Galactic War between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic.
He stole the majority of her visions of the future as well as her power and energy, which he would then use to build his Empire.
The Entity, of course, hated being used in this way but was unable to counter Baras due to his power.

# History

Later on, Darth Vowrawn would begin to notice a change within Darth Baras, sensing the disruption and finding out about the Entity’s enslavement.
He would work for an unknown period of time in order to free the Entity from Baras’ grip.
As soon as Vowrawn figured out how to free the Entity from Baras’ grip, he would act upon his plan many years later, with the appearance of the second Emperor’s Wrath, who happened to be Darth Baras’ former apprentice.
However, Darth Vowrawn believed the Wrath was not aiding him in freeing the enslaved spirit until he was attacked by an assassin sent by Baras, in which the Wrath protected him.
This newly constructed friendship and trust would lead both of them to an assault on Baras’ on-world base.
Once the two Dark lords had reached the chambers of the Entity, they were attacked by a Cyborg named Draahg, who would place a death field upon Vowrawn.
Draahg’s cybernetics powered the death field, in which the Entity told the Wrath in order to rid Vowrawn of the death field, Draahg’s death would be necessary.
The Wrath decapitated Draahg after a long duel, releasing Vowrawn from the death field.
Before Vowrawn freed the Entity, he made sure of whether Baras could see what had happened there, knowing he was able to observe through the eyes of the Entity.
Once the Entity had been set free from their torture, she had told the Wrath to remember her before returning to the Force.
