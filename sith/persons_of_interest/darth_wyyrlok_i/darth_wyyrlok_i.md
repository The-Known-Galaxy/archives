# Biography
In the realm of the One Sith, Darth Wyyrlok emerged as a prominent figure several decades after the Galactic Civil War and the downfall of the Order of the Sith Lords.
Notably scarred from a previous injury that claimed his right horn, Wyyrlok assumed a crucial role as the executor of Darth Krayt's commands during the Dark Lord's prolonged stasis.
In 41 ABY, Krayt experienced a vision involving a frozen moon, prompting Wyyrlok to dispatch the Anzat assassin, Kell Douro, to the planet Fhost.
Douro was entrusted with the task of uncovering the hidden truth behind the vision, which Wyyrlok imprinted into the assassin's mind.
Soon after, Douro contacted Wyyrlok to relay information about pursuing the Jedi known as Jaden Korr into the Unknown Regions.
Recognizing Korr as a former apprentice of Kyle Katarn and therefore a formidable adversary, Wyyrlok acknowledged the threat posed by the Jedi.
Douro eventually located Korr at an Imperial research facility on the frozen moon but met his demise at the hands of Korr's associate, Khedryn Faal.
The encounter was captured by a recording device implanted in Douro's optic nerve, which Wyyrlok and the Umbaran Sith agent, Nyss Nenn, reviewed on Korriban.
The footage revealed a duel between Korr and the clone Alpha, witnessed by Douro before his demise.
In response, Wyyrlok provided Nenn with mindspears, ancient Rakatan technology capable of transferring memories into individuals.
He instructed Nenn to awaken an Iteration—a Sith-engineered clone of Jaden Korr—and, with the assistance of Nenn's sister, Syll, locate the real Korr.
Their objective was to utilize a mindspear to transfer the Jedi's consciousness into the Iteration, enabling the clone to infiltrate the ranks of the New Jedi Order.
