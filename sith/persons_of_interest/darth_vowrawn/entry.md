# Overview

Darth Vowrawn, also titled Emperor Vowrawn, was a Sith Lord and pureblood male Sith species with black hair and red eyes.
He was one of twelve servants within the Imperial Dark Council and soon was one of five.
Vowrawn, after the death of the current Empress Acina at the time, claimed the title of Emperor in the Sith Empire faction.
Vowrawn was a loyal Sith and served the Dark Council for decades before finally claiming the title of Emperor.
Vowrawn wasn’t an extremely powerful Sith like some Emperors before him but he did know a lot of Sith magic and rituals and he was the head of the Sphere of Production and Logistics which made him extremely talented in numbers which lead him to believe that the Sith Empire was out numbered compared to the Jedi Order.
The Emperor had a very loyal apprentice, Sith Lord Qet, who to show his respect and gratitude gathered an army of slaves and forced them to build a statue of Vowrawn in the Dromund Kaas jungle.
Vowrawn despised the Sith Lord Darth Baras.
Baras was going around claiming he was the voice of the Emperor and was aided by the force spirit known as the Entity.
Vowrawn then considered the only way to succeed in destroying Baras was to release the Entity and so he performed dark Sith magic and released the Entity.
After being severely wounded, Baras was sent to Korriban so that the Emperor’s Wrath could duel and since he was so desperate to overthrow the Emperor and survive he called upon the Dark Council to assist him.
Lucky for Vowrawn, the Dark Council ignored him and acknowledged the Emperor’s Wrath to duel Baras.
The Emperor’s Wrath killed Baras for his lies; he told everyone about him being the Voice of the Emperor so he could become Emperor himself.
The Emperor also witnessed an odd thing not long after.
Darth Thanaton was going to execute his rival Lord Kallig, Darth Nox, but he was reluctant and failed.
Darth Mortis snapped his head and Darth Nox took his place in the Dark Council and became the new head of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge.

# Abilities and Traits

Darth Vowrawn was a charming and intelligent elderly individual.
He was the head of the Sphere of Production and Logistics which showed his intelligence.
He was a powerful force wielder holding the capability to do rituals, magic and freeing the Entity from imprisonment.
He was also very loyal especially when the Eternal Empire invaded the Republic and Sith Empire then when all the Dark Council members died Vowrawn pledged his allegiance to the Eternal Emperor, Arcann.
For a little bit he served as the head of the Sphere of Civil Administration, which was the overlooking of supplies and weaponry for the Empire and enforcing its laws.
Not long after this he became Emperor after Empress Acina died he assumed that he could be her successor so he took the throne and claimed the title of Emperor.
Then he sent Darth Malgus, a slave at that time, to invade Ossus and the beginning of the third galactic war against the Jedi and the Republic.
As Emperor he abolished the anti-alien rule of the Sith Emperor and supported Darth Karrid’s ascension to becoming a member of the Dark Council.
During the Cold War Vowrawn’s skilled combat abilities started withering because of his old age and so he relied on his charm and deceptions to win the war.
He disguised himself as an important Republic asset and planned the death of Darth Baras not only that but he was also able to claim the title of Emperor and be the longest lasting member in the Dark Council at his time.
Darth Vowrawn was a very wise Sith Lord and was dedicated to the Sith and their ways but also loyal to his peers and to the Eternal and Sith Empire.
