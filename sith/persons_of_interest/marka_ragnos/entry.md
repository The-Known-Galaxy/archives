# Section I

Born a sith-human hybrid, Marka Ragnos was a direct descendant of the Dark Jedi who would flee from the Republic after the Hundred Year Darkness.
Ragnos was admired, feared, wise and powerful, and obeyed among the Sith.
He was even considered to be the best Dark Lord of the Sith during his time.
Ragnos was born a long time before 5100 BBY.
When another Dark Lord of the Sith died, Ragnos and Simus, another Sith Lord, took up the mantle.
In order to claim the rank for himself, Ragnos had to fight Simus, a formidable warrior in combat.
Ragnos eventually won the duel, defeating Simus and becoming a Dark Lord of the Sith.
As a Dark Lord of the Sith, Marka Ragnos would lead many campaigns against his Sith enemies, pitting his opponents against each other to ensure his right to the throne.
He would rule for over a century with an iron-fist.
Ragnos composed his own Epistle, a document of literary work authored by Ragnos, which would eventually be destroyed by Celeste Morne at some point prior to 3963 BBY.
Ragnos also created a Scepter, nicknamed the Scepter of Ragnos capable of drawing out the Force from many different places, which could be utilized to empower other Force-users around him.
Ragnos then created a pair of gauntlets capable of increasing the strength of the Force in its users.
Many years later, a thirteen-year-old boy named Tenebrae would show himself and petition himself before Marka Ragnos and the ruler of the Sith Council of the Sith Empire at the time.
He asked for Marka Ragnos to train him in the arts of the Sith and bestow upon him ruler of his father’s domain, the planet known as Medriaas.
Although Ragnos did take him on as a Sith Apprentice, he was impressed by the courage and ambition of Tenebrae, granting him ruler of Medriaas along with the rank of Sith Lord which would grant him the name known as Vitiate.
After his rule, Ragnos passed away in the year 5000 BBY.
His death marked the end of a golden age for the Sith even though the Sith Empire was still in its expansion after his death.
He was truly the greatest Dark Lord of the Sith during his time.

However, Marka Ragnos’ legacy as a Dark Lord of the Sith continued on after his death, the Ragnos Lakes, on the planet Kesh for instance, were named after the Dark Lord.
Two Sith Lords, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh emerged as favorites among the Sith who soon would duel in order to reach the throne as the newest Dark Lord of the Sith.
The two engaged in a duel of Sith swords, after a disagreement as to who would better serve the Sith Empire.
Ragnos’ spirit appeared before the dueling Sith, proclaiming in a great speech that only the most worthy could succeed him on the throne.
After the duel, Naga Sadow emerged victorious and reached the title of Dark Lord of the Sith.
Vitiate, however, did not join in on the succession of Marka Ragnos, he remained hidden until he saw the time to be right.
About a millennium after his death, Marka Ragnos was unintentionally summoned from his grave by Sith Lord Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma with the assistance of Sith talismans.
He claimed that Exar Kun would become the new Dark Lord of the Sith, and Ulic Qel-Droma would be the first of his Sith Apprentices all in an attempt to restore the lost empire of a thousand years prior.
The Great Sith War devastated the galaxy, but the Sith Empire, however, was not restored.
A few decades after Ragnos’ death, Vitiate reconstituted the Sith Empire once again, lighting a new war upon the Galactic Republic 1,319 years after Marka Ragnos’ death.
By the time of the Galactic War, the Force Ghost of Marka Ragnos would appear on the Fourth moon of Yavin Prime, roaming a cave known as the Architect’s Hollow.

# Section III

Thousands of years after Marka Ragnos’ actual death, during the time of the New Republic era, in 14 ABY, the Disciples of Ragnos, a Sith Cult, rose up in an attempt to resurrect Marka Ragnos from the grave and summon him as a Spirit.
The Leader of this cult was Tavion Axmis, Desann’s student.
Tavion used a Scepter, once used by Marka Ragnos, to siphon Force energy from many Force Nexuses around the galaxy and use it on the members of the Disciples of Ragnos to empower their Force abilities.
Once Tavion collected the amount of Force energy needed, he would use the remainder of it to resurrect the Dark Lord.
However, the New Jedi Order was tracking the Disciples across the galaxy.
Jedi Luke Skywalker and Kyle Katarn were in charge of the campaign to find the Disciples of Ragnos on Korriban; they dispatched any and all available Jedi from the Temple on Yavin 4.
Among them, a Jedi named Jaden Korr, would participate in the missions against the Disciples of Ragnos for almost the entirety of the campaign.
Korr managed to enter Ragnos’ tomb on Korriban during the time of the Battle of Korriban when Axmis managed to resurrect the spirit of Marka Ragnos, but Ragnos would ultimately and inevitably be defeated by Korr herself, forcing his spirit back into the sarcophagus as he screamed out that he would return.
