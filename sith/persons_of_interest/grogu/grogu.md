# Overview

Grogu, also referred to as the Child, was a Force-sensitive male   born in 41 BBY.
His species is unknown, but it is the same mysterious, legendary species as the powerful Jedi Yoda and Yaddle.
Grogu is the adorable child of the Mandalorian (Din Djarin).
The two are not biologically related, but they do share a special bond.
This bond they share prevents Grogu from becoming a powerful Jedi, but the bond makes sure that Grogu follows Din Djarin so they can work as a team to survive the harsh galaxy.
Grogu was one of the only Jedi to survive Order 66, and was trained by many different masters when he grew up on Coruscant.
It is unknown how he escaped Order 66, but someone must have rescued him because he witnessed the 501st Legion kill three Jedi before managing to escape.
Eventually, he ended up finding Din Djarin.

# Mando's child

Grogu was quite old, even though he appeared to possess the physique of a child.
Mando and an IG unit droid, IG-11, were bounty hunters, and their bounty was Grogu.
They found Grogu in a Nikto encampment and saved him from them.
Eventually, they found themselves on Tatooine.
Mando was attacked by a Mudhorn during this time, but Grogu saved him by lifting the mudhorn so Mando could stab it, Grogu was then unconscious.
Still venturing through the galaxy, Grogu found a silver ball, which was the knob for a control on the Razor Crest, which was Mando’s ship.
Mando was then forced to deliver Grogu to the Imperial figure who sent him.
The Imperial’s name was never mentioned but he was referred to as “the client”.
Doctor Pershing, another Imperial, wanted to study Grogu because of his uniqueness which could be valuable to the Empire’s rise back to power.
Pershing took Grogu, which left Mando skeptical about what they wanted to do with him.
Mando didn’t like the idea of leaving Grogu with the Imperials, so he brought havoc upon the Imperials until he saved Grogu.
They were then opposed by the Bounty Hunter’s Guild.
Luckily for Mando, his tribe came to save him.
Grogu and Mando escaped and once again Grogu reached out for the ball, this time Mando happily gave it to him.
The two went on a lot of missions together so Mando could earn a few credits.
Mando, Cara Dune, and Greef Karga were ambushed by Mopff Gideon and a squad of Death Troopers, Gideon wieldedthe legendary artifact, the Darksaber.
Eventually, they found themselves face to face with the famous ex-Jedi, Ahsoka Tano, who tried to help Grogu use the Force.
Grogu’s connection to Mando was so strong that if he became too powerful in the Force, his emotions might go flooding out and he would cause damage.
Ahsoka couldn’t help Grogu.
Once again, Grogu found himself in the hands of the Imperials and Moff Gideon took him aboard a Light Cruiser.
Mando, Greef Karga, Dune, Fennec Shand, and the legendary Boba Fett went on a rescue mission to save Grogu from Gideon’s forces.
Mando beat Gideon in combat and so he was given the precious Darksaber.
Gideon had a few tricks up his sleeves, he dispatched a squad of Dark Troopers to trap Mando and his gang.
They were all saved by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, who took Grogu so he could be trained.

# Jedi or Mandalorian

Grogu was once again trained by a Jedi.
Luke trained Grogu and taught him a few things, which included Force jumping.
Grogu was trained on the planet Ossus, where Luke started to build his own Jedi Order, but he wasn’t trained for long.
Mando came to Ossus and made a small armor out of Beskar, which was meant for Grogu.
He gave the armor to Ahsoka and she gave it to Luke.
Grogu was faced with a choice, become the first Jedi in Luke’s new academy or join Mando.
Obviously, Grogu chose Mando and returned to Tatooine.
He found Peli Motto, a friend of Mando’s who was a mechanic, and fixed the Razor Crest a few times.
Peli took Grogu to see Mando, but he was in the middle of a battle to help Boba Fett.
Grogu helped in the battle.
Boba and his allies defeated most of the enemy and his Rancor then went rogue.
Grogu went to touch the Rancor and put him to sleep.
After the battle was done, Mando decided to travel to Mandalore so he could go to a sacred river since he took off his helmet.
Grogu, once again, had the significant silver ball and in Mando’s new ship, which was a Naboo Starfighter, Grogu tapped the ball against the window so Mando could jump to hyperspace, which Grogu loved.
Mando at first told him to stop, but then he couldn’t help it and let Grogu convince him to.
