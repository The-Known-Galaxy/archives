Tyrans, also known as “The Tactician of the Masters”, was the unofficial “red-right-hand” to Dread Master Raptus, and was also the more vocal Dread Master among his peers.
Tyrans wielded a black and white bladed lightsaber.
He was considered the mastermind behind the tactics used by the Dread Guard and Dread Hosts on Oricon; he treated confrontation as a game in their Palace, using the floors of the sanctum to make a fight more interesting to the opponent.
Tyrans was a master of the Force, unlike many of his fellow Dread Masters.
His arsenal consisted of a thundering blast, shock, and death’s mark, all powerful abilities he would utilize in battle, and would not be underestimated.
Death’s Mark would cause the victim to wither and die in seconds.
Tyrans was a foe to be reckoned with.
