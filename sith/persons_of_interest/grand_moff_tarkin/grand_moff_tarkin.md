# The Empire

After the fall of the republic, Tarkin enlisted for the imperial navy (ranked Admiral) and was also made Moff of the Greater Seswenna Sector by Emperor Palpatine.
Tarkin’s career would not end here as he achieved the status of Grand Moff of the outer rim territories due to his efforts in exterminating all resistance to Palpatine reign.
