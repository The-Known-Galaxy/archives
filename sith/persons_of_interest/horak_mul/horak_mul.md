# Overview
Horak-Mul was a male Sith from the pureblood Sith species with a cybernetic eye.
Like most purebloods, he had red skin and red eyes.
He became a Sith Lord a few years before the Great Hyperspace war and was a native to one of the regions of the Sith Empire.
Because of the death of Marka Ragnos, two powerful Sith Lords, Ludo Kressh and Naga Sadow, decided to claim the title.
Kressh wanted it so he could gain power and Sadow wanted to expand the Sith Empire and had ambitions of his own.
Horak was a very big supporter of Ludo Kressh to become Dark Lord of the Sith.
He called himself the right hand of Ludo Kressh and called Kressh the true Dark Lord of the Sith.
After the death of the Dark Lord of the Sith Marka Ragnos, there was a schism within the Empire between Kressh and Naga Sadow, his biggest rival.
Kressh after witnessing Sadow going into battles with the Republic ordered his most trusted Sith, Korak and Dor Gal-ram to start a raid against Naga Sadow and his disciples.
Horak’s flagship and the members on it were told by Naga to kill Horak and both Horak and Dor died in the raid, killed by their own soldiers leaving Naga Shadow the victor.
Kressh also died in battle.
Horak’s body went missing and his eye with it.
A few scavengers found his eye and the body and buried him on the moon of Yavin 4 but Horak’s spirit possessed the crew and drove them insane.
He also drove an Ortolan chief insane when they encountered the Sith Inquisitor Kallig.
Kallig possessed powers that could blind people and Horak allowed Kallig to blind him if he carried out a task for the Sith Lord which was destroying a temple on Hoth.
Horak then told Kallig the location of his spirit and a little while later after being possessed Kallig was driven insane by Horak and Kallig tried to subdue the spirit.
However, he used Horak to kill Darth Thanaton and join the Dark Council.
Horak decided to stay in Kallig’s mind otherwise he would’ve been living in his tomb on Hoth.
Horak wielded a purple bladed lightsaber and wore an elegant robe during the raid against Shadow.
His prosthetic right eye was considered fashionable during his time and a thousand years after his death a Jedi covenant found his eye and stole it.
