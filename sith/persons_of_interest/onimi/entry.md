# Overview

Onimi was a male from the Yuuzhan Vong species.
He was a Shamed Shaper and, other than another mystery individual and a questionable exception, the sole Force-sensitive member of his kind.
At the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, Onimi turned out to be the actual force behind the Yuuzhan Vong.

# Biography

Onimi, a member of the Elite, was a shaper.
He gradually acknowledged that the eighth cortex, which was meant to bear the wisdom required to survive the decades of conflict that the Yuuzhan Vong had consigned themselves to, was hollow.
Onimi was recognized as a Shamed One after adding yammosk tissue to his brain, taking the shape of a psychologically and physically warped, crazy beast.
He blamed the gods, particularly Yun-Harla the Trickster goddess, for his misfortunes.
These changes made his social position crumble; he was treated as an annoyance and continuously underestimated.
However, Supreme Overlord Shimrra did not despise him but instead treated him like a pet.
The unknown reason for this was Onimi's connection to the force, a connection long lost in the Yuuzhan Vong.

The force gave him the possibility of playing with other people's minds.
In addition, due to the experiments he suffered, Onimi could amplify the force he used and exude toxins from any part of his body.
Trying to regain his position, Onimi used Shimrra.
He encouraged him to embrace him as a familiar, turning him into a trickster for the new leader.
Taking advantage of this new connection, he took an active role in deciding the species' new home.
All in the shadows with the hope of returning to a position that was once his.

# The Court of the Supreme Overlord

Onimi wasn't solely a trickster.
Under an alias, he collaborated with Nen Yim, another Vong, to develop the eighth cortex and new technologies for the Yuuzhan Vong.
When the invasion wasn't going the way he intended, he took matters into his own hands.
Nen was tasked with introducing information into the cortex, while Onimi interfered with the court of Shimrra.
Nevertheless, he didn't have knowledge of war, and the warmaster's mistakes werenÂ´t for him to blame.
Their invasion of Coruscant was a failure, which led to their extermination by the now-named Galactic Alliance.

# Revelation

During the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, when Luke Skywalker and the Solo twins infiltrated Shimrra's quarters, Onimi directed the biologically modified Slayer soldiers as they sought to repel the Jedi.
Their defeat made Onimi flee without a choice.
Jaina, one of the Solo twins, pursued him to the throne room but was swiftly incapacitated.
Now woken up, Jayla saw with terror Onimi's true form and intentions.
It was revealed that he was the true mastermind behind Yuuzhan Vong.
Furthermore, her use of Yun-Harla's reputation fueled even more of Onimi's hatred; he saw her as responsible for his tragic life.
His true plan was to become a god by sending the Alpha Red pathogen to Zonama Sekot, Vong's origin planet.
Onimi sensed the arrival of the other Solo Twin, Jacen.
In him, he saw the living image of Yun-Shuno, a goddess known to pardon the Shamed One.
Her death, from Onimi's point of view, was the pivotal point in his rise as a god.
Therefore, he attacked Jacen, but unbeknownst to him, the Jedi had reached full connection with the Force, becoming one with it.
With this power, he cured him using the pure power of the Force, eliminating all deformations.
However, this led to Onimi's connection to the Force being lost and his resistance against toxins dissipating.
These events caused his body to collapse and turn into a pool of toxic residue.
His death and the loss of his connection caused the citadel to tremble and inevitably fall.

# Legacy

Jacen's confrontation with Onimi had profound implications for Solo in the future.
Jacen's perception of oneness with the Force gave him the same concept as the Unifying Force doctrine itself: he had transcended good and evil, light and dark.
This event drove his mentality through the floor, leading him to lose his Jedi ways.
Jacen eventually became Darth Caedus, the Sith Lord, and perished at the hands of Jaina, the sister he spared from Onimi.
