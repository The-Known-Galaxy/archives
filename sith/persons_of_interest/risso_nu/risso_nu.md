# Overview:
A bounty hunter named Risso Nu planned an ambush to kill Boba Fett and steal his identity.

# Biography:
Risso Nu established himself as one of the most skilled bounty hunters in the Core Worlds while operating there, but he developed a fixation with taking down Boba Fett in order to establish himself as the galaxy's top hunter.


Nu enlisted the help of other people who harboured animosity toward the top bounty hunter in the galaxy on the isolated planet Ma'ar Shaddam.
They would get their retribution, and he would have the chance to become well-known.
He determined when and where Fett would have his armour maintained and be most exposed by using information he learned from a Kowakian monkey-lizard.


Together with a droid bounty hunter, the group included Toosog, Eermik, Nagyan, Mudmub, and Toosog.
They raided the weaponsmith's hideout in a mountain tunnel after waiting until they were sure Fett was defenceless and without armour.
Despite being well-armed, each one was defeated by an unarmed Fett.
Risso was the sole survivor and was successful in obtaining the renowned Mandalorian armour.
In a last-second fit of desperation, Risso hijacked Fett's starship, Slave I, and used its missiles to destroy the cave.


He put on the armour and pretended to be Boba Fett in a nearby cantina because he thought Fett had been slain in the blast.
His newfound renown, however, was short-lived as the real Boba Fett, who was still very much alive and was sporting an extra set of armour, showed up, severely battered him, and then took back the armour and his identity.
To remind the galaxy who was in charge, Boba Fett made the decision to let him live.
