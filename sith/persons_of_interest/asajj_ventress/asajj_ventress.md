# Overview
Asajj Ventress was a female dathomirian Zabrak born in 50 BBY on her species homeworld Dathomir.
As a child, she was surrendered by her coven to Hal’Sek, a Siniteen criminal who took Ventress as his own personal slave on the planet Rattatak.
Her servitude wouldn’t last long, as Hal’Sek was later killed by Weequay pirates, orphaning the young night-sister.
She was later discovered by Jedi Knight Ky Narec, who was stranded on the planet.
Narec took her as a padawan learner and taught her in the ways of the Force.
As master and apprentice, the two Jedi protected the people of Rattatak against pirates and warlords.
After ten years of this, Ky Narec would be killed by warlords who sought to kill the Jedi and end his crusade.
Enraged by the death of her master, Ventress embraced the dark side of the Force, killing the warlords and taking their place.
At some point before the Clone Wars, Ventress was discovered by the Sith Lord Count Dooku, who began her training as a secret Sith apprentice.


At the time of the Clone Wars, Asajj Ventress was assigned as a commander of the CIS droid army and secret assassin.
Her deeds caught the attention of the Jedi Order, bringing her into conflict with the order; particularly Obi-Wan Kenobi and his protege Anakin Skywalker (to whom she allegedly gave a scar near his right-eye).
Dooku’s master Darth Sidious also became increasingly wary of Ventress.
Fearing that she was a threat to his plans for galactic domination, Sidious ordered his apprentice to eliminate the Dathomirian.
Dooku complied, turning against her at the Battle of Sullust.
Ventress managed to escape her death, returning to Dathomir and plotting revenge on the Sith Lord.
She would eventually hire Savage Opress, a male Dathomirian Zabrak and brother of Darth Maul to train under Dooku in order to become strong enough in the dark side of the Force to help Ventress kill Dooku.
This plan failed after Opress betrayed and nearly killed them both.
After narrowly escaping death for the second time, Ventress returned to Dathomir to rejoin the Nightsister Clan.
Unfortunately, Dooku was enraged at the attempt on his life, sending Grievous and a detachment of battle droids to eliminate the Nightsisters.
Mother Talzan and Asajj Ventress were among few who managed to escape.

Saddened by the loss of her new family, Asajj left Dathomir in search of purpose.
She eventually took up bounty hunting, where she grew her hair out and traded her dual red lightsabers for a single-bladed yellow lightsaber.
During her time as a bounty hunter, Asajj met Quinlan Vos, a Jedi Master who was undercover, having been sent by the Jedi Order to assassinate Count Dooku.
The two reluctantly became friends and later fell in love, after Vos revealed his identity as a Jedi to Ventress.
Vos ultimately left the Jedi Order to be with Ventress, after which the two set out to assassinate Dooku as Vos had initially been assigned to do.
After a brief skirmish with the Sith Lord, Ventress was forced to flee and Quinlan Vos was taken hostage by Dooku who tortured the Jedi for months and revealed to him the secrets of Ventress’ past.
Enraged by this news and having been tortured for months on end, Vos turned to the dark side.
Knowing this, Ventress turned to the Jedi Council.
The council did not believe Vos had actually turned to the dark side and once again tasked Vos with assassinating Dooku.
Ventress reluctantly helped Vos and Dooku escape Jedi prosecution, where she sacrificed herself to save Quinlan Vos from death at the hands of Dooku.
The death of his lover gave Quinlan the motivation to return to the light.
The Jedi Council would later reinstate Vos as a Jedi and pardon Ventress of her crimes against the order to honour her sacrifice.
Ventress’ body was laid to rest in the waters of her clan’s village on Dathomir.
