# Overview
Darth Qalar was a female Dark Lord of the Sith who was of Pureblood or human race.
She served the reconstituted Sith Empire as Dark Councillor.
Darth Qalar and Darth Victun, a fellow Dark Councillor, fought each other in one of the most brutal humiliation Kaggaths and destroyed one of the Imperial citadels on the hidden planet of the Sith Empire, Dromund Kaas, which infuriated the Emperor.
The two called it a draw and were both later executed by the Dark Council, who got the order from the Emperor.
The Council also had to kill their bloodlines, leaving no survivors.
They used the possessions of Qalar, Victun and their bloodlines to rebuild the citadel.
