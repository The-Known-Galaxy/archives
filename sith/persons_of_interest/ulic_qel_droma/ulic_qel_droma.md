# Overview
Ulic Qel-Droma was a Fallen Jedi who was considered by many as one of the most powerful Jedi and Sith of his time.
Qel-Droma was skilled with the Force, mastering abilities such as Mind Trick, Force Barrier, Force Scream, Force Choke, and Sever Force.
Ulic was also talented in lightsaber combat, mastering Form V, also known as Djem-So.

# Fall to the Dark Side
The reason Qel-Droma joined the Krath and the Sith Empire wasn’t because he wanted to be as powerful as any other person.
Instead, he wanted to avenge all of the Jedi who died at the hands of the Krath group.
He did let his teammates know about his idea, and although everyone disagreed with it, he ignored them and left the Jedi Order.
Before leaving for Empress Teta, he went to Ossus’ library to meet his brother, Cay Qel-Droma, for the last time before departing.
Even though Cay knew his brother wouldn’t come back to the Light Side of the Force, he trusted Ulic.
After disguising as a smuggler, Ulic Qel-Droma went to the planet Empress Teta to infiltrate its capital city, Cinnagar.
He was surprised when he saw the Krath was holding a public execution against those who disagreed with their rule.
Qel-Droma watched the execution in secret until a carbonite trader known as Farng threw a knife at Aleema Keto, the co-founder of Krath.
Seeing his plan was in danger, he killed Farng with a lightsaber swing in an attempt to showcase loyalty to the Krath.
Aleema was impressed with the Fallen Jedi’s skill and brought Qel-Droma to Krath’s Iron Citadel.
However, he was betrayed by the female Krath member who knocked Ulic down.
After waking up, Ulic Qel-Droma was questioned by Satal and Aleema keto and tortured by an interrogation droid.
Qel-Droma was punished heavily by the Ketos, but thanks to a massive outburst of Force Energy, he freed himself but fell unconscious again.
After waking up once again, he was informed that a female Jedi was taken prisoner by the Krath; her name was Nomi Sunrider, a Jedi who came to Empress Teta to save the Jedi Knight.
Surprised by this notice, Ulic told Satal Keto he would execute her.
As expected, Ulic Qel-Droma wouldn’t kill a fellow teammate and sent her a message through a servant droid.
Satal eventually found out Qel-Droma failed Krath and sent an assassin known as Norgor to kill the traitor.
The assassin tried to shoot Qel-Droma but was killed easily by the Jedi Knight.
During that time, Sunrider escaped the captors and went to the Iron Citadel, where Qel-Droma’s brother and Tott Doneeta were waiting for her.
As expected, Krath forces were notified about the escape and engaged the Jedi.
As well, Qel-Droma went to Satal Keto’s to avenge Arca Jeth and finally kill him.
Satal Keto knew what he was doing and slowly manipulated the Jedi Knight into the Dark Side of the Force through hatred and anger.
The outcome of this duel ended with Qel-Droma successfully killing the Krath Ruler.
Qel-Droma then returned to the Iron Citadel with Aleema Keto, his new lover.
While they talked about the future of their relationship, they heard sounds of laser fire; a battle in the sky was happening between the Jedi Forces and the Krath.
This battle occurred because the fugitive Sunrider, along with Cay Qel-Droma, and Tott Doneeta, were trying to rescue the Jedi Knight by telling them he was under a Dark Illusion attack.
Ulic didn’t believe them and didn’t go with them.
After leaving the rescuers aside, he met a Fallen Jedi known as Exar Kun.
Aleema attempted to kill Exar but failed, and instead, Ulic did.
These two possessed an amulet, both of which started glowing during the fight.
These amulets invoked a ghost image of Marka Ragnos, who told them to stop fighting.
He then named Exar Kun as the new Dark Lord of the Sith, and Ulic Qel-Droma as Exar Kun’s Sith Apprentice.



# Serving under Exar Kun
During the Great Sith War, Exar Kun’s Sith Apprentice was tasked to form an army, something he did in 3996 BBY after meeting a Mandalorian clan and their leader, Mandalore the Indomitable.
Instead of surrendering, the Mand’alor challenged the new Sith Lord to a duel; if the Mand’alor won, he would get the seven worlds of the Empress system, but if Qel-Droma won, Mand’alor and his crusaders would have to swear loyalty to him, and the Sith Empire.
After a tough battle between both individuals, Qel-Droma was the winner.
Mandalore the Indomitable would act as a Lieutenant of Qel-Droma’s forces while he would act as a Commander.
During an attack on Foerost, Qel-Droma, along with his forces, decided to assault Coruscant.
After arriving at the Republic’s capital, he and his troops moved into the Republic war room to crush their central military command.
Unfortunately for him, his lover, Aleema Keto, betrayed Qel-Droma by telling his forces to retreat, leaving him alone with his personal guardsmen.
Before destroying the Republic Navy, he was arrested and put on trial by the Senate.
During this trial, Qel-Droma was accused of all his crimes against the galaxy, the most important one being him breaking the oath of allegiance to the Republic.
While this trial was going on, Exar Kun and Mandalorian the Indomitable interrupted the tribunal with their forces.
Ulic was rescued successfully, and along with Exar Kun, they cleared the courtroom.
Mandalorian then told his commander that Aleema Keto had betrayed him and that she could no longer be trusted.
After this, both Master and Apprentice headed to the Jedi Library on Ossus for Jedi treasures.
During this mission, Ulic met his brother, Cay Qel-Droma, who he tried to bring down.
Cay survived the strike.
However, he later died in a duel between him and his brother.
Ulic Qel-Droma fell to tears after realizing what he had done.
Nomi and Tott arrived after the fight and saw what the Sith Lord did.
After seeing one of her teammates was dead, Nomi projected a Sever Force attack on Qel-Droma that stripped his connection through the Force.



# Redemption and Death
Ulic Qel-Droma decided to exile himself eight years after the death of his brother.
Although he was alone now, he couldn’t achieve peace and thought the Force had abandoned him.
Qel-Droma was in fact, not alone, because the Force Spirit of his Jedi Master, Arca Jeth, appeared to him and told Qel-Droma to keep going.
During his time on the planet Rhen Var, Qel-Droma met the girl who would be later his apprentice, Vima Sunrider.
Vima was as expected from Qel-Droma, his first lover’s daughter.
The young girl asked Ulic Qel-Droma to be her master, something he thought wouldn’t be appropriate because he no longer held a connection to the Force.
Qel-Droma agreed in the end and taught his new apprentice everything he knew.
Although he was no longer a Force user, Qel-Droma taught Vima the ways of the Force.
The young apprentice learned Qel-Droma’s teachings really fast, and her master decided it was time to build her lightsaber.
After using an Adegan Crystal from his father, Andur Sunrider, they started dueling.
During a sparring session, Qel-Droma decided to teach his apprentice about the burdens of being a Jedi.
During the talk, Vima sensed her mother was close to the fortress they were inside.
Nomi told her daughter to leave Qel-Droma, but she refused because her master taught her a lot.
While Vima was showcasing to her mother what he learned, Qel-Droma thanked his Jedi Master for convincing him of living.
During the talk both master and padawan had, a Cathar Jediknown as Sylvar called Qel-Droma out and engaged him into a lightsaber fight.
Qel-Droma lost the duel, but Sylvar let him live because she avenged her lover.
However, a blaster bolt from Hoggon assassinated the exiled Sith Lord, who died in Nomi’s arms.
