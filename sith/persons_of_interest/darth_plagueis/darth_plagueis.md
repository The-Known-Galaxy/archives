# Introduction
Darth Plagueis was a very powerful Dark Lord of the Sith, he possessed a very unique power which allowed him to manipulate the many midi-chlorians to create life.
Darth Plagueis used this power for many occasions and used it to help him in the coming wars his Sith Order would lead.
Darth Plagueis would eventually have many enemies which would allow the Republic and also the Jedi to constantly be in a serious problem dealing with the many wars Plagueis would secretly start.

# Early Life
Darth Plagueis originally known as Hego Damask II was born in the year 200 - 100 BBY and the Planet Mygeeto and son to Caar Damask, who was Mygeetos Administrator.
Hego would grow up very powerful with the Force at such an early age, He used to use the force move, Force Manipulation to do dark things to the many kids at his school and world.
At the age of five he would discover this knowledge and would eventually be handpicked by Darth Tenebrous to serve as his Apprentice.
From there he would attend his mission to eliminate the natives of Kursid, and cement his place as Darth Plagueis.



# The Apprentice
Darth Plagueis would start to look for a worthy Apprentice and would find the perfect one in the Planet of Naboo.
through this young corrupt civilian he would learn of his extreme power in the force.
This young Hopeful known as Sheev Palpatine would be trained by Darth Plagueis and learn the many ways of the Force and they would eventually work towards giving Sheev now Darth Sidious a new spot as a Senator and work towards giving him the title of Chancellor.



# The Betrayal
Darth Plagueis wanted to work towards rising through the ranks with Darth Sidious, and work on learning about his power to better understand his capabilities and finally learn to use it against his many enemies.
Darth Sidious had other plans unfortunately and this led to Sidious eliminating Darth Plagueis in his sleep resulting in a fall of a powerful Sith Lord, and ending the rise of the Sith.
however, this would eventually be revealed to rise in the form of Darth Sidious and Darth Vader, a duo that was just as powerful as Darth Plagueis and Darth Sidious.
