# Overview

Darth Lokess was a female being of either human or Pureblood descent, who served the reconstituted Sith Empire as a Dark Council member.
She was a Dark Lord of the Sith and served the Empire during its early years.
She was the one who came up with the idea to kill the powerful Sith Emperor.
One day during a deadly storm on the Imperial capital planet Dromund Kaas, Lokess called upon her fellow Dark Councillors to discuss her plot to kill the Emperor.
She made sure that her loyal followers were outside the meeting place so they could deal with anyone that refused, however, they all agreed.
Her fellow Dark Councillor went to face the Emperor but in a quick and single flash of light, they all died.
The Emperor locked Lokess away in his Citadel and tortured her all the way until she died.
