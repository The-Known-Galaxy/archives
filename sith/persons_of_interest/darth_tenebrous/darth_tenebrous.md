# Overview

Darth Tenebrous was a male Bith Dark Lord of the Sith that served the Sith until his death in 67 BBY against one of the Sith masterminds known as Darth Plagueis.
Besides being affiliated with Darth Bane’s Rule of Two, he broke it as he had one secret apprentice other than Darth Plagueis, who was Darth Venamis.

# History

During his time as an Apprentice under a Twi’lek Sith Lord, Darth Tenebrous learnt a few things about the Force, being one of these that like any other energy source, the Dark Side of the Force could be manipulated for his own power.
After killing his Sith Master, Darth Tenebrous was on the look for a new Sith Apprentice.
Darth Tenebrous, also known as Rugess Nome, decided to take in a five-year-old Muun child known as Hego Damask, who turned into the Dark Side under the name of Darth Plagueis.

In 67 BBY, Darth Tenebrous, along with Darth Plagueis, went to Bal’demnic to investigate a lode of cortosis ore.
The investigation didn’t go well, as their M2 mining probe droid ignited a gas that caused a massive explosion.
Although the Bith Dark Lord contained the explosion, his Sith Apprentice betrayed him by collapsing the ceiling of the cavern on his Sith Master and killing him.
However, this decision did put at risk the life of the Sith, as Darth Plagueis’ starship was destroyed.

# Tenebrous' thoughts and abilities

Darth Tenebrous was a specialist in predicting the future, something that his Sith Apprentice, Darth Plagueis, thought happened because of his Sith Master’s race.
Along with this, Darth Tenebrous was a Sith who thought the Force was nothing else than a useful tool for the people who used it.

Tenebrous was a very skilled Force user, as he mastered a few abilities, such as Force Speed, Telekinesis, and Red Force Lightning.
As well, he was a talented lightsaber duelist, something he passed on mostly to his secret Sith Apprentice, Darth Venamis.
However, the lightsaber skill didn’t save Venamis from dying at the hands of Darth Plagueis “the wise”.
