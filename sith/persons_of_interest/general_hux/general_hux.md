# Introduction

General Hux is a First Order officer, young, ambitious, and cruel.
He has absolute confidence in his soldiers and the way they are trained.
His father held a high position in the former Imperial Academy, and Hux is very proud of his background.
He believes that he is destined to sit on the throne from which he will rule the galaxy.
However, all of Hux's knowledge of military craft is mostly theoretical.
The same Kylo Ren has a low opinion of Hux as a warrior.
Hux, in turn, being a rational person, does not understand well the mystical part of the First Order that Kylo Ren represents.

# Section 1

Hux's authority as a general extends beyond the military; he is also the Commander-in-Chief of Starkiller Base and can issue orders regarding the use of its destructive weapons but only after Snoke approves of this decision.
Hux was still a child when the Empire and the New Republic signed a truce agreement.
His father left the Academy on Arkanis and was one of those Imperials who went into self-imposed exile in the Unknown Regions (which the Empire was secretly exploring).
Hux grew up with the legends of the great Imperials and how the Empire saved the Galaxy from the horror of the Clone Wars.
Hux firmly believes that the galaxy must be saved from itself, as the New Republic is too weak to prevent the coming chaos.

# Section 2

Any stormtrooper knows that getting caught by Captain Phasma while violating the First Order Charter is a real punishment in every sense.
Even this is preferable to catching the general's eye.
Dinner?
You don't eat.
Dream?
You are not asleep.
Free time?
Given to you for self-development and improvement of skills.
Have you done everything yet?
You don't know what else you can do for the benefit of the First Order?
At best, you will be sent for a psychiatric examination.
Hallucinations about the fall of the Republic are ideologically true, but, like any hallucinations, they are dangerous.
In this issue (as in all others) there are no double standards.
If Hux doesn't do anything for the First Order, then he's already dead.
Often skips meals and takes hours away from sleep to work.
From childhood, I knew that I would rule the Galaxy.
Hux is one of those who does not command but has the honor of commanding.
The meaning of his life is service, and what is absolute service if not absolute power?
Power that takes away your family, safety, health, and time giving you the happiness of realizing that everything in the Galaxy is now as it should be.
He's ready for this.
He doesn't need anything else.
