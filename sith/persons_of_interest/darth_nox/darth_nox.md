# Overview

Darth Nox was a human male Dark Lord of the Sith who had many names and was worshipped by the screaming blade cult as the Great Dragon.
He was a descendant of the great Sith Lord Alloysius Kallig, and he continues the Sith Lord’s legacy by restoring his bloodline to being powerful again.
Darth Nox was a member of the Dark Council and the overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, which focuses on reclaiming lost artifacts and expanding the Sith’s knowledge.
He served as the apprentice of the notorious Sith Lord, Darth Zash.
He started as a slave and was selected to go to the Sith Academy on their home planet, Korriban.
He started as the apprentice of the cruel Overseer, Harkun, and eventually met Zash, who took him in.
Zash sent him on various missions to reclaim lost artifacts of the legendary Dark Lord of the Sith, Tulak Hord.
Nox encountered his ancestor, Kallig, and started to drift away from Zash.
As a Sith Lord, Nox was very powerful, and after Zash performed a special ritual, which was supposed to transfer her spirit to Nox’s body, Nox’s companion, Khem Val, interrupted her, and she ended up in his body.
Zash’s other apprentices, Corrin and Kaal, saw the body and attacked Nox.
Corrin realized that this was meant to be, so the two apprentices swore their loyalty to him.

# The Sphere of Ancient Knowledge's Overlord

The news came to Nox via a messenger, who informed him the powerful Sith Lord Darth Thanaton had joined the Dark Council and planned to kill all of Zash’s followers.
Nox then gathered his powerbase and challenged Thanaton to a Kaggath, a duel between two Sith and their powerbases for one’s rank or to humiliate them.
After running away multiple times, Thanaton went to the Dark Council on Korriban to plead with them for his help and to get rid of Nox.
However, Nox hunted Thanaton down and finished the kaggath in front of the council.
After the death of Thanaton, Nox was promoted to Dark Council and overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge.
A few Sith disagreed with Nox as a Dark Council member because he was only a Lord when he defeated Thanaton and many others worked hard to get their ranks.
However, there was no one more fit to lead the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge than Darth Nox, a descendant of one of the most famous Sith in history.
With the help of his ancestor, Darth Nox could expand the Sith’s knowledge and reclaim lost artifacts as he did as Zash’s apprentice.
Darth Nox’s ability to communicate with Force Ghosts made him even wiser than most Sith, and he could find artifacts easier and learn more about the history of the Sith.
