# Overview:

Darth Aruk was a member of the reconstituted Sith Empire, who served as a Dark Lord of the Sith and a member of Dark Council as the Overlord of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.
Aruk was in charge of spreading anti-Jedi teachings and enforcing the Sith Code throughout the Empire.
His goal was also to remove the Revanites due to the cult trying to brainwash the Sith by teaching Darth Revanâ€™s balance to the Force.
He attempted to weed out this cult but was later thought to be dead.
With the newly appointed Empress, Darth Acina, Darth Vowrawn was believed to be the last of the Dark Council and served Empress Acina.
Acina changed the Dark Council into 5 seats and the Sphere of Sith Philosophy came under the Sphere of Sith Doctrine.
