# Section I

Depicted as a three-eyed human mutant and the successor of Darth Bane, Darth Millennial was an incredible Sith Lord who could anticipate the future with the capability of his force powers and was trained as a Shadow Hand”, a term equal to apprentice handed out by his master, Darth Cognus, a former apprentice of Darth Bane, who took Millennial as her apprentice and educated him.

During his time spent with Cognus, he frequently questioned whether it merited learning her method.
Millennial was thoroughly against numerous Sith philosophies, however, he still believed in one; Lord Kaan's Rule by the Strong, a Sith philosophy declaring the strongest Sith out of all in the room be handed out the position of leadership.
His master believed in the Rule of Two, a philosophy based on two Sith Lords ruling, one master and one apprentice, and training said apprentice until they can defeat their master, only to repeat the process and create stronger generations.

# Section II

After a series of arguments with his master, who differed in the way of thinking that Millennial did, he had no choice but to escape and take refuge in the planet Dromund Kaas, as he stood no chance at overpowering the Sith Lord.

```
 When arrived on the planet, Millennial stumbled upon an ancient temple in the swamps.
```

The temple was protected by numerous Sith statues and noted to be ruined following the events of the Sith Empire’s loss in the Great Hyperspace War.
Later, Millennial invented his religion titled Dark Force, where he developed countless prophecies folks saw potential in, alongside setting the base-of-operations in the temple after it was examined to be inhabitable.
To keep a firm status for his religion, those that didn’t believe in Dark Force were killed for heresy.

After his death, his religion continued activities for a few more hundred years.
Darth Sidious recruited members of the religion to gain their trust and use in the Galactic Empire as counselors.
They were then attacked by Sidious' Inquisitors and had no choice but to abandon their temple and escape to the planet Bosthirda.
Once on Bosthirda, the religion was erased by a triumvirate of foes that had affiliations related to the Galactic Empire, who also practiced the dark side; Lumiya, Jax, and Azrakel.
Azrakel, a former member of the Dark Force was the first one of the triumvirate to appear and fight, dying but managing to defeat most of their forces.
Right after Azrakel's death, Lumiya, the Dark Lady of the Sith, alongside her apprentice, Jax, arrived and successfully slaughtered the remaining prophets.
