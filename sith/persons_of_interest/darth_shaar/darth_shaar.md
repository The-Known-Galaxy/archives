# Overview
Darth Shaar was a female Pureblood Sith Lord of the Sith Empire.
She was taught by the magnificent Darth Vowrawn and excelled politically because of her patience and since she could resist using threats.
She had what she claims was a “vigorous” relationship with the Zabrak Sith Lord, Raxxus, during her younger years and decades before the Galactic War began.
Their relationship caused Raxxus to be disliked and marked for death by the Dark Council.
However, not long after Raxxus was caught and imprisoned by the Jedi leaving Shaar's heart broken.
She soon found out that Raxxus was a former prisoner on the planet Belsavis and so she aided the Empire in hunting him down.
Shaar served the Sith Empire for years which led her to being promoted to Darth and joined the Sphere of Civil Administrations because she survived the Eternal Empire’s invasion.
She also took in two apprentices, Tarnux and Darth Norok.
