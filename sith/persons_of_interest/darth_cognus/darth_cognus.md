# Overview
A few years following the conclusion of the New Sith Wars, a female Iktotchi assassin, The Huntress, emerged.
Over a successful five-year stint, she secured employment with the royal guard of Doan.
Outstanding performance in this role led to an extended contract, now at the behest of Princess Serra who sought Darth Bane's capture.
Darth Bane fell into an ambush orchestrated by The Huntress and her mercenary cohorts, subdued using senflax poison and later incarcerated in the Stone Prison on Doan.
Plans for her departure were postponed following an unexpected bond with Bane.
Inside the prison, she crossed paths with Dark Jedi Set Harth, who suffered humiliation yet was allowed to escape.
Darth Bane arrived shortly thereafter, and following The Huntress' request for him to impart the ways of the Dark Side, accepted her as his apprentice.
As Darth Cognus on Ambria, named for her prescient abilities, her training commenced.
Darth Zannah, Bane’s other apprentice, traveled to the planet to challenge him for the title of Sith Master.
Later, Cognus ascended to the role of Sith Master and secretly mentored an apprentice, who was eventually dispatched adhering to the "Rule of Two".

# Early life
An Iktotchi assassin, she possessed abilities far more refined than those of her peers.
She honed her skills in telepathy and precognition, developing foresight greater than any other and eventually mastered the ability to manipulate visions and glimpse possible futures.
Her career as an assassin was exemplary; she completed every mission without fail and rarely suffered injuries.



# Doan missions
The Huntress was engaged by the Royal family of Doan for two separate contracts.
The first was to assassinate a mining organization leader, partially responsible for Princess Serra’s husband's death.
Upon arrival in Doan, The Huntress identified a Jedi among them.
Leveraging surprise, she swiftly shot down Gelba, the leader.
Subsequently, she tackled the rest of the miners, and a Jedi weakened by her force-suppression ability.
She killed the Jedi knight, Medd Tandar, thereby fulfilling the contract.
Her efficient execution intrigued Serra, who recently lost her father to Darth Bane.

They convened on Ambria, the planet where King Caleb met his end.
During this meeting, Serra presented the second contract, which involved capturing Darth Bane.
Through the Force, The Huntress witnessed visions of the past, specifically, Darth Bane and a blond woman causing Caleb's agonizing death.
The Huntress reminded Serra of her role as an assassin, not a bounty hunter, but was nonetheless enticed by a generous credit offer.
Furthermore, she was equipped with Senflax, a substance meant to immobilize Bane in combat.
In Darth Bane's absence, The Huntress infiltrated his residence.
As her companions kept watch outside, she thoroughly surveyed the estate, committing every detail to memory.
She deactivated all the mansion's security measures, encompassing those protecting a small outbuilding at the property's rear.
 The Huntress ventured inside, initially mistaking the structure for an armory, only to find it was a library teeming with educational materials—from datapads to aged parchment scrolls.
She stumbled upon the Dark Lord's holocron, although its significance eluded her.
She decided to seize it before commencing her thorough examination of the estate.
With everything in place, the plan progressed.
A trap was set using sonic detonators, and a strategy was devised to slow him down sufficiently to administer the venom.
Bane returned, sensing the imminent danger.
However, The Huntress's force-suppression compelled him to engage the mercenaries.
Bane utilized Force lightning to eliminate three mercenaries, but The Huntress, leveraging her abilities and flash grenades, managed to push him from the balcony.
After dealing with several more mercenaries, Bane confronted The Huntress, only to find the venom taking effect.
Caught off guard during the flash grenade chaos, The Huntress seized the opportunity to slash him before pushing him down.
With Bane now unconscious, the contract was nearly fulfilled.



# Dark Lord of the Sith
At a certain point, Darth Cognus took on an apprentice named Darth Millennial.
A three-eyed human, Darth Millennial did not regard the "Rule of Two" as beneficial to the Sith.
He believed that this rule put the Sith at a disadvantage against the Jedi due to their numbers, a conviction which ultimately forced him into exile.
Despite his exile, he managed to establish the Dark Force religion, while Cognus upheld Bane's "Rule of Two".



# Personality and traits
Characterized by red skin, yellow-colored irises, sharp teeth, plump fingers, shoulder horns, chin tattoos, and black robes, these were all features that defined Darth Cognus.
She took pleasure in misery and torture, which she believed enhanced her prowess in the Force.
Despite her grace and elegance, she was known for her sadistic tendencies.
She showed no recognition of the difference between 'good' and 'bad'.
She was inexpressive, cold, restrained, and displayed no interest in material possessions.
Her intelligence was unparalleled, and her chosen Sith name managed to surprise even Darth Bane.



# Powers and abilities
From the outset, her abilities greatly outshone those of her fellow Iktotchi.
Her abilities in telepathy and precognitive vision, honed from a young age, allowed her to organize her visions and perceive both the future and the past.
These powers, coupled with her keen perception and innate ability to manipulate others' potential to use the Force, rendered her one of the potentially most dangerous Sith in history.
In physical terms, she excelled at infiltration and information gathering.
As a trained Iktotchi assassin, she had proficiency in an array of weapons, ranging from long-range to close combat to explosives.
Her comprehensive knowledge of venoms, combined with her other skills, made her one of the most formidable threats in the galaxy.
That said, her proficiency with a lightsaber paled in comparison to her entire arsenal of skills.
