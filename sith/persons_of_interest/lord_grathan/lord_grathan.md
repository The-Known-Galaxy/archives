# Introduction
Lord Grathan was a human male who lived in prominence during the Cold War between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic.
His base of operations was on Dromund Kaas where he owned a large estate that housed his personal quarters and a prominent underground laboratory and research network, where he would practice his craft.
Grathan made his mark on galactic history when he rebelled against the Sith Empire and declared himself the thirteenth member of the Dark Council given his vast Powerbase.
This claim would be dismissed by the Council which would declare open war on Grathan and his followers.

After such a declaration Grathan fled the Citadel on Drommund Kaas and took up permanent residence within his Estate deep in the jungles of Dromund Kaas, bringing with him his private army and scientific personnel.
At this facility, Grathan would have his personnel mass produce war droids and cybernetic soldiers under his supervision, to ensure that any chance of open warfare from the Dark Council would be impossible.

# Prominence & Downfall
Despite Grathan’s tight defenses and an impenetrable fortress being his estate, he was not untouchable by any means.
Grathan’s security was tested when the Order of Revan broke into his estate and stole from him the Mask of Revan which he had stored in his most secure vault.
Despite such embarrassment, this did nothing to quell Grathan’s bravado and so he was entirely unprepared when Darth Baras wished to deal a blow to him by striking down Grathan’s family.
Baras dispatched his apprentice for such a task which would prove successful with both Lady Grathan and their son Beelzit lying dead.
Having been crippled by this loss, Grathan would live the rest of his life in obscurity on Drommund Kaas.



# Abilities and Legacy
Grathan was skilled in various aspects of the force, enough to earn him the loyalty of his large powerbase.
Upon this Grathan was well vested in the arts of a Sith Warrior able to use a series of telekinetic attacks as well as an unbreakable defense granted by not only his skill with his purple bladed saber but by his sheer force of will which by calling on the Dark Side of the Force allowed him to bolster himself to endure unimaginable pain.


Despite Grathan’s focus on the Warrior school of combat, he also had a keen interest in supplementary abilities and practices.
For one, Grathan had a keen interest in cybernetic enhancements and with his scientists enhanced his own soldiers and even himself, leading to his infamous cybernetic suit and mask which contributed to his combat capabilities as much as they do in instilling fear into an enemy.
This interest led to Grathan’s most dubious ability, with the assistance of his scientists, Grathan was able to perform a technique where they would graft a human mind into that of a droid, leaving behind a horrid abomination of a soldier.
This ability was the perfect culmination of Grathan’s cybernetic ambition and his power in the Dark Side.
