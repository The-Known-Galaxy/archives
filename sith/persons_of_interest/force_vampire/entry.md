# Origin

Tel Angor was a Jedi knight who served the order of the Silver Jedi.
He was highly well known amongst his colleagues and exceptionally praised for his abilities, both in combat and in the force.
Although the order had a goal of eradicating the dark side,  it would soon become something that the order wanted to embrace to further enhance its members' abilities.
The order of Silver Jedi had decided to experiment with the darkside in which Tel Angor had decided to participate.
After days of meditation and strengthening his bond with the force, the experiment would begin and backfire almost immediately; causing Tel to become completely corrupted by the darkside with a thirst for force energy.

# Aftermath

Unfortunately for Angor, his new process to sustain himself was through feeding on the force energy of other living beings.
This would typically lead to attacking anyone he came into contact with.
The force vampire as he would now be referred to, would mainly focus on attacking force sensitive beings with strong connections to keep him satisfied and fed.
However, being able to consume force energy was not the only ability that the force vampire wielded as he could also transfer the energy that he gains into pure physical strength that could greatly help with his attacks and recovery when needed.
Despite these strength enhancing abilities, the force vampire was also capable of radiating waves of terror that would shock its victim so greatly that it could physically damage them.

# The hunt

The Silver Jedi had acted immediately upon finding out about these tragic events and attempted to hunt down the vampire at all cost.
Unfortunately for the Jedi, most leads on the force vampire would usually only end in his victims with many who encountered the vampire not making it out alive.
However, before the events of the Clone Wars occurred, a group of seven Jedi were able to track down the force vampire.
Afterfter a long and straining battle, they were even able to capture him, imprisoning him on an outrider class cruiser.
After the imprisonment of the force vampire, the trip had begun and the Jedi would serve as guards until Tel could be brought back to the light; however one Jedi had made a critical error that resulted in the vampire escaping and feeding on the crew members.
Only one single Jedi Knight managed to survive and sabotaged the hyperdrive and sublight drives to isolate the vampire and died heroically against the creature in a battle.
The order of the Silver Jedi had been disbanded by this point and the force vampire had made his way to Coruscul to destroy the final stronghold but was stopped before he could do so.
A journal was found regarding the experiment which apologetically ended off with “We never should have tried”.
