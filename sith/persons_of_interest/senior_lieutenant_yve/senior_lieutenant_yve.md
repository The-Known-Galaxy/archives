# Overview

Yve was a female human Naval officer who served as a Senior Lieutenant and Starfighter Commander.
Yve was deployed on the planet Botajef and led a special unit of Starfighters to take down the turbolasers while Thrawn distracted Governor Quesl with fake laws.
The Chimaera, Thrawn’s flagship, encountered two CR60 Corvettes and seven squadrons of V-19 Torrent Starfighters, all of which were commanded by the Governor.
Thrawn activated the Chimaera’s tractor beamin order to trap the Corvettes, and his  actions exposed the Governor’s scheme to destroy his palace so everyone could believe he was dead and he could run off with the Jefi art money.
Due to his amazing intelligence, Thrawn had the capability to realise that it was all a plot, and Thrawn forced the Governor to surrender and hand over the art.
