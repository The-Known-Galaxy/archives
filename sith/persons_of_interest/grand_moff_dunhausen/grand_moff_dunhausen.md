# Overview

Dunhausen was a human who served the Galactic Empire as one of its Grand Moffs.
In his imperial career, he was known for his cunning character, a distinct pair of blaster-shaped earrings he wore and his droid, 3B6-RA-7, who accompanied him.

# Biography

There are no records of Dunhausen’s young life or what eventually became of him.
Following the attack on the second Death Star, a former Jedi Knight, Kadann, prophecised that the rightful heir to the imperial throne would locate and use the Glove of Darth Vader.
This resistant relic survived the explosion of the Death Star.
Imperial powers sought to find the glove to attain Kadann’s dark blessing.
Dunhausen joined the Central Committee of Grand Moffs intending to puppeteer Trioculus, a self-proclaimed son of the late Emperor Sheev Palpatine, and establish supreme power upon his succession.
In 5 ABY, they revealed their puppet at the Kessendra Coronation on the planet Kessel as rightful for the throne, publicly opposing Director Ysanne Isard of Imperial Intelligence, who also laid claim.
In a meeting with the committee, Dunhausen had recommended introducing a new leading position on Tatooine to consolidate his power of Mos Eisley spaceport but was rejected by Trioculus.
Sometime later, the committee travelled to Mon Calamari for the foreseen relic.
Kadann learnt through his network of spies that their pawn was phoney but was later convinced by the committee, so he gave his blessing.
Not long later, Trioculus fell for a trap while searching for the Lost City of Jedi on moon Yavin IV, which saw him frozen in carbonite by crimelord Zorba Desilijic Tiure.
Meanwhile, Kadann falsely proclaimed prophecies that gave him imperial power.
A Mofference (Grand Moff committee conference) was held to discuss the growing threat of the false Prophet.
They underestimated their foe and were subsequently trialled at the Chamber of Dark Justice onboard Scardia Station.
This proved advantageous for Kadann as it was part of the steps to reduce his opposition in the galaxy.
Dunhausen was sentenced to four years in prison on the planet Hoth.
