# Introduction

Darth Tormen was a male Sith pureblood with red skin and orange eyes that was known for helping during the Imperial invasion on Corellia in the Cold War with his commander expertise.
Unlike other people he had no interest in any other topics other than war, the only thing that entertained him.
He didn’t like having his enemies easily be defeated but rather succumb to him as he was a monster only made for war, being rather ruthless to everyone.
Besides his personality, he had no tolerance for failure; showing the fact that he used Force choke and killed the remaining bridge crew after his flagship he was on was attacked.

He would often charge towards anyone who fought him and ruthlessly assault his adversaries even if he was outmatched.
He wielded a single-bladed lightsaber and was capable of telekinesis and Force rage.
He retained a flag-ship for himself and taught an apprentice, a female pureblood named Vindis before she eventually became a Sith Lord.

# History

Around the Cold War, Sith Lord Fatalissar requested a Kaggath against Tormen.
When he was announcing Ziost to be the arena where the Kaggath takes place,
Tormen decapitated Fatalissar in close range with no remorse while he was still debating.

After that event, he invited the latest survivor and champion of the Great Hunt for a mission to his flagship, the Tyrant.
Tormen was furious when the hunter refused to drop his weapons and killed his welcoming party in self-defense.
He would give the hunter a significant sum for the completion of his mission and even give the chance for revenge as the targets, Sero and Janarus were accountable for a framing.
He would have to lure them down from Coruscant to Corellia.
Before they could do anything, they would have to take down another two targets that would try to destroy their plan.
When he was successful the hunter returned to the flagship upon Tormen’s request.
While they were on it Republic Special Forces managed to invade the ship, the attack was sudden and a majority of the crew were scattered off in different locations of the flagship, Tyrant.
They managed to take back control of the ship, Tormen terminated the remaining crew after finding out that the captain was already dead.
After that event, still, on the flagship, Tormen explained his plan to lure the targets.
He tells the hunter what consequences they will bear and they come up with a plan.
They would find three high-ranked leaders in the resistance and make them unwillingly sign a compromise.
As Corellia was protected by Imperial rule, Janarus wouldn’t be scared to approve the treaty while Sero would convince him to assemble the green jedi and take it upon the battlefront instead of thinking straight.

Eventually, the plan took place.
Tormen sent the hunter out to terminate Sero while he stayed where the treaty was supposed to happen and awaited the group of Green Jedi Sero dispatched.
Tormen slaughtered them all with ease and informed the hunter beforehand on how to enter Janarus’ ship, the Founder.
Janarus tried to bargain with the hunter by listing Tormen’s war crimes but he refused his offer and killed him.
Then, Tormen and the hunter encountered each other again for the final time after they took care of the mission.
