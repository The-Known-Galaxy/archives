# Overview
Darth Gean was a Twi'lek Sith apprentice of the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Gravid, who gave her the name Darth Gean.
She was strong enough in the Force to shatter through her Master's Force barricades around his stronghold.
In taking her apprentice, Gean continued the Rule of Two, a regulation that confined the Sith to a single Master and apprentice.
She also continued the Grand Plan, initiated by Darth Bane to demolish the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic.
Gean infiltrated the Force shields that Gravid had placed around the bastion that they had constructed together on the planet Jaguada and was able to slaughter her Sith Master.
However, during the fight, Gravid grievously wounded Gean, which forced her to wear prosthetics.
