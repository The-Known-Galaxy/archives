# Overview
Remulus Dreypa lived as a Jedi Admiral who fell to the dark side during the Hundred-Year Darkness.
Following the Battle of Corbos which ceased that conflict in 6900 BBY, he and several other Dark Jedi disciples were banished by the Jedi Order to the Stygian Caldera.
These Dark Jedi outcasts uncovered and defeated the Sith civilization on Korriban, forging it into the Old Sith Empire.
Remulus Dreypa stayed imprisoned within his oubliette for nearly four thousand years.
During this duration, the offspring of the Doomed preserved watchful surveillance over him.
In 2974 BBY, the Sith pariah Parlan Spinner discovered the "Great Weapon" and aspired to utilize it to settle scores with the Lost Tribe of Sith.
Spinner associated himself with the ancient Dark Lord, who was committed to pursuing revenge against the Jedi and the Galactic Republic.
Lord Dreypa's former ally Spinner united himself with Takara and the Doomed leader Kaliska to prevent the Sith Lord from returning to the galaxy.
Before her demise, Kaliski proclaimed that her people's Jedi ancestors had concealed an interstellar capable starship underneath the Circle Eternal, the Sith Tribe's castle complex in their capital, Tahv.
