# Overview

Raised in the Jedi, Darth Vader, or as well known as Anakin Skywalker, was a legendary Force-Sensitive human male with great combat prowess.
During his time as a Sith, he redeemed himself as a Jedi after killing the Emperor, Darth Sidious, intending to save his son from dying.
He was born in 41 BBY and was the son of a slave, known as Shmi Skywalker.
His offspring consisted of: Luke Skywalker as his son, Leia Organa as his daughter and Ben Solo as his grandson.

# Anakin’s childhood-padawanship

Since he was a child he was seen as the chosen one because of his intelligence at a young age.
After being investigated by Qui-Gon Jinn, he brought Anakin Skywalker to the Jedi High Council, saying they should train him because he was the “Chosen One” and that he would bring balance to The Force, however, Grandmaster Yoda and Jedi Master Mace Windu were in a disagreement due to his age and fearful behaviour.
After this meeting, Anakin Skywalker was sent to pilot a starfighter in the Battle of Naboo, where once again, he showed his ability to pilot at a young age.

As Obi-Wan Kenobi’s Padawan, Anakin Skywalker had great potential, but his attitude was unwise, which was the beginning of his way to the Dark Side of the Force.
During this learning period, Anakin Skywalker met Senator Padme Amidala with the mission of protecting her because of an assassination attempt.
After Obi-Wan Kenobi was back with him, Anakin told him he felt affection and love for Padme, but Kenobi said to his apprentice that she couldn’t be trusted due to her being a politician.

After a while, Skywalker was sent out once again to protect Amidala on Naboo, where he confessed his love to her, but she declined because Anakin wasn’t supposed to form attachments as a Jedi.
After reflecting on a dream where he saw his mother suffering, he decided to go back to Tatooine, where he found her tied with a stick and with a cut on the side of her face.
After a few minutes, Shmi died in his son’s arms, Anakin consumed with rage, killed everyone in the village, promising Padme he would become as strong as possible to stop the people he loved from dying.

# The Birth of Vader

Only few people realised Anakin couldn’t control his emotions since he was a Padawan, a hint of this is when Anakin killed everyone in a village because his mother died.
After his ascension to the rank of Jedi Knight, Grandmaster Yoda suggested Anakin to take a Padawan, so he decided to train Ahsoka Tano as his new apprentice;which he formed a great friendship with.

Due to a few problems that occured during a mission, Ahsoka Tano was brought to trial for bombing the Jedi Temple.
After the decision was taken, she was exiled from the Jedi Order.
Anakin and Padme trusted she was innocent, and got enough proof to get her back in the order, but she refused, making Anakin lose his trust in the High Council.

At the end of the Clone Wars, Darth Sidious noticed Anakin’s abilities, and used him as his agent and emissary from the Jedi High Council.
Once again, Anakin was frustrated with the Jedi High Council for denying him the rank of Jedi Master.
Darth Sidious noticed this and instantly contacted Anakin, trying to convince him that if he joined the Sith, he would be able to protect those he loved.
Due to Anakin’s frustration and the feeling he had for Padme, he accepted to join the Dark Side after killing Mace Windu, being named as “Darth Vader”.

# Vader's last days

Vader was revealed the true identity of Luke Skywalker through his agents.
He located and distracted him to come to Bespin for their meeting.
At the end of the battle, Darth Vader cut off his hand, and seeing he was at a disadvantage, he revealed to him he was his father, and also tried to convince him to join the Dark Side, he refused and jumped off to die but he was saved by his sister and friends.

Darth Sidious was noticing that his apprentice was filled with mourning instead of hate due to his previous actions.
Intending to keep him in the Dark Side, he tortured Darth Vader with Force Lightining, he tried to fight back but he was overwhelmed by Mas Amedda’s Royal Guards.
After choking three of them, Darth Vader was Force-Choked back by the Emperor, who told him to forget everything that happened in his life.

After meeting the Emperor on Endor, Darth Vader noticed a rebel shuttle was approaching the forest moon of Endor and instantly notified Darth Sidious, who allowed them to land on the shield generator base, where he was waiting for Luke.
After meeting his son, he escorted him to the Emperor’s room in the Death Star, where the fight started.
These two were matched in level, but Vader’s purpose wasn’t to kill his son, it was to lead him to the Dark Side, this succeeded when Luke kicked Vader down the stairs by using the Dark Side of the Force.
The Emperor noticed this and told Luke to use his rage again on Vader, but Luke realised what he had done to his father and took a defensive position, but then lost his control again and cut off Darth Vader’s hand.
Luke, once again realising what he has done, threw away his lightsaber, which made Sidious use Force Lightning on him.
Vader couldn’t see his son suffering, so he got up and grabbed the Emperor with his left arm, throwing him to the reactor shaft.
Vader was heavily damaged after this due to Sidious’ Force Lightning, nothing could save him and he died minutes later.
This showed that once Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker lived again, if briefly.
