# Overview
Vaylin was a female human; she was the daughter of Senya Tirall and the legendary Emperor Valkorion.
She was also the sister of the twin brothers, Arcann and Thexan.
Vaylin was very powerful and very undisciplined.
Her father himself couldn’t even control her, so he locked her away on the planet Nathema.
Vaylin threatened the great Emperor, so he couldn’t have her with him in case she decided to challenge or kill him one day.
Vaylin was forced to remain in Nathema’s Sanitarium and live out her life being tortured and losing her innocence.
Her mother tried to free her, but Valkorion stopped her and blamed her for Vaylin’s disobedience and then developed hatred towards Senya.
After a long time on the "dark and cold planet," Vaylin was finally allowed back to Zakuul, where she plotted her revenge.
Vaylin supported Arcann when he decided to kill Valkorion, and she was promoted to High Justice of the Emperor.
Five years through Arcann’s reign, the outlander escaped with the help of their mother.
Senya fought against her children after learning about the death of Thexan.
Vaylin eventually betrayed Arcann and tried to confront her mother.
Once Vaylin returned, she noticed that SCORPIO had taken the throne but the droid, when Vaylin arrived, just handed the throne to her.

# Eternal Empress
The Empress decided to do everything in her power to kill her relatives so they wouldn’t have to challenge her to the throne.
As the Empress, Vaylin also wanted to prove to her subjects that she was a far worse tyrant than her brother, Arcann.
After searching for a long time, SCORPIO suggested that Vaylin destroy the Alliance by luring them into a trap.
As the new Eternal Empress, she searched for her brother and mother and encountered Senya on Ord Mantell.
Vaylin tried to lure her family into a trap and found the Outlander.
She tried to strike down the outlander when the spirit of Valkorion entered the Outlander’s body.
The Outlander manipulated Vaylin, and Valkorion killed her and used her spirit to enslave her.
However, the Outlander freed her, and together they joined forces with the rest of her family.
A few years later, everyone who Valkorion ever manipulated teamed up to kill him.
They finally did.
Valkorion claimed that he only sent his daughter to Nathema so that she could learn a lesson, which infuriated her because the torture was extremely traumatizing.
This convinced her to join the rest of her family in finally destroying the entity once and for all to stop his reign of terror.
They were finally successful in killing the entity, and Vaylin enjoyed watching her cruel father die.
The family watched Valkorion die and say his last words, ending thousands of years of the tyrant’s reign.



# Personality and abilities
Vaylin had a great childhood, being free and spending time with her mother.
This was until Valkorion sent her to Nathema so she could be tortured, and from then on, she vowed that she’d never be “caged again.” Once she got back to Zakuul, she plotted her revenge on Valkorion and Arcann had a plan to gain the title of Emperor by killing his father.
Vaylin, having a strong hatred against her family and a desire to become Empress, agreed to support Arcann on his idea.
She had no empathy when she returned from Nathema and only cared for herself, so once she saw the possibility of becoming Empress of one of the biggest Empires, she took it.
Vaylin especially hated her mother and was obsessed with trying to torture her in the worst ways possible, and while Arcann fought their father, Vaylin tried challenging her mother.
Once Arcann told Vaylin to let their mother go, she lost it and felt lonely because now her brother was against her.
On Nathema, Vaylin broke her chains, and from then on, she realized that she feared being lonely.
Once Arcann abandoned her, she developed an even stronger hatred against her family and led a hunt to kill them.
Valkorion claimed that Vaylin was her best and most powerful creation, showing that even the Immortal Emperor feared his powerful daughter.
Vaylin was the only one who couldn’t be manipulated by Emperor Valkorion, thus making her able to defeat him.
After Nathema Vaylin changed mentally and physically, she grew even more powerful.
Vaylin had the power to conjure up Force-Storms, as she proved in her duel with the possessed Outlander.
After Vaylin’s death, she had the power to become a spirit.
However, Valkorion imprisoned her and used her spirit as a puppet so he could reclaim his Empire and mentally abuse the Eternal Fleet.
Vaylin may have been one of the most powerful Force-users, but she was not proficient in lightsaber form, for she relied mainly on the Force to help her win battles.
The legendary Empress could even destroy a thick door easily while it took the powerful Sith Lord, Lana Beniko, a lot of effort to lift the door.
When she broke her chains on Nathema, Vaylin vaporized every guard and sent a massive shockwave that even scared her father.
The Immortal Emperor was no match for Vaylin because her Force-Storms were impossible to block.
Vaylin destroyed the Sanitarium with very little effort.
Vaylin was one of the most powerful Force-wielders in the galaxy and could even challenge the legendary Immortal Emperor and beat him in a battle, which was extremely hard because the Emperor lived for thousands of years searching and gaining power until he was eventually said to be unstoppable yet Vaylin could stop him.
