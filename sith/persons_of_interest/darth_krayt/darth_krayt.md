# Overview

Darth Krayt, also known as A’Sharad Hett during his time as a Jedi, was a powerful Sith responsible for the creation of the New Sith Order that instated the Rule of One.
He was also the ruler of many Tuskan tribes until losing a clash with Obi-Wan that resulted in his skin being shown.
Krayt started off and grew up with the ways of the Jedi but slowly turned to the Dark Side after the events of Order 66.

# Section 1

A’Sharad Hett was a human male and Tusken mix that was born and raised on Tatooine.
From the moment he was born, he would be raised and taught following the ways of the Jedi, as well as the tradition of the nomadic sand people.
A’Sharad would grow up informally with the ways of the force and Jedi beliefs up until his father was slain by Aurra Sing, a bounty hunter assisting in a small Tatooine war.
A’Sharad would end up claiming his father's saber and still used it even after making his own.
Hett would grow up to become a skilled Jar’Kai user.

# Section 2

After his father's passing, A’Sharad was taken as a padawan by Ki-Adi-Mundi.
With careful watch from a Jedi Master, he and his master would go on a mission on the planet Mastalare.
During this mission, he would gather the opportunity to speak with and learn from many high-ranking Jedi, some of which were Yaddle, Mace Windu, his master, and many others.
The goal of this mission was to talk with the residents of Lannik, who claimed they wanted to end the ongoing civil war on their planet.
Malastare was used as the meeting location for the treaty.

A few years after this, the bounty hunter who murdered A’Sharad’s father all those years ago would resurface on an uncharted planet claimed by Senator Tikkes.
Both Hett and his master went to end the threat once and for all.
On the planet, they encountered The Dark Woman, who was previously the master of Aurra Sing.
She also displayed her disappointment in her and was eager to assist them on their journey.
During this mission, A’Sharad was assigned to the senator, as that was who the bounty hunter was
going for next.
Despite his best efforts to defend himself, Sing still managed to board the ship.
Upon entry, A’Sharad felt an extreme burst of anger that caused him to knock Sing unconscious.
Unfortunately, he was able to regain control of his emotions and turn in the killer to his master.
Krayt’s outburst of emotions left him feeling guilty, so he requested to be put into exile like his father before him.
Hearing this, the Dark Woman offered to take him in and control his emotions.
Over the course of about ten years, he would become a knight and take in a padawan by the name of Nikto.

# Section 3

During the clone wars, A’Sharad acted as a General for the Galactic Republic and was used mainly for air support during the Battle of Geonosis.
He also led clone troopers to many ground battles and planets such as Argonar and Metalorn.
After Obi-Wan’s assumed death, Hett would befriend the young Anakin Skywalker and act as guidance when he needed it most.
After the battle of Jabiim, Anakin and A’Sharad worked together to clear the way for the Republic Military hospital to lay ground on New Holstice.
During one of the battles, Anakin and A’Sharad fought together, one of Anakin's comrades was dying, causing Anakin to panic and try to massage her heart with the force.
This only led to a much more painful and quick death.
A’Sharad confronted Anakin about this and discovered that Anakin had not yet processed the idea that people die and it is a natural thing.
A’Sharad would teach him of the memory moths and how it's a good way to get through a comrade’s death.

# Section 4

During the conclusion of the Clone Wars, Palpatine executed his priority protocol, better known as Order 66.
This command caused all clones to execute their Jedi commanders.
Hett was lucky enough to be away from his clone squad at the time, though when he returned, he confronted one of the clones and learned what happened before killing him.
He fled in an attempt to find any other remaining Jedi, with disappointing results.

Thinking he was the last remaining Jedi, Hett moved to Tatooine, where he started a new life and became a leader for several Tuskan clans.
He led these armies and set up camps

while privately preparing for a war against the Galactic Empire.
Hett’s excellent leadership ability allowed him to recover the losses the Tuskens faced when Hett’s dad was killed.

# Section 5

On a mission across Tatooine, Hett and his Tusken force approached a farm under the name of Owen Lars.
When approaching the farm, Hett and his force ended up being attacked by none other than Obi-Wan Kenobi.
This, of course, shocked Hett and they ended up in a clash.
Obi-Wan believed Hett was getting dangerously close to the dark side and pleaded for him to stay back from the farm.
He did not listen as he believed that farmers were the reason for the Tuskens murder and problems.
Hett would end up losing the fight, as well as his arm.
His mask also fell off in the middle of the fight.
The Tuskens forbade any flesh from being shown, regardless of whether it was an accident.
This meant that all of the Tuskens turned around and abandoned him, with no words spoken.

Hett could not stand the humiliation and begged Obi-Wan to kill him right there.
Of course, Kenobi did not want to kill an old comrade, so he told him to never return to Tatooine.
He hoped that Hett would see his errors and return to the Jedi way, but this only caused his anger to rise.
Hett would learn the truth about Owens' farm and regret keeping it a secret decades later.

# Section 6

After his forced removal from Tatooine, Hett became a Bounty Hunter while not exposing himself as a Jedi.
When pursuing a bounty on Korriban, A considerable storm arose that caused Hett to have to reveal his Jedi abilities.
Hett killed the bounty after he threatened to turn him in for exposing his powers.
After this, he started to hear a voice calling to him from the darkness.
In it, he discovered a room containing a Sith Holocron.
An old Sith Lord appeared from the Holocron and offered to teach him the ways of the Sith, which Hett accepted.

Hett opened his eyes to the Sith ways and manipulated himself into believing that he was only learning new skills to kill Palpatine and Vader.
However, when he resurfaced he realized that a lot more time than he thought had passed.
The Battle of Endor had ended, and Vader and Palpatine had been defeated by Luke.
Because of this, Hett set off to the unknown regions to lose himself.

# Section 7

While traveling the Unknown Regions, Hett was captured and placed onto a Yuuzhan
Vong ship where he was put in the Embrace of Pain.
Here he was endlessly tortured both in the mind and in the body.
His fake arm cut off by Kenobi was replaced with a real one, and his eye was replaced by one from a Yuuzhan Vong.
During this endless cycle of torture, Fett would meet someone by the name of Vergere.
He would tell Fett about the weakness of the galaxy and that all it needs is one person to lead a new sith force to fix the galaxy.
Vergere would end up leaving the ship to try and fix the galaxy, which allowed Hett to escape and return to Korriban.

After his return to Korriban, Hett underwent the name of Darth Krayt, naming himself after a dragon from his homeworld.
He also completely re-established the Sith order and abolished Darth Banes's rule of two, and instead introduced the rule of one, meaning that it was just the entirety of the Sith Order with many minions under it.

Throughout hundreds of years, Krayt as well as his army grew stronger and stronger.
Krayt started to train his body to support the Yuuzhan Vong implants while also expanding and strengthening his army.
Unfortunately, though, his body started to fail him with his old age, and he presumed he had about twenty years to live.
