She was a strong member of The Sith Order and The Reconstituted Sith Empire.
She was trained in the arts and traditions of the Inquisitorious Path.
Zash was noted in very high levels of Sith Politics, for that reason she got promoted to Sith Lord.
Under the name of Lord Zash, she researched and studied Sith Alchemy and Ancient rituals.
Unfortunately, the dark side had bad consequences on her body, deteriorating her skin and taking away her youth.
Zash used a force illusion to hide her real appearance but physical damage was killing her, so she desperately searched for a cure to avoid her death.
But she also has to face some challenges from her superiors, Darth Skotia and Darth Thanaton, they both hated Zash, they thought that she was a lack of deference to her historical predecessors and the traditions of The Sith Order.
So Zash ordered her apprentice to go kill Skotia while she went to the local cantina.
His apprentice defeated Skotia successfully and went to the cantina to inform Zash of Skotia's death.
After this, Zash got promoted to Darth.
