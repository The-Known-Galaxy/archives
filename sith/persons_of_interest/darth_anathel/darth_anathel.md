# Overview

Darth Anathel was a human male Sith Lord who served the reconstituted Sith Empire as the Overlord of the Sphere of Sith Doctrine throughout the Cold War.
During his time in the Sith Empire, Darth Anathel developed a powerful rivalry against Darth Xarion, who later ascended to Dark Councillor as well.
Due to their enragement with each other, they travelled to the Stygian Caldera nebula so they could duel.
Neither of them won because they were told to leave for the Outer Rim Territories since they were interrupting the Imperial traders.
Later on in his life, he would ascend to the rank of Dark Councillor and Overlord of a new sphere, Sphere of Sith Doctrine.
Sphere of Sith Doctrine was a mix of the Sphere of Mysteries, Ancient Knowledge, and Philosophy.
