# Overview
A human who worked as the amiable steward of Sith mythology for the Lost Tribe of Sith.
Born and raised during the turbulent Time of the Rot.
Hilts wanted to bring the Tribe back together by utilizing the knowledge of the past as a historian.
The Lost Tribe was into a state of ferocious intramural conflict, and its actual roots had been forgotten.
Hilts was far more progressive and open-minded than many of his Sith peers.
Even the native humanoids of the planet Kesh, the purple-skinned Keshiri, saw him as an equal.
The numerous Sith groups were brought together by Varner Hilts, who then gave the Tribe a new task to conquer  this new continent.
The other Sith unanimously chose Hilts to be their next Grand Lord.
Iliana, whom Hilts later married, later took on his family name.
While an old rule mandated that the Grand Lord's consort be put to death upon the latter's passing, Hilts pledged to protect her.
Takara Hilts, a daughter from their marriage, was subsequently born.
Later generations would refer to Grand Lord Hilts' rule as the "Hilts Restoration," and it was seen as a period of peace, stability, and restoration.

# Biography
Varner Hilts was a male Human who resided on the isolated planet Kesh in Wild Space and belonged to the Lost Tribe of Sith, a clan of stranded Human Sith.
That blade had been used in an attempt to kill a certain faction leader by Hilts' father, but the dagger's sheath was left unfastened.The Tribe's homeland, Keshtah Minor, had been destroyed by civil war for more than 960 years when it was finally put an end by the passing of Grand Lord Lillia Venn in 3960 BBY.
Only on Testament Day, a festival celebrated every 25 years during which the Testament of Yaru Korsin, the founder of the Lost Tribe, was read, could the many Sith groups come together harmoniously.
Being the Tribe's Caretaker by the age of thirty-five, Hilts was able to oversee Testament Day that year.
As Grand Caretaker, Hilts had the authority to call the Pantheon's Peace, which permitted the reading of Yaru Korsin's Testament using a holocron, an antiquated piece of Jedi and Sith technology that existed before the Tribe.
Before the year 3000 BBY, Hilts met a Sith lover who tried to murder him and seduced him.
Hilts reminded the several Sith factions that the Circle Eternal was not the place for bloodshed after mediating between Iliana and Neera, the head of Force 57.
Korsin Bentado proposed that the three Sith groups move their battle outside, where a number of other factions had congregated, and fight there.
Hilts offered to do the holocron reading because he couldn't stand by as blood was spilt.
Hilts said that lying was a trait of the Sith when Iliana learned he had lied.
Hilts made the decision to go to the historic Kesh Sith Temple and open it because she thought Korsin had left a postscript.
The Omen, a legendary Sith ship that had delivered the Tribe's forefathers to Kesh, found its ultimate resting place in the temple.
The Kesh Sith temple was situated at the northernmost point of a long, hilly peninsula that ran parallel to the mainland of Keshtah Minor.
Hilts and Jaye returned to the Temple where they packed some provisions before setting out for the location.
Hilts had remembered Yaru Korsin's Testament and the Kesh Sith Temple's full blueprint during the course of his employment as the Tribe's historian.
Hilts saw the construction of a monument honoring Seelah Korsin, the Mother of the Tribe, outside the Wardroom.
Her own Sisters of Seelah had intervened during the battle, and Iliana retreated to the Sith Temple to elude her assailants, especially Korsin Bentado, the head of the Korsinite League, whom she had previously severely injured.
Iliana had found the bones of her idol Seelah Korsin in the wardroom of the Temple.
Iliana was shocked when Jaye made his presence known, but Hilts reassured her that the Keshiri were on his side.
To symbolize the end of the Time of the Rot, Hilts would christen his reign as the Hilts Restoration as the next Grand Lord.
To spread the word of Hilts' rise and the finding of Keshtah Major, Edell Vrai, Korsin Bentado, and Neera dispersed over mainland Keshtah Minor.
In order to create a way of reaching Keshtah Major, Hilts appointed the mathematician Vrai as his principal engineer.
He hypothesized that the locals would be aware of the Sith existence if the Keshiri rebel Adari Vaal and her followers had arrived on the new continent in their flight of stolen uvak.
The old guy was reenergized by the prospect of conquering a new continent.
Unquestionably, the conquest of Keshtah Major was the most significant aspect of Hilts' administration.
The Tribe worked to discover a safe route to go to Alanciar under the direction of Chief Engineer and High Lord Edell Vrai.
The Sith and Keshiri on Keshtah knew little about science and technology, but they both understood that Kesh was a globe.
The Tribe's scribes calculated that the western path across the ocean to Keshtah Major was shorter than the eastern route, but the Tribe's explorers were unable to advance because of the powerful tidal currents.
The Sith attempted to employ uvaks for exploration flights, but they were unable to due to the distance.
Boats also weren't effective.
Then 25 years of investigation later, the solution became clear: Airships fueled by hydrogen.
During the next years he would suffer plenty of setbacks and new enemies would appear but with the emergence of new allies, his immense intelligence, his powerful wife and confidence, he was capable of overcoming all obstacles and giving back its old glory to the Lost Tribe of the Sith.



# Personality and traits
Varner Hilts was distinguished from other Sith by his calm demeanor and his sense of logic.
He had a passion for history and was one of the Tribe's most well-known authorities on the old Tapani language, which was spoken by the Tribe's ancestors.
Hilts had no interest in either politics or conflict, in contrast to many of his Sith brethren.
He showed the indigenous Keshiri people respect and treated them equally.
He was not beyond lying, though, if it served his interests.
Prior to 3000 BBY, Varner Hilts, who likewise yearned for a female companion, was unable to locate one because of his unsatisfying job as the Tribe's caretaker, an archivist and museum curator responsible for maintaining track of the Tribe's historical records and timekeeping.
Varner Hilts shared this yearning for a female companion, but prior to 3000 BBY he was unable to locate a spouse owing to his unsatisfactory job as the Tribe's caretaker, an archivist and museum curator charged with maintaining the Tribe's timekeeping and historical archives.
Hilts got married to Iliana after being promoted to Grand Lord.
Iliana's power ambitions were to be restrained, and she was to be shielded from her previous adversaries, notably Korsin Bentado, by this marriage.



# Skills
Varner Hilts was not adept at utilizing the Force to defend himself or to engage in lightsaber battles.
He was also warned as a young man that no one would stand next to him for fear of unintentional amputation due to his subpar lightsaber abilities.
Despite having undergone the same training as his Sith peers, he had only ever used his Force abilities to deflect pieces of falling debris.
Hilts needed Iliana, his wife, to keep him safe even as Grand Lord.
His superior intelligence and logical reasoning, however, more than made up for his lackluster combat abilities.
Varner Hilts was also capable of and prepared to utilize deceit to further his personal objectives.
