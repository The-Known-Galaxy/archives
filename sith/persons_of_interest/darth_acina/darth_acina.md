# Overview
Darth Acina or Empress Acina was a powerful female human Sith Lord who served in the Sith Empire and later ruled the reconstituted Sith Empire.
Before rising to Empress she was a part of the Dark Council and served as overlord of the Sphere of Technology.
As Empress, she started a war against the powerful Eternal Empire of Zakuul.
Afterward, Zakuul was overthrown and the Empress died from the powerful weapon known as the Lokath superweapon.
This was an unfortunate death considering she was trying to claim that superweapon for her Empire.
With the death of Acina, there had to be a new Emperor and this was the Sith Lord, Darth Vowarawn.
Vowrawn ran the Empire a little while after Acina’s death until he met his ends.
Darth Acina, in her early years, trained on the Sith planet of Korriban.
She rose through the ranks extremely fast and became Dark Lord of the Sith following the death of Darth Karrid.
She also became the Overlord of the Sphere of Technology and was tasked with overlooking an important technology warehouse called the Arcanum.
One of Acina’s apprentices had an allegiance with the Dread Masters and they started an offensive raid on the protected Arcanum.
The Dread Masters stole many important and powerful artefacts; such as the Darkstaff and the Seeds of Rage.
Acina sent Imperial troops to reclaim the Seeds of Rage and they were successful.

# Reign of the Empress
Before she was Empress, Acina was a Dark Council member and Dark Lord of the Sith.
She ruled the Empire for five years and many supported her reign.
Acina allied with the Eternal Emperor, Arcann, but after he died she saw an opportunity to make her Empire more powerful.
Acina decided that she needed to defeat Arcann’s notorious sister, Vaylin.
Vaylin sent her new Eternal Fleet to invade the planet Voss and stage an attack on the Empress.
The Empress sent her Imperial fleet to support the Alliance and luckily for the Empress, her fleet arrived at a reasonable time and managed to scare off the Eternal Fleet.
After her success, the Empress called the Alliance Commanders to Dromund Kaas to negotiate an agreement.
She sent Gelmid Lorman, the Logistics Minister, to escort the Alliance.
The Alliance brought their advisers with them, Theron Shan and Lana Beniko, and the Empress decided it would be wise to allow the Commander to board her shuttle and negotiate there.
The Empress assured her guests that she had no intentions of claiming the Eternal Throne.
During their conversations, the Empress’ shuttle’s engine failed and they were forced to escape the shuttle into the dangerous wilderness of Dromund Kaas.
Surviving the harsh weather of the wild, the Empress discovered they were sabotaged by the legendary assassins, GenoHaradan, who she thought to be a myth.
The team was hired to assassinate them by orders of Leontyne Saresh, who was a former Chancellor of the Republic.
The pair were being attacked and were forced to move into the closest shelter, which was a Sith tomb.
They continued to travel inside the tomb and found Lorman waiting there.
Lorman was the one behind the sabotage and the strike team that forced them into the tomb.
Acina handed Lorman over to the Commander and the Commander returned to the headquarters on Odessen to discuss the fate of Saresh.
Acina decided it would be necessary to continue with the alliance.
Before all of this, Lorman imprisoned an Imperial Officer by the name of Malavai Quinn who, after the alliance was formed, became the advisor of Acina.
After the defeat of Vaylin, the Eternal Throne was empty and so the Alliance decided to revert it to the old ways where the GEMINI captains programmed and controlled the Eternal Fleet.
With the Alliance in control of the Eternal Empire, Acina had to be ready for anything and prepared for the possible war against the new Eternal Alliance.
After receiving an anonymous call that informed the Empire of a powerful superweapon on the planet Lokath, Acina sent her Imperial forces to claim the recently rediscovered superweapon.
The Imperials found out the Republic and Eternal Alliance were after the same thing after encountering them.
Acina sent Major Quinn to negotiate with the Eternal Alliance to defeat the Republic forces led by Supreme Commander Jace Malcolm.



# Personality and abilities
Darth Acina was a powerful Sith, who struggled to gain the title of Dark Council.
Acina was said to talk in a confusing way, where she made everyone who talked to her think she was playing a guessing game with them.
Following the death of the well-known Darth Marr, she wanted to rebuild the Sith Empire.
The Sith space was attacked many times by the Eternal Empire and eventually, Acina was the last Dark Councillor left.
Acina, for the first time, had lots of support from her people when she became Empress and many called her the “wisest of all Sith” because of the methods she used as Empress.
Acina didn’t sleep much, she usually practised her lightsaber skills and eventually took up horticulture as a hobby.
Acina only ever drank water that was purified from Dromund Kaas.
She was a ruthless Sith Lord and when she was betrayed by Minister Lorman she wanted to execute him, but she also wanted to keep her alliance with the Commander so that they could defeat the Eternal Empire.
Obviously, with her technical skills, Acina was head of the Sphere of Technology and was interested in things like cybernetics.
Her peers relied upon these skills, however, she never risked her life to get these for she didn’t want to suffer any injuries.
Darth Acina was a talented duellist and pilot.
She could use associated jargon in a dangerous situation.
Acina used to demure Darth Marr’s strategies as leader of the Dark Council.
Acina was a powerful force-wielder and used a double-bladed purple lightsaber in battles.
However, when she took the title Empress, she laminated the lightsaber for she rarely used it afterward.
Acina was a talented Sith Lord, who was adored by her people as Emperor and belittled by Sith before joining the Dark Council and becoming popular.
She spent her spare time planting and staying up late studying combat skills.
