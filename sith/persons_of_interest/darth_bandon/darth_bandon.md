# Overview
During the Jedi Civil War, which was started by the Sith Lords Darth Revan and Darth Malak, a Human male Jedi Padawan named Darth Bandon defected to the Sith Empire.

# Biography
The human being known as Darth Bandon was a Jedi Padawan who never fully embraced the Jedi Code's teachings.
Bandon's strong emotions, such as rage and hatred, raged within him and fueled his strength even as the Force poured through him.
His Jedi Master attempted to control these intense feelings, but the boisterous Padawan resented being controlled by his Master.


The heroes of the Mandalorian Wars and former Jedi Knights Revan and Malak discovered the Star Forge, a remnant of the Rakatan Infinite Empire that controlled the galaxy over 20,000 years earlier, and dubbed themselves the new Dark Lords of the Sith.
The Jedi Civil War was started when Revan and Malak declared war on the Jedi Council and the Galactic Republic.
Bandon abandoned the Jedi Order and his former teacher, running away to the revived Sith academy on Korriban, the former Sith homeworld.


Bandon accepted the dark side's and the Sith Code's teachings wholeheartedly as a pupil at the brand-new Korriban academy.
This rapidly distinguished Bandon from his fellow students and caught the eye of Darth Malak, Revan's Sith apprentice.
This was in addition to Bandon's strength with the Force, his inherent brutality, and his total ruthlessness in his pursuit of dominance.
Malak finally developed a fondness for Bandon.
The Jedi and Republic troops construct a trap for Revan and Malak two years into the Jedi Civil War in an effort to apprehend both Sith Lords.
Malak gave the command for his flagship Leviathan to start firing on Revan's ship during the conflict, betraying his Sith Master.
Malak took control of the Dark Lord of the Sith mantle after believing he had defeated Revan.
 

Malak searched among his followers for a single student who could acquire the Sith secrets and use them to effectively destroy the Jedi and the Republic.
This was customary for the Sith Order.
Malak chose the talented Bandon to be his Shadow Hand, elevating him to second place in the Sith Empire after only his Master.
Bandon learned a lot about the Sith from the Dark Lord.
Bandon murdered numerous Jedi throughout the conflict, therefore Malak was happy that he chose to take Bandon as his pupil.
Soon after, there were whispers that Bandon would challenge Malak for control of the Sith, and Bandon finally started to look toward his Sith Master's throne.

The Human guy known as Darth Bandon was infamous for his brutal actions while he was a Sith Lord.
Even for a perceived slight like someone blocking his path, he was prepared to sacrifice lives and destroy property to establish his position.
Along with the slaughter and extermination of the Jedi Order, he was also concerned with the destruction of the Republic.
Bandon told the former Dark Lord that he was no match for him, declaring that his abilities were more than sufficient to beat Revan and his allies.

His double-bladed lightsaber was effective in slaying many of his erstwhile Jedi colleagues.
When he duelled the Cathar Jedi Juhani, he additionally demonstrated his prowess with just one lightsaber.
Bandon hadn't faced an opponent who could match him in strength before facing Revan.



Bandon was skilled with the Force and had access to a variety of Force abilities.
He could modify the air currents around his opponent, turning it into a maelstrom, and use the Force to push them to the ground.
An opponent would be propelled into the air, spun around, and rendered entirely immobile by this swirling tornado of Force energy.
In his demonstration against Revan, Bandon was also able to harness the Force to temporarily make himself almost immune to most offensive Force powers.
Because of his proficiency with the dark side of the Force, Bandon was able to use dark-sided abilities like Force lightning.
He also channelled his wrath into the dark side and used it to attack.

Exar Kun, the Sith Lord who started the Great Sith War forty years before the conclusion of the Jedi Civil War, used a lightsaber that was similar to the one that he was wielding.
Additionally, Bandon wore a specially made pair of light fibre armour that he attached to his robes.
