# Section I
Raised in the Jedi, Exar Kun had surprisingly little control over his anger.
As a young Padawan, Exar showed immense potential in the Force.
None of his fellow Padawan peers could contest with him when it came to lightsaber or Force powers.
Exar’s very own master, Vodo Siosk-Baas, had taken notice of his Padawans' barely controlled rage.
At one point in Exar’s training, his master had to step in to stop a duel between Exar and a fellow peer Padawan due to Exar nearly killing her.
Exar Kun eventually took on a second saber and with it used the art of Jar’Kai to defeat his very master.

# Section II
Once Exar finished his training, he set out to find the dark power of the Sith.
His curiosity overwhelmed him, and he believed himself immune to the Dark Side's temptation.
Exar’s search led him to Dxun, a moon of Onderon.
There, Exar found the tomb and spirit of the ancient Sith Lord Freedon Nadd.
Freedom tempted Exar to the Dark, and took him on as an apprentice.
Exar grew in power quickly, and eventually destroyed Freedon’s spirit.
With his ambitions set on becoming a Dark Lord, he set out to destroy the other disciples of Freedon Nadd, so he would have little competition.
Exar Kun eventually came to find the Krath Sith Cult.
There, he encountered their warlord, Ulic Qel-Droma.
During this encounter, the spirit of Marka Ragnos appared, and announced they had completed their full true initiations as Sith.



# Section III
Exar Kun was dubbed Dark Lord by Marka, with Ulic becoming his Sith apprentice.
Together, they formed the Brotherhood of The Sith, and waged war on the galaxy.
Focused on destroying the ancient lore of the Jedi on Ossus, Exar’s apprentice betrayed him for the Jedi and prepared an assault against him at Yavin 4.
As Exar returned to Yavin 4, he was attacked by thousands of Jedi.
Using a technique he did not fully understand or master, he separated his spirit from his body in an attempt to escape.
Unfortunately, the Jedi Nomi Sunrider led the Jedi to create the Wall of Light, a power that destroyed the landscape of Yavin 4, trapping the spirit of Exar inside his temple.
