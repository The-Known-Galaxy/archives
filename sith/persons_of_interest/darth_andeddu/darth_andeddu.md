# Introduction
Darth Andeddu, also known as the Immortal God-King of Prakith, was an ancient Sith humanoid male who once reigned on the throne as Dark Lord of the Sith around the period of the One Hundred Year Darkness.
Andeddu was a very paranoid man who had believed that his subordinate Sith Lords, whom he called his enemies, wanted to claim his ritualistic and vast collection of Sith lore.
Of course, he was partially correct when he was overthrown and betrayed by his followers.
He had fled Korriban for the Deep Core.
Within the Deep Core, Andeddu made his way to Prakith, a planet where he would rule for centuries as the Immortal God-King, praised as a deity before his physical demise.
He was placed deep inside of a tomb to deter all those who sought to steal his power.
Before Andeddu had died, he stored all of his wisdom inside of a Sith holocron, which had also contained his most powerful and darkest of secrets, how to cheat death by transferring one’s essence into another vessel.
A Sith Cult founded by Darth Andeddu called “Malevolence” was formed after his death and sought to protect and guard Andeddu’s tomb for generations to come.

# Section I
Darth Andeddu hailed from the Deep Core world of Prakith, where he studied the wisdom of another great being, Karness Muur.
Over time, Andeddu grew in power and great wisdom, developing an expertise over the dark side of the Force.
However, as he continued to study Muur, he wanted to learn more than Dark side healing abilities, and sought more power from then on.
Andeddu was interested in how to cheat death entirely.
He was successful in his quest to find the power to cheat death, learning that in order to cheat death, he must preserve his mind and consciousness.
He also had learned the secret of transferring his essence into another vessel if he so needed.
As Andeddu grew in power and stature, he also grew in fear of others around him.
Andeddu had refused to release the knowledge of how to perform the ancient Force abilities that he had discovered, leading to the Sith Lords banding together to take the throne and his power for themselves.
After his coup, he had returned to his own private stronghold on his homeworld where he had stored all of his Sith spell books and scrolls that contained his knowledge and wisdom.
Because of Andeddu’s dark side abilities, he had begun to exceed the natural lifespan of a normal being, in which he would then rule Prakith for many centuries to come.
However, with the hyperspace lanes leading to Prakith being erased from existence, it caused Prakith to go into a deep isolation where Andeddu would rule undisturbed for a long time, but he was still paranoid of his own demise and his followers stealing his power.
So, to avoid this extreme paranoia, he entombed himself with all of his scrolls and belongings, placing his holocron inside of a sarcophagus along with his physical body.
The Malevolence cult continued to reign after his death, worshiping their God-King and maintaining his tomb.
Andeddu declared that they would guard his tomb for generations and await the day that he resurrected himself from death to lead them once again.
