# Overview
Hakagram Graush was a male purebred Sith race, proclaimed as their king, who ruled the Sith Empire around 6900 B.C.

Hakagram Graush was closely associated with the Force, and borrowed the same surname as another famous Sith sorcerer, who was Dathka Graush.
Hakagram was recognized as king and then he was crowned and began to rule his people.
The king ruled his empire with the help of his Shadow Hand who was his right hand and actually the second in command.
It went on like this until 6900 B.C.

# The Overthrow and Doom
During the war called "The Hundred Years of Darkness," the defeated Dark Jedi, led by Ajanta Poll, arrived on the homeworld of Hakagram, the planet Korriban.
 He was interested in the Pure Sith approach to using the dark side of the force.
Despite the fact that the Dark Jedi had advanced technology and weaponry, Hakagram refused to accept them as gods and forbade his subordinates to teach them aspects of Sith magic, but the Outcasts still managed to gain the King's trust through the Hand of Shadows.
Loyalty to the Hand of Shadow was a fatal mistake for Hakagram.
The head of the Dark Jedi, Ajanta Poll, beheaded King Graush.
Shocked by what had happened, the people of Korriban perceived the Fallen Jedi to be more powerful than King Graush and therefore recognized their power over them.
Thereafter, Ajanta Poll and his associates declared themselves lords of the Sith.
The Sith Order was founded and the culture of the Sith race was transformed into a religion of reverence for the Dark Side.
Although Hakagram Graush was overthrown and killed, he was given the honor of being buried with honors in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban.
