# Overview

During the early years of his life, the person who would be known later as Mandalore the Lesser was a warrior who fought for prestige in the arenas of Geonosis.
His talent as a fighter was noticed by the Imperial Intelligence from the True Sith.
Seeing his potential, the Sith Empire tried to make him a Manda’Lor as soon as possible.
However, their true intention to make the young warrior a Manda’Lor was so he could reunite the Mandalorian group in an alliance with the reconstituted Sith Empire in the Great Galactic War against the Galactic Republic.
After achieving the title of Manda’Lor, Mandalorian the Lesser promised his group that he would lead them to victory.
His life would come to an end throughout the Great Galactic War and the Cold War, as in an attempt to gain his teammates’ trust, he revived the ancient competition known as Great Hunt.
After losing the Great Hunt, the winner of it, Artus Lok, challenged him to a fight.
Artus Lok was the winner of the duel after shooting Mandalore the Lesser to death, proclaiming himself as the new Manda’Lor under the name of Mandalore the Vindicated.
