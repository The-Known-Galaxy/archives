# Overview

Tray'Essek was a Trandoshan investigator during the early days of the Galactic Empire.
At some moment in the past, Tray'Essek was shamed and backstabbed by his kindred, his Lar'omx.
A disciple of the Trandoshan religion, Tray'EsSek lost his position of honor in his afterlife with his Jagannath points reset to zero, as per standard Trandoshan beliefs.
Tray'Essek then took the traitor's life and set out to reclaim his place, dedicating the rest of his life to his goal of Lar'omx, vowing that no one would kill his rival first.
After discovering that Lar'omx was working for the Black Sun criminal gang, Tray'Essek joined the Pyke Syndicate to serve the Syndicate, allowing him to face Lar'omx again.

After Kadas'sa'Niktos bounty hunter Kaa'to Leeachos backstabbed the Pykes, Tray'Essek, with a group of Pyke-related agents, was tasked with tracking down the Nikto.
During the mission, Tray'Essek encountered Lar'omx on Coruscant at an Underworld gambling den, the Spyder, and later discovered Leeachos at The Works district.
