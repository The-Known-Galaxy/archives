# Introduction

Jedi Master Atris was a serving member of the Jedi High Council and an exceptional Jedi Historian during the days of the Mandalorian Wars, Jedi Civil War and later the Dark Wars.
Jedi Master Atris would lead a rather hypocritical life and be one of the most staunch defenders of the Jedi Order, even during the course of many of the Order’s wrong doings.

# Disapproval

The earliest recorded knowledge of Jedi Master Atris’ involvement in galactic affairs came during the early days of the Republic’s participation in the Mandalorian Wars.
Atris was one of a majority on the Jedi High Council that would protest against Jedi involvement in the Mandalorian Wars.
Atris was known for her stubborn ideology and would be unwavering in her disapproval of Revan and the Revanchists.

After the Mandalorian Wars had ended, one Jedi, known as Meetra Surik, would appear before the Jedi High Council to be judged for her participation in the conflict.
Having been stripped of her force to survive the detonation of the Mass Shadow Generator, Meetra Surik would be deemed unfit to remain as a member of the Jedi Order and was made clear that Jedi Master Atris took Meetra Surik’s participation in the conflict rather personally, providing the former Jedi with no leniency in her judgement, even believing that exiling Meetra Surik from the Jedi Order was not a harsh enough punishment.

Atris saw Meetra Surik as somewhat of an idol and viewed her fellow Jedi as an exceptional Jedi prior to the Mandalorian Wars.
When Meetra Surik abandoned the Jedi Order to follow Revan into the conflict it weighed heavily on Atris, more so than most other Jedi at the time.
Atris would go on to blame Revan personally for Meetra Surik having been forced to strip herself of the force and would condemn one of Revan’s former Master’s, Jedi Historian Kreia for Revan’s actions.

# Downfall of The Jedi Order

After Malak had been defeated by Revan the Jedi Order was struggling to rebuild from its losses.
Through warfare and defection to the Darkside, many Jedi had died or abandoned the Jedi Order all together.
The Jedi Order had little breathing room to recover, as by this time the Wound in the Force, whom the Jedi would later come to know as Darth Revan, alongside his counterpart, Darth Sion, were hunting surviving Jedi and either turning them or killing them.

The Jedi Council were unaware of what was hunting them and did not know of the existence of the Sith Triumvirate.
Atris, alongside the surviving Jedi High Council would convene a meeting of a majority of surviving Jedi on the world of Katarr.
Atris, believing the Jedi could defeat the threat should they meet it head on, took it upon herself to leak the location and time of the Jedi gathering.
As a result, while Atris was offworld, Darth Nihilus would descend upon the planet and kill every Jedi at the gathering, as well as every surviving being on the planet, with the exception of one Mirilukan.

The death of the Jedi Order and subsequent destruction of the world of Katarr could be attributed to Atris, whom upon receiving word of the Jedi Order’s destruction, would flee into hiding to start her own ‘’Jedi Academy.’’

# Reunion

During the Dark Wars, Atris would build the foundations of what she claimed would be a Jedi Academy.
And from a certain perspective it could be perceived as such.
Atris, on the world of Telos IV, would mentor 6 Echani women in various forms of Echani martial arts, educational studies and on specific matters concerning the Jedi Order.

Despite the young women who would become known as Handmaidens to Atris being force-sensitive, Atris would make them swear an oath never to undergo Jedi teachings or learn the ways of the force.
The Handmaidens served the purpose of monitoring and supporting the Jedi Order, aiding them in eradicating corruption and even being trained to kill Jedi should they fall to the Darkside.

It was in this Academy that Meetra Surik and Atris would re-unite.
Fleeing Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion, Meetra Surik would be forced to track the Ebon Hawk, stolen by one of Atris’ Handmaidens, to Atris’ Academy.
While there Atris would inform Meetra Surik of what had happened to the Jedi Order and begrudgingly assist Surik in finding the remaining Jedi Masters who were in hiding after the devastation of Katarr.

Atris was an emotional woman, despite being a Jedi Master, and still harboured a lot of anger towards Meetra Surik for abandoning the Jedi Order to go to war.
Atris would make this very clear during their meeting on Telos IV.
Despite her anger being directed towards Meetra Surik she did secretly still admire the Jedi Exile for her courage and for standing by her decision to follow Revan.

# Corruption

Atris sought to oneday rebuild the Jedi Order in her own image of perfection and intended to use the Handmaidens to assist her with this.
However, Atris ironically would fall to the Darkside, believing herself to be too strong to succumb to the allure of Sith teachings.
She would fall in almost the same way Revan and Malak would years prior.
During her time as a Jedi Historian, Atris would amass a large collection of teachings and holocrons, including those of the Sith.
Atris would often study these holocrons on Telos IV to understand the once forbidden knowledge held within them.

After the surviving Jedi Masters had been killed by the now returned Darth Traya, Traya would return to Telos IV in search of Atris.
Darth Traya would explain Atris’ emotions to her, understanding how she felt and essentially expose Atris to what she already felt but was too stubborn to express.
Atris assumed the position of a Dark Jedi, having been educated on Sith teachings by her holocrons she had now become the very thing she fundamentally at her core, believed she never would.

# Redemption

After Atris’ fall, Darth Traya would return to Malachor V and soon after Meetra Surik would follow in her footsteps, finding herself back on Telos IV.
Meetra Surik would find the fallen Jedi Master and duel her in the centre of Atris’ Academy.
Upon defeating Atris, Meetra Surik was left with the decision to either kill or spare her.
To the surprise of Atris, Surik would spare the life of Atris and in doing so, Atris understood everything she did wrong and forgave Surik for abandoning the Jedi Order.

Atris would then be left to the judgement of the rebuilding Jedi Order in the same way Meetra Surik was once at the mercy of Atris’ judgement many years prior.

# Personality and Ideology

The story of Atris is in many ways a sad one.
Her stubborn views of Jedi perfection and her gross overconfidence would be the very thing that would prove her own imperfection.
Despite her harsh judgement of the Jedi Exile she herself would be judged in the same manner.

Atris is viewed historically as the epitome of Jedi imperfection, despite her own staunch beliefs that the Jedi were perfect.
She failed in the many ways that the Jedi Exile succeeded, and in a way this caused her to doubt herself and can be attested to her fall to the Darkside.
Atris fought an overwhelming mental battle that she was too confident to admit she was losing until it eventually became too late.

Atris was quick to judge and harsh in doing so, and it took the kindness of the one that she judged the harshest to eventually help her in overcoming her flaws and to admit her failures.
