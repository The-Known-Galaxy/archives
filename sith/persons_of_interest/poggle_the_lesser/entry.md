# Overview

Poggle The Lesser was an influential figure within both the geonosian’s society and the confederacy of independent systems.
As an archduke of the Stalgasin hive, the most powerful hive within Geonosian homeworld Geonosis, he commanded great authority over the vast majority of the Geonosians while still under the rule of Queen Karina the Great.
However, his power and influence did not stop at Geonosis.
Later on he would become one of the most prominent figures within the confederacy of independent systems, tasked with overseeing droid armies production and strategies against the Galactic Republic in the Clone Wars.

# Origin

Poggle the lesser was originally a drone who rose through hierarchy to his current position with an assist from the ingenious Sith Lord Darth Sidous.
While he was in his quest for power, he seized control over many droid factories within Geonosis which later would become the powerhouses for the Separatist droid armies production.
To ensure the integrity-
of his position, he would eliminate Hadiss the Vaulted, the current leader of Geonosian.
With his position secured, he drove the Geonosian to join the Confederacy of independent systems.

# The First Battle of Geonosis

Poggle the lesser had always been the true believer of the Confederacy of independent systems’ cause as he led his people and droids to the battles with the Galactic Republic.
With a new bond between him and his new ally, the former Jedi Count Dooku, which the count helped the Geonosian guarantee the firm grip on Baktoid Armor Workshop.
Provided the Seperatist with sufficient weapons and armies.

His involvement became clear again while he as well as count Dooku and other separatist conspirators visited the execution of the Galactic Republic’s puppets, Senator Padmé Amidala, Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Padawan Anakin Skywalker at Petranaki Arena, also known as Arena of Justice, at the Stalgasin hive’s spire on Geonosis.
The execution however was unsuccessful as the Grand Master Yoda along with the clone troopers interrupted and rescued the prisoners.

As the clone troopers as well as Jedi broke into the arena, he led his associates to the Underground Geonosian Command Center to strategize in an attempt to repeal the Galactic Republic forces.
Unfortunately, despite their combined effort, the invasion of the Galactic Republic was a success.
Many geonosians and the separatists had been forced to flee from their homeworld into the uncertainty.
Despite the dark time they had faced, the Galactic Republic had failed to secure one of the most important pieces of intelligence, the plan for the Ultimate Weapon.
Poggle the lesser entrusted the weapons schematic to the Sith Lord, the future of the Confederacy of independent systems had been secured.

# The Second Battle of Geonosis

Following the end of the first invasion by the Galactic Republic, Poggle the lesser and his fellow Separatists did not take too long to gather their forces and returned to Geonosis.
This time they successfully opened the Geonosis primary droid Foundry with Poggle the lesser, overseeing the production.
One of the projects of the Foundry is the Super Tank, designed to eradicate the clone trooper forces.
They were indeed effective against the clone troopers as the battle shifted into the Confederacy’s favor.
However, the disruption from Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Luminara Unduli would diminish their effort as the two Jedi successfully infiltrated the Reactor room inside the Geonosis primary droid Foundry.
After realized this transgression , he ordered his men to use the bombs to demolished the foundry in a hope to eliminate the Jedi threat.
After the explosion, Poggle the lesser and his subordinates traveled to the Progate Temple, the sacred site where Queen Karina the Great resided within, guarded by the undead armies reanimated by the brain worms.
The surviving Jedi followed them through their trail to the Progate temple.
The Jedi entered the temple in an attempt to capture Poggle the lesser, their attempt would fail as they had been greeted by the undeads.
While in chaos, the geonosians successfully captured the Jedi Luminara Unduli.
They send her to Queen Karina the Great as a gift.
Later on the Jedi General Anakin Skywalker with Jedi master Obi-wan Kenobi came to rescue the Jedi Luminara Unduli and killed Queen Karina the Great by collapsing the sacred Progate temple.
The fate of Poggle the lesser had been put into the hands of the Galactic Republic as he had been held captive and brutally interrogated by the Jedi General Anakin Skywalker.
His destination was the Republic Center for Military Operation at Coruscant where he would be routinely interrogated to reveal the information regarding the Confederacy of Independent systems.

# The Imprisonment

During the time of his imprisonment, the Galactic Republic intelligence did not give up about the Ultimate Weapon as they continued to interrogate Poggle the lesser.
With his deep loyalty toward the Confederacy, Poggle upheld the secret with all he could do until the Lieutenant Commander Orson Krennic offered his freedom in exchange for the Ultimate Weapon’s plan.
He agreed to this offer but without true loyalty.

The Ultimate Weapon began its construction after the release of Poggle to his homeworld.
With much retaliation from his fellow geonosian, the archduke united his people and began the building of the Ultimate Weapon.
While under the stage of construction, Poggle the lesser ordered his drones to initiate the chaos in order to make a distraction for his escape.
After his successful escape, the archduke would join the Confederacy once more.

# The Last Effort

Even with all he could do, the defeat of the Confederacy of Independent systems is imminent.
General Grievous hid him as well as others Speratist Councilors at the planet Utapau for their own safety.
After the cyborg general had failed to attack Coruscant and the death of Count Dooku.
Once again they fled to a fortified bunker at Mustafar where they and the entire Separatist Council disappeared.
Few and far between know that Darth Vader, the Emperor’s enforcer executed them under the Dark Lord’s decree.
