# Section I

Calphayus, also known as “The Prophet of the Masters”, was a Sith assassin and wielded a cyan bladed saberstaff.
Calphayus will be the last surviving Dread Master.
Calphayus is the one among the Dread Masters who had planned and organized the assault on Asation, even though he never even appeared on Asation except through a mental presence to the strike teams of the Republic and Sith Empire who came to assist the Gree Enclave.
Calphayus dispatched three of the most powerful Dread Host Commanders, whose names were Ciphas, Kel’sara, and Heirad.
The three Commanders ultimately proved themselves in battle, but through the intensity of the fight, they were defeated.
Through Kel’sara’s death, Calphayus stated that “The Shield is broken, but the sword is drawn.” After Styrak’s death on Darvannis, Calphayus was one of the first Dread Masters to feel the intensity of the effects caused by his death, beginning to go insane.
He began to witness visions of great pain, becoming stronger and more detailed, but his overconfidence led him to believe that they were truthful.
Calphayus fought against the team responsible for the death of Kephess, Styrak, Brontes, Kel’sara, Heirad, and Ciphas.
Due to his mastery of time, space and knowledge allowed him to extend his power through the future and past, however, his plans failed.
Eventually Calphayus was defeated, he deserted the Palace on Oricon, hopeless and broken.
He wandered Oricon after the deaths of his fellow Masters, seeking help from the Republic Strike team encampment.
He reasoned with the strike team and they agreed to forgive him for his crimes, handing him to the Jedi so that he may be cared for and evaluated.
