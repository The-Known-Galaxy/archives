# Overview
Eldon Ax was a human female Sith born Cinzia Xandret and was the daughter of the technician Lema Xandret.
Eldon was extremely gifted with the Force; she served as the apprentice of a ruthless master, Darth Chratis, who shaped her to become full of rage and determined to kill her mother for her betrayal.
At a young age, Cinzia was stolen from her family to join The Sith Order to become Eldon Ax, and this infuriated Lema.
At the age of seventeen, Eldon’s mother was considered a traitor to the Empire and so Eldon decided to hunt her down so she could kill her, however, Lema was already dead.
Eldon and a few enemies she made on the journey arrived at Sebaddon with Galactic Republic and Sith Empire reinforcements, which included Chratis who died during the invasion.
The Republic and Empire were forced into an alliance to destroy Lema’s droids and Eldon reached a lab that contained a clone.
The clone was of Cinzia Xandret herself.
Cinzia was stuck on the planet to be “protected” by all of Lema’s droids.
Eldon, at the sight of her, despised her clone sister until they got personal about their mother.
Satele Shan, Grand Master of the Jedi Order, cut the clone free from her bacta tank in hopes she could escape, sadly the clone died.
However, before she died, she told Eldon the password to shut down all the droids.
Eldon returned to the Dark Council and was placed on trial for killing Darth Chratis until Darth Howl, Dark Councillor, took her in as his apprentice.
