# History
Xendor was once a respected Jedi Knight, but his desire to train both sides of the Force made him leave the ancient Jedi Order.
After leaving the Jedi Order, Xendor opened a Jedi academy that taught students the way of the Bogan, alongside Force traditions, such as the Dai Bendu, the Baran Do, the Chatos Academy, etc.
Xendor’s academy grew due to his teachings, and the students in the academy changed its name to the Legions of Lettow.
This new group aimed to defend their traditions and philosophy from the Jedi High Council.

Xendor served as the general of the Legions of Lettow during the First Great Schism in 24,500 BBY.
One of the many battles he led the Legions of Lettow on was the Battle of Ossus, where he was forced to retreat.
Despite his defeat on Ossus, he tried to ally with the Galactic Republic to go against the Jedi Order, but was unsuccessful.
During the Battle of Columus, Xendor engaged in a fight against the ‘Green Blade’ Awdrysta Pina, who defeated the Dark Jedi with the help of Force meld.
