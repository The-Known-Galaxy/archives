# Overview

DT-5537 was a human male Death Trooper that served the Galactic Empire.
His real name was never exposed because a lot of Death Troopers were secretive and those who werenâ€™t had code names, such as Pik or Waffle.
DT-5537 was part of the special Unit TI-23, also known as the undying unit.
On the Imperial planet of Scarif, DT-5537 had to face severe training camps and received classified orders.
He was very skilled in the art of guerilla warfare tactics and proved to do really well in the training camps.
He was very efficient when it came down to demolition and improvisation.
Unfortunately, not many of his battles were mentioned and a lot of missions he went on are classified.
However, he proved to be a very skilled soldier and was the only notable member on Unit TI-23.
