# Overview
Darth Malora was a human female Dark Lord of the Sith, who served the reconstituted Sith Empire as Overlord of the Sphere of Scientific Advancements and Dark Councillor.
As an apprentice to the human Sith Lord Rennings, Malora felt his experiments were just a waste of time and that the Dark Council gave him too much credit.
Malora recruited two acolytes to help her sabotage one of Renning’s plans.
However, this backfired when the acolytes betrayed her and turned her over to Renning.
This led to Renning punishing Malora by using Force lightning and disowning her.
Luckily for Malora, she lived longer than he did so she became a Dark Councillor.
During her time as Dark Councillor, Malora led an invasion of Ossus and encountered the deranged Sith Lord, Darth Malgus.
Malgus took command of Malora’s forces, which infuriated her, so she tried to attack him and failed.
After the attack, Malora returns to the Dark Council only to find out that she had been replaced by Darth Savik.
