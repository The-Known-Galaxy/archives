# Overview
Savage Opress was a Dathomirian Zabrakn as well as a Nightbrother who grew into a Sith Lord alongside his younger brother.
He was personally selected by Asajj Ventress to become her servant following her severe test selection.
Mother Talzin and her Nightsister enchantresses used their dark magic to bestow Opress with frightening abilities, placing him underneath their rule.
After learning from Dooku, Opress was dispatched to Toydaria to capture King Katuunko and persuade him to join the Separatists.
During a fight to stop Opress, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker were encountered by Opress and his former master Ventress.
After striking Opress with Force lightning until the apprentice implored his master for mercy, Ventress told herself as his master's betrayer and tried to kill him.
Opress fled and returned to Mother Talzin, who informed him he had another brother who could aid him.
Opress journeyed across the galaxy looking for his brother, Maul, who was overpowered by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Opress became Maul's apprentice, and jointly, the brothers hatched a plot to bring Kenobi out into the open and slaughter him.
After bringing Maul back to Talzin, she cast magic on him and mended his mind and body.
Transmitting a message to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, the brothers threatened to kill an entire village on the planet if Kenobi didn't come to encounter Maul.
Deeming Maul would kill the entire village just to get to him, Kenobi went to protect the people and stop Maul.
Once there, Maul, with his brother, whom Kenobi was oblivious was related to the situation ambushed him, seized him, and imprisoned him.
Onboard the vessel, Maul prepared to torture Kenobi to death and would have had it not been for Asajj Ventress.
Dooku's former apprentice turned into a bounty hunter and tracked Opress to Raydonia to calm the million credit reward on him for the disorder he caused at plot Dribble's diner at the spaceport on Stobar.
After rescuing Kenobi, Ventress and the battered Jedi master battled Opress and Maul, barely fleeing with their lives.
After the failed try on Kenobi's life, Opress wreaked devastation across the galaxy with his brother, accumulating a mass fortune.
The brothers attracted a band of pirates to their ship and persuaded them to join forces with them.
After joining the brothers, the pirates attacked their old leader, Hondo Ohnaka.
Following the brothers from one of their recent incidents, Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Adi Gallia joined forces with Ohnaka.
The two Jedi encountered the brothers while Ohnaka dealt with his traitorous crew.
During the duration of the duel, Opress killed Gallia, leaving Kenobi to confront the two brothers alone.
Kenobi directed the brothers away from the pirates, so Ohnaka could deal with his men.
Kenobi dueled the two brothers.
Ostensibly beaten, Kenobi maneuvered during the duel, causing Maul to cut off his brother's arm.
Defeated, the two fled from the Jedi and the reunified pirates.
Fleeing in their ship, the pirates shot it down, forcing the brothers to utilize the escape pod and leave the riches to the pirates.
Close to death, drifting through space in their escape pod, the two brothers were rescued by Pre Vizsla and the Death Watch.
Recognizing that each side could be useful to the other, Vizsla, Maul and Opress decided to join forces to eliminate mutual enemies: Dooku and Kenobi.
However, each side intended to betray the other.

Jointly with Vizsla, the brothers created the Shadow Collective, an organization consisting of several large crime families, including Black Sun, the Pyke Syndicate, and the Hutt clan.
Operating their combined resources, the Shadow Collective bombarded Mandalore.
The Mandalorian authorities were incapable to stand against such a force.
Pre-Vizsla and Death Watch came to stop the assault, as a result, Vizsla and his Death Watch were seen as Mandalore's heroes.
Ultimately displaying his true colors, Vizsla had the brothers arrested, assumed total control of Mandalore, and dissolved the Shadow Collective.
Escaping from prison, Opress pursued Maul, who challenged Vizsla to single combat and won.
The two brothers seized authority of Mandalore and a fragment of Vizsla's soldiers.
those who remained loyal to their deceased leader revolted.
Feeling his former apprentice's power growing, Darth Sidious journeyed to Mandalore.
Endeavoring to hold on to their power, the two brothers dueled the Sith Lord.
During the fight, Maul was knocked out, leaving Opress to duel the Sith Master alone.
Not capable to stand up against the superior foe, Opress was slaughtered.
Dying, the magic of Mother Talzin exited him, transforming him into his previous physical form.
After Opress' death, Maul tried to duel Sidious alone and failed.
The Sith Master said he wouldn't kill his former apprentice because he had other uses for him.
