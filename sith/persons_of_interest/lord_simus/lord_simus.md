# Overview

Lord Simus was a bodiless male Sith magician who served the Old Sith Empire faithfully as a Sith Councilor for a century.
During his time as an aspirant of the dark lord throne, Lord Simus challenged his rival Marka Ragnos and got beheaded.
By the application of Sith magic, he persisted beyond natural death.

Under the reign of Marka Ragnos, Lord Simus helped shape the Sith Empire in its golden age as the Dark Lord's advisor and continued to guide the Sith even after the great Ragnos eventual demise.
Despite the volatile nature of the Old Sith Empire politics, Lord Simus the gray-skinned Sith had been well respected by all ancient warlords.

With his death, the Sith mourned and called for vengeance.
Led by Naga Sadow, his apprentice, later Dark Lord of the Sith.
The Old Sith Empire would have been pulled into one of the most bloody times in its history, the Great Hyperspace War.

# Dark Lord Aspirant

Born centuries before 5000 BBY, the young and ambitious Warlord Simus grew strong in both the art of Sith sorcery and combat prowess.
He accumulated wealth and power, abiding for the time that he could rise to greatness.

Following the death of the previous Dark Lord of the Sith in 5150 BBY, a fierce battle among the Sith competed for the Dark Lord's mantle ensued.
With Marka Ragnos as his most dangerous contender for the throne, Lord Simus challenged him into a duel and got decapitated by the hands of the Dark Lord.
Although the Sith Lord got beheaded, he did not give up on his life.
With his great knowledge of Sith sorcery, Lord Simus used the ancient and long-lost Sith magic to keep himself alive by preserving his head in the crystal sphere.

# Sith Councilor

After the ascension to the throne of Marka Ragnos, Lord Simus eventually proved himself and earned a seat on the Sith council, a sole ruling council of the Old Sith Empire.
Despite losing all of his combat prowess and having to rely on servants to move him around, his wisdom, vision and cunning gained him respect from his fellow councilors.
Even though he and Marka Ragnos were old rivals, Lord Simus put aside all of their previous resentments in a favor of the Empire as he advised Marka Ragnos in his many plans and aspirations.
While serving as a Sith Councilor, the Lord took a Half-breed Sith named Naga Sadow as his apprentice.
Naga Sadow would have been raised learning much Sith sorcery and wisdom from his master.
Another which future Dark Lord of the Sith would have learned was the transgression of the Jedi and the Republic as the vision of expansion and victory of the Old Sith Empire over their Ancient enemy would be fixated upon by both the master and apprentice.

# The End of the Golden Age

Over a hundred years of stability and prosperity, the Old Sith Empire faced another inner turmoil.
Eventually the deterioration of time finally caught up upon Marka Ragnos as he passed away on his deathbed.
Naturally, the Sith were seeking the new Dark Lord to be their ultimate ruler.

Among them were the two aspirants of the Dark Lord’s mantle, Ludo Kressh and Naga Sadow.
Both of them have conflicted views about the vision of the Empire.
Ludo Kressh detested the expansion of the Empire as to preserve the stability, backed by many of the Sith.
Naga Sadow on the other hand seeked to expand the Empire, a vision shared with his master Lord Simus.

After the clash between Ludo Kressh and Naga Sadow in front of the tomb of Marka Ragnos at the sacred catacomb world, Korriban.
The arrival of the scout ship of the Galactic Republic, starbreaker 12 landing on the planet sowed even more chaos.
The passengers Jori and Gav Daragon were immediately arrested and put into prison at Sith Citadel on the Sith throne world, Ziost.

During much deliberation and disagreement between Sith Lords, Lord Simus served as mediator between the Sith Councillors to ease tension.
Him and Naga Sadow agreed upon the idea to use the Republic explorers as tools to find their ancient enemy.
For the Sith to launch war against them with the aim to seize territory.

However, even with wisdom and respect gained from many years sitting at the Sith Council’s throne, the majority of the councilors did not follow through with their vision and sided with Ludo Kressh.
The fate of the two explorers would be execution.
Lord Simus would travel to the explorers’ cell to inform the twins about their final verdict.

# Death

Unlike his master Lord Simus, Naga Sadow did not give up on his ambition.
Soon to be Dark Lord of the Sith secretly set a plan which would result in war between the Galactic Republic and the Old Sith Empire into motion.

The old Lord Simus sensed the disturbance from the cell which held the twins.
He followed and found many dead Sith, his ally Naga Sadow stood with his back turned.
Lord Simus thought that this was the result of the Republic Raid and proceeded to ask Naga Sadow with worry.
The apprentice turned to answer him with an apology then shot the old Sith and his servant with the Republic blaster pistol.
The true death of Lord Simus.
With the death of his former master seemingly by the hand of the Republic, Naga Sadow was able to convince the Sith Council about the threat of their long-hated enemy.
Reputation of Lord Simus earned him much respect and admiration in life.
Many would go on calling the Republic “monster” for their crime against the bodiless Simus.
His death not only made the council rationalize the decision to attack the republic but also induced the emotional response from the Sith.
