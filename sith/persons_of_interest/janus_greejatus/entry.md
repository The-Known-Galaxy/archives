# Overview

Janus Greejatus was a human Dark Side Adept who served under Emperor Sheev Palpatine within his Ruling Council during the Imperial Era.
He carried a short shrivelled stature with a pale complexation and sunken eyes and was seen wearing distinctly bright robes and a hat, both seemingly oversized for the old man.
Having speciesist ideologies, he would eventually succumb to the same tragic end as his master with the destruction of the second Death Star in 4 ABY.

# Biography

Born on the planet Chommell Minor of the Mid Rim, Greejatus grew disdain against all other species after encouragement from his father as they had crippled his family’s wealth.
He and Palpatine enrolled in the Legislative Youth Program, entering the political stage for his planet.
Greejatus was sent by King Bon Tapalo of Naboo to attend Senator Vidar Kim’s funeral held in Galactic City of the planet Coruscant; Kim had been killed by a ploy orchestrated by Palpatine and Hego Damask.
Partaking in the ceremony by transporting his ashes to and scattering them in the Solleu River on the planet Naboo, Greejatus gained political support and became a pawn for Palpatine’s grand scheme.
Palpatine was elected as the new Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and positioned Greejatus as the Senator of the Chommell sector in 32 BBY.
However, he was replaced by Horace Vancil in the reelection that happened two years later.
Later, the former senator earned recognition as a Senior Adviser to the Supreme Chancellor during the Clone Wars, influencing the activities within the planet Naboo.
One such event was the homecoming of Poggle the Lesser on the planet Geonosis, which he attended with other colleagues as representatives of Palpatine’s office.
Following the advent of the Galactic Empire, Greejatus’ loyalty to his master was demonstrated; he continued to serve Palpatine as one of his closest advisers, gaining a prominent place within the Imperial Ruling Council in 14 BBY.
His role involved the establishment of the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order, which aimed to supervise the Empire’s day-to-day management.
Still with apparent hatred towards non-humans, he was also crucial in the projects of the secretive Imperial Department of Redesign, a task force enabled to eliminate non-human threats.
Sometime before 4 BBY, Greejatus and another fellow adviser, Sim Aloo, were soon made into Dark Side Adepts due to their sensitivity to the Force.
Palpatine planned to keep his trustworthy underlings in power so he had more accessible reign over the galaxy.
The Adepts were ordered to retrieve Sith artefacts, specifically the Enchantress’ book of Ushruu, so they hired a group of the Trandoshan species to do their bidding.
Yet, this plan was in vain as the team were eaten by the queen of the Corellian hounds, who was guarding the book on the world.
In 4 ABY, the loyal adviser accompanied the Emperor aboard the second Death Star, along with five other advisers, presumably perished in its explosion.
