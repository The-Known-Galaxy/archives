# Introduction
During the Galactic Civil War, Merf was a male Vorzydiak who belonged to the Freelies gang on the planet Vorzyd V.
Merf, a devoted Freely, took part in a risky ransom plot in which his crew abducted famed Rebel commander Leia Organa and attempted to sell her back to the Alliance for a hefty ransom in 1 ABY.
However, a group of Stormtroopers quickly surrounded the Freelies' lair, Organa managed to flee during the gunbattle, and Merf and his friends were left with nothing.

# Biography
Merf, a male Vorzydiak, was a native of the Vorzyd V world in the outer rim, also called "The Gambler's World." By 1 ABY, Merf had joined the Freelies, a group of troubled young people led by a Human named Jax.
Merf and his companions were well-known for prowling the grimy alleys of the capital city of Efavan in search of scores when they came across a pair of roaming, valuable-looking droids one evening.
Merf and the group tried to take C-3PO and R2-D2 for themselves but quickly discovered they had forgotten the tool they needed to free C-3PO from his restraints.
This allowed R2-D2 enough time to summon a police droid, which chased the Freelies away.
 

However, once the Freelies entered a weapons store with the intention of pulling a prank, Merf and his companions soon ran into those same droids again.
The Freelies were persuaded to keep their distance by the droids' use of automated defensive weaponry, which quickly malfunctioned and caused damage to the shop.
Instead, they stayed back and followed the droids to the spacecraft Luke Skywalker, a rebel hero, owned.
Leia Organa, a famous Rebel leader, was taken there by the Freelies after they deceived C-3PO into letting them board.
They brought her back to their stronghold and demanded five million credits in exchange for her safe return to the Alliance.
 

However, the Freelies' intentions were seriously derailed when Bemmie was taken hostage by Imperial Stormtroopers who were also searching for Organa.
Skywalker saved Bemmie from horrifying torment, and the appreciative Vorzydiak guided Skywalker back to the Freelie lair.
The two parties were briefly forced to join forces when the hideout was invaded by a squad of Stormtroopers, despite Jax's refusal to trust Skywalker.
Once he made contact with the commander of the troops, Jax intended to sell Skywalker and Organa.
However, Bemmie managed to direct the Rebels to a covert exit from the hideout, saving them from Merf and the Freelies' plans.



# Personality and Traits
Merf was a devoted member of the Freelies gang, obeying Jax's orders and adhering to the group's belief that the most crucial thing was for the Freelies to be left alone.
Merf lusted after the two droids C-3PO and R2-D2, and he found it difficult to imagine what it would be like actually to have two droids of his own.
