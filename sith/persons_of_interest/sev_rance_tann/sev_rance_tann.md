# Biography
Sev'rance Tann, a rare Force-sensitive Chiss female born on the distant planet Csilla during the waning days of the Galactic Republic, possessed a unique gift - the ability to predict her enemy's movements with uncanny precision.
Recognizing her potential, she attended the prestigious Chiss Academy, where she honed her skills in military strategy and tactics.
One remarkable incident during her time at the academy showcased her brilliance.
When challenged to train the notoriously untrainable Yresilini species into an organized army, Tann demonstrated her prowess by appointing one of the creatures as her "general." When the first general failed to cooperate, she executed him in front of his comrades, sending a clear message that defiance would not be tolerated.
The second general complied, leading the troops to follow her orders implicitly.
This achievement earned Tann high marks and fueled stories of her exceptional abilities among those under her command.
Tann's abilities caught the attention of Count Dooku, the Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious, who sought skilled commanders to aid the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) during the Separatist Crisis.
Dooku, aware of her existence through Chiss contacts like Thrawn, invited her and her lover, Vandalor, to join the CIS.
Tann became a Dark Acolyte under Dooku's tutelage, delving into the dark side of the Force and mastering lightsaber combat.
Quickly rising through the ranks, Tann earned the trust of Dooku and other prominent Separatist leaders, becoming a general in the CIS military and the leader of Dooku's Dark Acolytes.
When the Clone Wars began in 22 BBY, Tann received orders from Dooku to secure his escape from the planet Geonosis.
This battle marked the start of the galactic conflict, with the Jedi and their newly formed Grand Army of the Republic clashing with the CIS forces.
Tann's tactical genius shone in subsequent missions.
She oversaw the construction of the CIS's own Decimators, powerful weapons based on Republic technology.
With her forces, she attacked the heavily fortified planet Sarapin, plunging many Core Worlds into darkness by destroying its geothermal generators.
The Republic, determined to counter Tann's threat, launched a counterattack on Sarapin.
Jedi Master Echuu Shen-Jon, seeking vengeance for his slain Padawan at Geonosis, led the charge.
Despite valiant efforts, Tann's mastery of the Decimators and her tactical brilliance thwarted the Republic's initial efforts.
Shen-Jon, guided by his desire for revenge, fell to the dark side during his pursuit of Tann.
In their final confrontation on Krant, Tann underestimated Shen-Jon's newfound power, and he ultimately killed her.
This marked the end of Tann's service in the Clone Wars, but her impact on the conflict and the fate of the Decimators continued to reverberate.
Despite her short tenure, Sev'rance Tann's exceptional abilities and strategic prowess made her one of the Confederacy's most formidable commanders.
Her mysterious departure from Chiss Space and her intriguing legacy left an enduring mark on the history of the Clone Wars.



# Personality and traits
Sev'rance Tann exuded confidence in her abilities, displaying unwavering faith in her capacity to fulfill Count Dooku's orders.
She held herself in high regard and boasted about her swift conquest of Sarapin when tasked with its capture.
Her overconfidence and underestimation of her adversaries led to her downfall, as she faced Jedi Knight Jor Drakas and Echuu Shen-Jon without any hesitation, ultimately meeting her end at the hands of Shen-Jon.
Tann was known for her mocking and disrespectful demeanor towards her enemies.
After killing Stam Reath during the Battle of Geonosis, she taunted his master, and during her final duel with Shen-Jon, she ridiculed him, even provoking him about losing another Padawan to her.
Her persuasive nature enabled her to rally Separatist forces not under her command and negotiate with Boorka the Hutt to consider trading with the CIS.
In her past, Tann displayed ruthless behavior during her time at the Chiss Academy, where she executed a Yresilini creature as an example to instill fear and obedience among its comrades.
This method proved effective, as her actions ensured absolute compliance with her orders without any questions.
Sev'rance Tann's audacious personality, sharp wit, and unyielding determination made her a formidable commander within the ranks of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
However, her overconfidence and penchant for mockery ultimately led to her demise in the Clone Wars.



# Power and abilities
Sev'rance Tann possessed a wealth of military knowledge, making her a skilled strategist and tactician, evident in her successful command of various battles throughout the Clone Wars.
As a Chiss general, she showcased remarkable expertise in maneuvering her forces and outwitting her opponents on the battlefield.
In addition to her commanding abilities, Tann was a formidable combatant, actively engaging in fights alongside the Separatist infantry.
Trained in the dark side of the Force by Count Dooku, she wielded a yellow-bladed lightsaber and demonstrated proficiency with it, defeating multiple Jedi in lightsaber duels during the Clone Wars.
Despite her Force sensitivity and training as a Dark Acolyte, Tann's true strength lay in her military prowess as a general.
Her tactical acumen allowed her to outmaneuver her enemies, earning the praise and recognition of Count Dooku himself.
However, in her final confrontation, Master Echuu Shen-Jon proved to be her match, defeating her in lightsaber combat, and ultimately bringing an end to her service in the Clone Wars.
