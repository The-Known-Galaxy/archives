# Overview
Silri was a prominent member of the Nightsisters clan, a powerful Dark Side witch of Dathomir and the one who originally found the Carbonite Sith Army.
She worked with Tyber Zann and helped out the Zann Consortium.
She was very interested in seeing Zann’s fury firsthand during the Battle of Yavin.
She was decently knowledgeable on Dark Force abilities (such as Drain Life), and often used them in battle, alongside a lightwhip.
She also had a pet rancor named Cuddles, whom she summoned during battle.
She had a very violent personality, often arguing with Urai Fen, Tyber Zann’s second in command.

# Biography
She was taken captive by the Empire following the Battle of Yavin, along with other members of the Nightsisters, as the Imperial Governor wished to have power over them.
This attempt failed however, as the witches of Dathomir rebelled against him.
Tyber Zann, in the meanwhile, found a Sith Holocron which he couldn’t decipher, and after finding out about the Nightsisters, during the Ground Battle on Dathomir he, along with his second-in-command Urai Fen, took Silri away from her prison, and she agreed to decipher the Holocron in return.
Silri then revealed that the Holocron only contained a Star Map, and nothing else.
Zann at first tried to sell the artifact, but it was then stolen by Grand Admiral Thrawn.
Silri got mad at what happened and was forced to reveal that the Sith Holocron actually led to somewhere else, and wasn’t simply a Star Map.
So she, along with Zann and Fen, went to raid Emperor Palpatine’s private vault.
While going back out of Coruscant, Silri noticed the deaths of Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine and informed Zann about it.
Deciding it was time to steal the eclipse, he launched an assault on Kuat, emerging victorious.
Silri then fully decoded the Sith Holocron and brought Tyber Zann to the Carbonite Sith Army’s location.
