# Biography

During his youth, Jax served in the Galactic Empire as a stormtrooper and even worked as one of Agent Blackhole's referred to as Blackhole stormtroopers.
Jax distinguished himself as one of the finest in his squad, and it didn't take long for this to be noticed.
Jax was then taken from his unit and sent to get prepared to be a Royal Guard.
Jax underwent rigorous training that included learning the lethal combat technique known as Echani.
Jax and the other candidates would put their mettle to the test in the Squall, an arena, under the careful eye of Master Ved Kennede.
It was here where Jax first met Kir Kanos, and would often spar eachother with Jax as the winner.
Jax and Kanos were top students in their class, but Burr Danid was more highly regarded for his flawless fighting style and unequaled talent.

The young man was brutally murdered by Vader in front of the whole group of trainees.
Although Jax had anticipated this to happen.After spending a year together, Kir Kanos, Lemmet Tauk, Jax, and Frost were taken to Master Kennede, who told them that only one more exam remained and it would be a duel to death.
Frost was swiftly killed by Jax in an unilateral battle.
As the last two reached the Emperor's apartments, his dead corpse was hidden from view.
Jax was permitted to observe Tauk and Kanos go through the identical test that he had just finished.
Both Kanos and Jax were promoted to the rank of Royal Guard.
Jax's following duty in the Royal Guard is unclear, although it is presumed that he did a commendable job protecting the Emperor.
However, during the entirety of Jax's time in the Empire, his allegiances were to himself and his prospects for ascending to a position of greater authority rather than Palpatine.
Jax's battalion was the one sent to the Dark Lady Lumiya when she asked Isard to send a division of the Royal Guard.
Jax was being trained as Lumiya's Sith apprentice when she first noticed the Force potential in him.
Jax honed his telekinesis and precognition skills while receiving his training in the Force.
Jax began to interact with many of the influential figures in Imperial politics within Lumiya's circle.
He met Quest, a clever political swindler who had spent some time gaining a quiet majority on the Council.
The two Force-users advanced together to seize control of the Empire.
Quest provided Jax with a task force headed by the Star Destroyers Emperor's Revenge and Steadfast as well as a military unit commanded by General Redd Wessel by using his clout with the Ruling Council.
Jax also appointed Lieutenant Geff Blim to be his "hand" at this time, remembering the assistance Mara Jade had given Palpatine.
He met with Nom Anor at this period and subsequently told Lumiya about the odd agent.However, the relationship between this agent and Lumiya was broken when Jax was slain.
Jax returned to the Royal Guard after Palpatine regained power of the Empire in 10 ABY, although his true allegiances belonged to his previous comrades.
Jax was aware that his confrontation with the Emperor was about to occur.
Jax managed to entirely remove himself from the Royal Guard's database and any future duties.
By paying off the Emperor's doctor to sabotage Palpatine's surviving clones.
Palpatine's final clone body accelerated in age and altered due to the sabotage, indicating his demise.
To eliminate the last of the Royal Guards, Jax dispatched an army of stormtroopers.
Jax was furious because one Royal Guard, Jax's nemesis Kir Kanos, managed to escape the massacre.
Jax made the decision to postpone his aspirations for galactic hegemony until Kanos had been found and killed.
In the end, Kanos struck Jax in the chest with his weapon.
Kanos took off Jax's helmet and informed the deceased Jax that he was unable to wear it.
As Kanos departed the barren planet, Jax's lifeless body was still lying still in the middle of the Squall, where it all had started.
