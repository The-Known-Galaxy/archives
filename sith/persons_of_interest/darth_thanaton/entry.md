# Overview

Darth Thanaton was a human male Sith Inquisitor and a member of the Dark Council.
He served as the Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge for a little while until he died in a Kaggath against the mighty Sith Lord, Darth Nox.
Thanaton was born by the name of Teneb Kel and was a slave to the Empire until he was discovered to be Force-sensitive by a Sith Lord known as Calypho who trained him on Korriban.
On Korriban, Calypho taught Thanaton the secrets of the Force and the Sith.
He also taught Thanaton how to assassinate by sending him on missions.
Due to his ambitions and greed, Calypho was arrested by the Dark Council.
After his master's arrest, Thanaton was sent to serve the Imperial Military by order of the Dark Council so they could observe him.
He achieved many victories for the Empire, due to his skill in combat, but the Dark Council still saw his master’s flaws in him.
To prove his loyalty, the Dark Council sent Thanaton to Dromund Kaas so that he could kill Calypho.
Before killing his former master, Thanaton was sent on an important mission to find the Sith Emperor’s former apprentice, Exal Kressh.
Thanaton went with his friend, Maggot, to Lenico IV.
There he encountered Kressh.
The two duelled for a bit until Kressh had the upper hand and defeated Thanaton.
Thanaton remained on the planet left for dead.
Thanaton started having visions of the Emperor’s quest for immortality and saw that Kressh was vital because he was a child of the Emperor, which was because the Emperor stole Force-sensitive children and used them in his army so he could gain immortality and power to conquer the galaxy.
He then located and killed Kressh and Maggot so the Emperor’s plans would not be revealed.

# The hunt for Zash's allies

After the death of Kressh, Thanaton demanded the Dark Council promoted him to Lord, so he could kill Zash, and so he claimed the title Darth Thanaton.
He then started to build a power base in the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and was considered a Sith traditionalist, because he did things the old way.
Thanaton encountered the deceiving Sith Lord, Zash.
Thanaton and Darth Skotia, his new ally, considered Zash to be a scheming and corrupting Sith, because of the way she treated her apprentices.
Zash deceived her apprentice, who would later be known as Darth Nox, to kill Darth Skotia.
Zash was then promoted to Darth.
Once she was promoted, Zash started her quest for immortality.
This surprised Darth Thanaton.
Zash sent her apprentice all over the galaxy to claim artifacts so she could transfer her spirit into a different body.
Once her apprentice encountered her on Dromund Kaas, he killed her and was promoted to Lord Kallig.
At the same time, Darth Thanaton ascended to become a part of the Dark Council and became Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge.
With his ascension, Thanaton used his power to kill the new Sith Lord and failed multiple times.
Thanaton declared a Kaggath on the young Kallig and travelled to Corellia.
Kallig beat the powerful Sith, which forced Thanaton into retreating to Korriban and begging the Dark Council for mercy.
Kallig tracked down Thanaton and met him in front of the Dark Council.
They then proceeded with the Kaggath and Thanaton was defeated.
The Dark Council saw Thanaton as a failure.
He broke the rules of the Kaggath out of cowardness.
This irritated the Council and so Darth Mortis snapped Thanaton’s neck using the Force as Thanaton begged for mercy.
The death of Thanaton left an empty seat in the Dark Council.
Due to his victory in the Kaggath, Lord Kallig ascended to Dark Council member and Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge.
Kallig was titled Darth Nox and would become one of the most powerful Sith in history due to his ability to bind and communicate with Force Ghosts because he was a descendant of Aloysius Kallig.
