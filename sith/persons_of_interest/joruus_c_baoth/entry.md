# Introduction

Joruus C’baoth was a psychotic Dark Jedi clone of Jorus C'baoth, leader of outbound flight, and a crucial character in the Thrawn campaign.
Palpatine manufactured him, and he was appointed Guardian of the Imperial warehouse at Mount Tantiss on Wayland.
Grand Admiral Thrawn visited Wayland after learning of the storehouse's existence.
With the assurance that he would have new apprentices including the likes of Luke Skywalker, he was successful in persuading the Dark Jedi to assist him in his effort to destroy the New Republic.
Thrawn would later order that C'Baoth be held captive in Mount Tantiss as he became conscious of the clone’s true danger.
His life was ended by Mara Jade and his body would erupt in a dark force explosion.

# Biography

It was said that the Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth had a tissue sample taken from him just before he boarded the Outbound Flight in 27 BBY to travel to the Unknown Regions and beyond.
Extracted from every passenger on the outbound flight, it was justified by the possibility of viruses or epidemics developing while they were in space.
These were utilized to produce a clone from a sample of C'Baoth's tissue.
Shortly after the extraction, C'baoth and his fellow travelers boarded Outbound Flight for their journey, but Thrawn's actions prevented the ship from carrying out its purpose.
Emperor Palpatine once sent a Guardian to the planet Wayland to watch over his secret warehouses and cargo atop Mount Tantiss.
The Guardian was neglected for the following five years after the Battle of Endor and Palpatine's passing, during which time he became bored.
The Guardian was then challenged to a battle by Joruus C'baoth, who had just arrived on the planet.
The Guardian was dead, and C'baoth assumed his position, utilizing the Force to maintain control over the people of Wayland.
C'baoth received orders from the reincarnated Emperor Palpatine at some time before or after his combat with the Guardian, the identical orders issued to all of Palpatine's Dark Jedi.
But clone mania caused him to disobey or forget these directives, and like Thrawn, he would function as a diversion to hide the Emperor's increasing power.
Later, with the goal of using everything there to further his battle against the New Republic, Thrawn managed to locate the Emperor's private storeroom on Wayland.
He was aware that a Dark Jedi Guardian was present under Palpatine's rule and that it would be advantageous for his cause.
They traveled to a settlement close to Mount Tantiss, where they were greeted by an elderly man who revealed to the Imperials that he had murdered the mountain's guardian long ago and had since taken over the planet.
He took them to a tomb where he attempted to murder them by unleashing a lethal blast of Force lightning.
He was only spared death by the Grand Admiral's cautious usage of Ysalamiri.
The mad Dark Jedi was persuaded to join forces with Thrawn by making him a promise that his apprentices would be his to shape whatever he pleased.
C'baoth has grand plans to rule the galaxy by building an army of Dark Jedi.
The first of his Jedi would be Skywalker, his sister, and the kids of the Solo family.
In multiple engagements, C'baoth fought alongside Thrawn, boosting the effectiveness of the Imperial troops by 40%.
When the Jedi approached him on Jomark, he also succeeded in one of his primary objectives: capturing Luke Skywalker.
C'baoth had sensed Skywalker's presence during the First Battle of Nomad City earlier in the campaign and had spoken with the Jedi.
At the same time, rumors that a Jedi was on Jomark were being propagated by Imperial soldiers.
Skywalker finally visited Jomark, despite his skepticism about the existence of a Jedi who had not only survived the Great Jedi Purge but also hadn't helped the Rebel Alliance or even disclosed himself after Palpatine's death.
He encountered C'baoth there, who identified himself as a Jedi Master.
He started Skywalker's instruction, imparting knowledge on him that was at odds with what the young Jedi had previously learned from Yoda.
Skywalker was taught by C'baoth that Jedi should utilize their authority to rule inferiors since they were superior to everyone else.
He also taught him that in order to govern those who are not Force-sensitive, Jedi should utilize force and pain as their teaching tools.
Skywalker made an effort to treat C'baoth and bring him around after realizing that he was both psychotic and a practitioner of the dark side of the Force.
After some time had passed, C'baoth informed Skywalker that he had detected the presence of a second Force-sensitive individual, one whom Skywalker had already met: the smuggler and former Emperor's Hand Mara Jade.
She would eventually be his killer when C’baoth attempted to clone her.
Many years after his passing, C'baoth's memory continued to frighten those who had experienced his insanity.

# Personality and traits

The clone shared the same level of haughtiness as the Jedi Master, thinking that being a Jedi inevitably gave one supremacy over others.
C'baoth was similarly overconfident, thinking that the might of the Force would let him to do practically any endeavor.
C'baoth was adamant that Thrawn was wrong to define power in terms of reigning over entire worlds rather than over specific individuals, and that authority over such individuals came from understanding them.
Thrawn was sure that he could keep C'baoth under control with the ysalamiri and thoughtfully planned instructions until he was no longer required.
C'baoth, who subsequently revolted against Thrawn and tried to seize leadership for himself, had been misjudged by Thrawn.
Few were aware that Joruus C'baoth was a clone since the Great Jedi Purge had destroyed the majority of documents pertaining to the Jedi and the planet Wayland was kept a well guarded secret.
Thrawn only knew this, in reality, since he had been present when Outbound Flight was shattered and the actual Jorus C'baoth was killed.
The irony of this hidden reality is that even Joruus C'baoth lost his true ancestry and thought he was the original Jorus C'baoth due to years of solitude and failing sanity.

# Powers and abilities

The clone was equally as deadly as Darth Vader because, like Jorus C'baoth, he was incredibly powerful with the Force and had access to a wide range of Force abilities.
He was a brilliant practitioner of the discipline of war meditation, and he utilized it to direct Thrawn's armies and plan assaults.
He could wield Force lightning, and he regularly did.
The C'baoth clone desired to be able to manipulate other people's brains, though.He also possessed the ability to seize control of other people's brains and actually remodel them in his own image, which was a very challenging task.
In addition, he was capable of inducing lethargy and weariness as well as using Force Scream, a destructive sonic weapon.
