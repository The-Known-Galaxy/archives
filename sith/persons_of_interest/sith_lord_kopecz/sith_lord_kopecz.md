# Overview

The last decades of the New Sith Wars saw the life of Kopecz, a male Twi'lek Dark Lord of the Sith.
Kopecz, a former Jedi, joined the Sith and left the Jedi Order, becoming one of the founding members of Lord Skere Kaan's Brotherhood of Darkness.
He devoted a significant portion of his time to leading the Brotherhood's wars against the Galactic Republic, which included the pivotal conflicts on Ruusan and in orbit around it.

Strong Sith Lord Kopecz was frequently the first to criticise Kaan, inciting the other Sith to turn against him over topics like the protracted struggle for control of Ruusan.
However, Kaan always managed to persuade Kopecz to support him, as he did when he explained the thought bomb attack strategy at the Seventh Battle of Ruusan.
When the Brotherhood was assembled in a maze of caves, Kopecz, on the other hand, saw the absurdity of Kaan's use of such a contraption.

Kopecz snuck out of the crowd, joined the cave mouth defences, and was fatally wounded as the Jedi's Army of Light attacked.
Lord Valenthyne Farfalla, a Jedi Master who knew Kopecz to be a former Jedi, found him.
Kopecz persuaded the Jedi to fight him in exchange for disclosing Kaan's scheme, refusing to submit and insisting that Farfalla promise him death in battle.
Farfalla concurred, knowing the Twi'lek had little time left given his wounds.
Farfalla and Kopecz engaged in combat after Kopecz had explained the mind bomb to the latter.
The Sith Lord was quickly dispatched by his erstwhile ally.

# Biography

Kopecz snuck out of the crowd, joined the cave mouth defences, and was fatally wounded as the Jedi's Army of Light attacked.
A masculine Twi'lek named He Kopecz existed during the New Sith Wars.
Kopecz was a popular moniker for men of his species and meant "philosopher" in his native tongue.
An individual with Force abilities from Ryloth,  Kopecz joined the Jedi Order and underwent years of training.
Kopecz finally abandoned the Order's teachings in favour of the ways of the dark side as he lost faith in them over time.
Kopecz defected because he thought the Sith gave the best opportunity to create a stable galaxy with them ascendant throughout the galaxy.

He had a bitter feud with Qordis, a Human Dark Lord, while he was still a Sith.
Because of his strong character and skill set, Kopecz earned the respect of his fellow Sith for whom he served as a source of authority and a mentor.
He also earned the respect of individuals on the other side of the struggle.
Kopecz was respected by both Jedi Lords Hoth and Valenthyne Farfalla.

As each Sith Lord fought for dominance over the others, conflicts between Lords akin to the one between Kopecz and Qordis were frequent among the Sith.
The Brotherhood of Darkness was established at this time by the charismatic Dark Lord Skere Kaan, wherein each lesser Lord would be given the title of Dark Lord of the Sith and all would pool their resources to form a single, unified front.
Kaan understood that fighting between one another among the Sith Lords would only lead to defeat from within their ranks given that the Sith were at war with both the Galactic Republic and the Jedi.
Both Kopecz and Qordis were valuable assets to the Sith war effort, so Kaan urged them to join his new Brotherhood.

Both parties accepted Kaan's offer, and the Brotherhood's claim of newfound equality was sufficient to keep the two sides in an iffy ceasefire.
The three Dark Lords planned to reclaim Korriban, the former Sith homeworld, in 1006 BBY in order to reopen the Sith Academy and raise new Dark Lords for the Brotherhood there.The Sith defeated the Jedi and Republic in a bloody ground fight led by Kaan, Qordis, and Kopecz; in the aftermath, Qordis remained on Korriban to oversee the Academy's rebuilding, where he would also serve as headmaster.
However, Kopecz stayed with Kaan to carry on the conflict with the Republic.

Although the Brotherhood promised that all Dark Lords would be treated equally, in practise there were always Sith Masters who assumed leadership roles and relayed orders between Kaan and the other Dark Lords during various battles during the New Sith Wars.
Kopecz was one of the Sith Masters present at these battles.
One such figurehead who oversaw the Sith army was Kopecz.
Kaan's leadership was tarnished by numerous setbacks, and many Sith believed that Kopecz's skills as a military leader were the only thing keeping the Sith from losing numerous wars.
During the Battle of Phaseera, Kopecz was in charge of every military force in existence, including the Gloom Walkers, a specialist unit of the Brotherhood.

In order to save his team from a suicide mission that Ulabore had agreed to, Dessel had taken action.
Under Dessel's leadership, the Gloom Walkers broke the rules established for their mission yet still managed to complete it effectively and with few casualties.
Despite the mission's success, Kopecz was tasked with managing Dessel's punishment for his misdeeds.
The Human's seemingly extraordinary exploits were detailed in numerous stories in his dossier, which he also examined when he felt the strength of the Force within Dessel.
Instead of bringing him before a court-martial, Kopecz transported the Human soldier to Korriban, where he informed him he would be trained as an apprentice with the potential to become a Sith Lord.Dessel then adopted the moniker Baneâ€”Bane of the Sith

# Personality and Traits

The soldier Dessel thought Kopecz to be the biggest Twi'lek he had ever seen because of his height and physique.
Kopecz was deeply distrustful of the Brotherhood of Darkness's other powerful Sith Lords.
He consented to join the Brotherhood, but he had never trusted its leader, Kaan.
Kopecz was aware of Kaan's desire to rule the Sith while still considering himself to be their leader, and he frequently reminded Kaan of his own assurances of equality within the Brotherhood.
Lord Qordis and the Twi'lek had a similar hatred for one another as they had been rivals before joining the Brotherhood.
This was made clear when Qordis ordered the other Sith Masters at the Academy to stop giving Bane, the apprentice Kopecz sent him, special treatment.

# Power and Abilities

Kopecz was regarded as having a good grasp of the Force by both the Jedi and the Sith.
In addition to his power, Kopecz's stubbornness made him challenging to control with the Force, as Kaan discovered when he tried to convince the Dark Lords of his viewpoints.
He was a skilled pilot who piloted a Buzzard fighter during the First Battle of Ruusan.
He was also skilled with speeder bikes, riding one of them during the ground fighting at Ruusan.
Kopecz thought his own lightsaber proficiency to be so great that he believed it was beneath him to challenge two Selkath Padawans to a duel.

Instead, he demonstrated his command of the evil side by using the Force.
one of the Padawans was choked to death, and the other was put to death by a flash of Force lightning.
When he recognised the potential in the Gloom Walker sergeant, Dessel, for example, he was able to detect the might of the Force in others.
