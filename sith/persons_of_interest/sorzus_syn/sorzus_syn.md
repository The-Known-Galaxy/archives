# Introduction

Not much is known about the origins of this Dark Lord.
She began her life as a Jedi though it is not known which title she held or her specific masteries, though it can be safe to assume due to her interest in Sith alchemy and her desire to influence biology, as well as her desire to write and study philosophy that Sorzus Syn was either a Jedi Consular or a likely aspirant of that path.
Alongside numerous other Jedi including Ajunta Pall and XoXaan she was exiled from the Jedi Order by the Jedi Council for studying the dark side of the Force.

# Part I

Sorzus Syn fought in the conflict known as the Hundred-Year darkness, in which she rose to become one of the most influential and highest ranking Dark Jedi.
Her role in the war was unique, having altered biological chemistry to create creatures that would serve as living weapons against the Jedi Order.

# Part II

Throughout the war Sorzus Syn would collect numerous materials regarding the existence of the Sith species and the planet Korriban.
It can easily be credited to Sorzus Syn for the founding of Korriban by the Dark Jedi for it was these materials that convinced her fellow Dark Jedi to travel there.

Sorzus Syn took part in removing the Sith King of Korriban who at the time was King Hakagram Graush and would later be dubbed in Ajunta Pall’s new Empire as one of his Shadow Hands.
However in one of Sorzus Syn’s diaries she would display the desire to become the next Dark Lord of the Sith after Ajunta Pall though failed to elaborate further on how she might wish to achieve this.
She did make it clear however that she hoped Adjunta Pall’s reign would be short.

The Dark Jedi, now dubbed the first Sith Lords, would collectively build what became the first Sith Empire.
Sorzus Syn’s personal part in this is relatively unknown though yet again we can make safe assumption that she became some form of chronicler, historian or philosopher, likely being an early predecessor to the Sith Inquisitor.

# Part III

Sorzus Syn would be responsible for crafting the three Great Amulets of the Sith.
These amulets were Sith talismans designed to greatly enhance the power of Sith magic and the powers of the dark side, these three amulets would be some of the most powerful in Sith history with power so feared even Luke Skywalker hoped that they had not survived the passage of time.

Sorzus Syn would later discover that the biological makeup of the Sith species and the Dark Jedi’s were similar enough to allow for crossbreeding with the use of alchemy.
This discovery would lead to the evolution of the Sith Pureblood species.
Sith such as Naga Sadow and Darth Vitiate would be of Sith Pureblood origin, showing the true testament of the power this discovery held and the effect it would have on the galaxy for millenia to come.

After Ajunta Pall’s Sith Empire settled on Ziost, Sorzus Syn would return to Korriban to open many of the ancient tombs scattered across its valleys.
These tombs served as the burial grounds of ancient Kings such as King Adas as well as many other senior and influential members of the Sith species.
Sorzus Syn made a hobby of delving into these ruins along with Kissai Priests and Sith slaves to find their hidden secrets, often a perilous task.

After a lengthy and difficult delve into the sanctuary of Sakkra-Kla, Sorzus Syn discovered that the Sith of old under the rule of King Adas had attacked and conquered numerous worlds before them, she made it a personal goal to pinpoint every world the Sith had raided so that she could search for any knowledge they may have left behind.

# Part IV

Sorzus Syn would author the Book of the Sith, a diary that would describe her thoughts on the Jedi Order, Jedi Code, Sith Code, ancient Sith and everything she had discovered throughout her various expeditions.
This book would become sought after due to its insightful descriptions of the founding of the first Sith Empire, as well as Sorzus Syn’s numerous descriptions of ancient Sith alchemy and her many different discoveries regarding the ancient Sith, most notably of King Adas of Korriban.

# Part V

It is not known how Sorzus Syn died however her legacy lived on until the days of Luke Skywalker and the First Galactic Empire.
Some of her ancient texts would end up in the hands of Darth Sidious who would note that these texts would easily be the oldest Sith writings in existence.
These texts would later come into the hands of Luke Skywalker while he was Grand Master of The New Jedi Order.

Her personal holocron which she had made at the end of her life was discovered by the Jedi Order and stored in their archives, it would later be stolen by Darth Bane however the purpose it served him and where it ended up is currently unknown.

# Part VI

What Sorzus Syn was like as a Jedi is unknown however her personality as a Sith could be described as stereotypical.
She was cold, calculated and uncaring.
She had little regard for the lives of others and would often sacrifice slaves and servants during her many expeditions.
She believed that operating on the biological makeup of a dead creature was more effective and easier than that of a live one and as such, often killed individuals to operate on them.
