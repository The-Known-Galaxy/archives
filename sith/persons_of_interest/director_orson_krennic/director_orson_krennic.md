# Introduction
Orson Callan Krennic, otherwise known as Director Krennic, was the Director of the Imperial Military Department for Advanced Weapons Research under the guise of the Imperial Security Bureau and Imperial Intelligence.

# Biography
Orson Krennic was born in Sativran City on Lexrul in 51 BBY.
As a teenager he was enrolled into the Galactic Republic’s “Future Program” where he met a friend that would be a crucial part of his life later on, Galen Erso.
Krennic would later become a supervisor of large onworld and deep space construction projects in the Republic’s Corps of Engineers, Erso would focus on applied sciences and Kyber Crystal research.

After the fall of the Republic and the creation of the Galactic Empire, Krennic became an officer in the army.
His research and continued secret construction work of the DS-1 Death Star Battle Station was going as it was planned but some setbacks have caused delays, such as the Malpaz Disaster where a research facility got destroyed and a major loss of life and intelligence occurred.
His work was supervised by Grand Moff Gideon Tarkin who expected Krennic to create this superweapon one way or another.


With Galen Erso in Krennic’s grip, Krennic managed to get a prototype of the weapon he has been working on since Erso began his research on Kyber Crystals provided by Krennic.
He attached the prototype to a Star Destroyer and fired it towards 2 black holes known as the “The Hero Twins”.
The weapon was functional, the beams of the lasers went straight towards the black holes.


Upon completion of the Death Star and after many tests of the weapon itself, the Death Star was piloted towards the planet of Jedha.
Krennic expected a larger audience, hoping the Emperor or Darth Vader would be present, but to his dismay they were not there.
Tarkin confirmed that it was for his own safety should the weapon have failed during the display.
With a singular blast, Jedha City was erased completely with all of the people present there.
Decades of hard work and construction brought along the spectacle of the destruction of Jedha.


“Oh, it's beautiful.” 
       – Orson Krennic, on the destruction of Jedha City.

After the Crisis on Eadu, Krennic lost command of the Death Star to Tarkin.
Soon after that, Scarif, the planet on which the Death Star plans were stored, was attacked by rebels.
The plans in the end ended up in the hands of the rebels, leaving an injured Krennic on the tower platform of the Imperial base to watch as the Death Star exited hyperspace and aimed its weapon towards the base.
Laying there, watching in irony as the weapon he spent his whole life on creating and perfecting kill him, Krennic said his last words: 

"The shield is up.
Your signal will never reach the Rebel base.
All your ships in here will be destroyed.
I lose nothing but time.
You, on the other hand, die with the Rebellion."
-Orson Krennic's last words, to Jyn Erso
