# Section I
The death of Galen Marek was a turning point in the galaxy.
Secret Sith apprentice turned Jedi and founder of the Rebel Alliance, few in his time made such a great impact on the future of the galaxy at large.
His death came after he sacrificed to save Rebel leaders Rahm Kota, Bail Organa, Garm Bel Iblis and Mon Mothma from the hands of Darth Vader and his master, Darth Sidious.


However, it wasn’t just the Rebellion that suffered after Galen’s death.
Darth Vader also had been set back.
His chance of overthrowing Palpatine had evaporated before his eyes.
That’s what Palpatine thought anyway.
After the wounds dealt by his former apprentice were healed, Vader ordered Galen’s body be brought to Timira City, a cloning facility on the planet Kamino.
There, Vader ordered the creation of multiple clones of Galen Marek.
This operation was incredibly secretive, known only to a select few.


Time and time again, the clones failed.
They were deemed too mentally and/or physically unstable for service, and were immediately terminated upon creation.
That was until Subject 1138 was created.
Subject 1138 made quick progress, which initially led Vader to conclude he had finally made the perfect genetic clone.
However, this proved to be an optimistic assessment, as it was quickly realised that Subject 1138, codenamed “Starkiller”, suffered from the emotional imprints inherited from his template.
This led to a sudden obsession over Galen Marek’s former lover, Juno Eclipse.
Seeing this as a sign of weakness, Vader attempted to execute Starkiller.
However, sensing this betrayal, the clone was able to overpower Vader with a torrent of Force Lightning and escape.

The clone eventually ventured to Cato Neimoidia to rescue General Rahm Kota, Galen Marek’s Jedi Master, from Imperial captivity.
Upon a successful rescue, General Kota refused to believe that Subject 1138 was a clone at all, believing him to be Marek himself.
The clone refused to rejoin the Rebellion, instead telling Kota that his only mission was to find and ensure the safety of Juno Eclipse.
During a previous battle however, Eclipse had fallen into Imperial hands, captured by Boba Fett and his unit of Imperial Terror Troopers.
Starkiller later turned over all the needed data for a Rebel invasion of Kamino, hoping to use the opportunity to find Juno and free her from Vader.
The mission was a success at first, with Starkiller causing a Rebel frigate to crash straight into Timira City itself.
This gave Kota and his team of Rebel Commandos the ability to breach the city and re-route as many Imperial forces as possible from Starkiller’s position while he searched for Juno.


Subject 1138 eventually came into contact with Vader.
He originally seemed to be winning the fight, however Vader gained the upper hand by choking Juno and threatening to kill her right in front of Starkiller.
Using his feelings for her to his advantage, Vader forced the clone to submit to his will.
However, Juno would use this chance to attack Vader.
She was of course unsuccessful, which led her to be thrown from a window.
This caused Starkiller to erupt into a fit of rage, as he attacked Vader with everything he had.
Using a lightning storm and electrical conduits to his advantage, he was able to bring Vader into submission with ease, disarming him and placing Vader at the clone’s mercy.
As he went to strike Vader down, he was stopped by Rahm Kota, who encouraged Starkiller to spare Vader as a way of gaining information.
Starkiller complied, and was reunited with his love, Juno Eclipse.
Vader was brought into Alliance custody as a prisoner of war.

However, Subject 1138 is not the only clone of Galen Marek in existence.
Somewhere, in the shadows, The Dark Apprentice, a loyal and obedient clone lurks, waiting for his master’s call.
He is an ever present danger for both the Alliance and Subject 1138.
