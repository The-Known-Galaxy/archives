# Introduction

Githany, also known as Githa, started as a Jedi Padawan under Master Handa.
But temptation led her to embrace the dark side, becoming a Sith Lord in the Jedi-Sith War.
She wielded both a  lightsaber and lightwhip, displaying mastery over the Force.
Betraying her former lover, Kiel Charny, she defected to the Brotherhood of Darkness.
Her treachery proved pivotal, providing crucial intel to Lord Skere Kaan about the Jedi and Republic tactics.

# Section 1

Githany, a Force-sensitive female Human, entered the world on an unnamed planet approximately two to three decades before the Ruusan campaign.
Her parents, recognizing her potential, entrusted her to the care of the Jedi Order while she was still an infant.
Under the guidance of the Cathar Jedi Master Handa, she embarked on her journey as a Padawan alongside another Padawan named Kiel Charny.
This period allowed for multiple Padawans, marking a time of greater flexibility within the Jedi Order.
During her time as a Padawan, Githany grappled with a disconnect from the Force, overwhelmed by its magnitude.
To shield herself, she instinctively built mental barriers.
With patient guidance from her Jedi Master, she gradually broke down these barriers, resuming her training.
As she matured, Githany found herself drawn to Kiel Charny, her fellow Padawan.
However, their Master discovered their illicit romance and demanded its end.
While Kiel complied, Githany stubbornly refused, opting to flee the Jedi Order.
Eventually, she sought solace among the Sith.

Charming and alluring, Githany possessed a magnetic appeal that few could resist.
She took pleasure in leveraging her charisma to manipulate others to fulfill her desires.
Renowned for her stunning beauty, Githany captivated admirers from various species.
Despite her modest stature, Githany's striking appearance was unmistakable, characterized by luscious black hair, sun-kissed skin, and mesmerizing green eyes.
A circular black tattoo adorned her forehead, adding to her enigmatic allure.
During the initial phases of the Ruusan campaign, Githany succumbed to the allure of the dark side, covertly aligning herself with the Brotherhood of Darkness.
Despite her defection, she kept her betrayal concealed for a time.
Upon joining the ranks of the Sith, she rendezvoused with Sith Lord Skere Kaan and his cohorts, providing invaluable strategic intelligence regarding the Jedi, including crucial details of Jedi Lord Hoth's battle strategies.
This information, acquired through her association with Charny, one of Hoth's esteemed generals, proved instrumental to the Sith cause.
Satisfied with her contributions, the Sith dispatched Githany to the Sith Academy on Korriban to commence her training as a Sith adept.
At the Sith Academy on Korriban, Githany swiftly forged an alliance with another student named Bane, recognizing his potential as a powerful ally.
She utilized  him as a pawn in her bid for dominance; she orchestrated a scheme to overthrow the school's top student, Sirak.
Despite the reluctance of other Sith Masters to train Bane, Githany took it upon herself to mentor him in secret, imparting the forbidden knowledge of Force lightning.
Githany's bond with Bane deepened during their secret training, leading to a romantic involvement.
However, when Bane spared Sirak's life, Githany felt betrayed and joined forces with Sirak against him.
In a treacherous ambush, Githany initially sided with Sirak but then turned on him and her allies, Yevra and Llokay.
In the end, Bane emerged triumphant, killing Sirak and solidifying his power within the Sith Academy.

As the tide of battle turned against them, Kaan and the remaining Sith Lords retreated into a cavern system.
There, under Kaan's leadership, they devised a last-ditch effort to annihilate their enemies.
With the thought bomb poised for deployment, the Sith Lords gathered in a circle to commence the ritual.
Despite Kaan's control, Githany summoned the strength to resist the ritual's influence and break free, narrowly escaping the imminent devastation.
Escaping through the rear cave entrance, Githany and Darovit encountered a Republic infiltration squad led by Hardin, Darovit's cousin.
Hardin commanded Ruusan bats to attack Githany and Darovit, causing chaos.
Amidst the turmoil, Githany fought off the bats while Darovit dueled with Hardin.
Despite her efforts, Githany suffered injuries, including the loss of her right eye.
When Darovit hesitated to kill Hardin, Githany intervened, severing Hardin's leg with her lightwhip.
With the thought bomb's power looming, Githany, growing impatient, abandoned Darovit and fled alone as the catastrophic events unfolded.
Githany's attempt to escape was futile as she was engulfed by the dark side energy unleashed by the thought bomb.
The overwhelming power drained her life force, reducing her body to ash.
Alongside other notable figures, including Lord Kaan and members of the Brotherhood of Darkness, Githany's soul remained trapped for centuries until years after the Galactic Civil War.
