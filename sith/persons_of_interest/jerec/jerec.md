# Section I
Jerec was a Miraluka, who served the Jedi Order as one of its key archaeologists and masters.
Jerec was discovered by Jocasta Nu while she herself was still a Jedi Knight.
He was taken back to the Jedi Temple, where overtime he would come to serve Jocasta as her Jedi Padawan.
As her apprentice, Jerec was constantly told that he should seek more knowledge at any given opportunity, as this would give him a much greater understanding of the force.
By the time of the Clone Wars, Jerec had risen to the rank of Jedi Master, after previously training a student of his own, Ameesa Darys.
Jerec was on a mission in the Unknown Regions seeking lost artifacts during the Clone Wars.
As a result, he was spared from Order 66.

Upon returning to the Known Galaxy, Jerec and his team of archaeologists had made it all the way to Coruscant before learning of the current state of the galaxy.
He was pursued by former Jedi and serving Inquisitor, Antinnis Tremayne, who eventually caught up with Jerec.
He then gave him a choice.
Serve the Empire, or die.
Jerec, knowing that joining the Empire would be a path to new knowledge, he eagerly agreed to join the Inquisitors.
However, he would not be satisfied with his current deal.
Under the Empire, he would constantly seek out more power for himself, wanting to take the position as the Imperial Executor and eventually Emperor.
He formed a group known as the Seven Dark Jedi, Darksiders loyal to Jerec and Jerec alone.
Jerec would also seek out the Valley of the Jedi on the planet Ruusan.
His Seven Dark Jedi would all be defeated or killed by Jedi Kyle Katarn, with Jerec himself being slain on Ruusan in the valley he craved to find for so long.
After his death, he erupted into a flash of dark side energy.
