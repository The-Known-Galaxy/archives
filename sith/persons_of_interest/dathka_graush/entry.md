# Overview

Dathka Graush is a dark lord of the Sith who lived about seven millennia before the Battle of Yavin.
Dathka came to power thanks to his victory in one of the civil wars on Korriban.
Dathka created an entire dynasty that ruled three planets.

# Dark Lord of the Dead

Dathka was called the Dark Lord of the Dead.
He is the most famous of all, but he is not the only one, because while he was alive he had a force-sensitive stone transplanted into his heart that supposedly held the souls of his enemies and was later known as the “Heart of Graush”.
With the help of Sith alchemy he was able to create an army of the living dead which he ruled with his new heart, but despite the artifact, Dathka still fell victim to assassins.
With his death, the energy of the zombies already present was encased in the crystal, and the creatures themselves found temporary peace.
Dathka Graush was buried in his tomb on Korriban, along with his sword, Holocron and his Sith amulet.
