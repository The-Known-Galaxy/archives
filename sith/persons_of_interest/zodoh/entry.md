# Overview

During the latter years of the New Sith Wars, a struggle between the Galactic Republic and the Sith, Zodoh was a Hutt criminal lord who made money by providing slaves and weapons to the Sith located in Hutt Space.
He sought to increase his power in the Sith-ruled Grumani area.
His fleet of Stormdriver starships constituted the foundation of Zodoh's strategies.
Zodoh tested his new weapon on the planet Aquilaris Minor in the Daimanate, an area of space ruled by the Sith Lord Daiman, as a show of strength to the Sith Lords present there, but was forced to end the operation early due to Jenn Devaad's activities.
Darknell was assaulted by Zodoh, but Devaad and Kerra Holt, a Jedi Knight, stopped him.
As a result of the destruction of the Voracious, the Stormdriver fleet was rendered inoperable, leaving Zodoh adrift in empty space.
After the conflict, Daiman's troops discovered Zodoh wounded but still alive and brought him before the Sith Lord, who used a tiny Stormdriver to wreak retribution by dehydrating the Hutt.

# Biography

The Hutts seized the opportunity when the comm-relays in Hutt Space failed, leaving the Sith Lords operating in that region of the galaxy dependent on the Hutt clans to convey supplies and manpower.
A Republic task force was once entirely kidnapped by Zodoh's tribe on the planet Daalang when the local populace deserted them.
The Alderaanian Baron Lemayne-led Grace Command, which provided aid to those stranded in Sith space, managed to free a small group of captives after five years of imprisonment, among them Captain Jenn Devaad.
Zodoh chose to expand his commercial activities outside of Hutt Space after becoming weary of the clan wars, and he focused on the Grumani sector in the Outer Rim Territories.
As Zodoh began initiating hit-and-run attacks on Sith forces, he learned the real purpose of Grace Command's activities there: the charity served as a cover for Operation Deluge, a scheme to undermine the Sith war effort by flooding entire worlds with Deluge, an addictive drug that sapped people's desire.
Several Stormdrivers, capital ships with weaponized moisture vaporators that could create downpours by squeezing moisture from a planet's atmosphere, were also part of Zodoh's fleet.
A strike force of Intruder-class starfighters under Zodoh's personnel command launched an assault on the Daimanate planet of Aquilaris Minor.
Zodoh retreated his fighters while the Sith were still reeling from his initial strike, and he positioned one of his Stormdrivers above Capital Cay's harbor, utilizing its vaporators to begin draining the water from the bay.
Devil Squadron, an organization of Fire Lotus-class starfighters linked with Grace Command and made up of the Daalang survivors, headed by Devaad, attacked and destroyed the Stormdriver while the crew was distracted.
Zodoh had provoked the fury of the regional Sith Lords by entering Sith territory, and Odion and Calimondra both showed their ire at being called by the Hutt.
According to Zodoh, he was in Sith space to grow his company by supplying the Sith warlords with slaves and weapons.
Exactly in time for the Hutt to see Devil Squadron leave for the Malakite-occupied world of Heptooine, Zodoh's fleet made its way back to the Aquilaris Minor system.
Flying one of his Intruder-class starfighters, Zodoh let Devil Squadron see him as they made their way to the location of their upcoming leap into hyperspace.
Devaad led Devil Squadron in pursuit of the Hutt, disregarding Holt's advice to exercise care in order to get revenge for her time spent in captivity.

# Personality and traits

Zodoh was a masculine Hutt with brown skin and orange eyes.
As was typical of his species, Zodoh was involved in crime, especially the fabrication of armaments and the trade in slaves, but he saw himself as a businessman serving his customers.
Zodoh has trouble trusting people.
Oon Garat, one of the few people who enjoyed Zodoh's trust, was discovered by the Hutt to be the focus of rivals looking to hire her.
Zodoh discovered that he liked working in the field and that battle suited his hedonistic tendencies, which was unusual for a Hutt.
Although he was disliked, Zodoh thought that his leadership style made him more successful than other Hutts.
With aspirations to become the greatest Hutt ever, Zodoh was haughty.
He was not easily moved and treated the Sith Lords in the Grumani sector with contempt, considering them to be nothing more than small-time criminals who would eventually come to serve him.
In his interactions with the Sith and with Devaad, he was deceitful and manipulative.
His willingness to utilize Deluge to enslave whole people and his use of Stormdrivers to produce fictitious storms to drown his adversaries were the finest examples of his callousness.
Zodoh was willing to sacrifice a large portion of its billion-person population in order to conquer Darkknell.
The Hutt was shrewd and persistent, nevertheless, and was prepared to tolerate minor setbacks in order to accomplish long-term goals.

# Skills

Unlike the majority of his kind, Zodoh was an athletic combatant.
The Hutt had a jetpack that allowed him to fly and armor covering his upper torso.
He preferred utilizing his favorite weapon, an ancient Mandalorian axe, to combat his opponents.
In addition, Zodoh was capable of using his own body as a weapon, using his enormous size to overwhelm and subjugate his opponents as well as wrapping his powerful tail around them to pull them to him and smash them.
Zodoh defeated the Jedi Kerra Holt thanks to his edge in zero gravity thanks to his jetpack.
After the Voracious was destroyed, he was able to survive in space because of his Hutt physiology, although other species would have perished.
