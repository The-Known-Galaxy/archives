# Overview

Darth Vilus was a Sith Lord of either human or Sith Pureblood descent, who served the resurgent Sith Empire and died before the start of the Cold War.
Vilus wrote a lot during his life, having written three thousand writings.
It is also said that he had many apprentices, even killing his fourth one, after he caught him spying on the Sith Lord.
Vilus was very powerful and he proved this by using the rare Force walk ability.
After he performed the ritual, just like many others, Vilus started to hear Force Ghosts in his head.
Annoyed by this, he set out to find  a cure.
Vilus had heard of a cure that could heal damaged minds, with its supposed location being on the planet Voss.
Vilus went to Voss to find this cure, but went insane before finding it..
Darth Vilus had made a few writings on the cure before his death, and fortunately, the young Sith Lord Kallig, who would later join the Dark Council and become a Dark Lord of the Sith that served as the Overlord of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, read about Vilusâ€™ writings.
Kallig, also known as Darth Nox, learned about this in the secret library that belonged to the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Thanaton.
Nox was lucky Vilus wrote about the ritual because he had the same curse and he successfully performed the ritual on Voss that cured him.
