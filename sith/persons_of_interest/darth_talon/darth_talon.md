# Overview

Darth Krayt's One Sith contained an adult female Lethan Twi'lek named Darth Talon, who was the female castle's first Sith Lady.Talon was adorned with black Sith tattoos covering her body, including her head and lekku, each of these tattoos has been made by Krayt himself and had been inscribed with his own mark.
While still a Sith apprentice, she was trained under a fellow Twi'lek Sith Lord named Darth Ruyn, who she later killed on Krayt's order with a swift decapitating strike of her lightsaber, shortly before ascending to the status of a full-fledged Sith in Krayt's Order.
The Dark Lord, Krayt, recognizing Talon's unwavering loyalty, anointed her as one of his Hands, thereby allowing the Dark Lord to truly interact with her.
With this responsibility, Talon found herself working alongside Darth Nihl, a counterpart of hers from the Hand organisation.

Talon took part in many of her Master's most important missions, including the capture of Cade Skywalker, the fugitive Jedi, and his training in the methods of the Dark Side of the Force, until Talon's apprentice renounced the One Sith.
In spite of Darth Wyyrlok's unsuccessful attempt to take over the One Sith from Talon after her lord Darth Kraytâ€™s supposed death, Talon remained loyal to her lord Darth Krayt.
She assisted Krayt in his recuperation, as well as combating the Sith that stood between Krayt, during which she and Nihl witnessed his return to power.
In the end, when Darth Krayt was finally defeated during the Battle of Coruscant, she as well as the rest of the One Sith entered hiding.
By concealing their activities, the One Sith continued to achieve their objectives.

# Training

Lethan Twi'lek Darth Talon was a third-generation Sith, raised and taught at the Sith Academy on Korriban, an ancient Sith Burial world of the One Sith.
She was honed in her unique Force- sensitive abilities under the tutelage of Darth Ruyn.
Psychologically, she was cultivated to be completely receptive to the One Sith's teachings.
Although Talon's first loyalty was to the founder of her order, Darth Krayt, the Dark Lord of the Sith and emperor of the new Sith Empire.
On the cusp of completing her training, Talon found herself deeply engrossed in the Dark Side of the Force.
The final test of loyalty for Talon would be to kill Ruin cold-bloodedly.
Darth Krayt's apprentice did not hesitate to kill her formerMaster without question since she had no choice other than to obey his orders.
Having completed her final rite of passage, Talon was elevated to the rank of Hand, confirming her status as one of the Emperor's most trusted assassins.
In her first mission as a Hand, Darth Talon was given the task of locating and capturing Princess Marasiah Fel in order to lure the deposed Emperor Roan Fel from hiding.

# Personality & Traits

Darth Talon was  cold and dispassionate, Talon's lack of passion was due to her undying loyalty, a unique trait to herself..
Darth Krayt instructed her to do what he asked of her without question or hesitation.
This was evident when she decapitated her Mentor Darth Ruyn upon receiving the orders to do so.
She was unmerciful like most Sith and kept Elke Vetter alive only for as long as she needed to find Marasiah Fel, except for the short time necessary to hunt down the criminal.
While dedicated to the Rule of One, she was not in a position to care about her own life, as it was revealed to Cade Skywalker during her training that she would rejoice in her death when his training was complete, if such was Darth Krayt's will.

Though she was a powerful and respected member of the Sith Order, it was clear that she was never meant to rule, for she was a fanatic like most Sith and did not possess the ability or desire to lead as Darth Nihl did, nor did she possess his independent thought.
As such, she became one of the Sith working under Nihl's command to sabotage the galactic governments.

# Weapon of choice

As with most Sith, Darth Talon possessed a single crimson-bladed lightsaber that served as her primary weapon.
This instrument was elongated and notched with crisscrossed grooves on the surface.
The Lightsaber was formed of Coral akin to that of her fellow One Siths.

# Powers & Abilities

The combat skills of Talon were without a doubt amongst the best of the One Sith.
As previously mentioned, her skill at fighting was further entailed in the fact that she was anointed as one of Darth Krayt's hands, as in the following example.
TheDarth Talondemonstrated her ability in lightsaber combat by defeating two Jedi known as Shado Vao and Wolf Sazen simultaneously on Vendaxa, showing her aprotic knowledge of the weapon.
Princess Fel, who just happened to be nearby, prevented Talon from killing Master Sazen but only by a last minute change of heart.
The fact that she was known to perform acrobatic flips and leaps when using a lightsaber could indicate that she was using the Ataru FormThe fact that she had often, if not always, fought with one hand suggests some application of Makashi to her style of self-defence.
Due to her fighting skills, her rank as a hand, as well as her innate skills as a Sith, she had a status high above the majority of the Sith.
It is also important to mention that Talon was a skilled practitioner of Force techniques such as Force lightning, with which she executed the Imperial Knight Elke Vetter.
To verbally reveal crucial information to Vetter, she used a Force technique in which she summoned a light circle of cyan from within herself into the path of her adversary on the ground.

In return, she was able to manipulate the minds of beasts to aid her in combat with the Jedi.
Her strength was such that she was once able to push Shado Vao to the ground with such force that he was unable to recover for quite a while.
In addition, she was able to sense Darth Krayt's life force and free him from stasis with the help of force lightning, which she accomplished with no trouble.
