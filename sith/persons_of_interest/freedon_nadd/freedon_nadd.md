# Overview
Freedon Nadd was a male human seduced so badly by the Fark side that his skin turned pallid.
He had yellow eyes and was adopted on the planet Onderon.
He started off as a Jedi training on the planet Ossus.
His master, Matta Tremayne, was killed by him later in life.
Nadd slew his master because of his lust for power which he desired.
He then renounced his allegiance with the Jedi Order and started his journey to the Dark side.
He then departed Ossus and made his way to the centre of the Old Sith Empire and from there he followed the Force to the moon of Yavin 4.
There he found the Dark Lord Naga Sadow and Sadow trained him in the arts of the Dark side of the Force.
Before then, Nadd had a broad knowledge of the Dark Force for he had spent a little while in the heart of the Old Sith Empire, studying the ways.
Once he convinced himself that he learned everything he needed to from Sadow, Nadd killed him and left Yavin 4.
Afterwards he searched for a planet to claim as his own and he took the title of Dark Lord of the Sith.
He decided to claim Onderon and title himself as King.
His reign lasted for longer than a century and once his body was entombed underneath the Royal Palace of Izziz his spirit lingered in his tomb teaching his descendants the ways of the Dark side of the Force.
Nadd had a huge influence on his people that they fought over the deceased Dark Lord.
However, one day a team of Jedi Knights led by Arkanian ventured to the planet of Onderon to cease the fight and placed a temporary halt on Nadd’s influence after Queen Amanoa’s defeat.
However, her husband King Ommin put the Sith’s influence back in place.
King Ommin then released Nadd’s spirit from the chaos and then rose the Naddist insurrection.
Nadd then revealed himself to the Jedi and helped them hunt down Arca Jeth.
Nadd was defeated and ashamed so Arca Jeth banished him from Onderon.
Before he was banished he taught a few people of the Dark side and informed a Jedi knight, Ulic Qel-Droma, of his destiny as a Sith Lord.
Nadd trained the Ketos for months revolving Sith magic until one day a lost Jedi, Exar Kun, seeked support in the Dark ways of the Force.
Nadd took Exar in after trialling him and trained him in the ways of the force.
Exar Kun was deemed worthy as a Sith apprentice and Nadd took him to Yavin 4 where his old master lay dead.
Exar Kun embraced the Dark side and defeated a Sith wyrm and the Massassi native warriors.
This pleased Nadd very much and so he showed Exar the need to create a physical body using alchemy but Kun refused.
Infuriated by Nadd’s expectations, Kun betrayed him and attacked Nadd.
His force powers strengthened because of a Sith amulet present and Kun was able to blast Nadd with a potent blast of Force energy, After this Nadd informed the Ketos of Kun’s betrayal and warned them about him.
Before dying for the second time he announced Satal and Aleema as the future of the Sith.

# Personality and Abilities
Nadd, in his younger days, was said to be a joyful and radiant young man who loved life.
He was also a determined young man who manipulated the Force and was inspired to become the greatest Jedi of all time.
He was confident that the masters on Ossus would promote him to Jedi Knight but when they failed him he grew furious.
He demanded an explanation from his master but realised she was no use to him for the only way he could find out was if he travelled on his own.
Nadd after this had a new desire, to become the most powerful Sith Sorcerer in history.
Nadd after gaining a very broad knowledge of the Dark side believed that the force served him because when one embraced the Dark side they would become one with the Force and the two would become inseparable.
Once he was a Sith Lord, Nadd protected himself very well.
He wore heavy battle armour and a helmet, which he also used as a crown for his kingship.
Nadd’s influence on his people was so powerful that even as a spirit his citizens seeked help and he trained them in the ways of Sith magic but he was also vigilant so he wouldn’t teach them so much that they surpassed his knowledge.
Nadd desired a physical body after his death so he could continue to serve as a powerful Sith.
As a Jedi Nadd was a scholar in the ways of the Force and impressed the masters on Ossus.
He could wield some of the powers that the Jedi Masters could at a young age.
His teachers all believed that he would be sitting among them before any other student.
However, when the Jedi Masters informed him of his failure he went on a rampage and killed his master.
Blinded by his arrogance he blamed his master for her own death.
Darth Nadd placed all of his knowledge in his own holocron which a few thousand years later was found by Darth Zannah, apprentice of Darth Bane.
With this knowledge he also knew about the Orbalisk parasite which fed on the Dark Force.
Nadd possessed a bronze bladed lightsaber which killed many Jedi in battle.
Nadd was more skilled in aspects of the Force rather than lightsaber combat.
He could not exceed his master Trymane in lightsaber duels even though he could kill her.
Nadd was a skilled Sith who focussed mainly on becoming a Force scholar which he did on both sides.
Nadd’s Force abilities were extraordinary and were stronger than a lot of the Jedi Masters on Ossus including his own.
