# Overview

It was Dramath, a male Sith Lord, who ruled the planet Medriaas in the years before the Great Hyperspace War.
He belonged to the Old Sith Empire.
The hedonistic and self-satisfied ruler of his own fief, Dramath brought about one of the greatest evils in galactic history when one of his many illegitimate children turned on him and condemned him.

# Old Sith Wars

There is a legend that spread throughout the Sith Empire during the Old Sith Wars that described Lord Dramath as having had a son, Tenebrae, through marriage with one of his subjects, a poor farmer's wife.
As soon as Dramath learned of Tenebrae's existence, he ordered the child’s mother to drown the Young Tenebrae, but his mistress secretly defied him and refused to dispose of the child.
Tenebrae's stepfather attempted to attack Tenebrae's mother after realising the truth about his wife's affair with Dramath Here, the young Tenebrea would demonstrate his force sensitivity by killing his stepfather.
Eventually, the young Sith killed his mother after torturing her.
Tenebrae was utterly ignored by Dramath ,despite the murders he had commited, until he reached the age of ten, wherehe confronted Tenebrae in order to decide whether or not to enslave or execute the boy.
Tragically, Dramath discovered to his horror that Tenebrae had already surpassed him in power at this very moment.
Dramath was killed by Tenebrae which marked the recognition of Tenebrae by Marka Ragnos who titled him “Vitiate of Medriaas”, for his first deed as the new ruler he renamed his home planet to “Nathema”.
Several years after the Sith defeated the Jedi in the Great Hyperspace War, Vitiate performed a dark ritual, destroying all life on the planet now known as Nathema and rendering it unconnected to the Force.
This also gave Dramath's illegitimate son the ability to become immortal.
Eventually and quietly, Vitiate would create the Eternal Empire with himself as the Eternal Emperor Valkorion, and would go on to declare himself the Emperor of a revived Sith Empire.
The only person who remembered Dramath was gone, and every record of the planet had been purged to ensure his dark deeds remained a secret.
Nor could anyone have guessed that he wasn't entirely dead.
Vitiate had actually kept the spirit of his father, the long deceased Dramath, inside a powerful holocron, and he tortured him mercilessly for a thousand years.
The holocron was subsequently kept underground beneath a structure called the Sanitarium, the only stable and hospitable structure on Nathema.
With the passing of the centuries, it was in a twisted sense that Dramath had become the closest thing Vitiate had to a friend, despite the circumstances regarding the pair.

# Encountering the Outlander

Eventually, Lana Beniko, the Outlander, and the Anomid scientist Jarak opened Valkorion's vault in 3630 BBY to escape from a death fog that Vaylin, the daughter of Valkorion, unleashed while attempting to undo the damage Valkorion had done to her mind.
As a result of the Investigation, the Outlander released Dramath, who, when asked to relate his encounter with Valkorion to the Outlander and Beniko, explained what had happened.
As the pair approached him he told them to take the holocron, saying it would help destroy Valkorion and asked to be freed from his torment.
