# Overview
Karis Nemik was a human male freedom fighter who served as part of a team assigned to steal the quarterly payroll of the Galactic Empire base on Aldhani.

As a member of the Aldhani infiltration team under Vel Sartha’s command, Nemik, a talented astronavigator, aided in the planning of the robbery and calculated the group's escape trajectory.
