# Introduction

Jedi, General, hero of the Republic.
Meetra Surik was all of these things and more.
Among all the great stories studied and told about the Jedi, few stand out as much as Meetra Surik and her struggle to reconnect herself to the Force while battling one of the most powerful Sith Lords in history.
Meetra Surik would go from a young Padawan following her idols to war and grow into one of the most independent and strongest Jedi Masters of her era, she would survive three wars and become responsible for the survival of the Jedi Order after the Dark Wars.

# Part I

Meetra Surik would begin her life as many Jedi do.
At an early age she would be inducted into the Jedi Order as a Youngling, having been detected as Force sensitive and become one of the many Jedi Younglings who would train within the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine, prior to the days that students would train on Coruscant.

Meetra Surik had perhaps one of the rarest and most dangerous Force abilities of them all, one she was consistently cautioned against and fortunately never had to use on anyone but herself.
She had the ability to sever an individual’s connection from the Force, essentially stripping them of their life essence and making them a living wound in the Force.
Much like a foe she would face later in life.

During her days on Dantooine, young Meetra would rise to the rank of Padawan and be informally assigned to the then Jedi Knight Kavar Lamares.
There is no knowledge surrounding why she was informally assigned a Master and it would not be the first time this would happen, later being assigned to Jedi Master Vima Sunrider informally as well when Kavar would go off to assist the Republic in preparing for the inevitable Mandalorian invasion.

# Part II

Meetra Surik would be one of many Jedi who believed in Revan and Malak’s desire to help defend the Republic against the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders.
As such she would join the Revanchists and set off for war.
Surik was a strongly compassionate individual and believed it was her duty to avenge the lives already lost by the Neo-Crusader onslaught in the Outer-Rim.
Her first Master, Kavar Lamares was involved in the early skirmishes prior to the Republic and Jedi Order taking an official stance on the war and believed it was only right that she follow in his footsteps.
Because of this, Meetra Surik was among the most dedicated Jedi to Revan’s cause, perhaps only being outmatched by Revan himself.

Meetra Surik would eventually become Knighted during the Mandalorian Wars, likely a result of her bravery and brilliant strategic mind, after being Knighted it was not long before the Republic Military recognised her prowess and commissioned her as a General within the Republic Army.
Revan saw her as his most trusted ally and General, even more so than Malak.
Meetra would be placed in charge of some of the bloodiest and crucial campaigns of the Mandalorian Wars.

# Part III

When Revan ordered the Republic Military to conduct a counter-offensive, Meetra Surik would be charged with taking the most fortified Neo-Crusader position in the war.
Revan believed it was crucial to free the independent world of Onderon from the Neo-Crusader occupiers that had taken the planet towards the start of the war.
But to take Onderon, Revan knew he had to take its moon, Dxun.

Dxun was staunchly loyal to the Neo-Crusader cause, having been inhabited by Mandalorian Clans decades before the war began, the moon was heavily fortified and the Neo-Crusaders had prepared the dense jungle well for invasion.

Dxun served as headquarters for the initial invasion of the Republic and as the staging point for all operations the Neo-Crusaders conducted against the Inner Rim, if the Republic did not take the planet then the war would be lost, as Dxun provided a gateway into many coreworlds

that had already cost the Republic Military too much to retake during Revan’s counter-offensive.

Revan would order Meetra Surik to take Dxun, however upon the initial landing a majority of General Surik’s forces would be depleted.
She had but a small fraction of her invasion forces and was up against massive garrisons of Neo-Crusader defenders.
However, due to Meetra Surik’s tactical brilliance and the almost suicidal strategies employed by Revan during the later stage of the war, Meetra Surik would be successful in driving the Neo-Crusaders off Dxun, essentially marking the turning point of the war and allowing the rest of the Republic Military to take Dxun.

# Part IV

As a result of Meetra Surik’s success in taking the moon of Dxun, Revan would place her in charge of the final battle against the Neo-Crusaders.
Meetra Surik would be responsible for tackling the largest element of the Neo-Crusader fleet above Malachor V and for detonating the Republic super-weapon, the Mass Shadow Generator.

Meetra Surik successfully engaged the Neo-Crusader armada but was overwhelmed by their numbers.
The largest element of the Republic Fleet was with Revan on a mission to kill Mand’alor the Ultimate and destroy his own personal fleet.
While Revan was successful, Meetra Surik’s forces were struggling against the Neo-Crusaders, she relayed this information to Revan who in return ordered Meetra Surik to detonate the Mass Shadow Generator.

Despite having thousands of Republic forces in orbit around Malachor V still fighting, Meetra Surik would detonate the super-weapon and as a result was forced to sever her personal connection to the Force in order to survive.
Surik would prove successful in ending the Mandalorian Wars.

# Part V

After the Mandalorian Wars had ended, Revan, Malak and the rest of their Jedi followers would travel into the Unknown Regions of space in search of the hiding Sith Emperor.
Meetra Surik would stay behind, being the only Jedi that would return to face judgement for her actions and disobedience of the Jedi Council’s wishes.
Meetra Surik would return to the Jedi Order only to face scrutiny and harsh judgement, despite being a war hero of the Republic, the Jedi Council did not view her as one.

Many Jedi on the Council including Master Atris would come to view Meetra Surik as a potential follower of the Darkside and believed her punishment should be severe, whereas other Jedi Masters such as her former Master, Kavar Lamares, believed that the punishment being issued was an emotional response to the Council being defied.

Despite a passionate speech in defense of her actions, Meetra Surik would be exiled from the Jedi Order, stripped of her lightsaber and sent on her way.
The Council had sensed that she was no longer connected to the Force and believed that a harsher punishment was unnecessary.
From this point onwards she would forever be known as ‘’The Exile’’.

# Part VI

After her exile at the hands of the Jedi Council, Meetra Surik would find herself travelling the Outer Rim.
It is unknown as to why Meetra Surik decided to go to the Outer Rim though it could likely be attributed to her desire to find Revan, who was missing at the time as he travelled into the Unknown Regions in search of the Sith Emperor.

# Return

Meetra Surik would eventually return to known space at the height of the Dark Wars.
Upon finding out about the near destruction of the Jedi Order and that all surviving Jedi were in hiding due to an unknown looming threat, Meetra Surik was confident she would be safe due to her lack of connection to the Force.
This was true to an extent.
If it was not for Master Atris leaking the information of Meetra Surik’s return to the Sith Triumvirate on purpose, she would have been safe.
Unfortunately due to Master Atris’ plan to lure the threat into the open as she had once tried on Katarr, Meetra Surik would be hunted by Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion, who believed her to be the last of the Jedi, regardless of her status as an exile.

Believing Meetra Surik to be the last of the Jedi as well, the Republic Navy gave orders to a Republic warship to re-route from their expedition to Telos IV and collect Meetra Surik.
Unfortunately as a result of Master Atris, the Republic vessel would fall into a trap laid by Darth Sion.
The Republic vessel received a distress signal from an unknown freighter claiming to be under attack from a Sith warship, as per Republic Naval regulations the Republic warship went to investigate and found a relatively abandoned freighter, except for the body of Darth Sion.

Unbeknownst to the Republic, Darth Sion had his cloaked Sith assassins board the Republic ship to find Meetra Surik.
Kreia, formerly the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Traya, and one of the Jedi Masters responsible for teaching Revan, would find Meetra Surik as she knew it was a Sith trap and take her to the Ebon Hawk, which was also picked up by the Republic warship.

Just prior to Kreia’s arrival Sith assassins began slaughtering the crew of the Republic vessel in an effort to find Meetra Surik.
During this slaughter, a HK assassin droid would unfortunately drug Meetra Surik, causing her to pass out on the Ebon Hawk and lose much of her recent memory.
The Sith would take control of the Republic vessel and fire on the fleeing Ebon Hawk, damaging it greatly.
Despite this, the Ebon Hawk managed to flee to a mining facility over Peragus as a result of the protocol droid T3-M4’s efforts.

When Meetra Surik awoke she would discover Kreia and an abandoned mining facility.
According to the facilities logs there was infighting due to a galaxy wide bounty being placed on Jedi.
The facility was occupied by Kreia, Meetra Surik, their eventual companion; Atton Rand and many hostile mining droids.
The three had to escape as the Sith were hot on their heels.

# Search

Meetra Surik and her new companions would escape Peragus narrowly, having a run in with Darth Sion and many Sith assassins.
After their escape they would make their way to Telos IV and while there, Kreia would explain much of what has happened in the galaxy.
Despite Meetra Surik’s reluctance, Kreia made it clear they would need to prepare to battle the Sith, as they did not care about Meetra Surik’s lack of Force sensitivity or that she had been exiled.

After discovering what had happened to the stolen Ebon Hawk and aiding many individuals on the Telos IV orbital station, the trio would make their way to Telos and reunite with an old Mandalorian Wars veteran, Bao-Durr, who had served personally with Meetra Surik during the war and was one of the engineers responsible for creating the Mass Shadow Generator, he was also the one who personally activated the device, under Meetra Surik’s orders.

Together, all four would make their way to a shuttle and renew their search for the Ebon Hawk.
Unfortunately they would be tracked by numerous HK assassin droids who would shoot them down over Master Atris’ secret Academy.
After dispatching the droids the individuals would be drugged and awake inside the Academy, having been captured by Atris’ handmaidens.
While there, Meetra Surik would face one of her demons, Jedi Master Atris and the two would exchange a lengthy debate.

Reluctantly Master Atris understood the requirement for the Jedi High Council to be reunited, as some Masters still survived.
If the galaxy wanted to defeat the new Sith threat, Meetra Surik would have to search for the surviving Jedi Masters and unite them.
Atris would provide Surik the destinations of the Jedi Masters and send Surik on her way, providing her with the Ebon Hawk and sending a surviving Jedi Padawan, Mical, with the group.

Together, along with numerous other companions found along the way, Meetra Surik would find and eventually bring the surviving Jedi Masters together on the ruins of the Dantooine Enclave.
Unfortunately though this was Kreia’s plan all along, she harboured disgust for the Jedi High Council for casting Meetra Surik aside and believed these Jedi to be weak.
Revealing herself as Darth Traya she would put Meetra Surik into stasis and strip the Force from the Jedi Masters.
Kreia believed that the Jedi at the time were weak due to their dependence on the Force, she believed they needed it to survive and Meetra Surik’s survival without it is what made her strong, someone who could rise above the Force.
Kreia, now known yet again as Darth Traya, would illustrate this by killing the Jedi Masters by utilizing the very same Force sever technique that Meetra Surik was capable of.
The Masters would cling to the Force for survival, ultimately resulting in their deaths.

# Betrayal

Darth Traya would flee to Telos and corrupt Master Atris, leading her to fall to the Darkside.
Meetra Surik would soon follow however and find the corrupted Jedi Master turned Sith Apprentice within her Academy, after a lengthy duel Meetra Surik would convince Master Atris of her wrong doings and forgive Atris for everything that had happened.
Atris, having been so
convinced that she would be killed by the Exile for everything Atris had done to her and for falling to the Darkside was shocked, and renounced her Sith ways.
Atris would inform Meetra about Traya fleeing to Malachor V to rebuild her Sith Academy.
Meetra Surik would leave Atris in the hands of what would become the new Jedi Order to face judgement for her many failures and set out to confront the Sith Triumvirate.

By this stage Meetra Surik had trained most of her companions in the ways of the Jedi, with many of them being qualified Jedi Knights.
She rallied the Republic as well as the surviving Mandalorian Clans on Dxun and took them to war against the Sith Triumvirate.
They would begin with Darth Nihilus, the Republic fleet along with a Mandalorian strike force accompanied by Meetra Surik and her companions would attack Darth Nihilus’ flagship and essentially kill the Dark Lord.
While not technically dead as the Dark Lord had imbued his presence in his mask and robes, he was at the very least defeated and no longer a threat.
This would become known as the Battle of Telos IV and would result in the destruction of much of the Sith Triumvirate.

# Return to Malachor V

Meetra Surik would take the Ebon Hawk to Malachor V, the site of where she had originally lost her connection to the Force.
Meetra Surik could feel the pain and suffering of the world, suffering she had caused.
She could also feel the presence of the Sith Academy there, and her former mentor Darth Traya.
The Ebon Hawk would crash on Malachor V and the crew would make their way to the Sith Academy.
While there they would face dozens of Sith Lords, Sith Assassins and Dark Jedi, including Darth Sion.

After numerous duels with Darth Sion, the Dark Lord admitted he could not best Meetra Surik and gave in to his feelings.
All along Darth Sion felt some resemblance of love and respect for Meetra and this proved to be his weakness.
Darth Sion only lived due to his pure hatred that kept his body together, when faced with Meetra Surik he began to feel other emotions that would result in his body malfunctioning.
Meetra Surik convinced the Dark Lord to let go of his
hatred and to give into the Force, Darth Sion would listen to Surik and after giving up on hatred, he would die.
Having defeated most of the Sith Triumvirate including two of its leaders, Meetra Surik would make her way to the heart of Traya’s Academy to confront Darth Traya herself.

Meetra Surik would find Darth Traya in the core of her Academy, awaiting Surik’s arrival.
The two would engage in a swift duel, Surik would overpower Darth Traya and be forced to cut her remaining hand off, ending the Force bond that existed between the two and forcing Darth Traya to her knees.
Darth Traya would ask Surik to kill her in typical Sith fashion, however to Darth Traya’s surprise Meetra Surik refused.
Despite feeling somewhat honoured that Surik refused to kill her, Darth Traya felt more rage than anything and used the Force to re-animated three lightsabers that she would use to attack Surik with.
This would force Surik to kill her old mentor, thus ending the Sith Triumvirate.
Meetra Surik would then, as she did many years prior, order Bao-Durr to reactivate the Mass Shadow Generator once more, fully destroying Malachor V and ensuring that Traya’s Sith Academy could never be used again.

# Part VII

Once again declared a hero of the Republic and this time the Jedi Order, Meetra Surik would set about retraining herself within the Enclave on Dantooine that was in the process of being rebuilt.
Despite having saved the Republic and potentially every living thing in the galaxy from the Sith Triumvirate and especially Darth Nihilus, there were still surviving Jedi and Republic veterans that doubted Meetra Surik in the same way she was doubted after returning from the Mandalorian Wars.

T3-M4, the loyal companion of Revan and now Meetra Surik revealed to Surik that he had information relating to the whereabouts of Revan but was adamant he could only show them to Bastila Shan, who had been in hiding until the revival of the Jedi Order.
Meetra Surik took T3-M4 to meet Bastila Shan.
The droid would reveal the information to the pair and most notably revealed that Revan had been captured by a member of the Sith species who were thought long extinct.
Despite saving the Jedi Order, Meetra Surik no longer felt welcome there and decided to go to the aid of her old ally.
Having Revan’s mask in hand which was supplied by Bastila Shan and her faithful companion T3-M4, Surik began her search once more.

T3 and Meetra Surik would come across the world in T3’s message, Nathema.
By the time they got there the world was entirely void of life, a feeling of emptiness would pour over Surik as not a single living thing existed on the planet.
This was as a result of the Sith Emperor’s ability to feed and drain life in order to extend his own power and existence, much like Darth Nihilus.

The duo would find information relating to the Sith Empire.
They had discovered that the Sith Empire was in search of Dromund Kaas and T3-M4’s splicing abilities allowed the pair to locate Dromund Kaas.
The two were able to successfully land on the planet and made contact with Lord Scourge, the Sith Lord responsible for Revan’s capture.

Lord Scourge did not want to see the Sith Emperor invade the Republic for his own personal reasons and decided to aid Meetra Surik in freeing Revan and destroying the Sith Emperor.
Together they managed to free Revan and return his mask, but had to defeat a Dark Council member on the way which resulted in Dromund Kaas being put into martial law.

The only option was to take on the Sith Emperor, Darth Vitiate.
Together the three would attempt this, getting as far as the Emperor’s throne room and confronting him directly.
Unfortunately for Meetra Surik and Revan, Lord Scourge would have a Force vision of their inevitable loss.
Revan would be on his knees in pain after being electrocuted by Darth Vitiate and Meetra Surik chose to defend Revan, however Lord Scourge would turn on her, seeing this as an opportunity to gain the Emperor’s favour.

Lord Scourge would stab Meetra Surik in the back, killing her almost instantly.
Revan would be recaptured and Lord Scourge would be declared the Emperor’s Wrath.
Meetra Surik would not die entirely; instead, she would live on through the Force as a Force Ghost for many decades to come.

# Part VIII

After her death, Surik would ensure Revan’s survival once more by providing him with enough Force energy to remain alive through the Emperor’s torture.
Surik would eventually help free Revan from the Emperor’s captivity by alerting the Jedi Order and Republic to his location.
The Jedi Order would dispatch a fleet and strike Force to free Revan, successfully doing so.
Meetra Surik would urge Revan to continue his fight against the Sith Emperor, to which Revan agreed.

Years later the Sith Emperor would be confronted one last time, the Alliance Commander, Jedi Master Kira Carsen, Meetra Surik, Revan and even Lord Scourge would find and confront Darth Vitiate directly.
With the combined might of hundreds of fallen Jedi and Sith, including Meetra Surik, the Alliance Commander and Revan would kill Darth Vitiate, putting an end to his reign and allowing Surik to finally be at one with the Force.

# Personality and Abilities

Meetra Surik was an exceptional Jedi and had a personality to mimic this.
She was highly regarded by those above and below her as kind, generous and capable of accomplishing almost any task set before her.
As a result of this she was able to form bonds in an unnatural nature, likely amplified by the Force.
She was always looked to for guidance and seen as an example to be followed.
This would serve her well as a General in the Mandalorian Wars and later when recruiting and training many of her companions as Jedi.

She was able to convince the remnants of the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders to go to war for her on behalf of the Republic, she was able to convince a Dark Lord of the Sith, consumed by hatred to let go and allow himself to die.
She would also be capable of forming Force bonds, specifically the one created between herself and Kreia.

Meetra Surik had a similar capability to that of Darth Nihilus.
Whereas Darth Nihilus would feed to keep himself alive and sustain his power, Meetra Surik would kill and as a result she would become more powerful.
She was not conscious of this however the Jedi Council was and feared her as a result.
She was also able to learn abilities and skills simply by watching them happen, not only just learning them but mastering them.
She would become an expert at many forms of lightsaber combat and develop a mastery of many Force skills simply by watching them happen.

Though on top of all of this, Meetra Surik was a brilliant strategist and tactician.
Hardened through many years of warfare and command experience, Meetra Surik had a tactical mind that could only be rivalled by the likes of Revan, this allowed her to forge alliances, oversee battles and eventually win the war against the Sith Triumvirate.
Meetra Surik was exceptional in every way.
