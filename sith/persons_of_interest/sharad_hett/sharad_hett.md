# Overview
Sharad Hett, a male Human Jedi Knight, lived in the years before the Invasion of Naboo.
Born somewhere in the Outer Rim, he was a man whose renown and acts were remembered throughout the entirety of his order.
His exhausting reputation, combined with the destruction of his homeworld and the death of his family, drove him to exile on Tatooine, where he joined the Tusken tribe.
He had a son there, A'Sharad Hett, with whom he led the Tusken.
This came to an end when Jedi Master Ki Adi Mundi was dispatched to fetch Sharad back during a battle with the Hutt.
Aurra Sing, an ex-Jedi bounty hunter, murdered him in the conflict, leaving A’Sharad in the custody of Ki Adi Mundi, who adopted him as his padawan.
Fortunately, the orphaned child succumbed to the evil side and became Darth Krayt, who subsequently ruled over the Sith Order.

# Hero
Hett was initiated into the Jedi Order at an early age, as custom mandated.
He learned in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and subsequently became Jedi Master Eeth Koth's student.
Their connection developed substantially quicker than average, the master even permitting him to visit his family on his homeworld.
Years later, as a Jedi Knight, his achievements made him famous across the order, exceeding his master's and gaining several titles.
He even made friends, including Qui-Gon Jinn.
Sharad despised his fame, believing that people's adulation for him had caused them to lose the humility that Jedi should have.
He declared that all he wanted was to live with this family, and in 47 BBY, returned to Coruscant after completing a difficult assignment.
Hett met his master there, and before saying farewell, he spoke to him one final time through tears.
Now, he hoped the long-awaited family reunion would occur without any problems.
However, upon his arrival, all the deserted Jedi saw was ruin and death, which devastated him and left only anguish.



# Exile
Sharad, now a wanderer, landed on Tatooine, where he joined a Tusken clan and ultimately became their leader.
He also had a son with his wife, K'Sheek, there.
K'Sheek was stolen as a child by the tribe and raised as a Tusken.
During a quiet decade, Sharad lived and schooled his kid in Jedi methods.
However, peace didn’t endure forever; Jabba the Hutt was the one who shattered it.
In order to acquire credits, he started a war between the Tusken tribes and the humans, allowing him to sell the blasters he had.
With no other choice, the human Tusken led the tribes to war while attempting to limit losses on both sides.
The Jedi Order dispatched Mundi to return the Jedi to the order, but Sharad felt his place was with the Tusken and declined the offer.
Sharad faced off against Jabba, Garulla the Elder, and Aurra Sing.
Sing came and dueled him while he was on his way to fight Jabba.
Sharad proved to be far superior, but the bounty hunter had a surprise: Dun Möch.
The combat form was unknown to Sharad, and it was during this period of confusion that she thrust him with her saber.
Mundi, now with Sharad deceased, chose Sharad's son as his padawan, respecting his final words.



# Powers and abilities
It is assumed that Sharad is on par with a Jedi Master, a rank he may have achieved if he hadn't exiled himself.
He was noted for being an incredibly powerful force in lightsaber fighting, which he excelled at, only losing once due to a new kind of battle he had never seen before.
Sharad was also incredibly skilled in the force, as well as competent at adapting to environmental tactics and survival, which allowed him to survive among the Tusken Raiders.



# Lightsaber
Sharad carried his lightsaber with him at all times as a Jedi Knight and even after the exile.
The color may have shifted throughout time, but he was famed for wielding a crimson-red blade as a warlord.
A few years after his banishment, the Jedi Temple received word of a Tusken Raider wielding a crimson saber.
Even Master Yoda recognized him, and Eeth Koth, his teacher, corroborated this notion.
His son acquired the weapon before his father died, which he wielded during the Clone Wars.
Decades later, A'Sharad Hett, the son, abandoned the ways of his father and became Darth Krayt.
