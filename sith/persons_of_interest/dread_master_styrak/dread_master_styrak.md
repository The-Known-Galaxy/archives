# Section I
Styrak, also known as the “Corrupter of Darvannis”, was the third member of the Dread Masters, whose power was almost on par with that of Raptus.
Styrak was notable for travelling to the planet of Darvannis alone, causing his own death which will rupture the Dread Masters greatly in their cause.
He will die alongside his pet, a Kell Dragon and many Dread Guards accompanying him.
Once he travels to Darvannis, he will begin to corrupt various members of Mercenary and Cartel groups to defend him against the Republic and Empire.
The Dread Guards were destroyed amidst the battle as it ensued between Styrak and the Republic/Empire.
Not intimidated, Styrak took to the battlefield, using his mastery of the Force to fight the strike teams sent out to kill him.
His Kell Dragon would die, only to be revived by Styrak, and then die once more.
Styrak would grow to a god like size to ravage the strike teams.
However, he was unsuccessful, resulting in his death.
This would cataclysmically affect the future of the Dread Masters, because they required all six members to maintain stability.
