# Overview
Count Dooku, also known as Darth Tyranus, was a mighty human male Sith Lord.
He was born on the planet Serenno.
Dooku started as the Padawan of the powerful Jedi, Grand Master Yoda.
As a Jedi, Dooku trained a Padawan named Qui Gon Jinn.
Qui Gon was a powerful Jedi who was fluent in the form of Ataru.
Like his master, Qui Gon didn’t follow all of the Jedi rules and learned that from Dooku.
Count Dooku eventually left the Jedi Order and returned to his home planet.
After leaving the Jedi, Dooku became the apprentice of one of the most powerful Sith Lords ever, Darth Sidious.
Sidious took Dooku in, and the two secretly created a plan.
Sidious hid in the shadow of the senate.
Meanwhile, Dooku did all of his dirty work.
Dooku created the Separatist army with the help of Poggle the Lesser, a Geonosian that owned droid factories, and his apprentices, General Grievous and Ventress.
Dooku was an extremely talented lightsaber-wielder.
He was the head instructor in the Jedi Order and was proficient in Form II, Makashi.
Dooku had a unique lightsaber design.
His curved hilt made it easier for him to master Makashi.
However, Dooku was only a puppet for Sidious’ real plan to rule the galaxy.
At the time, Dooku had no idea his master would betray him, so he blindly worked for Sidious.
Dooku was killed aboard his ship when he kidnapped the Chancellor.
He died at the hands of Darth Sidious’ new apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, later known as Darth Vader.

# The Separatists
Count Dooku was the leader of the Separatist droid army (CIS).
The CIS was an army that contained millions of B1 battle droids, super battle droids, and the occasional sniper/destroyer droids.
The Separatists were another Sidious plan to weaken the Jedi and force them into using the clone troopers.
This led them into the dark days of the Clone Wars.
Dooku led the CIS into war with the Grand Army of the Republic and killed many Jedi and clones.
Towards the end of the Clone Wars, once the Chancellor was caught, Dooku held Chancellor Palpatine, who was secretly Darth Sidious, captive on his ship.
Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker were sent to save the Chancellor from Dooku.
Unfortunately, the two Jedi fought off all Dooku’s forces until they reached the mighty Sith Lord.
Dooku fought them both and knocked out Master Kenobi, leaving Anakin to fend for himself.
Anakin used his rage to counter Dooku and chopped his hand off.
Dooku’s lightsaber landed right in Anakin’s hand, and Anakin finally had Dooku hostage.
Chancellor Palpatine convinced Anakin to kill Dooku, but Anakin “it wasn’t the Jedi way” and sliced the great Sith Lord’s head off.
Anakin released Palpatine and escaped the ship, holding Kenobi and helping the Chancellor.
After the death of Dooku, Kenobi hunted down and killed Grievous on Utapau, thus ending the Clone wars and starting Order 66.
Unfortunately, Sidious sent Anakin to destroy all droids and kill the Separatist leaders.



# Personality and abilities
Count Dooku was one of the best lightsaber-wielders and mastered the Makashi form.
Count Dooku was also skilled with the Force lightning ability.
Count Dooku was also considered a “political idealist” by his peers.
Dooku had a sister, Jenza, that was a Jedi, and the two were very close until one day, Dooku became a Sith Lord and was titled Darth Tyranus, and his sister was so desperate to turn him that he killed her.
At the end of the Clone wars, Dooku allied with Quinlan Vos and Maul to overthrow Sidious, but Dooku was killed before they got the chance.
The only Jedi Dooku remained fond of was his dead Padawan, Qui Gon.
He even bragged to Kenobi about him and how he is still miserable after Qui Gon’s death.
Dooku wanted Qui Gon’s Padawan, Kenobi, to join the CIS and told him that the real Dark Lord of the Sith was named Darth Sidious.
Kenobi was reluctant to believe the deceiving Sith, but Dooku was respectful to Kenobi until he turned him down.
Dooku was a powerful Force wielder known as one of the best swordsmen in the Jedi Order.
Dooku could even take on Kenobi, Anakin, and Grand Master Yoda.
Dooku was extremely skilled in Fore lightning, which made it easier for him to torture and kill his foes.
He could also use it in telekinesis.
Dooku was a scholar in the powers of the Force and could telekinetically manipulate people.
Dooku was skilled in lightsaber to lightsaber combat because he used Form II, Makashi.
Dooku desired to become a Sith Master/Dark lord of the Sith, which is why he wanted to overthrow Sidious.
Still, he didn’t realize Sidious had already overthrown him from the start, thus starting the long era of the Galactic Empire.
