# Overview

Ch’hodos is a desert planet located within the Outer Rim Territories’ Sith Worlds zone.
Many considered Ch’hodos to be a lesser work of the Empire and only notably served as the central rallying grounds for the troops in preparation for Republic assault and the central base for Sith Lord Shar Dakhan.

# Sith History on Ch'hodos

Ch’hodos obtained the status of a lesser world in the Sith Empire and was directly controlled by the Empire’s capital of Zoist.
By 5000 BBY, Ch’hodos served as Sith Lord Dakhan’s main base.
It was later used for the preparation of Sith soldiers under the guidance of Dark Lord Naga Sadow to attack the Galactic Republic.
The troops trained on Ch’hodos were primarily of the Massassi caste.Sadow and his human apprentice, Gav Daragon, amassed massive armies that embarked on Sith personnel carriers and the two discussed the upcoming attack on the Galactic Republic.

# Planet Characteristics

Ch’hodos had deserts on its surface, and the planet was red and rocky.
This planet orbited a red sun in the Ch’hodos system.
This system was located in the Esstran sector in the Trans-Hydian part of the Outer Rim Territories.
The Sith Worlds zone was surrounded by the Stygian Caldera nebulosity.
Ch’hodos resided along the length of the Nache Bhelfia hyperlane, which connected the five sacred Sith worlds; Zoist, Khar Delba, Rhelg, Krayiss II, and Korriban.
Ch’hodos was also linked to the Ashas Ree world via the Zorfe Trete hyperspace route.

After more than a millennium from when Sadow and Daragon constructed armies for their attack on the Galactic Republic, the red sun that Ch’hodos orbited released more radiation.
This radiation dramatically affected, via mutation, the local wildlife, and organisms native to Ch’hodos.
