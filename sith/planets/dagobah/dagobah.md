# Introduction
Dagobah is a remote, unexplored planet inside of the Dagobah system.
It is one of the most pure places within the Force.
It was a seclusive planet filled with swamps and forests.
Dagobah was also the place where Jedi Grand Master Yoda sought refuge.
Due to Yoda being here, Luke Skywalker came here looking for training.
Yoda died here and his essence became one with the Force.

# Description
Dagobah was a planet located in the Sluis sector of the Outer Rim Territories.
Dagobah was a hot and humid planet, and a nursery of life.
Dagobah was pure in the Force, one of the purest locations in the entire galaxy.
This planet was mysterious, filled with mist.
Dagobah was also interspersed with shallow lakes, lagoons and multiple living caves.
Dagobah was home to many creatures, including bogwings, dragonsnakes, butcherbugs, vine snakes, sleens, and swamp slugs.
Dagobah had flora too, such as the Lahdia plant, Gnarltrees, Yoghurt plants, and Yarum seeds.
This planet was clear of advanced or indigenous civilizations of sentient life.
Dagobah had two seasons, a dry season and a wet season.
During the peak of the dry season, the uplands become too hot for the majority of life to survive, so the organisms have to migrate to the lower lands.
After a quarter orbit passes, Dagobah is far away enough from its sun that the dry season comes to an end and the rains return.
The wet season starts again, making the uplands habitable again after this.



# Republic Era
During the High Republic Era, an academic paper was written that stated that Dagobah was strong with the Force.
During the Republic Era, Halka Four-Den’s Alpha Team was sent to Dagobah in order to chart and map the outer borders of the Galactic Republic and also to learn more about Dagobah’s plants and animals.
After three months, Four-Den and her team were overwhelmed by dangerous wildlife, fast-growing plants, and diseases.
Close to the end of the Clone Wars, Jedi Grand Master Yoda went to Dagobah after hearing deceased Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn's voice.
Yoda went into the swamp, where he communicated with Jinn who appeared as a group of fireflies.
Qui-Gon told Yoda how to contact the living after death using the Force.
Then, Yoda set foot in a cave, where he saw a vision of the Jedi fighting clones and fought Darth Sidious.



# Imperial Era
Following Yoda’s failure to defeat Darth Sidious, Yoda exiled himself in Dagobah.
Yoda began his exile, continuing his studies of the Force.
Due to the swampy environment of Dagobah, Yoda’s E3 standard starship lifeboat, his shelter at the time, started to degrade within a year.
As the Lifeboat was slowly consumed by the swamp, Yoda built a new home for himself.
He made it near the dark side cave but out of range of its influence; Yoda would visit the cave every few years.
Dagobah’s wet season created a need for Yoda to regularly relocate to the planet’s highlands for the duration of the season.
At some point in time, former Sava Medlin Sun went to Dagobah in search of Yoda.
After saving her from a monster, Yoda used the Force to lead Sun into the Dark Side cave.
While she was inside, she saw visions which dissuaded her from looking for Yoda.
Afterwards, she left the planet as Yoda watched from a distance.



# Training ground of Luke Skywalker
Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader’s son, went to Dagobah under the direction of deceased Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, hoping to find Yoda and be trained in the ways of the Jedi Order.
Luke crashed into a bog while landing, not realising he crashed upon the old master.
Yoda took Luke back to his hut for dinner, where he revealed his true identity to Luke.
At first, Yoda was reluctant to train Skywalker because of his age and lack of patience.
Yoda was later convinced to teach Skywalker by the Force spirit of Obi-Wan.
During Luke’s training, he entered the Dark Side cave and came across a vision of Darth Vader, who he struck down, only to see his own face in Darth Vader’s mask.
However, Luke ended his training early, once he had sensed his friends, Han Solo and Princess Leia, were in danger.
Yoda and Kenobi tried to reason with him to stay, but Skywalker left the planet, promising to return and finish his training.
Luke came back after learning Darth Vader was his father during their duel on Cloud City, saving Leia and Chewbacca from Vader on Cloud City, and also rescuing Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine.
When Luke arrived in Dagobah, he found Yoda sick and dying.
Yoda told Luke that his training was complete, but his final task was to confront Darth Vader one last time.
Yoda became one with the Force and the ghost of Kenobi revealed that Princess Leia was Luke’s Sister.
Luke left Dagobah in order to confront Vader and the Emperor in hopes of turning Vader back to the Light Side.



# New Republic Ear
Kylo Ren, the nephew of Luke Skywalker and under the guidance of his master Snoke, came to Dagobah in order to face his darkest fears.
In the Dark Side cave, Ren experienced a vision of his uncle Luke, in which he dueled and killed, and a vision of his parents Princess Leia and Han Solo.
Ren was not able to kill his parents, so he destroyed the cave, fooling his master, Snoke.
At some point in time around 34 ABY, herbs from Dagobah would become a popular ingredient in Dagobah Slug Slingers, an alcoholic beverage served at Oga’s Cantina on the planet Batuu.
