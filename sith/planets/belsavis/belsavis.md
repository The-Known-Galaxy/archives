# Overview

Belsavis, also known as Plawal, was a planet from the Bozhnee Sector, in the ninth quadrant.
The planet’s surface was covered in ice, with an average temperature of -50 degrees fahrenheit, -45 celsius.

# Pre- and Old Republic Era

Belsavis became one of the many worlds that belonged to the Rakata Infinite Empire at some point in the past.
The Infinite Empire made good use of Belsavis by transforming it into a prison colony, in which they would begin placing many dangerous criminals to be trapped for a millenia.
Around 5000 BBY, Belsavis entered an ice age.
The inhabitants dwelt in three volcanic jungle rifts.
Later on, around the Great Galactic War, The Republic would begin using Belsavis’ prison, called The Tomb, as containment of Sith Lords and war criminals.
Through a Rakata transmitter, Ivory, a war criminal imprisoned in the Tomb, contacted the Sith Empire, in which they sought to cause a mass prison break on Belsavis.
It was successful, resulting in freeing the Dread Masters and finding Rakata secrets.
The Sith Emperor would then send Executor Krannus to destroy the planet, which would send shockwaves into hyperspace that would inevitably destroy adjacent systems to Belsavis, in which Krannus will fulfill the Emperor’s request of mass genocide.
However, the Hero of Tython saved Belsavis’ demise with his intervention.

# Imperial Era

Later, around 19 BBY, Jedi Master Plett, otherwise known as Plawal, would hide a number of Jedi younglings in Plett’s Well to save them from the Great Jedi Purge.
The Galactic Empire would send the Eye of Palpatine to bombard Belsavis and destroy the Younglings.
Although two Jedi Knights, Callista Ming and Geith Eris managed to sabotage the device, the Jedi younglings and Plett were forced to flee from the planet regardless.
Roganda Ismaren and some of the other younglings had been captured by the Inquisitorius.
