# Overview
Mandalore was a planet that was located in the Mandalore system in the Outer Rim, located as the fifth planet of the system.
Mandalore is the homeplanet of the group known as Mandalorians, calling their planet Manda’yaim in their language and being the primarily sentient group to populate the planet.
Mandalore's surface is covered in different biomes, having different kinds of forest, jungles, deserts of white sand, and also different lakes, rivers and seas, with the addition of being the only known planet alongside the Concordia moon, to reside within the unique ore known as Beskar.

# Early History
Before the Mandalorians came to Mandalore to occupy the planet, Mandalore was dominated by the beasts known as Mythosaurs, enormous beasts with a great physical capability, without any sign of a sentient species populating the planet.
When the Taung warriors, a sentient species, alongside the Mandalorian warriors reached the planet of Mandalore under the rule of Mandalore the First, they killed most of the Mythosaurs while also tamed many of them, being able to rule over the whole planet of Mandalore.
After conquering and establishing in Mandalore, they named the planet in their language Manda’yaim, or also as “Home of the Mand’alor”, therefore obtaining the common name of Mandalore.
The planet was mainly inhabited by multiple Mandalorian clans, who were all ruled by a Mandalore, being the supreme leader of Mandalore, however, after they conquered Mandalore, they were not satisfied after conquering only one planet, so under the rule of Mandalore the Indomitable, the Mandalorian clans and Taung warriors began the Mandalorian crusades or also known as the Mandalorian war, trying to conquer different star systems, leaving the planet of Mandalore mostly abandoned.



# Post-war Era
After the Mandalorians lost the Mandalorian war when Mandalore the Indomitable died against the Jedi Knight Revan, some Mandalorians came back to Mandalore in devastation due to the lost war, and so Mandalore began to be populated once more by Mandalorians.
Some time after the war, a great plague known as the Candorian Plague, infected Mandalore and made it a great victim of the plague, becoming the planet devastated by the plague.
Due to the Mandalorian war being lost, and the plague affecting the whole of Mandalore and its sector, it transformed into a weakened planet often being attacked by outlaws and bandits, being Mandalore in a crisis scenario.
This time period of crisis lasted until Aga Awaud, a veteran mercenary returned to Mandalore in the year 1058 BBY, and when he saw the weak state of Mandalore, he took the position of Mand’alore to call upon all the Mandalorians over the galaxy to overcome the crisis and reform Mandalore as a whole, therefore becoming known as “Mand’alore the Uniter”.
When Aga Awaud reformed the whole of Mandalore and its sector  began to increase in military and technological power, becoming a very powerful group that threatened the Galactic Republic, in fear of suffering a second Mandalorian war.

Due to this, in the year 738 BBY, the Galactic Republic and the Jedi devastated in a strike force in the reformed parts of Mandalore, being called the Mandalorian Excision or Dral’han, which meant annihilation, this lead to Mandalore and the Mandalorians to begin a era of devastation where parts of Mandalore became inhabitable to reside in.



# New Era
After the devastation of the Mandalorian Excision, many Mandalorians began to endure a more “pacifist” regime, calling themselves “New Mandalorians”.
This political movement in Mandalore began to deny the warrior codes and the violence past of Mandalore, this led to a part of the Mandalorians to separate from Mandalore due to the new regime to deny the warrior codes that the Mandalorians followed for generations.
This led to the creation of the “Old Mandalorians” who followed the warrior codes like the past Mandalorians, while the “New Mandalorians” were a more peaceful group dedicated to their advancement of technology and to grow in Mandalore.
Many of the Old Mandalorians became mercenaries and bounty hunters across the galaxy, but some decided to change the regime of the New Mandalorians and formed the group known as Death Watch to overthrow the regime of the New Mandalorians.
This led to an era of constant inner wars between the clans of the Mandalorians, some followed the ideals of the Death Watch, while other clans refused them, begging for an inner fight between the different clans, although the regime of the New Mandalorians stayed out of the conflict.



# Clone Wars Era
During the Clone Wars, Mandalore stayed neutral during the conflict, however the Death Watch which remained hidden after the wars between clans, decided to act again, but in Mandalore in hopes of overthrowing the current government ruled by the New Mandalorians in hopes of bringing Mandalore back to the times of conquest and violence.
This was secretly supported by Count Dooku in hopes of making Death Watch to conquer Mandalore and join the Separatists in the Clone Wars, this made Death Watch to constantly attack the political figures of Mandalore by terrorist attacks, recruiting Mandalorian citizens of Mandalore and so on… This eventually led to the Death Watch overthrowing the Duchess and its council of ministers, taking over Mandalore with the help of Darth Maul and its apprentice Opress.
After taking over Mandalore, the new leader of Mandalore and leader of Death Watch, Pre Vizsla, betrayed their Sith allies Darth Maul and Opress to gain full control over Mandalore, however the Sith Lords anticipated this and after the betrayal, Darth Maul challenged Pre Vizsla to a one on one combat to gain the rule of Mandalore, wich Darth Maul won.
After Darth Maul took over Mandalore, a fraction of Death Watch decided to not follow Maul and wanted to overthrow him from the throne, calling the Republic troops with the help of the former Padawan Ashoka Tano, this lead to a battle for Mandalore where members of the Death Watch who opposed to Maul, fought alongside Clone Troopers and Ashoka Tano against Maul troops, eventually capturing Maul and winning the battle in favor of the Death Watch leaded by Bo-Katan, ruling Mandalore.



# Inhabitants
Being the first inhabitants, the Taung warriors who conquered alongside Mandalorians Mandalore itself, it became after that a planet who was mainly inhabited by Mandalorians who were human alongside a few Taung.
However when the Mandalorian war began and many Mandalorians began to spread across the galaxy, many Mandalorians in Mandalore began to accept also different kinds of races, but the bigger portion of the population in Mandalore were of the human race.
