# Overview |
Giju was an aquatic world located in the Colonies Region, the planet consisted of vast oceans with sporadic landmasses such as glaciers, marshes, and islands.
It was the native planet of the Herglics, a race of bipedal mammals that evolved from water-dwelling creatures and breathed through a singular blowhole at the top of their head.
The planet operated as a trade hub for the Herglics, proving highly profitable given its connections to the Giju Run, Rinma, and Hidakai Pool trade routes.

# Pre-Republic Era |
The native Herglics would go on to develop hyperdrive technology sometime around the year 27,500 BBY, using this technology the Herglics would colonize surrounding planets and form their own sector of space; Herglic Space.



# Republic Era
By 13,000 BBY the Herglic would end up forming the Herglic Trade Empire, operating within Herglic space which by this era consisted of 40 star systems with Giju being the capital.
This empire would be offered to join the Republic which was accepted by the Herglics due to the great capacity for trade the Republic would offer.

Giju would remain in the Republic all the way up until the fall of the Republic.
During the Clone Wars Giju would come under attack by Separatist forces wishing to take control of the planet, this incursion was repelled by Republic forces under the leadership of Jedi General Sha Koon.
However, when the Republic was reformed into the Galactic Empire, Giju would revolt against the Empire.
This revolt would be crushed by the Empire resulting in the slaughter of many native Herglics.
From this moment, Giju submitted to the will of the Empire and began to labor to supply the Empire export of mid-high grade technology.



# Post-Imperial Era |
With the defeat of the Empire at the Battle of Endor, Giju was quickly reclaimed by the native Herglics who returned Giju to its former position as a major part of galactic trade.
With the establishment of the New Republic, Giju and the Herglics were once again given an opportunity to join which they did so.
