# Overview

Vanquo was a resource-rich planet most notably mentioned within the Mandalorian Wars.
The planet was mountainous in nature, which enabled large-scale mining operations.
Major settlements contained a substantial civilian population.
The rest of the planet was dominated by mines, which made these areas a target for refugees who would plunder the mining stores out of desperation.
Vanquo had a refugee problem in the early Mandalorian Wars as the planet was something of a safe haven for those affected by the conflict.
Vanquo would eventually be a target of the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, where it would be successfully conquered.

# History

Vanquo is worthy of recognition for its role in the Mandalorian Wars.
The planet was one of the first worlds within the Core that was contested by Mandalore.
The threat of conquest forced the Galactic Republic to form the Jebble-Vanquo-Tarnith line.
The early Mandalorian Wars would see heavy combat take place on this line, however it would not advance past a stalemate.
This was until a diversion tactic involving paratroopers seizing mining installments was used.
This caused the Jebble-Vanquo-Tarnith line to be broken.
Vanquo would be conquered and Taris, the target of the offensive, would fall alongside it.
