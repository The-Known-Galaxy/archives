# Overview

Bamayar IX was an emerald and turquoise gas planet.
The gas giant is assumed to be located within the Mid Rim due to the planet Bamayar which shares its name.
Due to high atmospheric pressure, the skies of this gas giant were often sparkled with lightning storms.
Around 6 BBY, a trainee pilot of the Galactic Empire, Bodhi Rook, flew through the planet with the rest of his classmates at the Terrabe Sector Service Academy.
He managed to steer the old Nu-class transport shuttle through the treacherous storms of Bamayar IX.
This was an impressive feat, earning the respect of his fellow training crew.
