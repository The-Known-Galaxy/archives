Pasaana is a terrestrial planet found between the Inner and Mid rims, in the Expansion Region, in the Ombakond Sector, while within the Middian System.
It was precisely positioned at the coordinates O-13 at the Standard Galactic Grid.
The planet orbited a star and was orbited by a moon smaller than itself.
Pasaana is approximately 11,135 kilometers in diameter and has 378 standard days in its local year.
The planet houses a parched environment but sustains a breathable atmosphere.


The majority of the surface was lengthy stretches of dunes that were bleached by its orbiting sun.
There were also plenty of shrublands with shrubs being the dominating greenery located in and around them.
The shrubs’ harmony was interfered with by the long buttes of sandstones as well as granite.
The buttes created shady vales where water was gathered by lifeforms.
There were numerous caves situated beneath the tremendous deserts connecting to water sources.
However, there were treacherous predators roaming the water sources so the Aki-Aki’s did not utilize the water sources as much as they could’ve.
There was phedrugrass and termania-spore being grown on the planet using dustgrain farms which was a crucial way to feed the inhabitants for the little water needed to grow these crops.


The planet housed the lives of many different insects and creatures, some vulnerable and some very ominous.
One of them being the Sarlacc.
The Sarlacc is known to be very vicious and harmful to practically anything that stumbles across it.
The insects included thistlebuzzers,  solif-spiders, gouge-beetles, and gorpions.
The malicious creatures included vexis, titan-erkes, oki-pokis, and etobis.
