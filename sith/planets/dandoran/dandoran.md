# Overview

Dandoran was a temperate planet in Hutt Space, inhabited by immigrated Dandoranian humans.
With at least two continents, the terrestrial lands were notably covered by forests and separated by many huge lakes.
Due to its sheltered environment, the world was used as a stash for Hutt smuggling operations.

# History

Dandoran was in the middle of the conflict between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War; battles ensued on the planet’s Dandorian Eyeteeth, Mynock Grottos, Smuggler’s Basin and Varsa Meadows.
Additional efforts were made by Republic allies, Saponza, his partner and Han Solo, to raid an unidentified Hutt Cartel den for medical supplies.
The western continent of Dandoran was the beginning of the Dandoran Campaign, a set of Alliance missions led by Colonel Jennica Pierce to destroy several Imperial garrisons.
The Empire had established a secret Advanced Weapons Research facility on a southern continent, aiming to introduce Undead Troopers, a new experimental class of stormtrooper infected with the Blackwing virus.
Sometime between 0 BBY and 4 ABY, the virus broke out and took over stationed Imperial forces.
Now a threat to the galaxy, Saponza and his partner were tasked to clear them before any real damage was done.
