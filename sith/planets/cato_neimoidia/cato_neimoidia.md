# Information

Cato Neimoidia was a planet located in the Cato Neimoidia System within the Quellor Sector of the Galaxy’s colonies, a purse world of the Neimoidians and the headquarters of the Trade Federation.
The planet was covered in a thick fog while the “Bridge Cities” of the planet were built and suspended above the oceans of the planet which were naturally acidic.
The reason these cities were called “Bridge Cities” is because they were suspended with bridges on the naturally forming giant rock arches and formations on which many of the fauna, along with biomes like grasslands and forests would thrive on.

Cato Neimoidia first joined the Galactic Republic somewhere about 25 millenia before the Battle of Yavin meaning they have been a long time member of the republic.
By the High Republic Era, Cato Neimoidia solidified itself when their Opera House rose to fame, this in turn increased traffic to and from the planet leading to an increase in tourists, profits, etc.
This happened because shortly after the First Emergence, a Nihil Tempest Runner called Pan Eyta, suggested they should take time away from raids and he pondered about whether he should visit the Opera House of Cato Neimoidia.

During the Clone Wars, multiple battles and events occurred such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker getting into some feuds with Anakin saving Obi-Wan, which happened sometime in 22 BBY.
Also during the Clone Wars, the Trade Federation signed over a couple holdings including this planet to the Intergalactic Banking Clan in order to loan money for purchasing equity in a new droid factory.
Despite this, the Neimoidians managed to continue their control with the Headquarters remaining on Cato Neimoidia.
After this there were multiple battles occurring between the Separatists and the Galactic Republic on the planet with control of it, switching between the two sides on multiple occasions until the war was over.

Following the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Empire created a garrison on the planet in order to keep it there as a protectorate and therefore reducing the Trade Federation to a puppet of the Empire.
Finally, nearly 28 years after the Battle of Yavin, a race known as “The Gauntlet” settled on Cato Neimoidia, and because of that, during the Cold War, the Resistance had to launch a mission to save Lor San Tekka.

Cato Neimoidia, as previously stated, was a purse world of the Neimoidians, a wealthy species originating from their homeworld of Neimoidia, not to be confused with the topic of this article as Cato Neimoidia and Neimoidia are two separate planets.
The Neimoidians operated the Trade Confederation which was once one of the biggest and wealthiest corporations in the known galaxy, where Cato Neimoidia actually housed the headquarters of said corporation.
The planet ended up being so developed  that the Neimoidians found this a more hospitable and better planet to live on than their actual homeworld–resulting in a lot of the species living and working on Cato Neimoidia.
