# Description

An Outer Rim planet known for its icy climate and snow-covered terrain, Carlac possessed a landscape of mountains, plains, and forests.
Carlac was most notably colonized by the Ming Po people during the Clone Wars, who were relevant due to their practice of peace and neutrality.
An infamous Mandalorian terrorist group called the Death Watch also set up a base here around 20 BBY.

# High Republic History

During the High Republic Era, a battle for Operation: Counterstrike was located on this planet.
This military operation was created due to the threat of Nihil marauders claiming territory and expanding into Galactic Republic settlements.
When some of the Nihil were caught and interrogated on Carlac, the Jedi discovered the existence of Tempest divisions.
They also found that these divisions were led by three different Tempest Runners, who held significant power and influence over the entire organization.

# Clone Wars History

As previously mentioned, the Death Watch organization created a base on Carlac during the Clone Wars.
Padawan Ahsoka Tano and future senator Lux Bonteri traveled to meet Death Watch with the goal of securing a deal for revenge on Count Dooku.
Mina Bonteri, Lux’s mother, was killed by Dooku’s minions because she spoke out against the war.
After finalizing the deal, Chieftain Pieter of the Ming Po people interrupted their party, imploring that Vizsla returned the female Ming Po slaves he took.
Although Pre Vizsla, Death Watch leader, accepted his plea, he later returned to their town and killed Pieter’s granddaughter in front of him.
The Mandalorians burned their town, slaughtered a significant amount of their people, and captured Ahsoka when she tried to defend them.
Lux Bonteri finally trusted Ahsoka’s warnings that Death Watch was extremely dangerous, and the two were later rescued by R2-D2 and the group of target practice droids he befriended.
