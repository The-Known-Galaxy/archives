# Overview
Muunilinst was a lush world made up of forests, plains and mountain peaks, with skies said to be some of the most beautiful in the entire galaxy.
Its oceans contained so called “smokers”, small conical volcanoes, which spewed out rich, pure and precious metals from the planet’s core.
These natural formations provided the Muuns with an almost inexhaustible source of wealth, used to guarantee credits across the galaxy.
At their arrival, It was an unbalance world due to the terrain and the 2 moons.

# Culture
The Muuns were famous for their incredible intelligence in financial and mathematical matters, but they also had the reputation of being greedy people.
Muuns usually looked at other species as hot-tempered and immature, and so they didn’t feel much guilt when exploiting them.
They were highly competitive, both among themselves and among other races, living in a society based on rigid castes, with the higher ups being lawyers, financiers, engineers and diplomats.
The common Muuns usually weren't able to leave their home planet, as upward mobility was limited to only the most intelligent people of the common Muuns.
Despite their enormous greed, they respected fairness and regarded contracts as almost sacred.



# Locations
The most important Muun city was Harnaidan, headquarters of the InterGalactic Banking Clan and capital of the planet.
It was built around a series of spires, and had a population of more than 50 million.
Below the surface of Harnaidan were caverns containing vast amounts of hot springs and lakes, where the lower castes searched for mollusks and algae.
The city was unfortunately leveled for the most part during the Clone Wars.
A skyhook connected Harnaidan with High Port Space Center.
Mariunhus was a very important and rich city of Muunilinst, built around a smoker rich in platinum, gold and other precious metals.
It was considered a “vault-spire”, a safe source of wealth, which could be mined whenever needed to produce credits.
Other smokers were considered “mine-spires” and used for industrial metals.



# History
Once the Muuns achieved their independence from Rakata during the Infinite Empire, they established themselves on Muunilinst, and at first founded an economy based around farming and fishing.
As interstellar travel became more popular though, the Muuns started to utilize the natural resources and precious metals of Muunilinst for trading, with the planet even becoming a rival for Coruscant itself.
They founded a large number of trade guilds, colonies and corporations along the Braxant Run.
At some point, they even colonized the very wealthy planet of Mygeeto, which would be used as a financial center.
Once Muunilinst became part of the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Credit Standard was established, the InterGalactic Banking Clan, founded by the Muuns, became its major guarantor, producer and distributor.
During the Clone Wars, Muunilinst aided both the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems financially, but the InterGalactic Banking Clan, controlled by San Hill, was mainly backing the Separatists, so the Muuns asked the Republic for help, causing horrible battles to take place.
During the battle of Muunilinst in 22 BBY, the Republic took back hold of the planet, devastating however the majority of Muun infrastructure and screwing over their economy, bringing the galaxy on the brink of financial ruin.
Sometime later, Muunilinst came back in the hands of the Separatists.
During the era of the Galactic Empire, the planet was under direct supervision of the Empire, and although it wasn’t destroyed like other factions such as the CIS, its business operations were hampered by harsh Imperial decrees and the presence of Imperial monitors throughout its institutions.
During the years of the New Republic, Muunilinst was still part of the Imperial Remnant, but nobody was able to attack them without destabilizing the Imperial credit.
During the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, Muunilinst was devastated, but after the war the planet managed to recover, and stayed under the Galactic Federation Triumvirate.
