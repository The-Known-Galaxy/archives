# Overview

Anaxes was a terrestrial planet in the Outer Rim, inhabited by immigrant species.
The terrain was partly rocky, lined with canyons and caves that would border forest jungles, hills, and valleys formed from the river bodies over millennia.
Indigenous species were largely silicon-based, such as the predatory Fyrnock, which would use towering red trees to hide from the sunlight that hurt them.
This particular flora gave a distinct red hue when observed from space.
Benefiting from the temperate climate were several grasslands where agriculture could thrive; the Spiral Dumplings delicacy had its roots in these regions.
Trade was made possible with Republic shipyards, linking the planet to the Perlemian Trade Route.
However, Anaxes was obliterated following a freak accident, believed to be caused by a reactor failure and hypermatter storage in the shipyards, dispersing the planet into an asteroid belt.

# History

In the heyday of the Republic, Anaxes was a renowned stronghold for Core World defence forces against potential threats along its trade route, housing military bases such as Fort Anaxes.
This all changed during the latter years of the Clone Wars.
The Confederacy of Independent Systems targeted Anaxes even with their perceived little presence in the galaxy, which surprised the Republic.
In 19 BBY, the Separatists collected at a security outpost seized a prominent assembly complex for ships, one of several plans made by a new strategic algorithm provided by the Cyber Center.
This technology could turn the tides of the Clone Wars in their favour.
In response, the Republic deployed Jedi Generals Mace Windu, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker, alongside clone trooper forces, to reclaim the vital shipyard.
However, their efforts were in vain due to a complication - a bomb that could potentially level the entire planet.
Yet, Windu was able to deactivate the threat with the assistance of Skywalker and Advanced Recon Commando Echo.
Consequently, the unsuccessful attempt to capture led to Clone Captain Rex’s suspicions of the droid army’s use of Republic strategy algorithms.
Desperate to find the source, his 501st Legion and the unorthodox elite commando squad, Clone Force 99, were ordered to infiltrate the facility of their foe.
After storming the outpost, the team was able to locate Cyber Center.
It was later revealed that the overseer of the base, Admiral Trench, was using a signal from the planet Skako Minor, transmitted by Echo, who had been captured from the Battle of Lola Sayu by the Techno Union a year prior.
Following the Echo’s rescue, the Republic removed much of their enemy from the world.
The destruction of Anaxes in the early years of the Empire led to the rocky debris forming an asteroid belt.
Some facilities even survived, such as Fort Anaxes, now on PM-1203, and a Separatist stronghold, now on PM-6986.
Fort Anaxes saw a new function as a smuggling post for mercenaries and the early Rebellion, while droids on the planetoid PM-6986 were left stranded there.
