# Overview
Ashas Ree was the main planet of the eponymous system otherwise known as the Ashas Ree system.
This system was located deep within the Sith Empire in the Sith territory of the Outer Rim.
Like many other planets of the Sith Empire it also had a breathable atmosphere.
 Ashas Ree was a battle-scarred world and held the status as one of the lesser known worlds in the Sith Empire.
This planet was the first to be found by the Jedi Freedon Nadd after his exile, where he recovered the Adas holocron, which was previously held by a former Sith Lord who perished on Ashas Ree.
Under the command of Jedi Master Ven Zallow an attack was launched on Ashas Ree during The Great Galactic War but the attack was deflected by The Imperial Army and The Imperial Navy under the command of Darth Malgus and Darth Angral.
During The Cold War Between the Sith and the Jedi a protocol droid was sent to Ashas Ree where it was abducted and the information within was stolen before it could be deleted.
During The New Sith Wars, Servis Vaa researched the worlds owned by the Sith Empire and he stated that Ashe Ree was stripped of Sith treasures by Republic Scouts at the end of The Hyperspace War.
