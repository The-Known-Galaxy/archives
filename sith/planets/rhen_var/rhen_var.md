# Description
A planet in the Outer Rim Territories, Rhen Var was situated near the Galidraan system which was primarily controlled by the Galactic Empire.
This freezing cold planet possessed a frigid climate only withstood by troops well-equipped with heat harboring gear.


Originally possessing vegetation and fauna, a sudden cataclysm transformed the surface of Rhen Var into a frozen wasteland thousands of years before the Clone Wars.
The only terrain that remained was the tundra, snow-covered mountains, and glaciers.

# Imperial Era
Rhen Var maintained an Imperial outpost during the rule of the Empire, and it was thought that the stolen Carrion Spike would attack the settlement.
After this Imperial corvette (starship) was hijacked and used to launch assaults on the Empire’s establishments in the Galidraan system, Moff Wilhuff Tarkin originally predicted that it would be used against the Rhen Var base.
He later decided that the rebel pilots would instead target the planet Nam Chorios due to its mining colony and prison facility.
