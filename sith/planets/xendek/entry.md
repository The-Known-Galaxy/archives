# Overview

In the galaxy, there existed a blue planet called Xendek.
Xendek was home to a species of bird known as the argora.
The argora, in the eyes of the Xendekians, was the source of all good fortune on earth and delivered rain and crops.
The Galactic Empire at some point stole an argora for the Emperor's private zoo.
The Spectres afterward attempted to save the bird.
