# Overview
Almas was a terrestrial planet located in the Expansion Region.
Almas received minimal sunlight and had a strangely hot core despite not being geologically active.
This planet only has two small mountain ranges.
It was an anomaly with a poisonous atmosphere that was left largely untouched until the Sith Lord Darth Rivan, not to be confused with Darth Revan from whom he drew his name from, aimed to settle on the unruly planet.
Kaluthin grass was a part of Rivan’s plans.
This grass eventually enabled Almas to have an oxygen-rich atmosphere.
Darth Rivan built a Sith fortress on the planet until he was expelled by Jedi Knights during the New Sith Wars.
During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance established a base on Almas that would later be abandoned.
