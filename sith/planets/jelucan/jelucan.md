# Overview
Situated in the Outer Rim Territories, Jelucan was a planet that played a role in the Clone Wars, aligning itself with the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
However, as the Age of the Empire dawned, the Galactic Empire seized control over Jelucan, annexing it into their domain.
Notably, this planet served as the birthplace of Thane Kyrell and Ciena Ree, two individuals caught in a fateful love affair that found them on opposing sides of the Galactic Civil War.

# Description
Jelucan, a cold and rocky planet in the Outer Rim Territories, was inhabited by two distinct communities: the valley dwellers known as the First Wavers and the more affluent second wave settlers in urban centers like Valentia.
Mutual distrust existed between these communities, with the second wavers looking down on the valley dwellers and vice versa.
Jelucan was also home to non-sentient muunyak species and prized resources like Jelucani fogstone.
Ridgecrawlers were commonly used for transportation due to the planet's rugged terrain.



# History
Jelucan's history spans several centuries, beginning with the arrival of the First Wavers around 511 BBY.
These exiles settled on the planet, maintaining their allegiance to their king despite arriving in a state of poverty.
Approximately 350 years later, a second wave of settlers arrived and established profitable mining operations, considering the traditions of the initial settlers to be outdated.
The second wave settlers amassed wealth and power, while the First Wavers remained impoverished.
During the Clone Wars, Jelucan aligned itself with the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
However, following the end of the war, the planet gained independence until it was annexed by the Galactic Empire in 11 BBY.
A grand ceremony, attended by Grand Moff Tarkin, marked the Empire's presence on Jelucan.
During this event, Thane Kyrell, a noble from the second wave settlers, and Ciena Ree, a valley-dweller, were befriended by Tarkin and encouraged to join the Imperial Navy upon reaching maturity.
While only a few Jelucan residents were recruited due to their former allegiance with the Separatists, the Empire favored the more populous Inner Rim worlds for its cadet recruitment.
As time passed, the native muunyak species gave way to Imperial-introduced ridgecrawlers, becoming the prevalent mode of transportation on Jelucan.
Thane and Ciena, having fulfilled their dream of joining the Imperial Navy, graduated from the prestigious Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant shortly before the Battle of Yavin.
However, disillusioned by the Empire's oppressive actions, Thane defected to the Rebel Alliance.
The planet suffered from heavy pollution due to the Empire's mining activities during the Galactic Civil War.
The distinction between the First Wavers and second wave settlers blurred as both groups adopted similar attire.
The legislative building of Jelucan also fell under the control of the Imperial Military.
Following the Battle of Hoth, Ciena Ree returned to Jelucan to support her falsely accused mother, who had been sentenced to hard labor.
Ciena and Thane, despite fighting on opposing sides, reunited and shared a moment of intimacy.
During the era of the New Republic, Jelucani fogstone, a local resource, was employed to construct a statue of Senator Bail Organa at the New Republic senatorial complex on Hosnian Prime.
Tragically, the statue was destroyed by the Amaxine warriors during the Napkin Bombing in 28 ABY.
