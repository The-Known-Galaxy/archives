# Overview
Ezaraa was a terrestrial planet native to the Ezaraa species.
Only two continents were occupied by the Dominion of the Ezaraa, the xenophobic society of Ezaraa that sought to rule the galaxy and consume lesser life forms.
The planet remains a mystery.
It is implied that there were other continents that these natives didn’t conquer from conversations between Dr Chelli Lona Aphra and 0-0-0.
It is also assumed that there were other species on the planet for the Ezaraa to feed on due to their speciesism ideologies.
Materials obtained from harvest crops and other life forms and galactic trade must have allowed them to craft their iconic armour.
