# Overview
Actlyon was a terrestrial planet in the Outer Rim, inhabited by mainly immigrant populations of the Rodian and Trandoshan species.
The terrain was primarily mountainous, supporting a variety of flora and fauna, all enveloped by an orange hue that emanated from the skies.
Home to several industrial works and considerable crowds, Actlyon City was a prominent landmark of the world, later polluting its air with a horrendous odour.
Despite this, the lower district of the city still thrived with presence, housing at least one cantina where food and beverages were served.
Outlaws met to discuss rumours about various topics, including Resistance activity.
However, this must not be mistaken for a safe haven; even a bartender was kidnapped by bounty hunters for her debts.
Trade was made possible with one spaceport in the lower district, which linked to two hyperspace routes, one spanning to the planet Taul and another to the world of Batuu.

# History
By 34 ABY, the Resistance used the cantina as a briefing point.
The band member of the “Sentient 7 and the Clankers”, Pall Gopal, operated as a spy and was summoned to deliver a package to Dok-Ondar, an Ithorian collector on Batuu.
With the aid of Izal Garsea, who was left by her former captain, the illusive smuggler Ana Tolla, Gopal could follow his orders.
Nothing else is documented about Actlyon.
