# Overview

Obroa-skai, a planet located in the Obroa-skai system of the Inner Rim, was renowned for its libraries and medcenters.
During the Clone Wars, one of its medcenters purchased a fleet of Sephi flyers from Thustra for emergency evacuations.
It was also home to Galen Walton Erso, who served as a teacher at a college on the planet.
In 14 BBY, Berch Teller and his rebel cell transmitted false information about traveling on Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's stolen corvette Carrion Spike to Obroa-skai, causing the Empire to divert significant resources to apprehend them.
This led to a tragic space accident involving several ships, claiming the lives of 1,100 passengers aboard the MC80 Star Cruiser Stellar Vista.
The ships that made it through were hauled to the shipyards in Obroa-skai to undergo repairs.
Around 0 ABY, the Stratosphere Room of Obroa-skai became the site of the Obroan Intelligence Summit, where information brokers gathered to discuss their trade.
