# Introduction

Yavin 4 is one of three moons that was orbiting around Yavin Prime, a gas giant located in the Gordian Reach Sector.
It is one of the few moons that is habitable.
Yavin 4 is considered remote and unheard of, mostly covered by jungles and rainforests and barely any humanoid species inhabited it.
However, this moon played an important role in multiple galactic events, such as Exar Kun’s transition to the Dark Side, Freedon Nadd’s defeat during the Great Sith War, and where Revan met his demise.
It also housed the Battle of Yavin during the Galactic Civil War and was the target of the Death Starwhen it launched its attacks.

# Environment

Yavin 4’s core was built up from molten/metallic substances and was followed up by a thick crust.
It comprised four different continents that comprised 67% of the moon’s overall surface, which were filled with large jungles, tall canopies, and mountainous territories–where volcanoes were also housed–.
The remaining percentage of the moon was covered by six interconnected, landlocked oceans and often experienced numerous geothermal activities because of how small the moon is.
The moon contains two different seasons: a wet one filled with constant thunderstorms and a dry one that heated the environment.

Due to how big its surface territory is, Yavin 4’s large jungles house numerous creatures.
Whisper birds can be seen soaring through the sky, Woolmanders will be feeding on the fruit of trees, Runyips would be hidden amongst the trees, while Howlers scare them with their roars.
Yavin 4’s aquatic life was also high in numbers, even with the low amount of bodies of water it contained, housing piranha beetles, armored snakes, and gundarks.
