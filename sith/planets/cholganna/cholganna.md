# Overview
Cholganna was a temperate planet in the Outer Rim.
Orbited by two moons, the world had at least one continent, Indona, a forest full of different flora and fauna.
In the jungles, predatory Nexu would hunt several species, like the Arboreal octopus, Bark rat and Reevo, at the top of the food chain.
Over galactic history, creatures and plants have been exported for profiteering.
An example was using the Nexu for fights in off-world arenas due to their violent nature.
Intersected by the Tethyrr River, the labyrinth of vines neighboured a valley.
An ocean separated Indona from the mountainous terrain.

# History
Sometime before 3678 BBY, the Sith Empire and Abyssin battled in the Skirmish on Cholganna, which saw victory to the Sith.
Sith Acolyte Teneb Kel spared Abyssin warrior Qawhohl and kept him as his slave.
Near the end of the Clone Wars, the Sa Nalaor, a Banking Clan Munificent-class star frigate, lost course and crashed on the planet.
Survivors of the calamity, Separatist Captain Rel Harsol and Arkanian cyberneticist Cratala, amongst others, eventually formed a secretive colony within the dangerous jungles, the Retreat, to escape the eyes of the new Galactic Empire.
Cratala carried on with her research in hiding while utilising smuggled technology and medicines, presumably by the unfamiliar Perlemian Trade Route-Cholganna hyperlane that crossed the planet.
