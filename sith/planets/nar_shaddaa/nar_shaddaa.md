Nar Shaddaa was the biggest moon of Nal Hutta, located in the Y’Toub system, the planet surface was entirely made out of overgrown cities and being a very industrialized planet.
However, unlike other planets with overgrown cities, Nar Shaddaa was filled with crime activity all over the planet, very polluted and filth.
This planet was mostly controlled by various Hutt cartels, disputing over territory all over Nar Shaddaa, generating multiple wars between these cartels.

# Culture
Nar Shaddaa, despite being a very developed planet with numerous overgrown cities all around the surface of the planet, was mostly known for its criminal activity and illegal businesses.
Many Hutt cartels and criminal organizations established numerous black markets, laboratories in charge of researching weapons of mass-destruction, slave markets, and much more.
In response to these conditions on the planet, many smugglers, criminals and pirates originated from this planet, giving it the nickname of the Smuggler's Moon.



# Old Republic Era
During the time of the Old Republic, Nar Shadda was a newly formed planet with the Hutts when they left their homeworld, Varl, settling in the moon of Nal Hutta and deserting or slaving the Evocii, natives of Nal Hutta and its moon.
After defeating the Evocii, many of them were enslaved and forced to build the overgrown cities of Nar Shaddaa.
After being the planet fully urbanized to the known Nar Shadda, the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire during the cold war, decided to try to ally with the Hutt cartels in hopes of gaining the moon to their favor.



# Galactic Empire Era
During the era of the Galactic Empire, the empire decided to increase their relations with the planet’s criminal organizations and the Hutt cartels that resided in Nar Shaddaa.
In exchange of the Empire being able to have more influence over the moon alongside establishing numerous shipyard’s over Nar Shaddaa, the organizations that resided on the planet were allowed more freedom in their illegal activities without the Empire intervening.
After the battle of Yavin, the Empire began to lose their numerous shipyards and influence over the planet, leaving Nar Shaddaa and the organizations inside the planet in the same situation as it was before the Empire came.
