# Overview
Taris acted as one of the many urban planets in the Star Wars universe, with this one being located in the Taris system of the Outer Rim Territories.
The products and people on Taris were referred to as Tarisian after unknown human colonists overtook it.
Aliens would consistently go in and out of the planet, whether to settle or to visit.
This caused the Republic to notice it and claim it as its own.
While the Republic’s rule of the planet first caused immediate economic growth, it eventually led to a mass overpopulation of the planet.
Once the Galactic Nexus was formed, greater trade routes were found, which led to Taris’s importance on the map greatly declining.
Eventually, the harm became too much for the Tarisians, and they started immigrating to other planets.
Those who were less fortunate and could not immigrate started social movements and riots among its people.
The economy declined, the oceans were polluted, and its main food source was gone.
It got so bad that pretty much all of the Taris wildlife was sick or dead.
The poor were left to die while the rich hoarded what was left.
This led to numerous civil wars, most notably the Tarisian Civil War, and the Humanocentric Civil War.
These wars only led to more unjust rules for the poor as they would be banished from entering the upper regions of Taris, where the rich resided.
Taris acted as a crucial central point for the Jedi during the Mandalorian Wars.
As the lower class was trampled during the war, their anger only grew.
The crime levels shot up, and the rebellion from the low class became stronger.
This caused one of the biggest mining companies to leave Taris, causing the unemployment of half of the lower class.
This would cause much of the lower class to go to the planet's government and start riots.
They even kidnapped the Senator as well as the local constable.
This only led to the Jedi also leaving, causing the wars on Taris to continue raging.
Taris would eventually recover after the Jedi return during the Jedi Civil War.

# Planet features
Taris was an ecumenopolis, meaning that pretty much all land was transformed into cities.
Unlike most ecumenopolis, Taris had a huge ocean that took the majority of its surface.
These oceans were once used for enormous kelp farms to feed the massive population, but then the ocean became polluted, causing the kelp to die.
The buildings on Taris were tall and beautiful and had unique features around their edges.
Despite this, the planet was still corrupt and left the lower class to suffer under all of the loud buildings.
After Darth Revan’s Sith empire bombarded Taris, much of the buildings were left in ruins.

Taris had these feathered dog-like animals that were used as pets by the citizens of Taris.
Many animals were also hunted or used for resources that were either shipped or used by Tarisians.
The Rakghoul was one of the most terrifying creatures on the planet, residing in the Undercity of Taris.
They were ruthless creatures that tore their prey apart and spread a disease that turned their victim into a Rakghoul.



# Culture
Taris was an extremely classist and segmented society, splitting up the rich and the poor into nicer areas based on wealth.
Most alien species were banned from even being in the upper regions of Taris, with a few exceptions.
Most aliens that even stepped foot in the upper regions would be arrested.
The middle regions allowed aliens, but also still had a majority of humans due to the unfair favoritism of humans on Taris.
The lower region was mainly alien-based and dealt with lots of crime.
The punishments on citizens were extremely harsh, with the most common punishments being an execution, or being banished into the underworld.
