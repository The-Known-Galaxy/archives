# Overview

Honoghr was a primary home for the Noghori, and was part of the seven planets in the Honoghr system.
In 20 BBY, the planet fell into disaster when a battle in orbit caused a ship to crash on the planet's surface.
This caused the Galactic Republic great interest because of a toxic release that destroyed the planet and its resources.
After the war in orbit ended, Vader went onto the planet only to find his men killed by natives.
Impressed, he offered to have the Galactic Empire restore the planet in exchange for the natives working as his assassins.
Sneakily though, the Empire actually kept the planet intoxicated, leaving the plants to die and keeping Vader's assassins by his side.
Vader also used this planet to train his apprentices Starkiller, Tao, and Ennix Devian.

# Section I

Before the Battle of Yavin, a ground force was sent to the planet in an attempt to kill Commander Malinth as a sign of hostility towards the Noghri.
Despite best attempts with the Empire, they failed to fight back.
Leah,  the daughter of Vader, had learned of the Empire's deceit in pretending to fix the planet, and persuaded the Noghri to disband the alliance with the Empire.
After breaking the deal, they joined the New Republic and even had representatives in the Senate.
