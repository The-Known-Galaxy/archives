# Overview
Fyodos was a temperate planet in the Outer Rim, native to the sentient Fyodoi humans and the Galidyn species.
The terrain of the planet was predominantly forests and grasslands complemented by mountains.
At least three continents, Tharak, Kalid and Othlor, spanned the world; the latter two were separated by the Othlorian Sea.
There was another significant body of water, its name lost to time.
Also known by Tatrang IV for its position in the Tatrang system, Fyodos was orbited by three moons, each representing an aspect of Fyodoi culture - Deathmoon, Lifemoon and Warmoon.
The Deathmoon appeared as a shrivelled corpse’s face and was home to a military base.
Ceremonies and rites of passage for the Fyodoi people were held on the Lifemoon.
The Warmoon was believed to be a place for meaningless battles with other species; some may see it as a precursor to the following Great Cleansing of 350 BBY.
With their little galactic presence, the people could trade hide armour and weapons for food, chemicals and Slugthrower ammo, and a rundown spaceport in Tharak was used by travellers coming and leaving the planet.
The Galidyn, on the other hand, prioritised intellectual discussions and often held conversations at the Crater of Debate.

# Great Cleansing
A conflict between the Fyodoi settlers and Galidyn commences, who were otherwise coexisting.
Fyodoi stationed at the Deathmoon were ordered to fire hundreds of atomic missiles but ultimately refused to do so and were abandoned.
The devastation across the planet’s surface, later named the Great Cleansing, ensued when weapons for war were used, killing most of them.
The Galidyn fled to underground cities and stayed out of the way of the warring Fyodoi.
Survivors of the two nations lived with one another once more.
However, the humans were particularly affected by the aftermath and regressed to a more primitive way of life, fearing future cataclysms.
