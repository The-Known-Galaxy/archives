# Overview

Csilla is primarily known for being the homeworld of the legendary Chiss.
Csilla was an extremely cold planet consisting of glaciers and snowy wastes.
This planet was located in the deep Chiss Space and was the capital planet for the Chiss Ascendancy.
It is a terrestrial planet that resides within the Unknown Regions and occupies the second orbit for the star Csilla.
It imported resources including food, luxury items, technology, and other valuables from planets to distribute within the Chiss Ascendancy.

Csilla held relatively standard gravity and had a frigid climate.
It was orbited by three moons, and the entire planet was covered in icy structures like glaciers and caves.
These glaciers were extremely blue due to the hydrosphere of the planet, which contained a very high mineral content.
Around 27500 BBY, Humans reached the planet and began a colonization of the planet.
These humans would end up working with the Chiss and creating a global government for the planet.
At around 5000 BBY, the planet began going through an ice age, which caused icy glaciers to engulf the once-warm grass that covered the planet.

This ice age would never end though, and to this day the planet is still locked in this icy abyss.
This forced many technological and socioeconomic changes to be made regarding the planet so that the people residing on it could continue to live there safely.
Although this planet is mainly known for inhabiting the Chiss, it contains roughly eight billion sentients.
