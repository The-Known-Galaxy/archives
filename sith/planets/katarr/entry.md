# Introduction

Katarr is a Miraluka colony world, located in the Mid Rim territories.
It is specifically located in the Vensori Sector within the Mid Rim, and the only colony world of the Miraluka race; a humanoid species of Force-Sensitives that could see through the Force.
The planet is almost filled with mountains but contains rich flora and fauna filled with multiple bird species and trees.
The cities built by the Miraluka contained a unique style, as all their buildings contained a distinct round-shaped style.

# History and Destruction |

In 3,952 BBY, Katarr was completely ravaged during the First Jedi Purge.
The Sith Lord Darth Nihilus arrived on the planet and drained the entirety of the Force present, alongside all life within.
This attack happened because of a Jedi meeting taking place on the planet, which caused the death of the entire sentient population.
During the aftermath of Nihilus’ attack, he discovered that only one person had survived: Visas Marr.
Darth Nihilus’ true motivation for his attack was to devour the Jedi and consume their Force.
However, since Katarr was located between Onderon and Dantooine; two planets key to the Republic, they assumed that the Sith wanted to blind that specific region to the Force, to conceal their movements from the Republic.
