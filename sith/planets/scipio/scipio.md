# Overview

Scipio was a planet almost completely covered in ice and snow, located in the Outer Rim Territories’ Albarrio sector.
It was the homeworld of the Muuns and the headquarters of the InterGalactic Banking Clan for some time.
The world was filled with frozen peaks and mountains along with towering columns and graceful arches.

# History

At some point the planet was the home of a warrior species and culture, whose influence is still visible in the Muun clothing styles.
The people also used tattoos to signify a high status.
It then became the homeworld of the Muun species, who exploited the planets’ geothermal energy.
As Scipio lacked any form of natural resource, the Muuns had to colonize Muunilinst to found the InterGalactic Banking Clan.
Scipio’s Banking Clan became a major grantor of the credit, becoming very important for the Galactic Republic.
The bank profits were safely held on the planet.
Many other organizations and representatives made their home on Scipio, to ensure their place in the galactic market.
Senator Rush Clovis represented the interests of the InterGalactic Banking Clan from 25 to 22 BBY, when he was arrested.
He became the head of the Banking Clan in 20 BBY.
He did not last long however, as he was killed in the Separatist attack on Scipio, sacrificing himself in order to save Amidala Padmé, representative of the Galactic Republic found on Scipio to prevent corruption.
At the end of the Clone Wars, with the rise of the Galactic Empire, Scipio was subjugated.
