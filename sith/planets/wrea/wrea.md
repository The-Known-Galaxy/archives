# Overview
Situated in the Outer Rim Territories, Wrea was a planet notorious for its inaccessibility, as the Smuggler's Run asteroid belt nearby made it difficult to reach.
Despite this, the planet was home to a variety of species, including the aquatic Wrean species, who called the planet's predominantly oceanic terrain home.
The planet's rocky landmasses were sparsely scattered over the surface and covered in grass and scrub brush, serving as a haven for a range of creatures.
Because the planet was mostly covered in water, its climate was predominantly chilly, and the salty aroma that permeated the air could be detected from afar.
From space, the planet appeared predominantly blue.

# History
During the Clone Wars, Wrea served as a crucial site for the Separatists, as it housed a significant presence along with a base featuring a comm tower.
As the war came to a close, the planet was left with the remains of numerous battle droids scattered throughout.
Moving forward to the Imperial Era, Wrea became a focal point for Saw Gerrera, a freedom fighter who chose the planet to establish a base for his Partisans insurgent group.
It was on this very planet that Gerrera rescued Jyn, daughter of Galen Erso, after her father was captured.
Bringing her to his base on Wrea, Gerrera ensured her safety in the midst of a turbulent era.



# Conclusion
The events that transpired on Wrea during the Clone Wars and the Imperial Era reflect the planet's crucial role in the galactic conflict.
From serving as a Separatist stronghold to becoming a hub for the rebellion against the Empire, Wrea played a significant role in shaping the destiny of the galaxy.
