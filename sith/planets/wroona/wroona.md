# Overview
Wroona is a mainly isolated planet with lots of history revolving around the Galactic Empire, Senate, and Civil Wars.
They were home to Wroonians, which were human-like creatures found in the Wroona System.
It was a mainly naval planet and had a huge culture around fishing, naval travel, and other water-based activities.
It was home to many trades and held many colonies, as well as hosted the Void hyperspace shortcut.
Despite the attempted isolation of this planet, the Galactic Empire still made efforts to gain control over the trade routes and guilds.
The Wroonians were divided on this matter, with some subjecting to the Empire's treatment and others fighting against it.
One group known as the Guild of Armament Distributors went as far as to heavily damage a Victory-class Star Destroyer.
