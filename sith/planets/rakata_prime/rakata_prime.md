# Introduction

Located within the G-11 grid area of the Unknown Regions, Lehon, alternately called Rakata Prime or simply Rakata, was a terrestrial planet.
Despite the hindrance posed by the Galactic Barrier—an expanse of hyperspace anomalies—Rakata Prime remained accessible through cautious hyperspace jumps, standing as one of the select few navigable worlds discovered through infrequent exploration missions.

# History

In approximately 9 ABY, Hunter Rieve, a Force-sensitive individual, acquired an audiochip containing music from her former band.
She compared her vocals to a Rakata-like creature.
Around 33 ABY, the Zabrak pirate Tryki was arrested for attempting to board a First Order cruiser near Rakata Prime, resulting in the destruction of her starship.
Resistance pilot Venisa Doza and her droid, Torch, also visited the planet.
A year later, in 34 ABY, while facing capture by the First Order, Doza referred to their time on Lehon in their escape plan.
Lehon was associated with the Rakatan Infinite Empire, Rakatan wraith boxes, and the Legend of Lehon.
The legend suggested that Tatooine was once a jungle inhabited by the Kumumgah before it became the desert planet known in the present.

# Inhabitants

Lehon, inhabited by the amphibious Rakata species, held the distinction of being their home planet.
According to a legend, the Rakata were pioneers in hyperspace travel.
However, they were said to have succumbed to the dark side of the Force, leading to their eventual extinction.
The planet was also home to various native creatures.
