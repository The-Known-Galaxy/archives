# Overview
Ryloth was a planet that housed the Twi値ek species and was located in the outer rim territories.
This planet had varied a lot in terms of its ecosystem consisting of jungles, volcanoes, valleys, and mesas.
Ryloth also contained an atmosphere that was breathable to both Twi値eks and humans.
Although the planet's different landscapes and biomes may seem appealing, Twi'leks would generally live in caves as Ryloth was filled with dangerous territories with plenty of predators roaming the jungles.
Ryloth was also known to be orbited by a total of 5 moons causing its gravitational pull to affect the planet immensely.

# Section I
Ryloth was a planet with quite a diverse geology that was in possession of mountain ranges, snow plains, temperate forests, and deserts.
A small portion of this planet slightly distant from the Jixuan desert would be perfect breeding territory for the Gutkurr species.
Unfortunately for the Twi値eks the thriving and dangerous wildlife would force them to go into well-defended areas or enclosed caves.



# Section II
In its early days, Ryloth would prove itself to be an important planet due to the fact that it is the homeworld of the Twi値ek species.
Unfortunately, this planet would occasionally be exploited by the Hutts to use the Twi値eks and take them into slavery for the production of various goods.
The planet was known for spice trading and was under the control of the Zygerrian Slave Empire before the regime fell at the hands of the Jedi Knights.
Ryloth also contained multiple clans which would participate in a series of civil wars against each other.
