# Overview
The Wellspring of Life is a powerful planet in the galaxy that holds significant importance to the light side of the Force.
Although it was not included on any official star map and had no name, it was recognized as one of many similar sources of power in the galaxy.
The planet's barren surface was deceiving, as below it, there were floating islands covered in plant life, immersed in the Force.
The Wellspring of Life was a legend across the galaxy and was only discovered by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn shortly before his death.
After Qui-Gon Jinn's death, his spirit manifested itself in Grand Master Yoda's dreams, urging him to continue the investigation into the Wellspring of Life.
Yoda traveled to the planet and met the Force Priestesses during the Clone Wars on the planet.

# Description
The Wellspring of Life, located in the heart of the galaxy, was surrounded by a nebula of golden gas and appeared as a planet of cracked rock.
Despite its barren appearance, the planet's surface was clean, pure, and hospitable to all species, with geysers of light erupting through its fissures, spewing pure life energy.
Inside the planet was a hollow space containing drifting islands of solid ground, covered in jungles of strange flora and inhabited by creatures that were creations of the Living Force.
These beasts did not harm visitors to the Wellspring, and neither hunger nor thirst affected anything within the planet.
However, the planet's creatures could not be removed from the Wellspring without vanishing.
The Wellspring was the birthplace of midi-chlorians, the microscopic organisms linked to the Force, and the secrets of immortality were tied to the Force Priestesses who roamed the land.
