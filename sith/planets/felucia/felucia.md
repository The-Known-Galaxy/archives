# History

Felucia is a planet located in the Outer Rim of the galaxy, with a long and storied history.
The planet was once home to an advanced civilization known as the Kumumgah, who built towering cities and developed sophisticated technology.
However, the Kumumgah eventually died out, leaving behind only ruins and artifacts for later generations to discover.
Felucia later became a member of the Galactic Republic, and was represented in the Senate by Senator Vien'sai'Malloc.
During the Clone Wars, Felucia was a key battleground, with both the Republic and Separatists fighting for control of the planet's strategic resources.
The planet was the site of several major battles, including the Battle of Felucia and the Second Battle of Felucia, both of which were won by the Republic.
After the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Felucia fell under Imperial control, and was used to produce valuable medicines and drugs from its unique flora.
However, the planet was eventually liberated by the Rebel Alliance, and Felucia became a symbol of hope and resistance against the Empire.
In the years that followed, Felucia remained a remote and isolated world, with only a few brave travelers and traders venturing into its dangerous jungles.
Today, Felucia is known for its vibrant and colorful flora, as well as its dangerous wildlife and exotic landscapes, and remains a mysterious and fascinating world.
