Despite its remote location, Rishi boasts a diverse array of landscapes, from lush tropical terrain to towering mountains, deep valleys, and sprawling swamps.
Nestled amidst these natural wonders are the nests of the planet's indigenous inhabitants, the Rishii, a winged species whose homes perch atop the highest peaks of Rishi's mountains.

Other Species like humans had also colonized the planet and made it their home.
They carved out multiple settlements in the planet's deep valleys and established a symbiotic relationship with the Rishii.
While the colonists focus on exploiting the planet's rich fossil fuel resources, particularly Exonium, the Rishii inhabit the mountains, living in harmony with the land and its natural inhabitants.

Despite all the busy work, Rishi still feels calm and beautiful.
Its lush jungles, clear rivers, and stunning views remind us of its wild nature.
Its beautiful landscape and the harmony of its people impact all who come to Rishi.

Rishi's significance extends beyond its natural beauty and hidden mysteries.
It serves as a beacon of hope and sanctuary in a galaxy consumed by conflict and turmoil.
For those seeking refuge from the chaos of war or simply a moment of respite from the struggles of everyday life; Rishi offers a sanctuary like no other, a place where the stars themselves seem to whisper tales of adventure and discovery to those who dare to listen.
