# Overview
Oba Diah, a planet in the Outer Rim Territories, served as the home of the Pyke species.
Positioned at the far end of the Kessel Run, Oba Diah was crucial for the Pyke Syndicate's operations.
The syndicate oversaw the distribution of spice from Kessel, with Oba Diah housing their stronghold where the spice was managed and dispatched to various parts of the galaxy.

# History
During the Invasion of Naboo, Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum dispatched Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas and his aide, Silman, to Oba Diah to resolve a conflict within the Pyke Syndicate.
However, their mission was interrupted, and they were redirected to Felucia.
The Pykes, hired by the Sith, attacked their vessel, resulting in Sifo-Dyas' death and Silman's capture.

Years later, during the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Plo Koon discovered Sifo-Dyas' shuttle on the moon of Oba Diah, prompting an investigation into his disappearance.
The Jedi, with the assistance of former Chancellor Valorum, uncovered a connection between the Pykes and Sifo-Dyas.
Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker were sent to Oba Diah, where they learned that the Pykes were hired by Count Dooku, secretly known as the Sith Lord Tyranus, to kill Sifo-Dyas.
In the ensuing confrontation, Silman was killed, and the Jedi fought against Dooku and the Pykes.
Dooku escaped, but not before killing the Pyke leader, Lom.

In the later stages of the Clone Wars, the Pyke Syndicate, led by Marg Krim, rejected a merger proposal from the Black Sun crime syndicate.
In retaliation, Black Sun kidnapped Krim's family.
Krim enlisted the aid of bounty hunters Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos, who successfully rescued his family.
As a response, Black Sun attacked the Pykes' stronghold on Oba Diah.

After the fall of the Empire, Oba Diah became too dangerous for the spice trade, and the Spice Runners of Kijimi took over much of the Pykes' business.
