# Overview

Twon Ketee, a noxious swamp planet, served as the perilous dwelling for rathtars.

# Description

Twon Ketee, a planet characterized by dense jungles and swamps, served as the habitat for rathtars, fearsome creatures known for their ferocity.
The planet's atmosphere, unfortunately, proved to be toxic, necessitating the use of breath masks by its inhabitants.

# History

In the period leading up to the Battle of Naboo, Twon Ketee became the stage for a fateful encounter.
A group of hunters, led by an alien hunter who had been hired, ventured onto the planet's treacherous terrain, only to meet their demise at the hands of a formidable rathtar.
Unbeknownst to the ill-fated hunters, Darth Maul, the Sith apprentice, silently observed their actions from a distance, biding his time.
When the rathtar was enticed out into the open, Maul swiftly dispatched the creature using a deadly vibro-axe.
Driven by his insatiable thirst for Jedi blood, Maul proceeded to eliminate several more of these fearsome creatures.
Later on, Twon Ketee gained significance in a different context.
It found its place as one of the marked locations on a holo-map belonging to the First Order, a map that was obtained by Kazuda Xiono, a determined Resistance spy, during his critical mission aboard the Colossus.
