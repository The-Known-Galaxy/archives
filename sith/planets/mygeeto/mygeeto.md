# Description

Mygeeto was a cold, crystalline planet, located in the Outer Rim territories in the Albarrio sector, and was the homeworld of the Lurmen species.
This planet was discovered 7 000 BBY and was one of the most desired planets to its contenders.
Additionally, Mygeeto had two moons orbiting it and a breathable atmosphere alongside one sun called Malola.

# History

Mygeeto was controlled by the intergalactic banking clan alongside the Confederacy of Independent systems.
Before the beginning of the Clone Wars, this planet was researched by pantoran scientist Cuata.
However, Mygeeto would soon be in danger causing Tee Watt Kaaâ€™s Lurmen tribe to abandon it in order to avoid any bloodshed.
The third battle of Mygeeto began in 19 BBY during the Clone Wars era which was a conflict between the Confederacy of Independent systems and the Galactic Republic.
During this conflict, General Grievous brought a group of separatist droids and was assisted by Colonel Coburn Sear who had previously escaped being captured by the Republic.
Two Jedi were sent to confront the separatists and eradicate their droids in hopes of reducing separatist influence within the planet.
