# Overview

Planet Lothal was located in the Outer Rim Territories and was established as a trade route for the Galactic Empire and other organizations.
During the early years of the Galactic Empire, Lothal was currently in a state of economic neglect and offered a deal for the Empire to take full ownership of the planet’s industries, at the cost of the promise of security and riches.
The citizens of Lothal had many doubts and worries about the Empire taking over planet Lothal and instead attempted an insurgency which failed.
Around 5 BBY when Lothal was growing in success due to the Empire’s reign over the planet, Lothal had become a nesting ground for the Spectres, a small group of republic alliance rebels that operated the Starship Ghost.
After persistently attacking the Imperial forces and impeding Imperial activities for a year or more, they eventually caught the attention of Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin, however, they were unsuccessful in eliminating the rebels.
Darth Vader manufactured a blockade on the planet, but the rebels of the Spectres slipped through these blockades and regrouped with the alliance.

After the rebellion, events that had occurred would also spark up a prison revolt which led to the escape of numerous prisoners, including the former governor Ryder Azadi who was discharged and arrested due to treason, he would then proceed to activate another rebel cell on Lothal before continuing his escape.
The Imperial blockade has become an uncertain situation and caused severe obstacles for Princess Leia Organa to embark on a mercy mission to Lothal.
However, this mission was a deception for Princess Organa to deliver ships to the rebellion.
Now in 2 BBY, the rebellion made Ryder Azadi’s successor, governor Arihnda Pryce formally request Grand Admiral Thrawn and his Seventh Fleet to arrive on planet Lothal to support the Empire with the ongoing rebellion at hand.
Ryder Azadi’s efforts in demolishing Imperial vehicles around the Imperial Armory have drawn Grand Admiral Thrawn’s attention.

During 1 BBY, planet Lothal was under constant heavy Imperial blockade and employment, with her once immaculate environment ruined and on the verge of collapsing.
Nearly all traces of natural resources had been strictly removed from the planet.
Immense pollution covering the planet started becoming visible from orbit.
Although the will of resistance remained, the planet was under Imperial control and those who remained and had not joined the Empire by free will were either forcefully deployed into service or executed.
This chaos created the opportunity for a group of rebels under the leadership of the Spectres to make a daring move which managed to eradicate the Imperial presence on and around Lothal.
For some time, the planet’s citizens lived out of fear and concern that the Empire one day might return to claim it once again, but the Empire was now disrupted by the Rebel Alliance and Lothal remained as a world with freedom for the rest of the Galactic Civil War.

Around 35 ABY, planet Lothal was now directly under the control of the First Order, the Galactic Empire’s successor.
Ensuing the Battle of Exegol, Lothal was included with several other systems that rebelled against the First Order.
