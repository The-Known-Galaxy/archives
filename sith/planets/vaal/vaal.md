# Overview

The Outer Rim Territories' Gordian Reach contained the warm, green planet Vaal.
Large savannas predominated the planet, which was also home to various fearsome predators.

# History

Sergeant Reybn served as the commander of the outlying Imperial Relay Outpost V-798, which was situated on the planet in 0 BBY.
Being the closest Imperial outpost near the Yavin system, V-798 was noteworthy.
Vaal's orbit crossed paths with a number of dangerous asteroid fields.

Darth Vader was forced to crash-land on the planet when his modified TIE Advanced x1 was damaged during the Battle of Yavin.
Vader traveled to V-798, but a gang of vicious Hyenax attacked and cut short his quest.
After killing several of them, including their leader, he gained their respect and rose to the position of pack leader.
Lord Vader later rescued the group from a different beast.
The three stormtroopers at the outpost were finally taken to Coruscant on a Lambda-class shuttle, but not before he had abandoned them and allowed his Hyenax pack to kill them.
