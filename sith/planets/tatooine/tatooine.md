# Overview
Tatooine: the desert world that everyone loves to hate.
This notorious planet in the Outer Rim was home to hardy folks who worked day and night farming moisture for a living, plus dealing scrap metal and selling used equipment on its 5709-DC Shipping Lane spur of the Triellus Trade Route connecting it with civilization via Corellian Run - if you could call such an infamous spot civilized!
But despite being perceived as “the cesspool” by most galactic citizens, Tatooine would still go down in history for playing important roles throughout time.

# Geology
Tatooine was a scorching desert home to some of the oldest civilizations in known space, where two suns illuminated breathtaking sandscapes and giant standing
stones.
Settlers warned that gazing upon its arid flatlands with too much intensity may burn out one's eyes faster than looking directly into the double star system!



# Inhabitants
Tatooine, the desert planet populated by a diverse host of species from all corners of the galaxy.
Most residents loved nothing more than making friendly wagers on anything and everything - especially podracing before it fell out of favor with the rise of The Empire.
Evidence suggests that this lawless world has long been dominated by Hutts as humans native to Tatoonie are known for their uncommon last names like Fardreamer, Sandskimmer, Darklighter and most famously Skywalker!
