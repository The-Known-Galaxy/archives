# Overview
Ilum was a planet that held the extremely rare Kyber Crystal; the planet was held as a sacred planet for the Jedi Order, as Kyber Crystals were used to power their lightsabers.

# Information & History
Ilum was in the 7G sector of the Unknown Regions, with a star named Asar.
Home to a Kyber Crystal line planetary core, Jedi Younglings would go to Ilum to harvest their Kyber Crystal and construct their lightsabers.
After the collapse of the Republic and Jedi Order in 19 BBY, Jedi Padawan and outcast in exile Ahsoka Tano visited the planet.
The Kyber Crystals no longer sang to her like they did in the Clone Wars, as the planet was being mined out by the Empire to build their super-massive planet-destroying space station, the Death Star.
Following the collapse of the Empire, its successor state, the First Order, used the planet as a system-destroying super weapon with its new name, Starkiller Base.
It was then destroyed by the Resistance after the destruction of the Hosnian System and the New Republic.



# Description
Ilum’s frigid surface was what came to be the Kyber Crystal Caves of Ilum, which brought the Jedi Order to the planet to perform their sacred rite of passage for their younglings to harvest the crystals needed for their lightsabers.

Ilum’s Kyber Crystals were naturally attuned to the light side of the Force, and when a Jedi Youngling harvested a crystal, its color would be decided by the harvester’s connection to the Force at the period in time.
The Jedi Temple on Ilum remained the only sign of life on Ilum.
Additionally, it had one unique hyperspace route, from the core world of Metellos to Ilum, but it was kept secret to the galaxy.
Eventually, all mentions of Ilum were deleted from local and Galactic Star maps.

The Jedi Temple on Ilum was hidden by a large cliff of ice, making it indistinguishable from the countless other large cliffs of ice plains of the planet.
