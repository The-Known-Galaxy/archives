# Overview

Lol was a planet known for its extremely dull, boring, and lifeless characteristics.
It was found after a starship pilot crash-landed on the planet, where he shortly after discovered a special ore on the planet that could be used to assist in Durasteel making.
Thinking of the riches he could claim behind this planet, he decided to try and claim the planet, where he named it after the god of death.
Unfortunately for him though, a much larger mining company heard of this planet and ended up claiming it through domination, where they began mining immediately.
The mining company set up multiple cities that ran mines.
These cities would often fight over mining claims and sometimes these quarrels even ended in physical combat.

During the period of the Mandalorian Wars, a Jedi under the name of Revan led his own fleet into this planet, where he then requested food and supplies for his fleet in exchange for modern technology.
Due to the leaders of this planet's greed, many of the resources on the planet were depleting after giving them to Revan.
This led to riots and outbursts from minors on the planet, which forced the leaders to think fast.
In the end, the miners just received more money and a better living area, which satisfied them.
