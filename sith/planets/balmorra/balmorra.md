# Overview

Balmorra was a planet that housed someof of the best droid manufacturing machines and factories, which made it one of the most important planets to the Republic.
Balmorra started as a planet for the Humanbarine colonies and was one of the colony planets that declared independence, Where it then rapidly bacame oneof the galaxy's best battle droid manufacturers.
It is located in the Balmorra system in between the Colonies and the Core Worlds.
Balmorra had lots of minerals, especially iron.
The majority of the planet was covered by industrial wastelands.
Balmorra’s economy grew primarily from selling weapons and manufacturing droids.
There were still wide spreads of urban districts such as the capital Bin Prime.
The downside of these areas was that the Balmorran metal parasites ate the metals.
Another common thing was the Balmorran flu, which is thought to have originated from Balmorra.
Balmorra joined the Galactic Republic and was an essential battle site for the war between Leviathans and the Dark Jedi.
The reconstituted Sith Empire attempted to seize the planet because of their droids and weapons manufacturers.
The Republic quickly sent a team to prevent this from happening but failed.
The Sith’s influence over the planet began to spread until the Treaty of Coruscant was signed.
The Eternal Empire sent an assault team to Balmorra and captured the weapon factories.
Balmorra produced some of the Speratist’s B1 series battle droids due to the Republic’s attempt to close the factories.
After the fall of the Separatists, Balmorra joined the Galactic Empire and supplied weapons to the Empire such as the AT-ST walkers.
This was stopped once the powerful Jedi, Luke Skywalker, and the Rogue Squadron destroyed most of the weapon factories that were under construction.
A few years later, Balmorra’s Senator offered any turbolasers and shields so they could gain protection from the Senate.
