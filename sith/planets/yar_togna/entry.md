# Description

Yar Togna, located in the Outer Rim Territories and the Trailing Sectors, was a planet known for its unique geological features.
Intense fault-line pressure produced rare crystalline elements vital for sensor array manufacturing.
The landscape comprised a vast volcanic mountain range, lava channels, and mountain springs.
The planet's atmosphere was dense, high-pressured, and oxygen-poor, with the constant release of sulfur and ash from the volcanoes creating a foul-smelling and toxic environment.
However, float-jellies, large gasbag-like creatures, consumed the ash, preventing the planet from entering a deep freeze.
The float-jellies secreted substances on their backs, enabling the growth of valuable mosses, molds, and mushrooms by the Tognath species.

# Overview

Yar Togna, an Outer Rim Territories planet, was inhabited by the Tognath species.
This high-gravity world possessed a dense, oxygen-poor atmosphere and boasted a striking volcanic mountain range.
The volcanoes constantly spewed sulfur and ash into the air, but their impact was mitigated by the presence of float-jellies, large floating creatures that consumed the airborne particles.
This symbiotic relationship prevented Yar Togna's climate from turning frigid and ensured its habitability.

The Tognath, an ancient insecto-mammalian species, called Yar Togna their home.
With subpar hearing and a limited sense of balance, the Tognath often relied on cybernetic enhancements, particularly when venturing beyond their planet.
They primarily worked as miners, extracting valuable crystals crucial for sensor array manufacturing.
Additionally, the Tognath engaged in float-jelly farming, cultivating mosses, molds, and mushrooms that served as highly sought-after exports in the wider galaxy.

However, the planet's fate took a dark turn around 10 BBY when the Galactic Empire invaded and conquered Yar Togna.
The Empire sought to exploit the planet's strategic crystal deposits and enslaved the Tognath population.
This oppressive occupation triggered a mass exodus of Tognath refugees, including notable individuals like Benthic and Edrio, who became part of anti-Imperial resistance groups.
