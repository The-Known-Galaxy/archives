# Description

Located in the Saleucami system within the Suolriep sector, the planet Saleucami harbored an arid climate and possessed a variety of landforms like deserts, swamps, and forests.
This Outer Rim planet had a name that meant “oasis,” and not only housed a major Clone Wars battle, but later an invasion for control of an outpost located near a major hyperspace route.

# Clone Wars History

Although the locals of Saleucami avoided conflict, war was eventually brought to the planet.
Former clone trooper Cut Lawquane was the only survivor of his gunship squad after the rest of his brothers were executed by droids.
He fled and married Suu Lawquane, acting as a father figure for her two children.
Captain Rex of the 501st discovered Cut after his men left him at their farm to recover from a major sniper wound.
Rex initially thought about reporting him to the Republic, but changed his mind after fighting against commando droids with Cut and seeing the love for his family.

Separatist General Grievous took the captive Jedi Master Eeth Koth to Saleucami with the hopes of baiting Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to engage him.
Although Skywalker and Adi Gallia were able to save Koth, Grievous fled from his duel with Kenobi, and crashed in an escape pod into the Saleucami wetlands due to debris hitting his light destroyer.
Even with resistance from the 501st and 212th legions hunting down the functioning escape pods, Grievous was able to find one and flee the battle.

Commander Mekedrix and 91st Mobile Reconnaissance Corps were a part of another major invasion that the Separatists launched on Saleucami.
Supreme Chancellor Palpatine dubbed this planet a member of the Triad of Evil due to its importance to the Separatists.
The Republic gained a victory over the Siege of Saleucami caused by rumors of a secret CIS project after a lengthy campaign.
Sadly when Darth Sidious began Order 66 Jedi Master Stass Allie was killed by Commander Neyo while on her BARC speeder.

# Imperial Rule

Clone troopers remained on Saleucami even after the Empire’s initial formation to protect its interests and to enforce control.
Citizens were forced to register for chain codes to leave the planet, and had their ships impounded.
Around this time, Rex traveled and warned Lawquane of these developments and found Cut had plans to immediately leave.
The Bad Batch arrived to question Cut on how he remained hidden since they were all fugitives now, but soon after they all had to escape due to Imperial crackdowns.
