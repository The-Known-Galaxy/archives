# Overview
The planet of Tauber was a planet that specialized in medicine.
Tauber was widely regarded as the most important area for medicine in the galaxy.
During the Bordal Contagion outbreak, medical researchers on Tauber would go on to create an antidote that would later be distributed to the Rseik Sector, the area that was affected by the outbreak.
While Tauber was primarily a medically-focused planet, there were also other industries that thrived on the planet.
Neuro-Saav Corporation managed material-design laboratories on Tauber.
The hospitals on the planet are useful in everyday care, but as demonstrated in the past they also are useful for containing deadly outbreaks.
