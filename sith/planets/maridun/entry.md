# Overview

Maridun was a planet situated in the Rolion sector in the Outer Rim territories specifically, on grid Q-6 on the Standard Galactic grid.
Its natural stance was moderate and lush despite the ecosystem being demanding to adapt to, including the treacherous predators.
There were large and grassy open areas where tremendous seed pods grew.
The life that roamed the planet seemed to show no desire to take on travelers or explorers from an antagonistic perspective.
The earth also nurtured a breathable atmosphere.
The surface formed waves of different-shaped stones that formed a grassland pattern.
The grass was very tall and could grow up to two meters high.
It illogically grew massive trees in the middle of the grasslands.
The treesâ€™ roots were deeply buried in the ground and the tree trunks grew together and merged into one main tree in the middle.
Water that was meant to be preserved for later was often found near these areas.

# History

The planet was the homeworld of the Amanin species who were seen to hunt the Charnoqs.
The world was inhabited by the Mastiff Phalones who were harmful critters roaming the fields.
The planet went unharmed for the majority of galactic history due to its lack of natural resources to be sold to the rest of the markets.
It did, however, house a large excess of grass.

During the Clone Wars, the Lurmen escapees built their village on the planet to settle away from the events of the war and the eyes of either party.
During the battle of Quell, Republic survivors who were involved crash-landed on the planet and encountered the Lurmen village.
The village had also met Separatist General Lok Durd, who wanted to ally with them to discreetly sample a weapon called the Defoliator.
The villagers realized that the Separatist General had betrayed them, so the Jedi shielded them in that case.
They rallied up the villagers, despite them being pacifists.
Together, they made the weapon dysfunctional and captured the general.
