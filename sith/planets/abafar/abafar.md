# Description
Abafar was a hot desert world located in the Sprizen sector within the Outer Rim.
It was a very bland planet with nothing as far as the eye can see, quite featureless besides a few urban settlements.
Although the planet couldn't be seen by the naked eye from space, the Galactic Republic's scanners could see it.
While it was a desert planet, it had some water and one of the few suppliers of a like-oil material called Rhydonium.
The town Pons Ora was built below surface level and was known for digging and mining out the rare oil Rhydonium.
This planet was not well populated but did play home to the immigrants, including the Aleena, Aqualish, Dug, Human, Sullustan and an unidentified tentacle-faced species.

Due to the atmosphere being thin, the reflection of the sun made the sky orange, and the white dust on the ground made the air dusty.
Abafar, due to its lack of biodiversity, had a species of flightless birds, Void Striders, that traveled in packs but were not bothered by droids or other species.

# History
At around 20 BBY, the Galactic Republic's D-Squad, led by Meebur Gascon, crashed on Abafar after following a lost trade shuttle.
Afterwards, Meebur had an outbreak of lunacy, forcing all the droids to go by themselves.
The rest of the D-squad found the town Pons Ora; they found a clone commando that led them to a Separatist's base so they could steal a shuttle and escape the vacant planet of Abafar.
