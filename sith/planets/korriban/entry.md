# Introduction

Korriban was a planet home to the Sith species, housing a variety of traditions and philosophies throughout history located in the Outer Rim Territories within the Esstran Sector, specifically among the Sith Worlds.
Being a terrestrial planet with a cold and dry climate, Korriban’s landscapes consisted of a series of deserts, canyons, and an abundance of mountains.
The planet of Korriban was well known for its mass graveyard consisting of many tombs of different Dark Lords (The Valley of The Dark Lords) throughout ancient history such as Maraka Ragnos, Naga Sadow, Tulak Hord, Ajunta Pall, Ludo Kressh, and Jaden Korr as well as its native species, the Sith.
This foundation for Sith would see the start and end of many battles, wars, victories, losses, and other forms of discovery as well as ancient history within the Sith for all of its time.

# Ancient Times

In 27,700 BBY, The Rakata, a humanoid species that was highly advanced in technology would eventually choose to invade the planet of Korriban in hopes of adopting the planet into the Infinite Empire for the purpose of enslaving its beings to do work for Rakatan outlines.
Their attempts were futile as they would be excised by the Sith King Adas who forced them to flee with the assistance of his people.
This successful battle attempt to drive off the Rakata would lead to the death of Adas which would cause chaos and disorganization upon the societies and principles of the Sith.
Due to concerns about being invaded once more, the remaining Sith would choose to relocate to other worlds that met their necessities for Sith alchemy and Dark Side power such as Ziost.

# Foundation of the Sith Empire

Within the date of 6900 BBY, Korriban would also serve to create the first Sith Empire.
Following the exile of a multitude of Dark Jedi that grew attached and curious with the Dark Side of The Force and its nature, they would flee in search of a planet that harnessed great Dark Side energy, this planet being Korriban.
Upon arriving on Korriban, the Dark Jedi demonstrated extreme prowess with the usage of The Force.
This would impress the native Sith even the very King that ruled them known as Hakagram Graush.
It is for these reasons that the Sith were deceived by the Dark Jedi, being easily impressed and essentially praising them for their power.
This set of events would lead to the rise of a new Sith’ari, known as Ajunta Pall.
Though, the Sith would still see many benefits in technology and other forms of biological advancement through interbreeding with the Dark Jedi.
With his status as the newer Dark Lord, Ajunta Pall established a Sith Empire.
The term, “Sith” would no longer refer to the primary inhabitant species on Korriban, rather it would evolve into a term used to identify and refer to any Force Sensitive that was strong in and practiced the Dark Side of The Force.

# Notable Affiliations:

There was a multitude of different factions, groups, tribes, empires, and other affiliates that used Korriban as their homestead throughout history.
The Brotherhood of Darkness would utilize Korriban to establish an Academy to train their followers, one of these followers being Darth Bane himself.
Yet another group to use Korriban and its contents for beneficial Sith progression were the Disciples of Ragnos, a cult dedicated to worshiping and practicing the ancient teachings of the Dark Lord Marka Ragnos.
