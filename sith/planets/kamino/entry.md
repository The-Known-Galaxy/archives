# Overview

Located in the Outer Rim, Kamino is an aquatic planet, home to Kaminoans.
These Kaminoans are tall, long-necked, slender-like beings.
The Kaminoans lived in cities held by poles under water.
These cities are in the shape of a circle with ascending and descending levels inside.
The majority of these cities were homes to some of the best cloning technology.

# Section 1

With the Kaminoans’ technology, this later led to the Clone Army's creation by the donor named Jango Fett for the Galactic Republic.
With this, the Kaminoans started getting to work.
They began to make millions of clones for the Galactic Republic and were making a decent amount of money in exchange.
These clones were well-trained and were put in different specializations such as medics, arc troopers, marksmen, anti-tank troopers, etc.

# Section 2

While chasing the bounty hunter Jango Fett, Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered the isolated planet Kamino.
Erased from the Jedi archives by Count Dooku, Dooku did this to cover up the Sith’s objectives.
With this knowledge, Kenobi informed the Jedi Council.
Even though he informed them, the mastermind deceived them all and Order 66 eventually occurred during the ending of the Clone Wars.
While Jedi would go to Kamino to view the clones’ progress, the Kaminoans always informed the Sith of their arrival and what had happened.
