# Overview

Located in the Raioballo Sector, Dantooine was a terrestrial planet that was ruled under a largely Imperial rule, though also having a past with the Galactic Republic.
This planet had two moons and was also the fourth planet in orbit of its sun Dina.
A few Kyber Crystals were found in the past here, and it once housed a Jedi Temple.
Dantooine has a history in eras like the Clone Wars, the Galactic Civil War, and the Rise of the First Order.
Despite its prominent appearances in history, Dantooine was not a well-developed planet and had a low population.
This is due to its stagnant position in the galaxy and its lack of useful resources.

# Terrain and Planetary Features

Dantooine was an extremely grass-filled planet with lots of natural features.
It was a beautiful planet with features like rivers, hills, plains, and lakes.
It was a dense planet with a dry climate.
Dantooine was home to many animals, and a large number of plants, specifically Blba trees, allowed many herbivores to thrive.
Although it has an extremely dry climate, it has a short wet season that brings massive rainstorms, often causing fertile soil to run off and tinting the brown grass into a purple shade.
Just a few of the animals you might find on Dantooine include Stalker Lizard, Graul, and Kath Hound.
Unfortunately, the animal population would decline as many of the animals were captured as guards or pets.

# Brief Overview of History

During the Clone Wars era, Dantooine hosted mainly small farmers who utilized the fertile soil.
During the war, though, the Confederacy of Independent Systems arrived on Dantooine in search of ancient artifacts.
The Galactic republic did not buy this claim, and in rebellion sent Mace Windu and his legion to respond.
It was a close fight, but despite Windu losing many of his soldiers, he still achieved victory in the end.

During the massive war with the Resistance, the First Order occupied a blockade on Dantooine.
Venisa Dose, the Resistance Commander, sent out a squad to invade the blockade and destroy their TIE Fighter fleet.
Three Resistance Shuttles attempted to meet up, but were ambushed by a fleet of First Order Fighters.
Only two managed to escape, but as they went off-planet, one of the Shuttles was destroyed by a TIE Fighter pilot.
