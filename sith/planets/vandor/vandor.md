# Overview

Vandor was a cold planet located in the Sloo sector of the Mid Rim.
The Galactic Empire has a strong presence on this planet and would be part of much of its history.
This planet had two moons and a breathable atmosphere, though it was very cold and contained a large amount of mountains and such.

The planet was discovered by a Republic Scout and was surveyed by Arhul centuries ago.
The planet was named Vandor as a reference to an ancient poem made about exploration.
The planet would be claimed by the empire after Imperial Troopers captured Lando's ship and took it to an impound on Vandor.
Despite its breathable atmosphere, Vandor was not home to many animals and was sparsely settled.
This is due mainly to the technological infrastructure present on other worlds.
The terrain consisted of many famous snowy mountains, and also had Fort Ypso.
