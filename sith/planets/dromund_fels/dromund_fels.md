# Introduction
Dromund Fels was an arid planet that settled the fourth planet in the Dromund system, which is a system in the Sith Worlds.
This planet was in the Outer Rim Territories and was orbited by one moon and sun.

Surprisingly, this arid planet could sustain life.

# HISTORY/DISCOVERINGS
Dromund Fels was ruled by the time of the Old Sith Empire before its collapse.
Before 3954 BBY, this planet was reclaimed by the reconstituted Sith Empire.
Darth Igrol, a sith pureblood, decided to reside in his homeworld on Dromund Fels instead of the Empire's capital of Dromund Kaas, Kaas City.
Although he did not live long, because shortly after he got executed by the Emperor during a meeting in the Imperial Citadel.

Before 3678 BBY, Darth Marr found the lightsaber of the mighty Sith Tulak Hord on the planet.

Over time, Dromund Fels became the site of several excavations by the members of the Imperial Reclamation Service who found Sith artifacts and treasures from the excavations.
Rebels that opposed the empire were operating on this planet alongside some allies during the Cold War and showing a compelling criminal presence.
