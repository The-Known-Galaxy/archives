# Overview

Paloma was a terrestrial planet in the Outer Rim, inhabited by several immigrated species, most of which were human.
However, Fibra-Bot droids were in power, ruling over its people with an unforgiving stance.
Having previously opened the arid wastelands to visitors, the droids later confiscated their property, stranding them on the planet as permanent citizens.
The sands that covered the landscape had no use for the dwellers and were native to aggressive creatures like the Womp rat and Krayt dragon species.
Those who chose to journey on through the deserts often used Dewbacks.
A prominent city was Prosir, home to the Fungus Hotel and a spaceport, inviting traders of the galaxy.
Sand would often soil droids’ mechanical parts.
Yet, droid components were major exports, bartered in exchange for people’s rations and technology.
Nothing else is known about Paloma.
