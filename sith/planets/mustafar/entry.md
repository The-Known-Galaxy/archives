# Introduction |

Mustafar is a planet that orbits the Mustafar System located at the Outer Rim.
It orbits the star called Pirate, alongside the following planets: Schada, Jestefad, Lefrani, and Rietta.
The planet is a volcanic world where a certain type of lava was mined as natural resources.
It was also a place where individuals disposed of evidence they did not wish the public to see; which is something that drew the Black Sun Syndicate’s attention and prompted its habituation & usage.
Mustafar was known for being the Separatist’s last capital before their official defeat; an incident that affected the course of history.
This planet was where Darth Maul began his training with Darth Sidious and where Obi-Wan Kenobi fought against the newly titled Darth Vader, where the Sith Lord was severely burnt and severed.

# History |

Mustafar was previously not a planet filled with volcanic components.
It was a beautiful green planet that housed a Jedi Enclave that was built in 5,300 BBY.
During this time, Jedi Master Chu-Gon Dar developed a sentient artifact known as the Chu-Gon Dar cube, where its user could harness, use and alter the physical Force.
Unfortunately, the planet’s beauty and harmony did not last long, as Sith invaded Mustafar in 3,996 BBY to exterminate all inhabiting Jedi.
This led to the Battle of Mustafar; one of the many conflicts within the Great Sith War, in which a gas giant was pulled into the atmosphere and caused environmental hazards, and forced the Jedi to abandon their Enclave.

Many years later, a dangerous eruption destroyed almost all Mustafarian settlements, as well as its overall green environment; therefore transforming it into the volcanic planet it currently is.

# Inhabitants

The planet of Mustafar was inhabited by the Mustafarians; a species of sentient insectoids.
The Mustafarians were divided into two different subspecies, which were the following: Northern Mustafarians–the tallest and thinnest– and the Southern Mustafarians–smallest and roughest–.
Due to their physical appearances, both subspecies contained different roles in society.
Aside from the Mustafarians, factions like the Black Sun, the Blackguard, and the Sith often inhabited Mustafar but were isolated within their structures.
