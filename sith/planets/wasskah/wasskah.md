# Description
Wasskah is a Trandoshan moon filled with islands that contain thorny and condensed forests.
Located in the Kashyyyk system, Wasskah orbits the planet Trandosha which is in the Mid Rim’s Mytaranor system.
The atmosphere was breathable to multiple different kinds of sentient species like Twi’leks and Cereans, and long beaches surrounding the islands.
Rancor bramble encompassed most of the forests, which housed several different species like Convors (owls) and Momongs which were like Trandoshan monkeys.

# History
During the Clone Wars, this moon was owned by Garnac’s hunting guild.
This organization was filled with Trandoshans eager to capture and kill inhabitants brought from other worlds.
These hunters would specifically target weaker and less experienced opponents to kidnap as they did it entirely for pleasure.
Island Four was primarily used for this activity, and Padawan Ahsoka Tano was mistakenly brought here as prey for the hunters to kill.
Upon exploring the island Tano also discovered multiple Jedi younglings who were captured, and later found the Wookiee Chewbacca from the wreckage of a prisoner ship they attacked.
After taking one of the Trandoshans hostage and receiving help from Wookiee warrior General Tarrful, the group was able to escape.
One of the Jedi younglings was unfortunately killed prior to their escape.
