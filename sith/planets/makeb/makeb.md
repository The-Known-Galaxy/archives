# Overview
Makeb is an oceanic planet located on the fringes of Hutt space.
Its surface is riddled with stone pillars, plains, and many cave systems.
Makeb’s low gravity allows for the formation of the large stone pillars and intricate cave systems, which many of the planet's native creatures use as shelter.
These cave systems are also home to many mineral deposits from which many people on Makeb claim their wealth.
One of these minerals, Isotope-5, is an extremely valuable and rare mineral and was the reason for the Hutt invasion in the year 3638 BBY, who used the mineral for the creation of powerful war droids, weapons, and shields.

# Early History
Makeb was first discovered sometime during the Mandalorian Wars when refugees on a Republic Transport Ship crashed onto the planet's surface.
These refugees, led by businessman Semako Thalien, built settlements on top of Makeb’s stone pillars and explored its surface, discovering many mineral deposits.
Over time, the settlers would begin to mine these deposits, and the planet, as well as the early settlers, became extremely wealthy once communication was established with the rest of the galaxy.
For much of its known history, Makeb remained independent from the Republic and was filled with prosperity and much economic investment from foreign corporations and wealthy business people.
Much of the planet's prosperity can be attributed to the Avesta Family, who played a major role in establishing a government and creating trade deals between the Hutts and Republic.
The planet boomed in tourism and the Capital, Talaos City, became an economic and cultural center for the people of Makeb.



# Hutt Invasion
In 3638 BBY, taking advantage of the Republic’s war with the Sith Empire, the Hutt Cartel invaded Makeb.
The defensive forces of Makeb, made up entirely of the Interstellar Regulator's mercenaries, were bought off by the Hutt Cartel and the planet was easily conquered.
Following the invasion, the Republic came to the aid of the planet after many of its leaders agreed to join the Republic and was able to push the Hutts off of the planet.
Unfortunately, the Hutt's invasion also came with increased mining, destabilizing the planet's core, and, believing that the planet was lost, the Republic evacuated the planet.
However, during the invasion, the empire had secretly worked to stabilize the planet's core in hopes of mining Isotope-5.
While the Empire's efforts did not prevent the planet from becoming inhospitable, they were able to continue mining Isotope-5 for their own agenda and were able to keep the Republic unaware of their continued mining on the planet.
