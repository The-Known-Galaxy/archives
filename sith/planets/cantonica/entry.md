# Overview

Cantonica was a planet home to the Canto Bight, a city for extremely wealthy tourists, gamblers, and war profiteers.
This planet was located within the Cantonica system and was a mostly desert planet.
This planet was visited by Resistance members Rose Tico, Finn, and BB-8, when they were on a mission to find the hacker able to remove the hyperspace tracker put on the resistance ship by the First Order.
A multicolored nebula is able to be seen from this planet, and it was located on the shores of the Sea of Cantonica, which was a completely fabricated and manmade ocean constructed to be the largest ocean in the galaxy.
The cost of this ocean was incredibly high, and its presence caused the lower altitude sectors of the planet to grow in a damp and moist environment.
