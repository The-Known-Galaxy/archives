# Description
Rodia’s tropical and humid climate allowed the local fauna to thrive as it perfectly suited the swampy jungles and oceans.
With its four moons and location between the Outer and Mid Rim borders, Rodia solidified itself as a hotspot for travelers to obtain supplies and utilize the nearby Corellian Run hyperroute.
The primary sentient beings on this planet, Rodians, created cities with large domes that provided protection and allowed vehicles to pass through.
Rodia was a part of the Tyrius system, which housed five total planets, and oceans covered a majority of its surface like the Wesessa Sea.
Jungles, swamps, and thick forests were what the solid landmasses exhibited if they were not already encased in water.

# Republic Era
After noticing the benefits of aligning with the Galactic Republic, Rodia pledged themselves to the Republic around 15,000 BBY.
The Grand Protector, leader of Rodia, also allowed Rodian hunters to pursue morally corrupt careers like bounty hunting and slaving due to this unification.


During the Clone Wars Era, Rodian citizens began to starve.
Due to pirates destroying relief supply ships to Rodia, Senator Onaconda Farr made a tough decision to trick his former ally, Padmé Amidala.
Luring her to Rodia, he handed Amidala over to Trade Federation viceroy, Nute Gunray, with the hopes of securing a supplies deal since the Republic’s efforts failed.
After realizing Gunray’s intentions were to kill her and delay the shipments with no guarantees that the deal would be fulfilled, he allowed Amidala to escape.
Gunray was arrested for his crimes and convoys were later delivered with food to save the citizens.


Darth Sidious also hired Bounty hunter Cad Bane to steal a force-sensitive child on Rodia, with the hopes of using the Dark Side to experiment on them.
Luckily Obi-Wan Kenobi 
was there to protect the child, and the plot was thwarted.



# Imperial Rule
Even before the official beginning of the Galactic Civil War, Rodia was under complete Imperial occupation.
Those who opposed and fought against the control were secretly recruited by the Rebel Alliance.
Luke Skywalker took an opulent yacht, the Desert Jewel, to the Betu continent on Rodia with hopes of recruiting the Chekkoo clan.
These Rodians were extremely skilled at manufacturing weapons and crafting armor, and they despised the rival Chattza clan for their allegiance to the Empire.
Luke also discovered the presence of Rodian Jedi Huulik, who he honored after learning of his death during Order 66.
