# Overview

Vashka was a warm planet in Outer Rim, native to sentient Vashkans.
The terrain had undergone some change to accommodate the settlers.
Previously dangerous forests dense with flora were replaced with ferns, palm trees and sunburst flowers.
Accompanying the plant life in the past, megafauna were hunted down for the safety of the inhabitants, leaving only a few to survive, like the sizeable venomous insect Vashkan apidactyls.
Vashkan City was the most renowned location; the metropolis housed a prominent medcenter and spaceport.
Interplanetary trade links are assumed to be possible due to the world’s intersection with the Llanic Spice Run.
Additionally, most small towns were located within proximity to the seas.

# History

At the end of the Imperial Era, many former and injured stormtroopers were retired by the New Republic, some of which ended up in the Vashka Valley Retirement Facility 48.
An example is a former captain, Jor Tribulus, who bounty hunter Bazine Netal sought to receive his steel case sometime between 17 and 34 ABY.
However, this site was forced to shut down when infested by a hive of apidactyls, leading to its staff being evacuated and the retiree’s death.
