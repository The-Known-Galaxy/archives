# Introduction |

Dromund Kaas is the third planet located within the Dromund System, which is a star system located in the Sith Worlds region within the Outer Rim.
It contained two moons that orbited the star named Dromund and are located between the planets Jaguada and Brothsida, should an individual take the Kamat Krote hyperspace route.
Its atmosphere is so heavily charged and dependent on electricity, that lightning became constant ever since the Sith Emperor arrived and began conducting experiments with the Dark Side of the Force.
These experiments also led to Kaas being surrounded by dark side energy, making its temples have strong force nexuses.
Although it contains a wet and humid climate, the atmosphere is quite stable and breathable for its inhabitants.

# Environment |

During the Great Hyperspace War against the Galactic Republic, Kaas was only covered with jungles and oceans.
This changed when the Sith Empire arrived on the planet in 4980 BBY, where they fought against the vicious fauna and tamed the jungles to establish a society.
After that, the capital Kaas City and other locations were created, whilst the vast majority of the planet’s environment remained in jungles, oceans, and swamps.

Centuries after the Galactic War, Dromund Kaas’ jungles began to disappear while swamps and marshes began to increase; therefore submerging the majority of the planet’s ground.
This led to massive dark-wooded trees growing in the swamps and further led to the formation of canyon-like groupings that grew infested with lizard-like creatures.

# Capital of the Sith Empire |

Originally, Dromund Kaas was a Sith colonized planet, where Sorzus Syn was known to commonly visit while the Empire controlled it in 5,000 BBY.
During this period, Kaas’ location was lost and therefore abandoned by the Sith.

Once the Great Hyperspace Wars ended, Vitiate ordered his followers to locate a planet that can be used as a haven for the damaged Sith Empire.
This led to Dromund Kaas’ rediscovery, as Vitiate manipulated the remaining followers of the Empire into a twenty-year-long pilgrimage that ended in 4,980 BBY, where thanks to Vitiate’s “advice”, Kaas was “discovered”.

Once at Kaas’ surface, Vitiate rebuilt the Sith Empire as its leader, swearing that he will take revenge against the Galactic Republic due to the Great Hyperspace War’s aftermath.
With the help of his Dark Council, they conquered Dromund Kaas and established their new homeworld, and began improving their overall strength & power.

# Fall of the Empire |

In 3,640 BBY, the Dromund Kaas Operation mission was carried out by the Jedi Order, to create a diversion so that the Jedi Hero and his companions could infiltrate the planet’s capital and kill the Emperor.
When landing in the Dark Temple–a site where spirits were housed and where Emperor Vitiate conducted his experiments–the Hero turned the mission into a success, by killing the Emperor’s Voice and forcing Vitiate into hibernation.
This outcome made the Dark Council take full leadership of the Sith Empire; under the command of Darth Marr.

Kaas’ leadership was once again jeopardized when the Eternal Empire of Zakuul was founded and invaded Dromund Kaas.
This prompted the fall of the Dark Council; however, Darth Acina was the sole survivor of this invasion and took the mantle of Empress, seeing as no sith was able to surpass her power.

After Empress Vaylin of the Eternal Empire was assassinated in 3,630 BBY, the Eternal Fleet began a bombardment with the sole purpose of eradicating all life within the galaxy.
Dromund Kaas was one of the planets affected by this incident and was highly damaged after the events.

# Inhabitants

Before the Sith arrived at Kaas, it was an abandoned planet that lacked sentient life-forms; though filled with a surplus of flora.
This changed when the Sith arrived and used the planet as their homeworld.
However, the planet still felt empty, as the humanoid inhabitants confined themselves into their cities and temples; which is mostly shown when the Prophets of the Dark Side took control of Kaas.

Due to Kaas being constantly abandoned and “rediscovered”, barely anyone within the galaxy knew of its existence which is mostly the reason why there is not a big number of inhabitants.
