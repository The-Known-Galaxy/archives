# Overview
Zakuul is a planet located in wild space that served as the Capital planet of the Eternal Empire.
The planet's surface contains a southern ocean, swamps which cover a significant portion of the planet, and semi-solid areas that are filled with overgrown trees.
The planet, due to its location, had virtually no contact with the known galaxy until Emperor Arcaan thrusted the Eternal Empire into the center stage of the galaxy during the times of the Old Republic.

# Early History
In Zakuul’s early history, the planet was conquered by the originators of Iokath in order for it to be used as a living testing ground for the weapons builders.
As the years went by and the builders of Iokath lost connection with their weapons on Zakuul due to their own civil war, people slowly started to immigrate to the planet and started living their lives.


Over the years factions started to form on Zakuul from the immigrants who moved to the planet, these factions were led by three Force-sensitive leaders who became known as the Matriarch, who lead a female ruled culture, the High Shaman, who was the highest priest to the old gods, and the Champion, who was named as the best warrior out of all the people in the tribe.



# The Rise of The Eternal Empire
At a point in history which is otherwise unknown of, a warrior named Valkorion united all the tribes on Zakuul, and went even further, taking all of the force users and revitalizing them into what would become known as the Knights of Zakuul, force sensitive beings who would be charged with protecting the people and the planet of Zakuul.

             
Under Valkorion's leadership the first official city of Zakuul would be built and became known as the Old World.
Valkorion would continue to further advance the people of Zakuul, developing the people's scientific skills and social reforms, turning the people of Zakuul from simply brutal savage warriors and into a people of science and skills.
Thus started the rise of the Eternal Empire



# The Fall of The Eternal Empire
After the defeat of the entire Royal Family of Zakuul by the Outlander, the Eternal Empire fragmented and collapsed into ruin.
Zakuul would be placed under the control of the Eternal Alliance and would face many hardships to come.
Although Zakuul submitted to the authority of the Alliance Commander, many revolts would be attempted in the next few years to come, especially when the Alliance Commander would go to War on Iokath.


Following the Alliance Commander’s mission to Nathema in the year 3629 BBY, the Eternal Alliance would lose the Eternal Fleet and the Alliance Capital ship the Gravestone.
It is after this occurrence that Zakuul no longer had to fear the Eternal Alliance and would segregate themselves from the rest of the galaxy and reform their own government.
