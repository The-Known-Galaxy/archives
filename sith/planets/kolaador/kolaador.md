# Overview

Kolaador was a terrestrial planet in the Outer Rim.
The surface was lined with crystalline structures that would protrude from the rocky world.
Upon the Treaty of Coruscant, the Cold War between the First Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire occurred; Kolaador was home to the yearly massive Kolaador Speeder Derby.

# Galactic Civil War

During the Imperial Era, the Rebel Alliance utilised the hazardous terrain as the Pilot Training Center to teach pilots how to navigate such an environment under the mentorship of Commander Ru Murleen.
A notable figure who passed through this program was Rookie One in 0 BBY.
Eventually, the pilots left the base to secure the Tantive IV in the Battle of Tatooine.
This Corellian CR90 corvette shuttled important diplomats but had been attacked by the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer, the Devastator.
Pilots, including Rookie One, would be involved in dogfights above the Kolaador base after an aerial assault by the Galactic Empire ensued.
