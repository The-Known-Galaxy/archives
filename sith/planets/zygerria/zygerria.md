# Overview
Zygerria was a temperate planet in the Outer Rim, native to the Zygerrian species.
It was only orbited by a moon, apart from a space station, sometime before the Battle of Yavin.
The terrain was peppered with plains, plateaus, and highlands, accommodating a variety of flora and fauna, like the Slave Shade and Brezaks.
Two trade routes intersected the Zygerria system, the Triellus Trade Route and Listehol Run, which allowed for hyperspace travel and trade.
Many of the Zygerrian high class lived in the Zygerrian capital city, also home to the Royal Place of Zygerria, which was distinctly blue and held slave exhibitions for curious buyers.
The blazing heat from its sun meant the capital had many bright awnings on its streets.

# History
During the first Galactic Republic, the planet thrived from the profits of slaving.
Slavery required fortified cities with many slave prisons to be built on plateaus.
It could be assumed that their imports included materials to build weaponry and other utilities to keep slaves under their control.
Cities also housed arenas for fighting and pod races, adding to the planet’s popularity for buyers seeking cheap slave labour.
These operations were discontinued mainly after the enforcement of the anti-slaving campaign by the Jedi Order.
However, the Zygerrian Slave Empire gained a presence in the Imperial Era.
It persisted in achieving tourists and visitors in the New Republic Era.
