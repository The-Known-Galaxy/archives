# Overview

Exegol is a dark made-like desert planet within the Unknown Regions.
Exegol is known to have a stormy climate and a breathable atmosphere, while the terrain is primarily composed of deserts and tough mineral matter.
Exegolâ€™s nearby space was scattered with the remains of megafauna, which resulted in a cloud of red gas and stardust forming around it, making a navigation barrier.
The flora, silica tree was a mineral formation on Exegol.
Because of the endless lightning on the planet, the grit and sand got turned into branching tumors of glass that were easy to knock over.
According to some myths, it was also a hidden planet where the Sith Order used to form their base-of-operations.
In 35 ABY, Exegol was ruled by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and the Sith Eternal.

# THE QUEST FOR IMMORTALITY ON EXEGOL

According to a legend, two Sith Lords, Darth Noctyss and Darth Sanguis reached the planet in their quest for immortality which they thought they would find here.
Sanguis had achieved immortality, but at the cost of becoming a horrendous abomination of a creature.
He decided that if he wanted to end his pain, he would want to make Noctyss do the same ritual he did by hiding his identity, and letting his fellow Sith Lord sacrifice him to it.
He was successful and his suffering has ended, turning Noctyss into the same creature he once was.
