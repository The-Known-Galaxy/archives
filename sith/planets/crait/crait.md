# Overview
Crait, a terrestrial planet in the Outer Rim Territories, boasted at least one continent.
Its oceans and lands were saturated with sodium salt, forming white salt flats over its red rhodochrosite soil, such as the Nupayuni salt flats.
Salt and minerals would be mined and traded for profit by a Q’ltane individual, Trusk Berinato.
The landscape was also outlined by mountains and canyons.
Inhabited by non-sentient species, the world was home to various fauna and flora adapted to survive the blinding midday sun against the shiny surface crystals and crystalstorms that ensued.
The elusive Vulptix species, known for their crystalline spine coat, would dig beneath the salt occasionally brewed, where small mammals and the Tuber plants they fed on lived.
Still, the Vulptix fell prey to other carnivorous species.
Waterways ran across the mineral terrain, with briny seas underneath, presumably apt for aquatic life.

# Imperial Era
With the advent of the Galactic Empire, a secret base was established by the early Rebel Alliance to serve as a strategic stronghold that occasionally infiltrated Imperial facilities.
In 3 BBY, the Alliance attacked the Calderos Station in the Mid Rim to diminish the Imperial presence in the sector and to conceal import records for Crait.
Yet, the Crait outpost was abandoned within the next three years.
Later, Leia Organa and Han Solo, prominent leaders within the Alliance, journeyed to the world to find a new location for a base.
However, they were met with hostility and deception when Berinato, in charge of mining droids within the Mines of Crait and assigned to do so by the Nupayuni Mining Consortium, lured them into the mines for the Empire’s Task Force 99 to detain.
The Alliance fought off the intruders successfully but they deemed Crait an unwise choice for a new base.



# First Order-Resistance War
After the destruction of the First Order’s Starkiller Base by the Resistance in 34 ABY, the remnants of the Resistance sought refuge on Crait.
This consequently sparked the Battle of Crait, a major conflict between the two factions that showcased their respective technologies, but the Resistance defence had weakened to the point of near defeat.
This remained the case until Jedi Master Luke Skywalker appeared before their enemy using Force projection.
This distraction allowed the survivors to escape through the cave system and be saved by the crew of the Millennium Falcon.
The fate of Crait following this tumultuous event remains uncertain.
