# Planet Description

The surface of Christophsis was covered in a forest of naturally occurring turquoise crystal spires, thus making the landscape remarkably beautiful.
Christophsis had a breathable atmosphere for most humanoid species and was orbited by a single moon named Leesis.
Christophsis was located in the Outer Rim.

# Planet History

During the Clone Wars, the planet became the site of several key battles between the Galactic Republic and the CIS, where Senator Bail Organa would fly to the planet to deliver aid and relief.
However, the Separatist fleet would blockade the planet; thus trapping the senator on the surface.
Admiral Trench, a Separatist leader, would be the cause of this blockade, making it impossible to break through the defensive formation.
As the Republic had to come up with a new plan involving a ship that could cloak, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker would be tasked with using the cloaked ship to slip past the Separatist blockade and deliver supplies to Senator Bail Organa on the surface.
However, Skywalker ignored the order to slip past undetected and chose to engage Admiral Trench by using the ship's cloaking to his advantage and would eventually lead a torpedo launched by Admiral Trench into his ship’s bridge; obliterating him.

After defeating Admiral Trench and the Separatist fleet, the Republic would set up a military base to take the planet back from the Separatist forces.
This military operation would be headed by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Master Obi-Wan-Kenobi.
Later on Christophsis, the Republic would become outnumbered, and because of that , Grandmaster Yoda sent a young padawan named Ahsoka Tano to become Anakin Skywalker's padawan.
After much protest by Anakin–not wanting to take her–  Anakin and Ahsoka were eventually tasked with taking out a shield generator that the separatist General Whorm Loathsom was using to defend his advancing army.
However, Anakin and Ahsoka would succeed in blowing up the  generator, allowing Kenobi and the Clone Army to use their heavy artillery guns to beat back the droid army as well as capture the General.
