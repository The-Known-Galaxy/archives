# Overview
Serenno was a terrestrial planet located in the D'Astan sector's Serenno system, in the Northern Dependencies of the Outer Rim Territories, in grid square P-5 on the Standard Galactic Grid.
The planet sat at a prime point along a maze of key hyperspace lanes, close to the planet Toprawa and the Corporate Sector that lay to the northeast, at the very start of the Hydian Way super-hyper route.
To the east sat the vast Gordian Reach and, within it, the Yavin Sources, while Mandalorian space lay south.
A direct route down the Hydian Way to Brentaal IV would mean a short jump across to the planet Coruscant and the galactic seat of power.
It was also situated along the Spurs of Celanon.

# Section 1
According to the legends of the noble houses of the planet, Serenno was once a planet under the control of the Sith Empire.
Count Dooku's home planet is nothing to sneeze at.
Those looking for a place to hide away from it all for a while might put Serenno at the top of the list.
The mountains and cliff-side homes offer seclusion and privacy in a lovely setting.
Plan a long stay, pack some books, and disconnect from the HoloNet.
