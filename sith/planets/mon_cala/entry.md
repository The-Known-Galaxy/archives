# Description

Mon Cala, located in the Mon Calamari system of the Calamari sector in the Outer Rim Territories, was a waterworld situated in the eastern region of the galaxy known as “The Slice”.
The planet is in the Standard Galactic Grid square U-6 and has a moon with no atmosphere and a barren terrain.
Mon Cala's oceans held an abundance of life, including two influential sentient species: the peaceful Mon Calamari and the bellicose Quarren.
Both preferred to build their cities underwater, although some cities were built on the surface.
Despite their differences, the two peoples generally showed mutual respect throughout their history.
The coral on Mon Cala grew in large colonies, forming coral reefs that acted as shelter and feeding and breeding grounds for various sea life.
These reefs tended to thrive in areas bathed in the light of Mon Cala's twin suns, but some hardier species dwelt in deeper, darker areas.
The planet's sparse islands formed archipelagos with varying terrains, including rocky cliffs and sandy beaches with dense jungle.
The polar regions were colder than the rest of the planet, with ice floes located in the north.
Some Quarren and Mon Calamari left their homeworld to avoid politics, settling instead on the moon of Trask.

# History

Mon Cala, discovered by the Galactic Republic in 19,000 BBY, has a rich and varied history.
During the Clone Wars, the planet played a crucial role, serving as a battleground between the Republic and the Separatists.
The Mon Calamari, led by King Yos Kolina, sided with the Republic, while the Quarren aligned themselves with the Separatists.
In 19 BBY, the Battle of Mon Cala occurred, leading to King Yos Kolina's death and the Quarren's alliance with the Separatists.
After the Clone Wars, the Galactic Empire occupied Mon Cala, and the planet became a hotbed of resistance activity.
The Mon Calamari joined the Rebel Alliance, and a massive battle erupted, leaving the planet severely damaged.
In the years following the fall of the Empire, Mon Cala became part of the New Republic, and the Mon Calamari and Quarren worked together to rebuild their planet.
However, the planet continued to face threats, including an attempted coup by the Quarren in 5 ABY and an invasion by the First Order in 34 ABY.
Despite the conflict, Mon Cala remains a vital and resilient planet, with the Mon Calamari and Quarren living together in relative peace and cooperation.
They continue to protect their planet and their way of life, ensuring that Mon Cala remains a critical player in the galaxy's history.

# Settlements

Mon Cala's population mainly lived in underwater cities, preferred by both the Quarren and the Mon Calamari species.
However, some cities like Dac City breached the surface.
The cities included city-ships which could also be used as ships.
Mon Cala city was the planet's capital where the king ruled from and included a city square and a central planetary scanner mast.
Other settlements included Dac City, which had a palace for King Lee-Char, New Coral City located above water, Quarren Town located in the depths of the ocean, and Zeran Town located in the northern regions of the planet.

# Structures and buildings

During the High Republic Era, Mon Cala had an outpost made of coralite which served as a raft and had kelp hanging from the underside to create a habitat for sea creatures.
The Mon Calamari Royal Palace, located in Mon Cala city, served as the residence of the king of Mon Cala, and included a throne room used for debates.
King Yos Kolina was assassinated in the palace by Riff Tamson, but his son was soon coronated as the new king.
The Moncaladrome, a famous opera house, performed plays such as the "Faluvian cycle" and "The tale of the tragic egg" on a multi-level stage to a large audience.
During the Galactic Civil War, the Heroes of Yavin captured Moff Tan Hubi and used his bio-signature at the Moncaladrome.

# Landmarks

In the depths of Mon Cala's ocean lies the Great Ungeness Trench, home to a giant squid-like creature.
After the Battle of Dac City, Darth Vader fought and defeated the creature in the trench.
The Sacred Arena of Salka'a was an ancient gladiatorial arena located between the islands and made out of stone.
During the First Order-Resistance War, Rey fought the droid Arkay-Nine in the arena to save her friends from punishment.
Mon Calamari greats such as Admiral Ackbar were remembered at the Mourning Shrines, which were underwater memorials consisting of large statues surrounded by coral and a habitat for eels.
Visitors could place a shell in the mouth of the statue to honor the deceased.
Aftab and General Leia Organa visited the statue of Gial Ackbar, where they paid their respects.
