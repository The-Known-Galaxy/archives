# Introduction
Moraband is a former Sith planet located in the Outer Rim Territories.
Moraband was known by many names due to its age and use.
Most notably of the names used were Korriban when it was the planet of the Sith Temple and the Siths home world.
Korriban or Moraband, has since become a desolate wasteland due to years of prolonged wars and was abandoned by the Sith.
However, the atmosphere is still breathable despite most plant life having been long dead.

# Terrain and Climate
The terrain of Moraband became desolate due to the 100s of years of wars during the Ancient Siths occupation of the planet.
Moraband itself is also a very mountainous planet.
Furthermore, due to the aforementioned wars, the climate has since become hotter than when it was used as a Sith Temple.
Surprisingly, the atmosphere is still breathable.



# Locations
There are many notable locations of Moraband.
Two of the most important locations on Moraband were the Sith Temple known as the Valley of the Dark Lords and the Sith Temple known as the Sword of Khashyun.
The Sword of Khashyun was a Sith Temple that held the Sword of Khashyun.
The Temple was guarded by massive sentries and Tuk’atas (Also known as Sith Hounds).
The Temple was also heavily booby trapped to protect the Sword.
The sword itself is a Sith Artifact forged by a faction of Dowutin Sith Warriors that believed lightsabers were for the weak.
Legends say that the sword is cursed to turn Sith upon one another.
The Valley of the Dark Lords was a Sith Temple dedicated to holding the tombs of great Sith Lords.
The Valley of the Dark Lords was the largest monument to fallen Sith Lords.
The largest and most notable monument in the valley was that of Darth Bane, the founder of the Rule of Two.
The Temple itself also held an extensive execution chamber that was utilized to execute Jedi prisoners.



# Notable Events
Moraband, known as Korriban by its primary occupiers, the Ancient Sith, was the homeworld to the Ancient Sith.
Due to the constant wars and the subsequent fall of the Sith Order in approximately 1000 BBY(Before the Battle of Yavin) left the Sith homeworld of Korriban in disarray.
Korriban stayed almost entirely uninhabited until the Clone Wars when Grandmaster Yoda was sent to Korriban by the force priestess to unlock the secrets of Eternal Consciousness.
When Yoda arrived at Korriban, he was met with a number of Sith Spirits.
Including the spirit of Darth Bane himself.
As Yoda went further into Korriban, Darth Sidious attempted to corrupt Yoda using Force Visions to further the plot to destroy the Jedi Order.
The plan ultimately failed and Yoda left Korriban after unlocking the ability to Eternal Consciousness (also known as a Force Ghost).
