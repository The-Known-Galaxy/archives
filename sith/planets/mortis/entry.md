# Overview

Mortis was an “ethereal” realm of the force that  was talked about and passed down in legends between Jedi and Sith alike.
It contained dreamlike environments and could never be mapped due to even the biggest  landmarks often appearing in different places.
It is believed to exist outside of any star system, or perhaps even outside of the galaxy or universe as a whole.
Some also believe that the origins of the Force come from Mortis itself.

# Section 1

One of the more intriguing parts of Mortis is its day-and-night cycle.
During the day, it has a beautiful landscape of lush fields, mountains that are green, dense forests, and molten caverns, which allows for a stunning view of the entire place.
During the night however, this fauna would wither away and die, all the creatures would simply disappear, and the downpours would sweep the terrain so heavily that survival without a shelter was practically impossible.
Most interesting of all, is that in the black night skies of Mortis, there are few stars that shine, and all of them are unidentifiable.

The entrance to the realm was never voluntary either, it drew in its visitors out of the blue while manifesting itself in a manner of different ways.
To some, it would show itself as a monolith randomly floating in space, and sometimes individuals walked through a door or landed there without any specific reason for it.
The way time flows here is also most unusual and holds no meaning to any place outside of it as weeks, months, years spent in Mortis are mere seconds outside of this place.

# Section 2

The realm was inhabited by only three beings, The Son, The Daughter and The Father.
The Son signified the dark and twisted parts of the realm such as the night while the daughter signified the beauty and peace of it such as the day time.
We can therefore insinuate from this that The Son is aligned to the Dark Side of the Force while The Daughter is aligned to the Light Side of the Force.
The Father is who keeps these two forces in perfect harmony and balance.

# Section 3

It is here that Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi were drawn during the Clone Wars by The Father.
This happened because The Father realized that Anakin Skywalker was “The Chosen One” and therefore he would be able to keep balance in the Force on Mortis after he passes.
However, the entire thing escalated to the three beings on Mortis battling the three Jedi that were drawn into Mortis.
The struggle ended with The Father, The Son, and The Daughter dying at the hands of the Jedi trio that happened to be pulled to Mortis.
The deaths of these three beings led to the restoration of balance on Mortis.
