The Gree Enclave, otherwise known as the Gree Empire, 	planets that belonged with the Gree Enclave include Malanose, Asation, Lonatro, Te Hasa, Licha In, and Gree itself.
Travel to Asation started when the Gree Enclave used a starship known as the Rokak’k Baran.
Asation was a wet, high pressure world covered in slimy wetlands.
Asation was long believed to be terraformed by the Gree by placing genetically altered life forms to populate the surface of the planet.
Gree that were born on Asation were generally smaller in stature compared to the normal Gree.

# Galactic War Era
The Dread Masters were said to have travelled to Asation to activate and open a Gree hypergate, releasing a creature known as the Terror From Beyond.
It’s real name is a Lotek’k, a massive and grotesque multi-tentacled monster banished by the Gree.
The Dread Masters' plans involved sending one of their servants, Kephess, to Asation to take over control of the Grand Hypergate.
However, the creature was a massive threat to Asation, and the Gree were forced to call both the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire for assistance in its removal.
