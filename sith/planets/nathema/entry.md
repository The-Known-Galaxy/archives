# Overview

Nathema was a fertile and lush planet located on the edges of the Sith Empire and what was later known as territory of the Outer Rim.
Nathema was a very productive world for the Empire and was used up until 5113 BBY.
Nathema had a bright orange star that circled and had a type 1 atmosphere that left people able to breathe for both the Sith and others.
This planet was especially good for growing goods due to its fertile land and had tons of farmer settlements.
Throughout The Great Hyperspace War Nathema had only one single populated city.
On the planet, there existed only one single ocean that separated the continents leaving the planet with only two continents of land.

After the Ritual of Nathema, the planet became lifeless with no living organisms and the surface was left as a barren wasteland.
Even droids did not survive the ritual nor computer operating systems.
The land was drained of life, color, and even the atmosphere was warped and all that was left was a planet for Vitiate’s enemies.
After Vitiate’s death, the planet seemed to be recovering from the damage caused by the ritual.
The air had become fresher and the fertile land, as well as inhabitants, had returned.
