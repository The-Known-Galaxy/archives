# Overview
Velusia was a violet colored planet that was part of the Core Worlds.
It contained many vast oceans and was mainly a naval planet, but also supported an extremely wide variety of species.
This planet's terrain consists of salty oceans with volcanic islands smooshed in.
Due to the volcanic islands, the planet's land was extremely unstable and was at risk of being destroyed at any given moment.
This ocean contains poles and atolls that had frozen water and sea coral.
This planet was also home to the near-Human Aquar, which ate many different sea animals, such as fish, algae, and plankton.
This planet's main city was Hollow, which was the main hub for trading and imports

At the beginning of its time, this planet was first inhabited by Humans, who came in and colonized it, slowly taking over each island.
They used the resources gathered after colonization to pay the Aquar to gain individual rights.
Many Aquar on this planet were scouts, guides, and laborers who kept the ores on the planet a secret as a way to capitalize on the planet's wealth from its hidden ores.
Velusia joined the Galactic Republic and the Alsakan Conflicts during their respective periods.
At one point, the Galactic Republic had created an oceanic harvesting program on the planet, which spiraled into complete Imperial reign.
