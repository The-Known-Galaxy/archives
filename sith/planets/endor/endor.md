# Description
Endor is a captivating moon with a lush and humid climate, famous for its dense forests that are filled with life.
These forests are home to the Ewoks, a charming and endearing species of bear-like creatures who live in intricately designed tree villages and are deeply connected to the Great Tree, a deity that they worship with passion and devotion.

# Society
The societies on Endor are diverse, ranging from the Ewoks, who live in tree villages and have a complex social structure based on family units and the worship of the Great Tree, to the Yuzzum, a species known for their musical talents and love of entertainment.
The Duloks, a primitive and aggressive tribe, live in the swamps of Endor and are often hostile towards outsiders, including the Ewoks.
The Gorax, a ferocious and solitary creature, lives in the mountains and is feared by all who dwell on the moon.
Despite their differences, the inhabitants of Endor share a deep connection to the natural world and are united by their reverence for the moon's forests, wildlife, and spiritual traditions.



# History
Endor has a tumultuous history marked by conflicts and wars, with one of the most significant being the Galactic Civil War, where the Rebel Alliance faced off against the Galactic Empire.
This culminated in the Battle of Endor, a pivotal moment in the war that resulted in the destruction of the second Death Star and the death of Emperor Palpatine.
Endor also saw smaller-scale conflicts, such as disputes between the Ewoks and Duloks, and the Gorax and other species.
