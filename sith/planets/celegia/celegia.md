# Description
Located in the Expansion Region (area between Inner and Mid Rims), Celegia was a world apart of both the Galactic Republic and the Empire at different eras in time.
The cyanogen gas that filled the planet’s airspace acted as regular oxygen to the natives of the world, which were sentient beings known as Celegians.
Sea water encompassed a majority of this planet’s surface, with harsh currents that created tides over most of the land.
Since the Celegia system was in The Slice portion of the Expansion Region, it was connected to both the Virujansi and Belasco systems through hyperlanes.

# History
By 17,000 BBY Celegia finally was associated with the Galactic Republic.
Controlled by the Grand Companies, which were conglomerates of trading connected with Coruscant, Celegia had no major power over their Belasco system hyperlane.
The Grand Companies were primarily located on the Spin hyperlane, which was around the Core Worlds.
Additional routes like one leading to Virujansa were contested and fought for by other factions or sometimes even remained neutral.
Due to conflicts between the Alsakan planet and the Republic’s Coruscant over natural resource control, it began conflict within these Celegia hyperlane routes.
Between 22-19 BBY, the Fourth Sector Army was tasked with fighting around Celegia against the CIS military army.
However, by 17 BBY the system became a fully-fledged asset to the Galactic Empire.
The Yuuzhan Vong on their conquest of power eventually conquered the Celegia System around 27 ABY.



# Inhabitants
Celegians primarily breathed their home planet’s toxic gas and required a specific life support chamber in order to properly intake gas on oxygen-ridden worlds.
The toxic gas located in the Celegia atmosphere was a deterrent for other species' arrival as they could not ingest it.
These mind-reading jellyfish-like beings evolved and utilized an organic locomotion method of levitation, allowing floatation while in the air.
Although Celegians are unable to breathe oxygen as it is poisonous to them, they were able to form a well-developed settlement on the cyanogenic moon of Tramanos.
Between 10-100 million Celegians lived on their planet during the approximate year of 25 ABY.
