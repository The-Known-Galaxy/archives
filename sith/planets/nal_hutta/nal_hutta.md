# Description
Nal Hutta, also known as Hutta, was a planet located in Hutt Space.
The planet had a sticky and uninviting environment, covered with mist and continuous heavy rainfall.
Its diverse ecosystem closely resembled the Hutt species that inhabited it.
The Hutts ruled the planet, and they utilised the little solid land available to build their abodes since numerous bogs covered the surface.

There were only a few spaceports built on the planet by the Hutts to move among their towns, settlements, and palaces.
Visitors seldom arrived on the planet; Nar Shaddaa, the largest moon, was the foremost hub for off-world transactions.
The capital city, Bilbousa, had the primary spaceport, and it sprawled across the land with twisting roots extending from large pods in all directions.
The Palace of Gardulla Besadii the Elder, one of Nal Hutta's significant buildings, occasionally functioned as the Grand Hutt Council's headquarters, responsible for governing the Hutt Clan.
Despite being a polluted and dangerous planet, under the Hutts' control, Nal Hutta played a preeminent role in the galaxy's black market and had a similar reputation as Nar Shaddaa.

# History
The Hutt Clan's headquarters were on Nal Hutta.
At one point, Nal Hutta was a bustling planet with many cities.
Unfortunately, during the Drengir crisis, this changed, and a Drengir infestation turned the world into a place of sweltering jungles.
The planet remained this way for years to come.
However, this climatic turn was to the Hutts' liking.



# Clone Wars
After freeing Ziro the Hutt from prison on Coruscant, the skilled bounty hunter known as Cad Bane brought him to the Grand Hutt Council on Nal Hutta.
However, Ziro refused to provide the Council with the location of his secret holo-diary and was imprisoned.
Nevertheless, Ziro managed to escape with the help of a singer named Sy Snootles.
Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Quinlan Vos were then dispatched to Nal Hutta to capture Ziro.
But, he escaped with Snootles and fled to another world, with aid from Ziro’s mother.

During a separate mission to rescue Supreme Chancellor Palpatine from Separatist assassins, Obi-Wan Kenobi, disguised as bounty hunter Rako Hardeen, teamed up with Bane and Moralo Eval and eventually crashed into the swamps of Nal Hutta.
The three of them had to travel to Bilbousa Bazaar and get themselves a spacecraft to flee the planet.
Even though they were pursued by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Padawan Ahsoka Tano, they successfully left the planet and landed on Orondia.

In the final days of the Clone Wars, the former Sith apprentice Maul visited Nal Hutta alongside his brother Savage Opress and the Shadow Collective.
Their mission was to persuade the Hutt Council to join them.
Regrettably, the Council rejected their offer, leading to a fierce battle scene.
Despite the Hutts managing to escape, Maul and his group were able to seize Oruba, who told them that Jabba Desilijic Tiure was present on Tatooine.
The Shadow Collective killed Oruba before leaving for Tatooine.
