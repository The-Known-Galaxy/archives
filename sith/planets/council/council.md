# Introduction
Tucked away in the Outer Rim Territories, Council is revealed as a celestial mystic, veiled in secrecy and fascination.
This far-off planet has not been extensively studied and is not affected by the impact of the galactic powers, therefore not much is known about it.
We are attracted into a world of age-old mysteries, wild wildness, and the promise of discovery that attracts explorers from across the stars as we set out on a quest to uncover the mysteries of Council.
