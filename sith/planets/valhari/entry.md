# Overview

Despite claiming neutrality in the Clone Wars, the Outer Rim planet Valahari provided the Confederacy of Independent Systems with more modern and sophisticated ships, giving the CIS an edge over the Galactic Republic.
The inhabitants of Valahari had a well-earned reputation as some of the galaxy's top starfighter engineers.

# History

The planet was visited by Obi-Wan Kenobi while he was  Qui-Gon Jinn's apprentice.
He got to know the House of Vane during that time.
At least ten years later, Kenobi and fellow Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker went back to the planet on a diplomatic mission to attempts to persuade them to cease supporting the Separatists by continuing to produce superior starfighters.
Count Dooku participated in the conversation over supper and rebutted the accusations made by the Jedi against the Confederacy.
The King of Valahari, Harko Vane, declined to support the Republic in the Clone Wars.
The Republic encircled the planet as a result.

A number of unarmed ships tried to depart Valahari, but Kenobi warned Vane that if they went any farther, their ships would be crippled and boarded.
Asajj Ventress had previously sabotaged Vane's spacecraft, so it blew up before either side could act.
Flight recorders demonstrated that the explosion was not caused by a Republic attack, but the Republic information was not seen as reliable.
Valahari's furious inhabitants joined the Confederacy in response to this occurrence.

The Tofen's Raiders starfighter squadron was established by Tofen Vane, the son of Harko Vane, to openly combat the Republic.
In the Battle of the Hexus system, the Republic and Valahari later engaged in combat.
Heavy casualties on both sides forced Valahari to flee.
