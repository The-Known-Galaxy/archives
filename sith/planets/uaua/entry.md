# Overview

Uaua was a terrestrial planet located in the Outer Rim Territories.
This planet was the homeworld of the Quor’sav, who grew distrustful of non-avian species after a flu nearly wiped their species from existence.
Mammals were naturally immune to the virus, but the Quor’sav did not have such immunity.
This led to non-avian off-worlders, particularly mammals, being no longer welcome on the planet.
Even the insects of Uaua showed fierce hostility to off-world visitors.
The Quor’sav were an avian species that were flightless and had a diet that consisted of centipedes and nerf steaks.
They stood around 3.5 meters tall.
