# Overview
Cadinth was an originally beautiful planet, just like many of the planets in the Kingdom of Cron sector.
Unfortunately, this planet and many others around it had their natural beauty stripped through industrialization and wastefulness of off-planet companies.
Cadinth was the capital world of the Kingdom of Cadinth planets.
During 25150 BBY, these planets in the Kingdom of Cadinth fell into a war in which they lost, causing them to join the Xer Empire, and after that the Xim Empire.
After this empire collapsed, they joined ANOTHER one under the name of the Kingdom of Cron.
This planet would never be subject to one side, and would always remain neutral in terms of the Republic and Empire.
