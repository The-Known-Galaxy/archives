# Overview
Located in the Akkadese Maelstrom, Kessel was a planet known for hosting its many spice mines.
Despite its infamy for Spice mines, the southern hemisphere of this planet is a green area home to lush sanctuaries.
During eras like the Galactic Empire, Kessel had many of its mines running through slave trades and labor.

Many people theorize that the spice on the planet stems from the large turbulent space around the planet.
Kessel was a very prominent planet in the spice trade, and was ruled by King Yaruba under the Family of Kessel during the Clone Wars.
For many years, the Pykes dealt with the spice trade on the planet and used smugglers and captains to transport spice to crime families on Coruscant.
