# Introduction

Ambria, also known as Stenness, was a planet located in the Ambria System, in the Stenness Node of the Inner Rim.
It was filled with rocky and desert terrains.

# Description

Life of Animals on Ambria included Hsiss dragons, neek lizards, and staga.
The Hsiss dragons came from a place called Lake Natth.
Lake Natth was a place that had a strong bond with the Dark Side of the Force.

Ambria was discovered during the Great Manifest Period, becoming famous because of its wealth in resources and minerals.
Ambria and its sector were considered a paradise full of minerals, which attracted many large corporations.
Ambria had a breathable atmosphere, but it had some rough terrain conditions, which because of it was never colonized.

During Ambria’s history, a Sith Sorceress came to the planet, taking it as her home.
Any major information about her is unknown, we know only a little about her and her legacy.
She enslaved all of the planet under her authority.
The Sith began building a giant black Sith Obelisk, which later on made her able to conduct a ritual within it.
The ritual has released a great amount of Dark Energy, killing any life except the Hssiss dragons.

During the Hyperspace wars in 5000 BBY, a few Sith Lords sought refuge on the planet.
Because of the dark energy it wielded, they stayed there, making it their home.
With time, the Sith Lords have passed into the Force, becoming Sith Wraiths.

With time, and the dark presence in the Force, a Tchuukthai Jedi Master named Thon would arrive at Ambria, making it his home.
Thon managed to repel the Sith Wraiths for a certain amount of time, but later on, he wasn’t able to do so.
He managed to defeat the Dark Spirits, trapping them in Lake Natth using the Light Side of the Force.
He dedicated himself to exploring Ambria, discovering places such as canyons, which had strong connections with the Force.
With time, he managed to build a training facility for the Jedi, where he trained his students.
Ambria was also a place where a legendary Jedi named Nomi Sunrider trained.
But after Jedi Master Thon was murdered, the planet became a wasteland once again.

A thousand years BBY a Sith Lord named Darth Bane came to Ambria, wishing to meet Githany, a member of the Brotherhood of Darkness.
Githany had other intentions, he wished to kill Bane, so he poisoned him.
Darth Bane was close to his death, seeking a doctor on a wasteland.
He managed to find one, threatening him, and he managed to be cured.
Bane later re-visited Ambria with his apprentice, but later on abandoned it.

During the Galactic Empire, the planet was forgotten, but after its fall and the creation of the New Republic, it gained more interest.
