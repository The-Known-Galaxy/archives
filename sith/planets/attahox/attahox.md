# Overview

Attahox was a terrestrial planet inhabited by immigrated humans with at least three moons orbiting it.
Phosovane salts for painkillers were the main exports, presumably mined, and the planet’s intersection with the Nanth’ri Trade Route made trade possible.
This connected Attahox to the better-known planets of Mimban and Nanth’ri.
Known as a rundown planet of trashscapes, it was an ideal hideout for criminal organisations like the Torgaigne syndicate.

# History

During the Great Sith War, the secret dark side society of Krath, in their conquering endeavour known as the Krath Holy Crusade, split their forces into three from the Belasco system.
One of their groups sought to take hold of planets in the southwestern direction, which included Attahox in the Battle of the Attahox system.
Attahox is assumed to have had ties with the Confederacy of Independent Systems while being in their region of operations during the Clone Wars.
