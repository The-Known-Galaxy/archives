# Overview

Hoxim was a terrestrial planet in the Unknown Regions, home to the immigrated Agbui species.
The world displayed luscious forests and grasslands, which contrasted against the distinct mountains and deserts present.
The soil was surprisingly acidic, meaning it couldn’t support edible plants.
Essentially free from alteration, it preserved much of its terrain, waters, and fauna.

# History

However, by 18 BBY, the peace was disrupted in the Hoxim Incident, a plan to collapse the Chiss Ascendancy.
An Agbui called Haplif misled three of the 40 Great Families of the Ascendancy into thinking the Agbui had dominion over a previously unowned Nyix mining settlement and that they were dismissive of this blue spinpria’s value, causing strife above the planet to claim it.
Nyix was a rare silver-coloured metal found in the Unknown Regions used to strengthen ships, so it was highly valued in the galaxy.
This was where the planet earned its name as the Agbui mining world.
Acting like he didn’t know any better, Haplif advertised Hoxim as a location filled with Nyix that the Agbui could create a lot of jewellery out of, which the Ascendancy could profit from through trade.
This eventually caught the attention of Councilor Lakuviv of the Xodlak family, who decided to invest in the mine.
As planned, this also attracted the Pommrio and Erighal families.
In actual fact, Jixtus, a member of the Grysk Hegemony, and Haplif had started a civil war on the planet Sunrise, from which Haplif stole Nyix and exported it to Hoxim.
Onboard the Springhawk, Senior Captain Thrawn saw through Haplif’s deceit and manipulated the Families above Hoxim to open fire on the mine, portraying it to have an enemy presence and stopping the trickster’s scheme.
