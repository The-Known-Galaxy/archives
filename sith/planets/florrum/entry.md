# Description

Florrum was a dry planet consisting of deserts, canyons, and sulfuric geysers with an arid climate.
Florrum was placed in Sertar Sector within the Outer Rim Territories.
The native species of this planet were known as the Skalder.
These species had thick shells that protected them from the acids that fell from the geysers.
Other species that migrated to this land were the Weeqoway, Jawa, Nikto, Bith, Twi'lek, Massif and Kowakian monkey lizards.

# History

A Weequay gang led by Hondo Ohnaka had its base of operation located on Florrum.
After they kidnapped Count Dooku, they returned to Florrum.
Later, Ohnaka captured Obi-wan and Anakin after they found out Dooku was there so they could pay his ransom.
They escaped later on with the help of Representative Jar Jar Binks.
Soon after this, the planet was left in peace.

Second Battle of Florrum:

General Grievous, under the orders of Dooku, made an assault on Obi-wanâ€™s fleet for control over the Florrum Sector.
The Separatists had won, which forced the rest of Obi-Wan's fleet to retreat.
Obi and CC-2224 activated the ship's self-destruct sequence right before the flee.
Grievous led an assault on Florrum and took over the old Weequay gang base.
Once they had arrived, they had captured Hondo and his men.
They eventually fled and came across Ahsoka Tano and the Slave I ship.
Once they had found other younglings, they fled and returned to Florrum.
