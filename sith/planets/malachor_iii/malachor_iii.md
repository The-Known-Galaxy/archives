# Description
Malachor III was an Outer Rim planet located in the Chorlian Sector, home to the tomb of the ancient human Sith Lord Terrak Morrhage.
The analysis of the planet by the Jedi Order concluded it as barren and its points of interests include several spaceports.
Its terrain included multiple plateaus with an additional rocky surface.

# Events
A group of six young Jedi Padawans went on an expedition to Malachor III with permission from the Council.
However, the spirit of Morrhage played with the emotions of the explorers, and eventually the expedition members began turning on each other until the dark creatures of the planet rose against Morrhage.

The youngest member of the expedition, Parkanas Tark, was trapped on the planet while attempting to save Jedi Master Eriz Vossan, then being tortured by the spirit of Morrhage, which eventually corrupted and possessed him.
Malachor III was later forbidden to any and all explorers with no exception, Darth Thanaton, a pureblood Sith Lord, after supposedly killing the apprentice of Darth Zash, traveled to the world to attend to his business.
