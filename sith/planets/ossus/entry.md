# Overview

Ossus was a planet, which was located in the Adega System part of the Outer Rim Auril Sector; the planet was also a part of the Jedi Order.
Ossus had been at least orbited by one forest moon.
There were some Jedi Scholars, such as Qel Droma, who had been making a case that the planet was the site of the Jedi Order’s beginnings.
Ossus was a Jedi retreat and also the largest storage of Jedi knowledge known in history.
Ossus had also housed the Great Jedi Library and the Jedi Temple.

In the Qel Droma epics, Ossus had its surface wiped clean during the Cron Supernova, when the Sith Lord named Naga Sadow had manipulated stars in the Cron Cluster to explode as supernovae.
But the Jedi had also managed to save some of the artifacts that had been hoarded on the planet.
The artifacts that were saved like mosaic floors and also the Chronicles of Med’eeth, which was recovered and kept in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant by the Exis Station.

In legend, a few Jedi had escaped their deaths by the blast and banded together to survive.
Many centuries had passed and those humans had become the tribe Ysanna, which were a group of humans with high Force sensitivity.
Among them, they had believed it was some sort of atavistic magic.
The other humans who had survived and lived on the planet were thought by the Ysanna as a minority people.

When the New Republic Era was happening, the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker built his temple on Ossus.
In this facility, he had trained many students, until the place got destroyed in 28 ABY by the anger of Ben Solo, after which Luke Skywalker went on a self-imposed exile.
