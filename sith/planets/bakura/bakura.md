# Overview

Bakura was a heavily forested planet, with a mixture of water and forestation.
This planet was located in the far end of the galaxy, commonly referred to as Wild Space.
This planet was home to the Kurtzen and human colonizers.
The capital of this city is Salis D'aar, which is known for its financial sector and spaceport, acting as a commercial area for all people in Wild Space.
This planet has many historical moments, with one of them being a truce between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic.

# Section I

Bakura was one of the eight planets in the Bakura system, acting as a separate sector in the vast Wild Space.
It was connected with a hyperlane called the Shiritoku Way and was on the edge of its spur.
It was a terrestrial world with two moons and a breathable atmosphere.
This planet was amazing for the manufacturing of starcraft parts, specifically repulsorlift coils.
This planet was also heavily used for mining natural resources and other minerals.
The terrain and natural features of this planet were plains, mountains, and urban centers all split along the three main continents of this planet, Braad, Prytis, and Kishh'daar.
Each of the continents were relatively similar, with Braad containing many open fields and other agricultural-based economics.
The people of Bakura despised droids, leading to almost none being on the planet at all.

# Section II

Bakura only contained one native species, which was the Kurtzen.
These were pale, human-like species that prided themselves on being independent.
They followed a unique religion known as the Cosmic Balance, which was made from a sacred text known as Fulcrum.
The religion made it so that teenagers with faithful parents had to undergo tests, the teen that passed the test with the best scores were given a small feather, while the other received a golden bowl.
The one who received the bowl was forced into a simple home, serving the Zanazi, who were the priests of the religion.
