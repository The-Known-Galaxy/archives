# Introduction
Eadu was a planet located in the Outer Rim.
Eadu’s nature is really stormy.
In history, it was an important planet to the Galactic Empire, due to the Empire’s scientist's research on the planet.

# Description
Eadu was a rocky, mountainous planet located in the Eadu system in the Outer Rim.
It had a really thick cloud cover, which paired up with infinite storms and made it look like the planet was in an eternal night.
It made landing on the planet really hard, due to the clouds blocking the vision of a starship.
It was home to Nerf herders and had a small planetary population.

During the age of the Galactic Empire, Eadu played a key role in the building of the Death Star and the Empire’s research over Kyber crystals.
In that age, it was owned by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin.
Between the mountains of Eadu, the Emperor installed a high-energy conversion laboratory.
The final project of a Death Star superlaser was created on Eadu, and it was later on moved and installed on the Death Star.

Later on in history, the rebel forces bombed the Eadu complex, destroying it, assisting in the destruction of the Death Star.
