# Overview
As the name implies, Voss is a terrestrial planet in the Voss system located in the Allied Tion of the Outer Rim Territories.
Initially, only one specie lived on Voss and they were known as the Gormaks until the ancient Sith arrived on Voss, where they would steal valuable resources till the Jedi came to fight them off.
The Jedi would help the native species by teaching the Gormak tribes how to use the Force.
Though, the tribes were unprepared and evolved into  a different kind of species known as the Voss.
Eventually, the Sith were destroyed, while the Jedi left or died.
As a result, the Voss established the city of Vosh-ka, which established a strong society that was able to thrive.
The Voss society became Force-Sensitives for guidance, as the Voss Mystics were gifted with Force vision, they would also perform beautiful healing rituals to heal fatal grave wounds.

# Cold War
Throughout the Cold War between the Mighty Sith Empire and The Galactic Republic, the terrestrial planet Voss would be discovered by the two Powerful factions (again).
They both tried to ally with the Voss people, to benefit from the Force Visions for an advantage during the war.
Though, the Voss would resist the conquest by making the Imperials frustrated.
The Voss stayed neutral during the Cold War, grateful for the Star Cabal's actions.
The planet became a huge battleground between the two powers, causing chaos everywhere.
Both sides attempted to gain favor by helping the Voss defeat the Gormaks, so the Sith plotted maneuvers to put the Republic in a bad light.
Accordingly, they could smuggle cyber beasts or hold the great city of Vosh-ka hostage.
Afterward, Voss captured Gormak King Jokull, revealing to them their common origins with the Gormaks, while the Hero of Tython killed Sel-Makor, the source of corruption in the Nightmare Lands.
