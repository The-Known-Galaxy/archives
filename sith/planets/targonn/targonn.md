# Overview
Targonn was a terrestrial planet in the Outer Rim.
Orbited by at least two moons, the world featured mountainous terrain and arid conditions, quite unfriendly to inhabit.
Yet, avian species like the sentient Targonnians had adapted to this environment.
During the latter years of the Galactic Republic, the population was under the dictatorship of Craw, who dubbed himself the Dictator-Forever of Targonn.
The cruel and torturous figure established selfish legislation like a 99 per cent tax, public flogging, and child labour, dwelling in the Targonn Royal Place with all his fortune.
To consolidate his rule, the eternal dictator even sought to subdue Targonnians into “Smilers” with Savorium herb, capable of enslaving the minds of its users in happiness.
A botanist, Zorneth, travelled to the world to barter the shaggy fur of Thookah.
However, the Herdship was assaulted by the dictator’s army even with Savorium herb onboard.
Eventually, Zorneth banded with the resistance group, Shay’s Revoltists, who were able to liberate its people from the ruler at around 5 BBY.
Key droids in this ploy were PDA6, C-3PO and R2-D2, which Zorneth owned at the time.
