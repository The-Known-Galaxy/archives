Gloam is a destroyed planet located in the Galactic Frontier which is a region in the Outer Rim Territories.
Gloam orbits around its twin planet, Aubadas.
It is the original home planet of the Katikoot sentient species.

Approximately a millennium before the High Republic Era, the dwellers of the planet escaped the planet and fled to Aubadas due to a plague breaking out.
The cause of the plague was due to the mining activity on the planet.
Something in the natural resources infected the inhabitants and made them zombie-like monsters.

The planet still housed many Katihoots that used the mines on the planet since Aubadas lacked the resources they required in order to survive, flourish, and evolve.
The stability of the ecological condition of the planet collapsed due to the plague 382 BBY.
