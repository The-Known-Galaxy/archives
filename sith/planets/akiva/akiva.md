# Overview
Akiva, situated in the distant Outer Rim Territories, had a history of affiliation with the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
It housed a significant droid construction facility underground.
Following the Clone Wars, the Galactic Empire occupied Akiva, with the Satrapy of Myrra collaborating with the new rulers.
In the aftermath of the Battle of Endor, the remnants of the Empire convened above Akiva to regroup and plan an attack against the New Republic.
However, the summit failed, resulting in the Rebellion on Akiva in space.
As the Imperial leaders fled for safety, the citizens of Akiva joined forces to overthrow the Satrapy of Myrra and the Empire.
This successful battle marked Akiva as the first Outer Rim planet to align with the New Republic.
Later on, in 34 ABY, Akiva pledged its allegiance to the rising First Order.

# Description
Akiva, located in the Outer Rim Territories, was a hot and humid planet known for its thunderous storms and frequent rainfall.
The city of Myrra, Akiva's capital, had unique features like "storm ladders" to swiftly evacuate people during flash floods.
The planet's surface boasted jungles, canyons, and narrow streets navigated by the bala-bala speeders.
Beneath Myrra's sprawling cityscape lay ancient catacombs inhabited by the primitive Uugteen species.
Legends surrounded these catacombs, with rumors of a Jedi training temple, Sith traps, or Hutt breeding grounds.
Only a few individuals survived encounters with the Uugteen.
Additionally, remnants of a Separatist droid factory from the Clone Wars were discovered in the catacombs.
In the past, Akiva was home to the Ahia-Ko, an ancient species that constructed magnificent temples in the planet's jungle wilderness.
The Ahia-Ko believed the water in the canyons possessed purifying qualities, capable of cleansing sins and improving one's character.
The water from these canyons was highly valued by members of the Satrapy of Myrra, including Satrap Isstra Dirus.



# History
During the Clone Wars, Akiva aligned with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, housing a Separatist droid factory in the catacombs of the city Myrra.
With the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Satrapy of Myrra ruled Akiva indirectly on behalf of the Empire, fostering corruption and a thriving black market.
The Karyvin clan, an aristocratic family, held significant influence on the planet.
Amidst the Imperial Era, Brentin Lore Wexley was imprisoned on Kashyyyk while his wife, Norra Wexley, joined the Rebel Alliance.
The crime lord Surat Nuat established a presence in Myrra.
Following the Battle of Endor, Norra and her allies orchestrated a successful uprising on Akiva, capturing members of the Imperial Future Council.
This led to the Satrapy switching sides, and Akiva became the first Outer Rim planet to officially align with the New Republic.
In the years that followed, Pima Drolley became Akiva's senator in the New Republic, and Brentin Lore Wexley was buried in accordance with Akivan customs.
As the First Order emerged, an emergency election resulted in the appointment of a sympathetic merchant as the new governor of Akiva.
