# Overview
Fondor was a planet located in the Colonies region.
Fondor had one moon in orbit.
It had a purple surface, covered with connecting bright lines and circles.
At the time of the Galactic Empire, Fondor was a large manufacturing hub for the Imperials, including dozens of orbital shipyards known as the Fondor Shipyards.
Fondor was a planet that was the site of two Rebel Alliance attacks against the Empire, which resulted in Imperial defeat.
Following the formation of the Galactic Empire, Fondor became a large manufacturing center, with its shipyards being equally on par with Scarif and Kuat.
Imperial Citizens, scientists, and officers that occupied Fondor became loyal to the Empire.
The Empire used this Shipyard notably as Imperial research and development of classified technologies.
 The Resistance came to Fondor requesting assistance but they refused.
Later, the shipyards were then seized by the First Order during the First Order/Resistance War.
The First Order sought out for the Resistance, trying to locate any trace of their whereabouts.
Despite being loyal to the Empire in the past, history of independence, and denial of helping the Resistance, they refused to give any information about the Resistance to the First Order, resulting in the death of a Fondor official under charges of treason.
The charges of treason were ordered by Supreme Chancellor Kylo Ren, seizing the shipyard.
