# Overview

Kashyyyk, the grassy planet home to the Wookies, is in the Mid Rim.
The Wookies are the native species that live on Kashyyyk; they are usually tall, furry, and strong.
Kashyyyk has been allied with the Galactic Republic and under imperial forces.
Later, it was a battleground for the fight, with Han Solo leading the Rebel alliance, and the opposing side being the Empire.
Kashyyyk has had its ups and downs throughout its lifetime.
For example, in 232 BBY, the Jedi made an outpost there.
Around twenty years later it was with the Trade Federation.
This shows Kashyyyk is not good, evil, or neutral; it’s been on all sides at one point.

The Clone Wars.
In the Clone Wars, Grand Master Yoda and Master Luminara Unduli were in a war against the Separatists.
With the help of the Wookies, they were able to win this war.
Chancellor Palpatine turned off the battle droids, and everything was going according to plan, or so the Jedi thought.
After this, a clone commander near Yoda had to take a holocall, with this, the word “execute order 66” was given.
As soon as the clone heard that, he and a few of his many went to kill Yoda, but Yoda could sense disruption in the force and managed to kill the clones.
Yoda thought quickly about this and set off with the Wookies to escape.
On the other hand, Luminara wasn’t so fortunate and was captured and arrested by the Clones.
This event of Luminara's capture would lead the Inquisitors’ by Darth Vader to capture the remaining Jedi in exile to come and assist but would later become Inquisitors or die as they were severely outnumbered.
