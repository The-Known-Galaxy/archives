Ziost was a cold-like, arid and rocky planet that happened to have a force vergence situated for the dark side and appeared to be like a second homeworld for the Sith where they formed some of their marks during the times of the Old Sith Empire and Adas’ Sith Empire.
It used to be a planet with warm weather conditions until an ice age occurred that caused the planet to be a glacial tundra with an arid climate; however, the atmosphere remained breathable.
Ziost was known to be within the Outer Rim Territories and has a hyperlane loop named “Nache Bhelfia”, a sun, 2 moons, and its grid coordinates are “R-4”.
The terrain is primarily composed of ice-formed landscape and tough mineral matter, occasionally having forests around because of the flora.
In these forests situate the felinoid repto mammals named vine cats while there also appear to be, in other regions, arachnids and arthropods that have deadly toxins they can discharge.

After the events the Sith left on this planet, it became nothing more than a forgotten planet with frozen remains although still possessing great dark power because of the ancient times.
