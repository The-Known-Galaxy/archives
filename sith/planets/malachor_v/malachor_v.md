# Overview

Malachor V, commonly known as Malachor, was a planet situated in the Outer Rim within the Chorlian Sector.
Its system bears the same name of Malachor System, and it is best known for its wasteland-like surface left barren and revolted by the Mass Shadow Generator during the Mandalorian Wars.
The planet is inhospitable, constantly ravaged by storms, and is only inhabited by beasts within those storms.
This volatile weather has made settling impossible by any means, and it remains a disclosed planet with no inhabitants to date.

# History and Decimation

Much of its history and possible natives are obscure, with little to no detail on the planet’s past.
It was then developed by the True Sith, an ancient and also relatively obscure sect.
An Academy for use of the Sith would be established on the planet’s surface and would be a prominent planet that is imbued with the Dark Side of the Force.
With the fall of the empire of the True Sith, so too would Malachor’s relevance as a strategic and valuable stronghold for the Sith as they retreated further unto the Unknown Regions.
The Sith Empire, led by the Emperor, would eventually establish itself on the planet, building the Trayus Academy.

The planet would remain particularly irrelevant until the Mandalorian Wars, becoming the ultimate standpoint of the war.
The Jedi General leading the Republic forces, Revan, would lure the Mandalorians into a trap by concentrating his forces on the planet, which in itself is taboo to the Mandalorians.
However, the opportunity was too much to resist taking advantage of and they would launch an attack upon the Republic’s armada.
Meetra Surik, later known as the Jedi Exile, would be given command of the force by Revan.

Revan would board Mandalore the Ultimate’s ship and slew him in combat, as the Mandalorians and the Republic’s ships would clash outside the system.
Sensing the battle turning against their favor, Meetra Surik would order the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator, crushing thousands of ships belonging to either Mandalorian or Republic as the yells and cries of hundreds would go silent.
În a single moment, Malachor's luscious and hospitable surface would quickly disintegrate into a shell of death and agony becoming a wasteland riddled with ships.
The destruction that occurred would ripple throughout the galaxy, even felt by those sensitive to the Force as the wound would open up, resulting in the chasms of death and the Dark Side expanding.

# Aftermath and Legacy

As a result of the battle, the Mandalorian forces would be utterly crushed by the Republic’s weapon, resulting in victory and spelling a state of decline amongst the Mandalorians from this point onwards.
Seeking to find the former masters of Malachor, Revan and Malak would venture to the Unknown Regions where they would confront the Sith Emperor and be turned into the Dark Side of the Force, being sent back to the Republic to wage a brutal war.
However, they would break free of his control instead, conquering large swathes for themselves, as Revan would proclaim himself Dark Lord of the Sith and spark the Revanites.
Trayus Academy would be used as a secret Sith base for the training and even conversion of captured Jedi, where Revan would establish his Order.
The sheer Dark Side energy of the planet and its environment would tatter the resolve of the captured Jedi, bringing darkness out and strengthening the Dark Side’s influence.
Most captured would become fanatic Dark Jedi and servants for the Dark Lord’s use.

```
Years after Revan’s betrayal, his former master Kreia would venture to the planet in search of Revan’s cause of corruption, only to be corrupted herself by the planet’s Dark Side energy.
```

Due to this, she would take up the title Darth Traya, Lord of Betrayal, and would seek to instigate her own Sith Order; utilizing Trayus Academy as her base to train two apprentices to the Dark Side, Nihilus and Sion.
The two would become powerful in their own right, forming a Sith Triumvirate which would nearly purge all Jedi from the Galaxy.
Eventually, her former apprentices would rise up against her and oust her power and titles effectively exiling her.

Eventually, the planet would be destroyed by the Jedi Exile, Meetra Surik utilizing the Mass Shadow Generator once again to fully decimate the planet, laying waste to its shell and ending the corruption that had plagued within as only asteroids and wreckage of ships remain to remind the galaxy of the grim events of the final battle of the Mandalorian Wars.
Its reputation would become fear itself, as no one would dare venture into its wreckage.
