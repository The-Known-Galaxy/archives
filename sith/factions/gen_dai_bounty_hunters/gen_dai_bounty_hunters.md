# Information
Gen’Dai Bounty Hunters were not only tall, large, and immortal-like beasts, but had many special abilities that came in handy, which included the ability to revitalize after death - especially during and after the High Republic era.
Somewhere in 200 BBY, a Gen’Dai named Rayvis stumbled upon a fallen Jedi Knight by the name of Dagan Gera and fought.
Rayvis’ defeat eventually marked the beginning of a life vow as a sign of eternal loyalty to his new master, where he would assist him in disorderly activity, until Dagan’s disappearance not long after.
However, the pair eventually united during the prime of the Galactic Empire centuries later.

# Section 1
Like Rayvis, another bounty hunter named Durge had a notorious status for being a fierce and powerful opponent who worked for the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
During the Clone Wars, he was known for being extremely unkillable at the time, as he had fought a variety of higher ranking Jedi and troopers, where none had the opportunity to successfully defeat, nor weaken him.
He became rather fearsome across the pirate communities across the galaxy, where he even managed to frighten experienced leaders.
Therefore, he came in contact with very few pirates throughout his life, as they wanted nothing to do with him or his businesses.



# Section 2
He was eventually employed by the Galactic Empire in 3 ABY, many years after the Clone Wars, to fulfill a contract that required him to apprehend weapons smuggler Ebann Drake aboard the abandoned spaceship "Opal Empress." On the ship, he unintentionally came across a few doctors, notably Lona Aphra, who reminded him that parasitic cymotes were concurrently infesting the ship.
As they decided to resolve this issue by pairing up, Aphra betrayed Durge and blew him into space, where he somehow managed to survive.
Following this encounter, Durge was determined to become a part of bounty hunter guilds, where he was ultimately tasked with finishing other challenging assignments throughout the rest of his lifetime.
