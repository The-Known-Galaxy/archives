# Overview
The Emperor’s Royal Shadow Guards were an elite group of force-sensitive soldiers that served Emperor Palpatine during the reign of the Galactic Empire.
These guards were Royal Guards, Sun Guards, and fallen Jedi who had turned to the dark side of the Force and served the Emperor’s will.
They were trained by Darth Vader and received orders from his master, Emperor Palpatine.
Shadow guards were usually tasked with guarding his excellency, as well as hunting down surviving Jedi and other force users who threatened his reign.

# History
Shortly before the end of the Clone Wars, sith apprentice Count Dooku tasked Asajj Ventress with hunting down and eliminating most of the Sun Guard, a mercenary faction on the planet Thyrsus.
Those who survived and displayed complete loyalty to Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious were enlisted in the Red Guard and later the Imperial Royal Guard after the rise of the Galactic Empire.
Those found to be force-sensitive were enlisted in the Emperor’s Shadow Guard.

17 years before the Battle of Yavin, two of the Emperor’s Shadow Guard were sent to a Golan defense platform orbiting the planet Byss to serve Inquisitor Valin Draco during a training mission.
The platform was attacked by the Alderaanian resistance, forcing the Shadow Guard into combat against resistance fighters who boarded the platform.

One lone Shadow Guard, along with several Imperial Naval Commandos were later sent to Nar Shaddaa when Galen Marek, otherwise known as Starkiller, attempted to find Jedi Master Rahm Kota in a bar called the Undertow.
After making a commotion trying to find Kota’s whereabouts, the Shadow Guard was killed when Starkiller used Force Maelstrom to blow him out of the bar.
Having eliminated the threat, Starkiller fled to Cloud City.

4 Shadow Guards were later deployed to Cloud City to assassinate Starkiller and Rahm Kota.
but were eliminated by Starkiller in combat.
On Raxus Prime, PROXY disguised himself as a Shadow Guard in an attempt to kill Starkiller.
The rogue apprentice would later encounter a real Shadow Guard at the Imperial Ore Facility, who was easily defeated by Starkiller when he pushed the guard into an ore cannon, incinerating him.

One final known Shadow Guard led the last line of defense of Palpatine’s watchtower aboard the first Death Star, but was later defeated by Starkiller.



# Equipment
The Emperor’s Shadow Guards were equipped with the same armour as the standard Royal Guards, only with the colours of the visor and armour itself being inverted.
Unlike the Royal Guards, however, Shadow Guards were equipped with red lightsaber pikes rather than the standard force pikes.
