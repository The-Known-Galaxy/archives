# Overview
The InterGalactic Banking Clan (often abbreviated to IGBC or IBC) was one of the most powerful and influential commerce guilds during the age of the Galactic Republic.
It was a conglomerate of Muunilinst’s Council of Banking Clans, along with other important banking powers.
The IBC’s influence spanned across the entire Galaxy, even extending to the nearest satellite galaxy.
The Tonith family, one of the most powerful Muun families, oversaw the IBC.
The Clan had heavy connections to the Order of the Sith Lords, as Darth Tenebrous manipulated the organization from the inside.
Even though during the Clone Wars Chairman San Hill allied himself with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the IBC itself stayed neutral throughout most of its history.
After a scandal related to the IBGC leader Rush Clovis, the organization was placed directly under the Office of the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, nationalizing the banks.

# Organization
The IBC facilitated the movement of credits and financial data, alongside other currencies across the galaxy.
The institution ventures used to connect this flow of currency were all controlled by the key representatives of the oldest and most prominent banking families.
Iotran soldiers always accompanied IGBC staff, and although it had the reputation of being a consumer-friendly organization, it had a sizable army of droids and Iotran military personnel called the  “Collections and Security division”.
Members of the IBC were mostly financiers, accountants and lawyers.
The hierarchy of the Banking Clan included the most important ranks in the most valuable planets controlled by the Muuns, such as Mygeeto or Muunilinst.
The Chairman of the Clan stood at the top of the hierarchy.



# History
The IBC was founded around the time the Galactic Republic was created.
The Banking Clan funded governmental institutions and had control over countless commerce guilds, trade corporations and shipping cartels.
By 1000 BBY, the IGBC was very powerful, and was known to be a far better option for transactions, as they were more honest and less corrupt than Core World-based banks.
At some point, Aargau was made one of its key worlds, resting in the boundaries between the Core Worlds.
The IGBC was a very important piece of the Sith’s Grand Plan.
Caar Damask owed his ascension to Chairman to the Bith Sith Lord Darth Tenebrous, and in exchange for the help he was given, Tenebrous received his son Hego Damask, who would rise to become the great Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Plagueis, as his Apprentice.
Plagueis would make use of the IBC’s finances to aid the Grand Plan.
During the Separatist Crisis, the IBC had a clearly pro-Separatist stance, sending propaganda messages inside of their own data server.
The IGBC also aided the Separatist financially with weapons and Hailfire droids, although the Banking Clan denied all accusations of arming the Separatists.
Chancellor Palpatine made a deal with the IBC, in which he would secretly open many tax-free accounts which provided funds to allies of the Clan, while the IGBC supported Palpatine in the Galactic Senate.
During the Clone Wars, the IBC supplied the Confederacy of Independent Systems with a number of security forces, including battle droids.
The IGBC later commissioned the manufacture of larger numbers of IG-series droids, including General Grievous’ elite IG-100 MagnaGuards.
The Chairman of the IBC, San Hill, allied himself with the Confederacy of Independent Systems through a deal from which both ends would profit the most.
During the Battle of Muunilinst, droids of the Banking Clan were assaulted, and Durge, the new commander of the IG droids, was defeated in battle.
San Hill was captured, but was later given the chance to escape captivity.
Senator Rush Clovis represented the interests of the IGBC in the Galactic Senate, Despite him being found to be allied with the Separatist army, the IGBC was never prosecuted, as it was far too important for the economic stability of the Republic.
After the Battle of Muunilinst, the IGBC headquarters moved to Scipio.
Rush Clovis was then chosen as the new head of the IBC.
However, Count Dooku, who secretly endorsed his rise to power, blackmailed him to levy debts against the Republic, forcing him to be evicted along with Scipio’s droid army.
After Clovis’ death, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine took control of the banks, making him gain more political power for his planned takeover of the galaxy.
The IGBC also funded Grievous’ reconstruction through the same technology used to save the life of Darth Vader.
During the Imperial Era, the IGBC survived as the creditor for the Empire’s currency.
The Empire allowed the Muuns to keep living, but had near full control over their governments and economy.
After the establishment of the New Republic, the IGBC became the creditor for both the Rebel Alliance and the Empire.
