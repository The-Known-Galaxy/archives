# Introduction
The Legions of Lettow were a group of acolytes and apprentices of the Kashi Mer dynasty exile.
It Was one of the earliest breakaway sects of the Jedi Order but was eventually defeated during a violent war against the Jedi.

# History of Xendor
In the early days of the Jedi Order, the Kashi Mer exile Xendor studied on the planet of Ossus which was the main fortress world of the Jedi Order with a culture primarily devoted to the study of the Force.
Jedi Knight Xendor was a well-respected man within his order, however, he opposed the order’s views on the Force and deemed it as exclusionary.
One of his most notable allies was a follower of the Steel Hand of Palawa named Arden Lyn.
The two had shared many philosophies and views outside of the Jedi High Council’s reach, forming a close bond with each other and engaging in a relationship.
The Jedi Knight was frustrated by the Jedi High Council’s ignorance, so he boldly approached them in hopes of opening a new academy far from Ossus to explore the darker aspects of the Force.
To his disappointment, his ideas were rejected by the council and so he traveled to the planet of Lettow, opening a new academy focusing on the teachings of Bogan.



# The war
Around 24 500 BBY, a war had erupted between the Legion of Lettow and the Jedi Order.
According to most Jedi historians, General Xendor alongside his legionaries were the ones to lead the attack on the Jedi while others believe that the Jedi declared a war against them due to their bond with the darkside.
The most detailed version of these events were provided by Imperial Grand Inquisitor Laddinare Torbin, stating that it was the Jedi Order who raised an army first so Xendor took up the title of General and attacked Ossus to prevent massive amounts of slaughter.
The war between the Jedi Order and the Legions had thrived in Chandrila, Metellos, Brentaal IV, and Coruscant.
The war ended with Xenor’s tragic death which allowed Arden Lyn to take command of the legions and the academy.
