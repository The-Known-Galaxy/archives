Members prioritized nature over modern technology, even creating tech to enhance this connection.

# History of the Church of Force

High Republic Era (around 382 BBY):
Represented by Kilan T'Dara at the Jedha's Convocation of the Force, the Church had a section in the Temple of the Kyber.
Resamond Saous served as prefect, with Keth Cerepath as adjunct.
Around 231 BBY, the San Tekka clan was affiliated with the Church on Naboo.

Imperial Era:
As the Empire hunted Jedi Knights, the Church became clandestine.
Lor San Tekka, a member, rejected the Empire's depiction of Jedi and preserved Jedi history.
He later aided Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi, in his quest for Jedi lore.

New Republic Era:
During this era, the Church had greater liberty.
Lor San Tekka held a map fragment to the missing Luke Skywalker.
He gave the map to Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, believing the Jedi's return essential for the Force's balance.
Despite his subsequent death at Kylo Ren's hands, Rey, a Force-sensitive scavenger, found Luke using the map.
