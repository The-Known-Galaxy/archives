# Overview

House Thul was an Alderaanian noble house founded sometime shortly before 3700 BBY.
Its members were descendants of a wealthy merchant who was able to buy his way into the nobility, which the house took great pride in.
House Thul specialized in trade negotiations and was essential in maintaining the economy of Alderaan.

# History

Following its inception into the Alderaanian nobility, House Thul would for many decades be tormented by its youthfulness.
Although it had proven itself to be very capable in specific areas such as trade and economic issues, the house was unable to marry into the royal family due to its relatively young age.
To counter this problem, House Thul switched a House Organa baby with a child of House Thul.
This child was to be a potential bride for the crown prince, however, the plan was foiled by the Jedi, and the entire house was exiled from Alderaan by the Alderaanian parliament.
During this exile, the Imperial diplomatic service contacted House Thul and pledged the Sith Empireâ€™s support for the house in its desperation for restored glory.
With this imperial support, House Thul joined the Alderaanian Civil War following the Republics' withdrawal from the planet in hopes of installing a Thul on the Alderaanian throne.
This war would pit House Thul against the republic-backed House Organa, initiating a bloody struggle that encompassed the entire planet and many noble houses.
While it is unknown who won this war, considering that House Organa was the royal house during the time of the Galactic Empire, one could assume that House Organa won in its bid for the throne of Alderaan.
