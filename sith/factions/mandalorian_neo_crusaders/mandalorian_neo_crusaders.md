# Description
In 3978 BBY the Neo Crusaders were formally formed by Mand’alor the Ultimate, it was an order consisting of multiple Mandalorian aliits uniting under one banner to start a Galactic Crusade.

The Crusade was originally formed after the Great Sith War due to the discontent and hatred for the Siths and Jedis by the Mandalorian Elders.
The Mandalorian Neo Crusaders went into the war head on, conquering worlds after others.

The war originally started on Althir, the forces of Althir being ten times the size of the Neo Crusader’s strength, but as the fog cleared and the day started anew on Althir, the Crusaders had won their first conquest, defining the start of the Mandalorian Crusade which was to last for close to two decades.

As the war went on, planets fell more and more to the Crusader’s might, people were given a choice, join as forced warriors and soldiers for the Crusade or to become forced workers for the might of the Neo Crusaders, collecting resources for the Mandalorians to fuel the Crusade, however the Mandalorians were blinded, unable to see the opportunity to use the now captured industries of the planet that they could use to product weapons and more armors for the growing numbers of the Crusaders.

However all these setbacks did not stop the Mandalorians who managed to form themselves a large fleet of vessels, carriers, starfighters, dreadnoughts and battleships, showing that they could rival the Sith and Jedi navy themselves.
As the war went on, the Mandalorians managed to show their true military might, conquering multiple planets, however the blaze of glory was not meant to last, as they were soon to face one of their biggest challengers, a group of Jetii Verd lead by the one and only Knight Revan.

It is on the battle of Malachor V that the Crusade eventually ended, at the hands of Jedi Knight Revan, the forces of Neo Crusaders, near victory, almost on the verges of destroying the Republic once and for all, taking over all their planets and destroying most of their forces, until the worst struck.

A duel between Revan and Mand’alor the Ultimate was happening in the midst of Malachor V’s massive battle, however, the one ultimate warrior came out on top, and another strong warrior fell, that being Mand’alor the Ultimate, bringing him and the Crusade to meet their end.
The Mandalorian forces abandoned the Crusade scattering and went back into small clans, going back to their old ways of Mandalorians fighting in broken clans once again, marking an end to one of Mandalorians crusades And the end of Malachor V’s ecosystem by the hands of Revan.

Eventually as years went on, the Neo-Crusaders were reformed, however the days were different, they became known thugs and pirates, they had no precise goals until one day they were tasked with assisting in fighting the Dar’Jetii, which Mand’alor agreed, leading the battle on Telos IV, winning and defeating the Siths along with Darth Nihilus’s ship, the Ravager.
