# Overview

The Exchange was a criminal enterprise that was active from around 4000 BBY to 3643 BBY and was considered the most powerful crime organization of its time.
The Exchange dealt in Spice refinement and distribution, smuggling, extortion, weapons trafficking, slave trading, and bounty hunting.
This organization was active on many worlds and would employ notorious bounty hunters, such as Calo Nord.

During the First Jedi Purge of 3954 BBY, the Exchange would post lucrative bounties on live Jedi, some large enough to purchase an entire planet in some cases.
Three hundred years later during the Cold War of 3653 BBY, the Exchange would engage in a galaxy-wide crime war with the Hutt Cartel, centering on Nar Shaddaa.

# Organization

The Exchange was a powerful criminal organization whose main base of operations was along the Outer Rim Territories of the galaxy, most likely as a way to help keep the attention from the central government from the Core Worlds to a minimum and operate more discreetly.
This organization was headed by an unknown and mysterious individual who others called the Compeer, along with a standard criminal command structure.
The only known way to get into the group was to be nominated by several other crime lords who belonged to this organization.

The Exchange organized and maintained various criminal cells on various worlds of interest, where each planetary cell was led by a boss who helped to maintain the Exchange's interests on the planet in question.
The bosses would report to sector chiefs who operated under secret identities, usually living normal lives compared to the bosses, and had no cells of their own.

The bosses would communicate with the sector chiefs through discreet means such as secret and secured holo-comm channels and in turn, the sector chiefs reported to the head of the Exchange.
Oftentimes they would use sham fronts and fake businesses to help with their operations, such as the Citadel Station’s Bumani Exchange Corporation.

# History

Sometime during the First Jedi Purge, some well-known Exchange bosses during this period were Davik Kang, who operated on the planet Taris, and Loppak Slusk.
who operated on the planet Telos IV, and Goto, who operated on the Hutt world of Nar Shaddaa.
During the Jedi Civil War of 3959 BBY, the Exchange would be briefly yet significantly involved with, and damaged by, both Revan and Meetra Surik, also known as the Exile.

In the year 3956 BBY, Revan was able to infiltrate the Exchange's headquarters on the world of Taris and kill the operating boss there, Davik Kang.
Five years after Davik’s demise, Meetra Surik would arrive on Nar Shaddaa, the largest moon of the Hutt homeworld of Nal Hutta.
There Surik would eliminate the crime lords Saquesh and Visquis and destroy the Visionary, thus destabilizing the Exchange's base of operations on Nar Shaddaa.

Eventually, the leading crime boss of Nar Shaddaa, who went by Goto, would reveal themselves.
Usually, the boss would hide their identity by using a hologram, however, Goto decided to reveal their true identity and much to the surprise of many Goto wasn’t an organic being but instead a droid designation was G0-T0.

G0-T0 involved itself with the Exchange as a way to fulfill its programming.
Its task was to help stabilize the Galactic Republic through any means necessary.
Its smuggling rings caused the deaths of people and organizations G0-T0 considered “destabilizers”, helped to bring unofficial profits to entire sectors, and helped to strengthen and solidify Republic worlds that would’ve otherwise been ignored and left poor.

Believing the biggest problems with the Republic revolved around the Jedi and Sith conflict, along with the Jedi Civil War, G0-T0 would place hits or bounties on both Jedi and Sith.
The reason being that the fewer Jedi or Sith there are in the galaxy, the less fighting there would be overall in the galaxy.
G0-T0 was simply following its programming and wanted to keep the Republic stable and its infrastructure together since the Jedi Civil War caused much devastation across Republic Space.

The droid would eventually accompany the Exile in hopes of stabilizing the galaxy.
G0-T0 would, unfortunately, meet its end on Malachor V when the Mass Shadow Generator was reactivated and destroyed the entire planet.

During the Cold War Era and by 3653 BBY, the Exchange would continue its existence and operations in the following years.
In this era, one of the Exchange's crime lords would sponsor one Jewl’a Nightbringer into the Great Hunt, as by this point the Exchange had become a major rival of the Hutt Cartel.

The crime boss of Nar Shaddaa during this time was Ukabi.
An Imperial diplomat named Maro Vizhen tried to recruit Ukabi into the Shadow Syndicate, a criminal group made up of several crime lords who allied themselves with the Sith Empire.
Ukabi would refuse the offer and a major crime war broke out between the Exchange and the Shadow Syndicate, which resulted in Ukabi’s death.

After the incident on Nar Shaddaa, the Sith Empire would outlaw the Exchange and actively hunt down its members within Sith space and sometimes even outside of it.
