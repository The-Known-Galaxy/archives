Eagle’s network was a terrorist organization originally started by Darth Jadus but handed to a human male under the name Eagle.
After the organization knew they were suspected, they launched two attacks; one on Kaas City’s generators and one on the flagship named Dominator.
Both attacks succeeded, the impact left on the flagship was slightly greater though.

It was later renamed the Eradicator network, taking inspiration from the Sith Empire’s exotic satellite weapons the terrorists sought to utilize and research.
Their ideals were soon prevented by the Imperial Intelligence agent Cipher Nine alongside Kaliyo Djannis who infiltrated their research sites, conducting their plans and putting an end to the organization’s reign once and for all.
