# Overview

Inferno Squad, also known as Inferno Squadron was an Imperial special forces commando unit which operated during the times of the Galactic Civil War.
The squad was commanded by Iden Versio.
It was first commissioned to catch and eliminate a group called Dreamers, an extremist group composed of former members of Saw Garreraâ€™s Partisans.
They were later utilised again by Iden's father, Admiral Garrick Versio as part of a new operation named Operation Cinder.
When the operation targeted the planet Vardos, Iden along with Del Meeko and most of Inferno Squad's crew went rogue and joined the New Republic.
A man named Gideon Hask however, remained with Garrick and the Empire.
Inferno Squad overall was an elite group that served near directly under the Emperor and carried out his wishes.
