# Introduction

The Czerka Corporation was an old distasteful business during the days of the old republic in 3964 BBY up to the era of the Galactic Republic during 4 ABY, this business was known to do many horrendous things such as enslaving thousands of wookies during Darth Revan's time as a Jedi and would use them to have instant brutes of nature to help store their weapons and experiments that were used to secretly aid the Sith Order.
During the time of the era of Darth Nihilius they were doing reconstruction on the native grounds of Telos IV and became a pest to the land’s nature.
Because of this the fallen Jedi Meetra Surik helped them after the Native Ithorians sought him to take down the Czerka Corporation on Telos IV exposing them of their crimes.
Of course, this was still not enough to expose them and be rid of them for good as they were still a threat on Tatooine since the days of Darth Revan, they were still using illegal practices on the planet and were known to use the ancient Rakata’s nanotechnology to control the minds of the people and even some Czerka employees that found themselves going to close to the secrets they were hiding, they were in charge of a mind prison found from an ancient Rakata known as the imprisoned one, from here they would be stopped and there was no knowledge of the Czerka Corporation until the Galactic Empire years away from the rise of Darth Revan where the timeline was past 0 ABY the Galactic Empire would use the Czerka Corporation to enslave the wookies and ultimately have their final evil deeds until 4 ABY the last known data of the Czerka Corporation where the Galactic Empire was defeated and replaced by the Galactic Republic.
