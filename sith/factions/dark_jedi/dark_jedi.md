# Overview
Despite the name and its origins, Dark Jedi did not just mean a Jedi who had fallen.
It could be referred to any force-sensitive being who had been seduced by the dark side but was neither Sith nor a member of the Imperial Inquisitorius, thus being unaffiliated and instead working in their own interest.
Ultimately, it simply meant dark side practitioners that did not formally belong to any dark side organisation.
Historians believe the first Dark Jedi was a man named Xendor, the first fallen Jedi.
Other ancient and perhaps the most famous Dark Jedi, were the group that were exiled from the Jedi Order following the Second Great Schism.
They arrived on Korriban, radically shifting the course of history as they ruled over the ancient Sith Species advance and shape what would be known as the Old Sith Empire.

Although some Dark Jedi were unassociated with the Sith, some worked under them over different eras.
In the Clone Wars, Count Dooku used Asajj Ventress and Sora Bulq, while Palpatine had the Inquisitors do his and Darth Vader’s bidding.
