# Overview

Their leader was the Supreme Prophet.

# History

The Prophets of the Dark Side were founded by Darth Millennial.
They arose in Dromund Kaas, specifically on the Outer Rim, and they were formed by Sith Lords from the Order of the Sith Lords.

These Prophets were trained to predict the outcome of any future event, one of them being the destruction of the Death Stars by the Rebel Alliance.
In order to predict the actual outcome of the events, they would check all their information regarding said event.

After a few years of being established in the Dark Force Temple, Palpatine discovered Dromund Kaas and the Prophets, making them also work for him.
Before the Jedi Purge, Palpatine appointed Dark Jedi Kadann as the Supreme Prophet, being one of the Emperor’s most trusted advisors.
As well, the True Prophets viewed Palpatine as an enemy instead of a leader because of his attitude against Supreme Prophet Kadann’s predictions.
