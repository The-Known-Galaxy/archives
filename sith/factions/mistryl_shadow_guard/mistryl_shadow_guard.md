# Overview
The Mistryl Shadow Guard was a privileged group of female human mercenaries.
Their job in the galaxy was to work for different organizations and factions to trade for a desired amount of capital.
They usually operated aggressively and the missions they executed usually entangled a ton of brutality.
They were never standing on any team’s side and were solely in it for the money.
They would however refuse to work for the Galactic Empire.
They were in desperate need of money because they needed to fund their homeworld, Emberlene, to support their vulnerable communities.
The group went through the hardships of the galaxy and had a tempestuous history.

Three years before the destruction of Emberlene, the planet was in its absolute form.
The civilization of Emberlene was wealthy, powerful, and confrontational.
They conquered several planets in their sector for wealth and power.
They stole riches and destroyed the valuable items they could not bring with them.

The other neighboring planets got tired of this monstrosity and got together to employ a mercenary army.
The mercenary army destroyed Emberlene in an instant.
It pushed their framework to the ground and caused poverty to break out all over the planet.
They used air strikes and firestorms to eradicate the populated provinces.


After the mass destruction, the ruling council of the planet, the Eleven Elders, told a tremendous falsehood that changed the course of the entire planet.
They told the younger generations that the Galactic Empire caused the destruction as a warning to the rest of the galaxy.


This lie made the population of Emberlene grow fearful, and they developed a strong hatred for the empire.
That’s when the Mistryl Shadow Guard was instituted.
Their members gathered money to support the inhabitants of the planet that were left.
They refused to work for the Empire because they trusted the elders.
