# Overview
The Sorcerers of Tund were an ancient order of dark side users from the planet of Tund which was located within the Outer Rim territories of the galaxy.
The Sorcerers were well-known for their dark, shadowy, and Sith-like robes and outfits.
Their talents with the Force were high-powered which was proven due to their mastery of deception, Force illusions, and even shapeshifting.
The Sorcerers rarely left their home however and were also noted to have been driven to insanity by their explorations and experimentations with the Force.

# History
The Sorcerers of Tund first established themselves on the planet Tund sometime after the Great Hyperspace War of 5000 BBY and also sometime around one of the Great Schisms on the teachings and philosophy of the Force.
The Sorcerers first started out as a group of exiled pure-blooded Sith Kissai, though they were also believed by the Jedi to have been descendants of Sith pure-bloods who were also exiled from the planet Korriban.

However, when they came to be on Tund, they quickly established a Sith pure-blood society that combined science, ontology, and magic together.
Through their encounters with the Rakatans, whether it was through Rakatan scriptures or in-person Rakatans, they became convinced of the idea that all living sentient beings are Force-Sensitive and connected through The Force.
They also called it the Unity.

The Jedi at this time viewed the Sorcerers as nothing more than another harmless dark side cult, however, that would change during both the Restoration and the reign of terror by the Sorcerer's leader, Karnak Tetsu during the Great Sith War of 3996 BBY.
After these events, the Jedi Order attempted to convert members of the Sorcerers Tund over to the light by trying to convince them to use the Force without the use or assistance of their magical mysticism.
When the Jedi had failed to convert all of their members, they instead chose to monitor and ensure that they didn’t fall too far towards the dark side.

As the years went by, the Sorcerers were no longer under the watchful eye of the Jedi Order as numerous events and crises had forced them to relocate their attention and resources elsewhere for more important matters regarding the Republic.
After the Galactic Republic's conversion to the Galactic Empire, the first emperor of the Galactic Empire, Sheev Palpatine, saw no point in continuing surveillance with the Sorcerers as he deemed his Imperial Navy fit to deal with them should the need arise.

The Sorcerers of Tund would eventually meet their end in 22 BBY at the hands of a Croke member.
Since the Sorcerers were quite welcoming of outsiders into their ranks and cult, Rokur Gepta joined the Sorcerers as a means to gain their knowledge and learn their secrets.
However, when there was nothing more to learn and their usefulness was at an end, Rokur launched an electromagnetic torpedo at Tund, killing all life on the planet including the Sorcerers.

With the cult either dead or scattered, Rokur became the last member of the Sorcerers until he met his end at the hands of the renowned gambler and charmer, Lando Calrissian.
Thus, officially ending the order of the Sorcerers of Tund.
There was a possibility that there could’ve been members outside of Tund, though, it was rare for them to venture outside of their homeworld.
