# Overview
The Dread Host, commonly referred to as the Dread Guard, consisted of a group with brainwashed Imperials and Sith under the rule of the Dread Masters.
The Dread Masters were six extremely powerful Lords that acted under the rule of the Emperor.
They served as Prophets, generals, and Advisors.
The Dread Hosts were used to secure artifacts, resources, and important locations for the Empire's benefit.
They were sent out in campaigns and participated in missions on multiple planets.

# Section I
The Dread Hosts ruled only under the Dread Masters, acting as an opposition towards both the Republic and Sith Empire.
These individuals could be recruited, but were mostly tortured in the mind and brainwashed.
Soldiers who joined the Dread Hosts typically kept their gear and used it in battle, until they were encountered on Oricon, where a uniform change was present, with the color scheme favoring red.
Precise origins of the Dread Host were unknown to all, but the planets they were typically deployed to were.
Many of the Dread Hosts were on the brink of insanity, which led to many problems not only in battle but also caused difficulty with staying loyal to the Dread Masters.
