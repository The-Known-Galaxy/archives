# Introduction

When it comes to crime organizations, few are greater and more powerful than the Pyke Syndicate.
Also known as the Pyke Family, The Syndicate, or The Pykes, this ruthless group of criminals was at the forefront of dealing in raw spice.
This raw spice was the main ingredient in creating a powerful drug commonly used across the galaxy.
The Pyke Syndicate became one of the most powerful crime families in the galaxy by creating a monopoly over this spice, and by being the best and transporting and selling it.

# Section 1

Hailing from their homeworld, Oba Diah, the Pyke Syndicate almost entirely controlled the flow of spice throughout the galaxy.
This shady organization did not do it alone, however, as they had many alliances and dealings with other groups.
These groups include the Black Sun, Maul’s Shadow Collective, the Crimson Dawn, and the Hutt Clan.
Through illegal dealings with these other organizations, the Pyke Syndicate constantly acted on what would make them the most money and give them the most power.

# Section 2

Although many might believe it, the Pyke Syndicate are not simply smugglers and criminals.
The family possessed a powerful army of troops, known simply as the Pyke Syndicate Foot Soldiers.
Soldiers in this group often were seen carrying CC-420 pistols, or larger rifles given to them.
There was also a larger, more fierce type of soldier at the Pykes’ disposal: the Pyke Sentinel.
These well-trained, powerful warriors were armed with larger, more specialized weapons, including electro-staffs, stun spears, and blaster turrets.

The Pykes used their formidable forces in a variety of ways.
Their footsoldiers and Sentinels would often be seen accompanying the Pykes’ freighters as they moved spice from planet to planet.
These forces were not simply security forces, however.
The Pykes participated in the Syndicate War, a great war between rival criminal gangs and drug smuggling organizations.

# Section 3

While the Pyke Syndicate at one time was a terrifying force ruling the drug trade across the galaxy, by 18 ABY, the Syndicate’s power had faded greatly.
While they still had holdings and power in some parts of the galaxy, many losses to individuals such as Boba Fett, Ahsoka Tano, and the mercenary Ledesmar caused their grasp on the drug trade to slip.
