# Overview

The First Order, or simply known as the Order.
Located in the Unknown Regions of the Galaxy, during the New Republic era.
The first ruler of this so-called Order, was named “The Supreme Leader”, who had his base in a mobile headquarters instead of a traditional planetary capital.
This dictatorship was a militaristic one that was planning to remove disorder from existence.
Their main wish was to launch an invasion within the Galaxy but they were stopped by The Resistance and Jedi Order, causing the First Order to disintegrate.

# History

The Galactic Order kept peace within the Galaxy for roughly a millennium, with the assistance of The Jedi Order and The Judicial Forces.
They thought that the extinction of Sith was proven, until the ruling Dark Lord Darth Sidious was discovered for his evil thoughts of secretly plotting to overthrow The Republic with the creation of his own Sith Empire.
He and his Apprentice Darth Tyranus arranged the Separatist Crisis, provoking political chaos around the Galaxy.
Throughout the next three-year period of time, Sidious and his Apprentice created a so-called Confederacy of Independent Systems, a rival galactic government.
A conflict broke out, named “The Clone Wars”.
Sidious, or “Sheev Palpatine” served as a Grand Chancellor during that period, even though his time expired a long time ago.
After Palpatine managed to complete his plan by overseeing the future of the Galactic Empire, falling.
He and his new Apprentice Darth Vader, would go on and construct the First Death Star, which was destroyed by Luke Skywalker.
The Empire suffered a great defeat at the Battle of Endor where, along with the Second Death Star which was abolished, both The Emperor and Darth Vader were destroyed.
After some time, The First Order was born, with Emperor Snoke as its leader.
After the dethroning of Emperor Snoke, who was killed by his own Apprentice, the new Supreme Leader became Kylo Ren.

# Organization, Culture, Economy and Infrastructure

The Supreme Leader, a self-appointed role, was the one who had the most power over The First Order and its army.
This created a higher-ranked cadre which was named the First Order High Command, who had the authority to govern The First Order in the Supreme Leader’s name.
A “commanding triumvirate” within The First Order was formed, which was composed of Kylo Ren, General Armitage Hux and Captain Phasma, the leaders of Starkiller Base.

The people grew up in isolation, in the far side of the Galaxy, in the Unknown Regions.
In the past, they’ve adopted a radical fascist neo-Imperialism political ideology, basing it’s worth on a fanatical devotion to the totalitarian notions of “order” and violent disdain for the New Republic and democracy.

The First Order’s economy was tightly kept alive because of the situation they were in.
They had deals with Artech-Loratus Corporation, Rebaxan Columni, Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems and more.
Some of their military’s major arms manufacturers are Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc.
and BlasTech.

The First Order had the airwaves infrastructure under state oversight and tight restrictions and censorship imposed on it.
They used a form of Holographic Technology that could show the user in full color and lacked any scan lines as part of its communications system.
