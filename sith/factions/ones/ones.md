# Introduction
The Ones commonly known as the Mortis gods were a family of formidable
Force wielders that lived on the planet Mortis.
They were a family of three composed of a dark side user son, a daughter who was won with the light, and a father, who was a balance.
The Father's job was to control both siblings and make sure there was always a balance in the force.
As long as the father stayed alive the two others would live forever with great power unless killed.
Their species were called Force Wielders which is a mysterious species with high force sensitivity and the ability to change into different forms.
They were considered gods.

# Section 1
The Son was a male Force wielder who was selfish and truly embodied the dark side of the force.
He was angry, bitter, and arrogant.
As the father grew weaker he looked for someone to take his place.
Eventually, after sending a mysterious help single out, Anakin Skywalker came alongside his padawan and his master to Mortis.
The Son was angry about his father's decisions and wanted to escape Mortis.
Despite the son's anger, he used this new arrival as an opportunity.
The Son wanted to turn Anakin to the dark side to help him escape, first starting by converting his Padawan.



# Section 2
The Daughter was a female Force wielder who was selfless and embodied the light side of the force.
She was humble and compassionate.
She also agreed with the Father's goals of keeping a balance in the force.
Despite her brother's obsession with the dark side she still loved him a lot.



# Section 3
The Father was a male Force wielder representing a balance of both the light and dark.
After Anakin declined The Father's offer of taking his spot he ran into a huge problem stopping him from leaving, his padawan had been brought to the dark side by The Son.
Anakin rushed to where The Son had taken his padawan but at this point, The Son was trying to kill The Father.
The Daughter insisted that Anakins Master retrieve The Dagger of Mortis to stop The Son from killing the father.
But by the time Anakin got back The Son had overpowered the Father due to his gaining in weakness and knocked him unconscious.
Once they returned they fought back against The Son.
In time The Son took The Dagger of Mortis and went to stab the father but the daughter got in the way giving her a fatal wound.
In her last moments, The Daughter told the father to combine the little bit of energy she had left to save Anakin's padawan's life, killing the daughter and saving the padawan.
Because of the imbalance of the force Mortis grew into darkness, which now brought The Son to his original goal, to convert Anakin to the dark side so he could escape.
The Son lured Anakin to a volcanic place deep in Mortis where he showed Anakin his dark future.
Anakin devastated by this vision, fell under The Son's control and asked The Son if he could help him stop this from happening.
The Son lied and said he would agree to help him.
After the padawan and master heard about The Son succeeding in converting Anakin the padawan sabotaged their ship so The Son and Anakin couldn't escape.
The Son went to get The Dagger so they could stop The Father again.
But this time despite The Father's weakness, he was able to take The Dagger from the son and then did something unexpected.
The Father stabbed himself as he fueled his kids' power.
Because of this, the son lost all his power making Anakin snap back to the light.
Anakin stabbed The Son with his lightsaber, making an end to The Ones and bringing a balance in the force back to Mortis.
