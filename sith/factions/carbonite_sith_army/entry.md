# Overview

The Carbonite Sith Army was an army found on a rocky planet.
It was formed of Sith troopers, frozen in strong carbonite, and then left in a storage hidden on the planet.
When entering the storage, a large statue representing the unknown Carbonite Sith Master could be seen at the head of the chamber.
It held an ignited Sith lightsaber in hand, while bearing the symbol of the Old Sith Empire in the place where the statue was erected.
The army was discovered after the famous Battle of Endor by Silri, a member of the Nightsisters Clan and dark witch of Dathomir.

# History

A large part of the history of the Carbonite Sith Army is unknown.
However, what is known is that at one point in time a high number of Sith troopers were frozen in carbonite, then placed in various rows in front of a hooded statue, called the Carbonite Sith Master, inside of a sealed tomb/vault.
They most likely were still alive, as when they were found, the casings were still blinking.
The location of the army was contained inside of a Holocron, the Carbonite Sith Army Holocron, which showed a diagram similar to the Star Map.
The Holocron was found by Silri, a prominent member of the Nightsisters Clan, which Tyber Zann and Urai Fen tried to steal at first, but it then was taken by Silri during a raid on Emperor Palpatine’s storage.
She then went to the planet shown on the Map, which is unidentified and simply referred to as “Carbonite Tomb”.
She then accessed the vault by inputting a code into a terminal next to a doorway, and saw the frozen Carbonite Sith Army.
