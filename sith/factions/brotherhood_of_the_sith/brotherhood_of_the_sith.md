# Overview
The brotherhood of the Sith or Sith brotherhood, in short, was a name for a group of former Jedi Knights who followed Dark Lord of the Sith Exar Kun to Yavin IV where they would be reborn as Sith.
The brotherhood would carry on the will of the Dark Lord alongside the Mandalorian crusaders and the Karth in the following Great Sith War and beyond.

# Deceived and Rebirth
The brotherhood began when Exar Kun traveled to Ossus just after the death of the revered Jedi Arca Jeth.
With his proficiency in persuasion and the current situation of the Jedi Order combined, 20 Jedi knights had been deceived by the Sith and followed him to Yavin IV with a promise to find “Ancient Jedi technique” for the purpose of strengthening the order.
Before the Dark Lord departed from Ossus, he did not forget to pay a visit to Odan-Urr.
a Jedi master and Jedi librarian who guarded the Sith Holocron.
With his might, Exar Kun was able to break into Odan-Urr’s chamber, slew the Jedi Master, and claimed his artifact.
However, fate itself seems to be against the Dark Lord of the Sith.
Just after he ended the Jedi Master’s life, his convinced knights found him in the act of claiming the artifact.
Utilizing his quick wit, Exar Kun proclaimed himself the successor of Odan-Urr.
Explained the death of the Jedi Master as a natural death after the burden of duty had been lifted from him and from now on the Sith shall be the guardian of Odan’s Holocron.
Increasingly impressed by the savior in their eyes, those knights would follow him to Yavin IV with no longer deliberation.
Contrasting to what they might have expected, Yavin IV was bloating with Dark Side energy.
The scenery of ruined temples and huge bestial Massasi warriors only amplified and sowed even more doubts into the mind of the Jedi.
One of the Jedi, Oss Wilum attempted to escape from the planet.
Fortunately, his attempt was a failure as he was stopped by Massasi warriors.

After Exar Kun realized how his plan was almost undone by the unresolving doubt, decided to feed them with one more lie.
He proclaimed that the reason they came to Yavin IV was to cleanse it from Dark Side influence.
Solidify his claim by explaining that the reason he brought Odar-Urr’s Holocron with him was to use it for the purification process.

Finally fully convinced, 20 Jedi Knights followed Exar Kun into the Sith temple.
The Dark Lord shattered the Holocron of Odan-Urr, instead of the purification they had been promised, they got brainwashed and fell into the Dark Side from the sinister influence of the Sith Lord’s teaching which got released.



# The first Test
The former Jedi knights now the Brotherhood of the Sith embraced the teaching of Exar Kun wholeheartedly.
Their education on the Dark Side went well without much trouble.
When Kun was confident in their abilities, he initiated a test and a mission for all of his students called “The Jedi Program”.
This program made his disciples go back to their former Jedi Masters and assassinated them.
It was a huge success, most of his students succeeded, proving the Sith’s superiority.
Although some had failed.
Unable to kill their masters or defeat their masters at the cost of their own lives.



# Defeat
After the capture of Ulic Qel-Droma, Exar Kun decided to invade the Jedi Library on Ossus.
The successful rescue of his apprentice revealed the treachery of the Death Witch Aleema Keto.
Desired to rid himself of further complications, Kun ordered the Witch and the failed disciple to set the Star off to supernova in the Crone Drift.
Killed both of his undesirable followers.
Everything was gone according to the Dark Lord’s expectation until Ulic Qel-Droma got shot down and captured once again.
The arrival of the Jedi and the implementation of the Lightside technique, the Wall of Light, were the last catalysts that settle the result of this war in stone.
 
Despite the unlikeliness of the circumstance they were facing.
Some members of the Brotherhood of the Sith did survive the event.
They fled to planet Empress Teta and used it as their last stronghold.
The Galactic Republic did not hesitate to throw everything they had at them in the hope to end the Sith’s threat quickly.
All remaining Sith stand their ground and resist far longer than anyone would have expected.
Still, their defeat is immanence.
In the end, the Brotherhood was no more.
Even though the Brotherhood as a whole was no more, some of its members survived.
At Least one of them not only survived but went on to set the foundation of the later Sith Order.
At the Sith ancient home Korriban, an academy had been erected.
This same academy would soon be used by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Reven in the restoration of the Sith Order.
