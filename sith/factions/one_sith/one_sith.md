# Overview
The One Sith, also known as the New Sith Order, was a Sith Cult created by Darth Krayt before 30 BBY on Korriban.
Krayt’s order followed his rule known as the Rule of One, where a single Dark Lord of the Sith ruled the Sith Order.
The New Sith Order collapsed after Krayt’s death because Darth Wredd lured most of the One Sith Infiltrators into an engagement against the Imperial Knights known as the Battle of the Floating World.

# Darth Krayt's new Order
The New Sith Order's origins date back to around 27 BBY on Korriban when Jedi Master A’Sharad Hett proclaimed himself the new Dark Lord of the Sith under the name of Darth Krayt.
Unlike other Dark Lords of the Sith, Darth Krayt didn’t follow Darth Bane’s Rule of Two.
Instead, he abolished it and created his own, known as the Rule of One, where many minions would serve a single Dark Lord of the Sith.
The reason for such a decision was because Darth Kryat believed power had to be used by the minions, adepts, and lords to protect the only Dark Lord of the Sith.
Although this New Sith cult knew about Lumiya’s Sith existence, they did not join them because of disagreements regarding the Rule of Two.
After the Second Galactic Civil War, Lumiya’s Sith Order perished along with Darth Bane’s legacy against Luke Skywalker’s Jedi Order.
With the collapse of Caedus’ Sith Order, the Jedi thought the Sith were extinct.



# The end
After Darth Kryat’s death, his troopers fell into madness because of the power and influence he projected on them.
With the eradication of Kryat’s troopers, Darth Nihl ordered the remaining Sith to leave the key worlds, such as Korriban and Coruscant.
Darth Nihl, along with his Sith followers, were still on the look for another war, but what was not expected was that they would dominate the galaxy through stealth and patience.
To achieve a new victory, Darth Nihl ordered the surviving Sith to infiltrate every planetary government.
Unlucky for the remaining Sith, their infiltration would be ruined by a Sith who wanted to re-establish Darth Bane’s Rule of Two, known as Darth Wredd.
He noticed One Sith's intentions after killing a Sith Infiltrator on Ceita Five.

In order to eradicate the One Sith, Darth Wredd lured the One Sith Infiltrators into a clash known as the Battle of the Floating World, where they were eliminated successfully by the Imperial Knights.



# Organization
The New Sith Order was composed of many ranks that served the Dark Lord of the Sith in different ways.
