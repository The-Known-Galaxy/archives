The Sorcerers of Rhand were a dark side cult that believed in a force greater than the Force, which they referred to as the Dark.
They would follow the way and the will of the Dark and be granted special powers by it.
They were the rulers of the Nihil Retreat, a collection of twelve stellar clusters located in the Unknown Regions surrounded by the Perann Nebula.

The Sorcerers called themselves the Rhandites and believed in the One Truth: “Only power is real, and the only real power is the power to destroy.
Existence is fleeting.
Destruction is eternal.” They believed that destruction was the will of the Force; they called this the Way of the Dark.

They saw destruction as a change to the universe's structure; destruction created a void, the absence of life.
The void was the foundation of truth.
They did not believe in the light or dark side, nor in the Force, they only believed in the Dark.
The only thing relevant was the response of the Dark to those who were trained in the Way of the Dark, they saw it as the hidden energy of the cosmos.

One of the greatest powers of the Dark known by the Rhandites was Darksight; Darksight allowed them to foresee the future and manipulate certain events to achieve the desired outcome.
To succeed one has to be in alignment with the Dark; only through destruction, one could ally themselves to the Way of the Dark and thus The Dark.
The Sorcerers of Rhand were created from three other sects- The Kanzar Exiles, who practised mental enslavement; The Knell of Muspilli, an ancient death cult who summoned apocalyptic gods from beyond the gap; and the Warriors of Shadow, a priestly sisterhood of Taung who fled to the Unknown Regions for attunement and meditation.
The three faiths together formed the Sorcerers of Rhand, located on the planet of Rhand in the ruins of dead species.
