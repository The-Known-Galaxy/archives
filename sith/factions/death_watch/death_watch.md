# Death Watch
The Death Watch were a known terrorist cell of Mandalorians who were known for their violence, however said violence followed the true Mandalorian Culture.


The Death Watch opposed the Pacifist Mandalorian Duchess known as Satine Kryze, although it did not stop her Sister from joining the Death Watch, Bo Katan Kryze, who also believed in the old Mandalorian ways of the Warriors.

The Death Watch once allied with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, in hopes to get more global support for their fight to retake the planet of Mandalore after their exile to the Moon of Concordia, they eventually broke off from the CIS.

After a few times of staying hidden, the Death Watch found an old Sith, named Darth Maul and his brother, Savage Opress.
Using them along with their Sith powers to take over Mandalore.
Death Watch and the two Siths then allied and started conquering and taking over criminal groups to help in taking over the planet, and now with their new found army, they tricked the Shadow Collective, which was controlled by Death Watch, to fake attacking the main capital of Mandalore, of which the Death Watch faked rescuing to gain support of the people.

After the take over, Death Watch arrested all criminals, including the Siths in a hidden plot, however it would be their downfall.
In 19 BBY, the Death Watch group was formed into the Mandalorian Super Commando after a Taung Blood Duel between Maul and Pre Vizsla, with Maul being the winner Death Watch was reformed, but with Bo Katan Kryze running off with her Night Owls, Marking the formal end of the Death Watch.
