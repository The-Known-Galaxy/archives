# Overview

Clan Bargrutfa was one of many clans assigned to young would-be Initiates who began learning the ways of the Jedi Order.
Clan members were chosen for their disposition to be loyal to others and to their own hearts in the dark.
As members of the clan, the students traveled through the Jedi Temple Academy together until graduation.

# History

The clan, named after Telok Olsen's gigantic mountain Gruuthfa, was stationed at the Jedi Temple after the Ruusan Reformation of the Galactic Republic.
Shortly before the Clone Wars, the lore of Clan Bergruutfa was overseen by the Abyssinian Jedi Master Qarmal, and its members were mostly humans, including Whiphid, Zabrak, Qel-Dor, Duros, and Nautolan.
In 20 BBY, they were aboard a Mon Calamari starship when it was attacked by General Grievous and a Separatist fleet.

The ship came under heavy fire, and Grievous and his army boarded the ship.
Master Quormor did his best to protect his initiates, but he was forced to die while the cyborgs took off with the youths.
After landing on the C-9979 landing craft on Versus, which was captured by the CIS, the clan was taken to a cell, where they awaited Grievous' orders.
In fact, Cyborg had planned to turn the group over to his master, Darth Sidious, to transform them into Darkseid warriors.
I went to the Ugnaught barracks nearby.

Grievous quickly located them and ordered their capture and execution.
However, he is thwarted again by a trio of Jedi who attempted to assassinate him.
As Master Baddard Tone and Knight Flynn Kaibo engaged in a duel with Kaleesh's cyborg, Padawan Cody Tai gathered the Padawans and headed for the escape shuttle.
Ty killed Torn and Kybo and returned to the Temple, handing the clan over to the Jedi High Council.
Alara, one of the Clan's brightest students, asked the Council to pardon Ty's disobedience but was ignored when the Council expelled Ty from the order.
