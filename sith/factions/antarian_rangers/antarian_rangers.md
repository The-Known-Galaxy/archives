# Overview

The Antarian Rangers were a part of the Security force.
It was founded in 620 BBY on the planet Antar IV to help the Jedi Order.
This law enforcement agency, another name for it being a Planetary Security Force, had two more names it was called, Police Force and Security Force.
The organization was the ones to enforce the laws.
This group was to make sure they make sure everything was under control and protected many things, such as life and places.

# Organizational Structure

The one of a kind organization of the non-force users were different to the civilians in the galaxy.
They were to show no fear of Jedi and their powers.
Yet, they had promised to help them and work as support troops that the Jedi needed, also dedicating their lives to it.
The troops' objective was varied, such as taking reconnaissance duties and covert operations.
This had been put in place for the Jedi’s work to be less laborious but meant they had to do dirty work sometimes.

Eventually, they increased to thousands of individuals and the ranks were diverse just like the ones in the Jedi Order.
The Jedi had found useful ways to use the Antarian Rangers, only affiliating with little groups that they were familiar with.
It seemed that the Jedi had permanent companions of Antarian Rangers.

Not many members had managed to join the Antarian Rangers without being chosen by an existing member.
The recruits were to be watched as some were rejected for training with their Jedi counterparts.
The faction consisted of Explorers, Lieutenants, Rangers, Ranger Captains and Ranger Generals.

# Origins

Rangers had been created within the planet of Antar IV around 620 BBY - the one who caused this action was a human Jedi Knight from Coruscant, Marus Timpel.
After he arrived at the planet to supervise some tasks that were given, he had an encounter with a Gotal called Kaskutal.
He was one of the people who had been turned down on the Jedi training.
However, they eventually formed a group to assist the Jedi Order’s issues in the galaxy.

The increase within the core was leading to the rangers being mostly humans, but many species were still joining the cause, helping them to grow bigger and better.
The Jedi did not stop the expansion of the Antarian Rangers due to them  proving themselves useful in many ways, including during the Clone Wars.

# Dark times

In the Imperial Era, the rangers turned into an unofficial military force and a resistance underground unit.
The rangers weren’t able to get to the same level as the Rebel Alliance.
In order to find and save the Jedi from Order 66, they had to use military operations to save and find the surviving Jedi.
This also had conflict with imperial oppression while making sure their people were safe.

Many people of the organization had been tracked by Darth Vader and his Inquisitorius, both with a ruthless dedication.
As a part of the rangers, individuals faced similar consequences due to them helping Jedi, who were fugitives.

# Rebirth

In the dawn of the New Republic and New Jedi Order, Luke Skywalker had revealed history belonging to the Antarian Rangers and figured out some survivors.
People started to reconstruct the ranks, even though the New Republic were suspicious that another independent, paramilitary group was emerging.
The group was small and tried to rebuild their numbers and make a success.

In the invasion of the Yuuzhan Yong in 25 ABY, the Antarian Rangers were back at the numbers they use to have before the Clone Wars.
The Rangers were crucial for defending the underground organization that protected opposition of the Vong, called the Great River, and scouting for new paths to go.

# Appearance

When the rangers weren’t recruited with Jedi, they would mainly train as well as improving their abilities for when they are ready to serve, They had no official set of uniform, so they just wore brown leather jackets, which look identical to their off-duty outfits.
The weapon they use was a modified Greff-Timms AR-1 blaster rifle.
