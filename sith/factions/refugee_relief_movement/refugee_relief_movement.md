# Overview
The Refugee Relief Movement, also known as the RRM, was a charitable organization whose origins lay in providing aid to billions of people residing in Coruscant's poorer districts.
In subsequent years, it evolved into a Galactic Republic-wide relief fund, calamity assistance organization, and resettlement agency.
It was an organization that converted AA-9 Freighter-Liners into refugee transports in order to assist those in need.
During the Clone Wars, the freighters were used to convey refugees from planets under the jurisdiction of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.


The Refugee Relief Movement started its operations prior to the Invasion of Naboo and ceased its operations by the end of the Clone Wars or when the Galactic Empire was proclaimed by Palpatine.
The RRM and its newly established Refugee Resettlement Coalition temporarily settled people displaced by planets joining the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Separatist Crisis.
Naboo, Monastery, Kalarba, Cerea, Sneeve, Bimmisaari, Durkteel, Ord Tessebok, Garos IV, and Ord Varee were Coalition worlds.
Former chancellor Finis Valorum opened Alderaan to refugees.
