# Overview
Clan Skirata was a small Mandalorian Clan that was established prior to the Clone Wars.
Led by Kal Skirata, the clan would grow to become one of esteem and respect in Boba Fett’s reunited Mandalorian society.


Clan Skirata would be unique as it was mostly made up of clones who had chosen to leave the Republic instead of complying with Order 66.
The Clan would be made up of Null-Advanced Recon Commandos and Clone Commandos from Omega Squad, all of whom would be traditionally adopted by Kal Skirata and embrace Mandalorian culture.


The Clan, while small, would become known as extremely capable due to the abilities of its unique clone members who were all veterans of the Clone Wars.
As a result of this, the Clan would grow to prominence under the rule of Mand’alor Boba Fett and would be responsible for saving the Mand’alor’s life by reversing the effects of the cloning process on Fett’s body.

# Pre-Clone Wars
Prior to the Clone Wars, Clan Skirata was made up of Munin Skirata and his adopted son, Kal Skirata.
Munin would train Kal to become a Mandalorian mercenary like himself, a job Kal would come to excel at.


The Clan would then grow when Kal Skirata would take a wife and have three children; Tor Skirata, Ijaat Skirata and Ruusaan Skirata.
Unfortunately for Kal, his wife would leave him as a result of Kal’s long time spent away at war and due to the fact Kal wished to take his two sons with him to war, despite their young age of 8.

Kal Skirata would then answer Jango Fett’s call to serve as a member of the Cuy’val dar and take part in the training of the Clone Army.



# Clone Wars
Kal Skirata would save the lives of the Null-Advanced Recon Commandos after they had been deemed defective, he would mentor the ARC Troopers and raise them as Mandalorians, giving each one a Mandalorian name.
These ARC Troopers would become the finest soldiers in the Grand Army of the Republic and declare staunch loyalty to Kal Skirata.
Towards the end of the Clone Wars, Kal Skirata would officially adopt the Null-ARC Troopers as Mandalorians and induct them into Clan Skirata.


Kal Skirata would plan for the Null-ARC Troopers to desert the Republic alongside as many other Clone troopers that would be willing.
The Republic Commando Squad, Omega Squad would follow Kal Skirata’s plan and refuse Order 66.
Kal Skirata would also have his daughter, Ruusaan Skirata broken out of prison to rejoin the Clan around this time and together the group would flee Coruscant and travel to Kal Skirata’s farm; Kyrimorut, to hide from the newly established Galactic Empire.



# Post Clone Wars
After the Clone Wars, Clan Skirata would grow with multiple members of Omega Squad and the Null-ARC Troopers getting married, with Darman Skirata even having a son with his deceased wife, Jedi Knight Etain Tur-Mukan.
The Clan by this stage even included the ex-Jedi Knight Bardan Jusik, who had adopted the Mandalorian lifestyle and joined Clan Skirata.
After some time, Kal Skirata’s own two biological sons would reconcile with their father and rejoin Clan Skirata.


Late in Boba Fett’s life he would hear of a Clone trooper who had found a way to reverse the clone aging process that was making Boba Fett sick.
This Clone trooper would be Jaing Skirata, the Null-ARC Trooper and Mandalorian responsible for figuring out how to reverse the Clone aging process.
Jaing Skirata would use the process to save the life of the now Mand’alor Boba Fett, and as a result, Clan Skirata would become well respected in the Mand’alor’s eyes.
