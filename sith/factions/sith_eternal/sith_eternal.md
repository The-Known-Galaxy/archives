# Overview
The Sith Eternal were an organization that resided on the dark desert planet of Exegol in the Unknown Regions, where secretive and mysterious cultists venerated Darth Sidious and revered the dark side of the Force, and followed the ways of the Sith.
The reach of the Sith Eternal was vast and went far beyond the Unknown Regions.
Steeped in ancient traditions, they used rituals designed to mine the secrets of the Force, they delved into the nature of phenomena such as Force bonds and dyads in the Force and believed that the galaxy was theirs to rule by cosmic right.

Due to its remote location and inherent secrecy, Sith Eternal choose Exegol as its base during the reign of the Galactic Empire and had his subordinate began to experiment with cloning technology in a bid to extend his lifespan and also with genetic machinations, leading to the creation of various artificial genetic constructs, known as strand cast, such as Supreme Leader of the First Order Snoke as well as the Emperor's cloned son, who sired a natural-born Force-sensitive daughter called Rey.
The Sith Eternal constructed the Xyston-class Star Destroyers comprising the Final Order, which would become the largest fleet in galactic history.

# History
In 19 BBY, the Galactic Emperor Palpatine, also known as Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord who masterminded the fall of the Galactic Republic and rise of the Galactic Empire, withdrew from the eye of the public in order to begin probing the secrets of the dark side and Sith lore in order to begin his quest in obtaining immortality.
On Exegol, the Sith Eternal, within the ancient Sith Citadel on the planet, began to experiment with the science of cloning in a bid to extend, with the end goal of ultimately permanently sustaining, their Emperor's lifespan.
During their service to Emperor Palpatine, the cult's labor and cloning experiments led to the creation of several genetic constructs, including an elite guard, and the start of the construction of a new fleet of Star Destroyers on the planet by the time of the Galactic Civil War.
