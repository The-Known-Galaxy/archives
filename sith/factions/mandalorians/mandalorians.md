# Description
The Mando’ade were first founded in 24000 BBY by “Mandalore the Ultimate” after they moved to the planet of Mandalore.
Although a Faction, the Mandalorians were and still are often split between multiple Aliits and do not own a specific race exclusivity, anyone can become a Mandalorian if deemed worthy of being a true Verd.

The Mandalorians hold dearly onto their culture of War and Honor, they believe it is more worth to die if one has no true purpose, and they praise the death of their strong brothers and sisters who were warriors like them.
Along with Honor and Glory, the Mandalorians follow a code of honour called: “The Resol’nare” which serves as a way of living for them, where they must educate their child through combat, wear the Beskar’gam, protect and be proud of your clan, preserve our Joha and speak it, follow our Sole Leader, Mand’alor.

The Mandalorians have their own language which was used mostly by the Taungs but then spread to more than them, their language is officially known as “Mando’a” it is oftenly spoken however it has grown more into a traditional way of speaking while not being always used as the main language.


Although the Mandalorians faced thousands of wars and sometimes defeat or setback, they always managed to stay alive along with their culture, the defeats only making them stronger and come back with an even bigger desire for revenge for their people and families.


Although a lot of Clans don’t see eye to eye and tend to war each other into Civil War, the Clans will always unite under One Banner, the one of the Mythosaur, if it is to protect the interest of their Mandalorian cultures and family, or the call of Mand’alor, the Mandalorians will answer and fight to the death, if it means honour and protecting their Aliits.

A Mandalorian could be a Male or a Female, the gender meant nothing and calling a Female cute or precious would mean dishonour for them, giving them a reason to end whoever called them such.
As long as the Female could fight just like any Male and like a true and strong warrior, she was considered a true Mandalorian.

Although Mandalorians grew rare, their identity remains renowned within all the Galaxy as the strongest and most fearsome warriors ever.
Honor, Glory, Warriors, Wars, those are the bases of being a true Mandalorian Warrior.
