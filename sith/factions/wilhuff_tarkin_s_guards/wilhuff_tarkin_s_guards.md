# Overview
Governor Wilhuff Tarkin, or Grand Moff Tarkin, was a human male that served within the high ranks of the Galactic Empire.
During the era of the Empire, most high ranking officials were granted their own squad of Death Trooper guards by Emperor Palpatine.
Tarkin, being one of the highest ranking officials in the entire Empire, was granted this honour.
The most notable time he was escorted by his guards was when he travelled to the Imperial planet Scarif to meet Darth Vader.
There were only three known Death Troopers that accompanied him when he arrived on Landing Pad 13.
Tarkin was supposed to meet Darth Vader there for a meeting in the Scarif Vault,, and was escorted there with his highly skilled Death Troopers.
