# Overview
The Guardians of the Whills, also referred to as the Guardians of the Kyber Temple, were a religious order that mainly preached oneness with the Force, separate in ideology from the Jedi Order.
Sometime before 483 BBY, they had been founded and during the Imperial Era, were a group of resistant monks in Jedha City on the Pilgrim Moon of Jedha.
Like how the Jedi constructed their lightsabers, the monks crafted their own lightbows, complex and powerful bowcasters that were capable of shooting down TIE fighters with a direct hit.
They were the protectors of the Kyber temples and those who took pilgrimages to visit them.
The most prominent member of the Guardians was the blind human Chirrut Îmwe, who, with his friend and former Guardian Baze Malbus, assisted Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor in attaining the Death Star plans until their deaths at the Battle of Scarif.
