# Overview
The 501st was a division within the Grand Army of the Republic and later the Galactic Empire that was built from the best of the best in all areas of combat, discipline, and loyalty.
It was made up of over fourteen thousand troops, all of whom were experts in combat and were well disciplined.
The leader of the 501st was the famous and loyal Captain Rex, who was replaced with Commander Appo after Order 66.
The 501st was a prestigious division and only accepted the best.
These include the well-known clones Jesse, Fives, Echo, Tup, Dogma, Hardcase, Kix, and the two leaders, Appo and Rex.
Although there are many other troopers within the legion, these men contributed the most to the legion.
Some even sacrificed their lives to save the entire Republic.
Towards the end of the Clone Wars, Anakin Skywalker split the 501st into a new division that was commanded by Rex.
Rex was promoted to Commander of the 332nd.
The 501st had a lot of notable members that fought and died during the Clone Wars and by the time Order 66 was executed, the majority of their best troopers died.
The only notable members that were a part of the Order were Rex, Appo, and Jesse.
Unfortunately, Lieutenant Jesse died trying to kill Rex and Ahsoka and during Order 66, Rex removed his chip, as he would rather help his friend Ahsoka Tano escape than remain loyal to the Republic (soon to be the Galactic Empire].

# Equipment, troops, and vehicles
All Terrain Tactical Enforcers (AT-TE): Six legs for walking, two armoured halves, and a power generator.
It could climb sheer surfaces and be armed with a mass-driver cannon that could shoot down ships using a rocket.
In addition shields for electromagnetic pulses and ion cannons.
It could hold clones for transport purposes with a pilot seat at the front, a few guns at the front and back and could only be pierced by tanksmasher rockets.

Jet troopers: Equipped with jetpacks for aerial assaults, the 501st’s jet troopers had a unique armour design and had blue jetpacks which they used to attack the enemy more quickly and destroy their front line quicker.
Jet troopers would unexpectedly attack the enemy from the air causing heavy casualties.

Armour: Until the battle of Mon Cala, the 501sts had phase I clone trooper armour which consisted of a fin on their helmet.
Later, the phase II armour they developed had a more round helmet and still had the same blue markings to represent their division.

Stormtrooper armour: Once they joined the Empire their armour was quite similar, it consisted of the same blue markings but in different areas.
For example, they often had a blue line that looked like a scar on their helmet, and usually, one side of their armour had more blue, and almost their entire arms were blue.
You could tell who the commander was because they wore a blue pauldron on their armour.
However, some of the 501st didn’t have any blue markings and looked like normal stormtroopers.

Venator-class star destroyer: The 501sts were genuinely carried by the Republic’s star destroyer and they stored their vehicles like Lateral Aerial Assault Transports (LAATs) there.
The Venator-class was used for both transport and combat because of its powerful weapon system; it was a useful tool in space battles.
LAAT: They couldn't use the Venator-class to land so they were transported onto the ground by LAATs which were piloted by clone troopers who specialised in starfighter combat and driving.
Occasionally, the 501st’s LAATs had blue markings on them to represent the 501st and some were piloted by 501st soldiers.

Imperial star destroyers: The Imperial star destroyers were a bit more plain than Republic’s Venator class.
The Imperials’ had a fully grey star destroyer which was as purposeful as the Venator-class.
The Imperial star destroyer was more often used in battle, but they also carried plenty of Twin Ion Engines (TIE fighters) which were more useful in dogfights.


All Terrain Armoured Transport (AT-AT): During the battle of Hoth the 501sts mainly had to use terrain vehicles so they could be well protected from enemy fire.
The most common vehicle used on Hoth was the AT-AT which could withstand all enemy fire and only had one weakness; the neck.
The Rebellion found out about the weakness and used the speeders to tie a rope around the vehicle so it could collapse and they could blow it up by firing at the neck.



# Order 66
Everyone knows about this horrific event orchestrated by the deceiving Sith lord, Darth Sidious.
Order 66 was a plan where the Separatist leader, Count Dooku, got his Jedi friend, Sifo-Dyas, to install inhibitor chips into the clone trooper’s minds, right before he became the leader of the Separatists so they could fight off rogue Jedi and Sith, however, Dooku also made it so they would believe that the Jedi were traitors to the Republic when they were told to execute Order 66.
Before the execution of Order 66, Mace Windu and several other Jedi went to “arrest” Chancellor Palpatine (Darth Sidious) because he was the Sith Lord behind the war.
Palpatine killed Mace’s companions and the two fought one on one until Palpatine was saved by Anakin.
Anakin runs in to help the Sith Lord by chopping Mace’s hand off and Sidious uses Force lightning to send Mac flying out of the building.
Anakin was then dubbed ‘Darth Vader’ and continued to lead the 501st into battle against the Jedi on Coruscant.
The 501st suffered severe casualties on Coruscant, but they also managed to kill thousands of Jedi, which unfortunately included younglings.
The 501st didn’t stop until all Jedi were dead.
After Order 66 there were only a few Jedi survivors who were hunted by Inquisitors and Vader.
Also following Order 66, the 501st was still a division under the command of Darth Vader, except with the discontinuation of clone production, they were replaced with regular human enlistees because they lacked the funding required to continue the production of clones.



# The final battle and their forever-lasting legacy
Endor: The final battle ever fought by the 501sts was on the forest moon planet, Endor.
The Rebellion hosted an attack on the famous and powerful weapon, the Death Star.
The Death Star could wipe out planets with a single blast of a super laser.
The Rebels gathered all their forces to attack the Death Star and in doing so they needed to blow up the shield generator on Endor.
The Empire sent the 501sts to Endor and there they fought against the Rebels who teamed up with the native EwoksThe Ewoks were a group of cute bear-like creatures who worshipped the forest and were semi-experienced in combat.
The Rebels used the chatty protocol droid, C3PO, to communicate with the Ewoks for they believed he was a God.
C3-PO convinced the Ewoks to help the Rebels fight the Empire and blow up their shield generator so the Millenium Falcon, piloted by Lando Calrissian, could blow up the Death Star’s core.
The Ewoks accepted and gathered their forces to fight against the Empire.
The Empire had more vehicles and weapons than the Rebels but the Rebels used this to their advantage.
The Ewoks stole the Scout Trooper’s speeder bikes and used them to kill them.
It was a sad day for the Empire because the Rebels made it to the shield generator and managed to blow it up.
During the battle on Endor, Luke Skywalker was transported to the Death Star by Lord Vader so they could meet Darth Sidious.
Luke fought Vader and bested him.
Sidious (known as Emperor Palpatine then) told Luke to finish him so his journey to the Dark Side would be complete.
Luke refused, claiming he was a Jedi like his father before him.
 Palpatine used Force lightning to torture Luke.
Vader, not willing to see his only son die, threw Palpatine into the Death Star’s core, and together, Luke and Vader attempted to escape.
Unfortunately, Vader was going to die since Palpatine’s Force lightning had damaged his suit's internal respirator.
Knowing this, Vader asked Luke to remove his mask so Luke could see his face.
In tears, Luke brought the dead body of his father to the forest moon of Endor and burned his remains in honour.
That same day, the 501st Legion disbanded after the death of Vader and all the troops on Endor.
There simply couldn’t be a 501st Legion without Vader or the correct number of soldiers, so it simply fell apart.
There wasn’t a single survivor, except Rex.
Rex’s death is unknown but we know he helped Ezra and his crew and it is assumed that Captain Rex was one of the Rebel fighters on Endor, we have no proof of this though except that the Rebel Commander who was on Endor looks a lot like Rex.
