# Overview
The men and women who comprised the First Legion, Darth Vader’s personal stormtrooper legion, were renowned in the Stormtrooper Corps.
Important figures such as Grand Admiral Thrawn admitted this.
The legion was mostly made up of recruits from the 501st, which as we know, served as Anakin Skywalker’s clone battalion in the Clone Wars.
As such, they had high standards placed upon them by Lord Vader, and officers who failed to meet them could expect one of two fates; demotion and transfer to the 501st or summary execution.

# Mission to Batuu
Sometime before the Galactic Civil War, a contingent of the First Legion under Commander Kimmund accompanied Lord Vader and Grand Admiral Thrawn aboard the latter’s flagship, the ISD Chimaera to investigate a disturbance in the Force felt by the Emperor himself.
The Chimaera also housed the Dark Lord’s personal Lambda-class-T4a-shuttle and the legion’s transport ship the Darkhawk-a repurposed Clone Wars Separatist ship.
Once the Chimaera had reached its destination, Lord Vader and Thrawn boarded a shuttle to the planet.
While they were gone, a fleet of Grysk freighters appeared.
 Following the sudden arrival of the aliens, the First Legion utilized the Darkhawk to attempt a boarding of one of the freighters.
The stormtroopers were successful in their attempt to board the ship but failed to recover anything useful, as Grysk warriors detonated explosives in the cargo hold.



# Defense of the Darkhawk
During the battle on the Grysk freighter, the First Legion captured several prisoners, which were transported to the Chimaera upon Grand Admiral Thrawn’s orders.
These prisoners were housed in the personal quarters of the TIE pilots, which happened to be near the hangar the Darkhawk resided in.
This left Commander Kimmud uncomfortable, so he, a sergeant named Aksind, and a pilot named Tephan stayed aboard the transport vessel, not wanting it to be unguarded.
The prisoners attempted an escape and tried to use the Darkhawk as a means of escape, not knowing the soldiers were in it.
A skirmish followed, resulting in Askind’s death.
 Unbeknownst to the three men aboard, Lord Vader and Thrawn wanted the prisoners to escape, for they had planted tracking beacons on all of the ships.
If not for the intervention of Grand Admiral Thrawn, Kimmund would have likely been executed.
However, Thrawn had deduced that because the Grysk attempted to use the only Separatist ship on the Chimaera, the alien’s base was located in an old droid factory on the planet of Mokivj.



# Battle of Mokivj
The First Legion, along with Lord Vader himself at the helm, infiltrated the separatist factory.
 Using a ruse by the Sith Lord, three soldiers-Commander Kimmund, Sergeant Viq, and Trooper Elebe- searched for the prisoners.
 When they found them, they were shocked to see that they were force-sensitive Chiss girls.
After securing the children, the three made their way to a courtyard, clearing it, and extracting via the Darkhawk.
After returning to the Chimaera, Vader informed the Commander that some of the Chiss prisoners remained in Grysk company, while a few escaped.
However, Grand Admiral Thrawn simply requested that Lord Vader track them through the force, which he did.



# Rescue Operation
After tracking the Grysk down, the First Legion decided once more to board.
Having support from Lord Vader in a TIE Defender who shut down the Grysk’s engines.
The legion proceeded with boarding, along with Grand Admiral Thrawn’s bodyguard, Rukh.
Using Rukh’s tracking skills, the soldiers successfully located and secured the Chiss prisoners, suffering minimum losses, although a trooper by the name of Jid had to be left behind.



# The Battle of Hoth
The last recorded combat duties of the First Legion were during the Battle of Hoth.
Sometime after the first Death Star’s destruction, the Empire used Project Swarm to locate a secret rebel base on the icy planet of Hoth.
The First Legion’s job was to support the 501st’s elite Blizzard Force, who were commanded by General Maximillian Veers.
The battle ended in Imperial victory, and nothing more of the First Legion has been recorded.
