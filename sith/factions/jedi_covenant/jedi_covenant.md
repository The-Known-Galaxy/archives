# Overview
The Jedi Covenant was a secret Jedi organization headquartered on Coruscant during the Old Sith Wars.
Founded by Krynda Dray after the end of the Great Sith War, she felt it was her fault for not realizing that Exar Kun had fallen to her dark side.
The Alliance's goal was to use Jedi emissaries as shadows to seek out splinter points that could lead to a Sith resurrection and take the necessary actions to prevent it.
The Jedi Covenant Hated the Sith with a passion for being a deviation from the Code.
They believed that had such an organization existed before the Sith Wars, they could have seen the threat of Exar Kun, who was still a Jedi.

# Organisation
Watch Circles: 
The Jedi Society consisted of several watch circles specializing in different types of vision.
His five Masters of the Jedi Tower of Taris, Luciandrei, Q'Anilia, Fern, Zamar, and Larnatey, were known as the First Watch Circle.
The first four were the Jedi Order's top consul officers, apparently the Covenant's chief forecasters, and Lucian served as his "hand".
Another Watch Circle is known as the "WatchCircle Vodo".
However, some masters felt that it was not very effective.

Her circle was a group of visionaries hired by the Covenant to investigate changes in Dray, Her Trust's stock and save it from bankruptcy.

Besides the Seers, the Alliance also had agents called Shadows.
All records of their existence were erased, and only a few members of the Alliance knew about them.
Shadows were used to hunt Sith treasures, one of which was the Talisman of the Moors of Talis.
Shadow Celeste Her Morn is known to have destroyed the last copy of Malka, Her Ragnos Epistles and regained the Jori Her Daragon Amulet and Horak mul Eye.
All found items were micro tagged, the signature Covenant identity chip.
This only happened after these artifacts were coated with the disabling resin.

The failed Padawan Hazen was taken under Kurinda's wing and became her hand.

Executors:
The various Watch Circles were led by a single Jedi Guardian who was given the title of Executor, acting as an intermediary and managing the logistical details so that the groups could carry out their missions.
They were chosen from among those who had no precognitive powers to prevent them from altering the results of the Watch Circles they oversaw.
In addition to this role, they reported to his Haazen on all WatchCircle findings and reported on their activities.
In addition, they acted independently and performed general security tasks against the Jedi Alliance.
