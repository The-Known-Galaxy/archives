# Overview
Perhaps the most well-known Clan in Mandalorian history, Clan Fett is an ancient and ruthless Clan that has produced some of the most well known and influential Mandalorians in galactic history.


Despite their reputation, the word ‘’Fett’’ translates to ‘’Farmer’’ in Mando’a, denoting the origins of the Clan’s members.
Despite the honest work the Clan is named after, known members of Clan Fett have fought across the galaxy as soldiers, bounty hunters and even as the rulers of the Mandalorian people.

# Mandalorian Wars 3976 - 3960 BBY
The earliest record of Clan Fett making an appearance in the galaxy was through its most notorious member, Cassus Fett.
Cassus Fett would serve as Mand’alor the Ultimate’s second-in-command and Field Marshal amongst the Neo-Crusaders.
Clan Fett would answer Mand’alor the Ultimate’s call and serve as some of his finest warriors during the Mandalorian Wars.

During the Mandalorian Wars, Field Marshal Cassus Fett would order the genocide of the Cathar species during the conquest of their planet.
As a result of this, Clan Fett would forever be solidified amongst Mandalorian society as a Clan of mercilessly efficient warriors.



# Cold War and Galactic War 3653 - 3636 BBY
During the Cold War and subsequent Galactic War, the Mandalorians would be enjoying an era of mercenary work.
As the Republic and Sith Empire fought on multiple fronts the demand for military contractors only increased as the war raged on.
The demand for Mandalorian warriors increased, especially within the Sith Empire.
Clan Fett would spend much of its time on the frontlines of the Sith Empire’s campaign.
Vorten Fett is a prime example of the trust placed in Mandalorians by the Sith.
This Mandalorian Commander would be responsible for leading attacks against Republic forces and had access to Imperial Military and Mandalorian resources to do so.


Clan Fett would later be involved in the Galactic War against the Eternal Empire.
During this period, Clan Chieftain Khomo Fett would turn Clan Fett into the most powerful Mandalorian Clan at that time.
As a result of this, he was put forward as a candidate for the title of Mand’alor, though he would later refuse the honour and serve as one of Mand’alor the Avenger’s top military commanders.



# Mandalorian Division 60 - 31 BBY
After the Mandalorian Excision, Clan Fett would find itself divided.
Many of its members would relocate to worlds such as Concord Dawn to continue their lives away from the internal politics of Mandalorian society.
Centuries after the excision a farming family belonging to Clan Fett would be attacked on Concord Dawn by the Mandalorian organisation known as Death Watch.
The only survivor of this attack would be a young boy by the name of Jango Fett, who would later go on to become a prominent figure in Mandalorian society.


Jango Fett would fight as a Mandalorian Supercommando under the command of Jaster Mereel, his adoptive father.
Jango Fett would end up becoming a prominent figure in the True Mandalorians and rise to the rank of Mand’alor before the destruction of the True Mandalorians in 44 BBY at the hands of the Jedi Order.

Jango Fett would spend the rest of his life as a bounty hunter and become arguably the most efficient bounty hunter of his time.
During his life as a bounty hunter Jango Fett would also be singled out as the genetic template for the Clone Army.
Jango Fett would accept on the condition he could have one genetically unaltered clone for himself.
This clone would become known as Boba Fett.



# Fall of the Republic and the Rise of the Empire 31 BBY and beyond
Boba Fett would be raised as a Mandalorian by his father but would place little importance on Mandalorian culture until later in his life.
During his time as a bounty hunter, Boba would grow to become an even more legendary figure than his father.
Though he would not consider himself to be traditionally Mandalorian, he did place value in honour and would still wear his beskar’gam, or Mandalorian armour with pride.
It wouldn’t be until his rise to the position of Mand’alor after the death of Fenn Shysha that the Fett Clan would become part of the Mandalorian community once more.


Boba Fett would lead the Mandalorians and Clan Fett against the Yuuzhan Vong and establish the Mandalorians as a united faction that would become a major player in galactic politics.
This would facilitate the name Fett as one of galactic renown and bring the Mandalorians out of an era of near-extinction.



# Structure
Clan Fett like most Mandalorian Clans would spend much of its existence as a name and less of an actual organisation.
After the Mandalorian Excision most Mandalorian Clans would be divided or entirely dissolved, Clan Fett was one such divided Clan.


During the Clan’s height in the Galactic War, Clan Fett would have a Chieftain but the rest of its ranks would be folded into Mand’alor the Avenger’s army.
This was typical for a Clan to do when a Mand’alor was in power.
During Jango Fett and later Boba Fett’s rise to power as Mand’alor, Clan Fett remained as a name and not an organisation.
There were other members of the Fett Clan throughout these periods in time, but nobody other than Jango and Boba would actually use the name Fett.
