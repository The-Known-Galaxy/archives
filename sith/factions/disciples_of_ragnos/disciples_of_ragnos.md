# Overview

The Disciples of Ragnos were also known as the Cult of Ragnos; they worshiped the Sith Lord Marka Ragnos.
Their ultimate goal was to try and revive the dead Sith Lord and be able to use his power to take over the whole galaxy.
Most members of the cult were called Sith Cultists, they trained in the Force or lightsaber combat.
The Sith Cultists were the main force of the cult.
The New Reborn were members of the cult that were superior to regular Sith Cultists.
They were present in more important missions.
Another group apart of the cult were Reborn Masters, they served as the most elite members within the cult and rarely did any missions.

# Rise and Fall

Tavion Axmis was the leader of the Disciples of Ragnos and the former apprentice of Desann.
Tavion was defeated by Kyle Katarn who spared her life and let her go, which Katarn went to kill the Empire Reborn’s members and leader.
For a time Tavion went into hiding until the time was right to revive Marka Ragnos.
Wanting to end the Disciples of Ragnos once and for all Luke Skywalker sent an army of Jedi to Korriban.
The Jedi and Disciples of Ragnos fought in the Valley of the Dark Lords but the Jedi outnumbered the Disciples of Ragnos, which led to Jaden Korr being able to penetrate their defenses and reach Ragnos’ tomb.
With the scepter, Tavion went to the Tomb of Marka Ragnos and revived him in which he possessed Tavion’s body.
Korr battled the possessed Tavion and managed to strike her down.
Marka Ragnos was sent back into his prison, vowing to have his revenge on the Jedi and leaving Tavion a lifeless body.
The republic eventually defeated all of the imperial forces that had helped the cult and when Korr destroyed the scepter all of the cultists lost their power, thus ending the Disciples of Ragnos.
