Darth Andeddu, who was also referred as the Immortal God-King of Praktith, was an ancient male that was humanoid, enacting leadership by being the Dark Lord of the Sith, doubtfully thought of as the forefather of the Darth title.
As a paranoid man, Darth Andeddu had believed that his subordinate Sith Lords, whom he had regarded as his own enemies, wanted to claim his huge collection of the Sith lore and rituals for themselves.
He got betrayed and also overthrown by his followers, which had forced him to leave his planet Korriban and went to the Deep Core.

Eventually, Darth Andeddu made the world of Prakith his domain, where he ruled for many centuries as a deity among the people.
A temple was built in reverence of their Dark Lord by the cult he later established, the “Malevolence”.
At the moment of his physical demise, the Darth had entombed himself in an attempt to deprive his disciples of the power they had sought to steal.
Prior to his death, Andeddu had stored all of the wisdom he had in a holocron, which had also contained his most arcane secret, the hidden ability to cheat death by transferring someone's essence into another vessel.
This was later put inside his sarcophagus where it would remain, while his followers guarded this fortress for generations in anticipation of the God-King’s return.

The Darth Andeddu legend and his incredible powers remained really large, long after he had died; the Jedi Order had even attempted to erase all of the knowledge and all of the reference of the Dark Lord from the galactic record.
Despite the Jedi Order's effort, the Malevolence had still remained prevalent.
Andeddu’s holocron had survived as well too, first uncovered by the fallen Jedi Freedon Nadd, next by the Sith Lord Darth Bane on Prakith around 980 BBY.
It was rediscovered by Darth Tyranus on the planet Korriban during 21 BBY, and later recovered by Darth Krayt and Krayt’s One Sith Order more than a century later.

Upon Darth Bane’s arrival on the planet, the cult presence seemed to have diminished, but was still feared by the local population.
Several of the members of Malevolence were brutally slaughtered by the Sith Lord as he retrieved the holocron he sought and journeyed back to Ciutric IV.

Krayt had suffered from a Yuuzhan Vong slave seed infestation that had threatened to leave him bereft of sentience, which allowed his lieutenant Darth Wyyrlok III to access Darth Andeddu’s holocron so they can find an possible solution for their problem.
The holocron had led the Chagrian Sith to go on a journey to Darth Andeddu’s tomb on Prakith, where he had encountered and also defeated Malevolence cultists.
Although initially sparing the leader of the cult, Gerlun, he was eventually drained of life to activate the holocron.
Doing so, Wyyrlok III had revived the body of Darth Andeddu.
Darth Andeddu had then started to duel Wyyrlok at a battlefield of the mind, which was a contest where ultimately had demised Darth Andeddu.
Darth Andedd’s corpse was resealed in the tomb, housing it in for countless millennia, and his collection of Sith doctrines was pillaged by Wyyrlok, who had hoped that he obtained viable means of ending Darth Krayt’s plight.
The end of Gerlun marked the termination of Darth Andeddu’s Disciples.
