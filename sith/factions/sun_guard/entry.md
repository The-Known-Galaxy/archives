# Introduction

The Sun Guard was a Thyrsian mercenary company and one of the most feared in the galaxy, centered on the planet Thyrsus in the Thyrsus system.
Formed from the rebellious Thyrsian special forces sometime after 1154 BBY, the Sun Guard fought the Echani of the Echani Command in numerous skirmishes before the Pact of Almera in 899 BBY confirmed Thyrsus's independence.
Earning fame as a mercenary unit, the Sun Guard became rivals of the Mandalorian warriors, though the group was ultimately subverted by the Sith under the influence of the Order of the Sith Lords.
Many Sun Guards served the Sith Lords directly, led by their Supreme Sun Guardian Thull Wulain, and other Sun Guards were considered for the position of prime clone in the Grand Army of the Republic.
The 2nd Regiment of the Sun Guard fought in the Clone Wars, but were crushed by Republic general Solomahal.
When Sidious needed the Sun Guard no longer, his apprentice Dooku ordered his own minion Asajj Ventress to eliminate them.
Some of the few surviving Sun Guards went on to join Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's Red Guard, Royal Guard, and for those few Force-sensitive individuals, the Shadow Guard.
A new generation of Sun Guards arose during the Yuuzhan Vong War almost fifty years later, defending Thyrsus against the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong and seeking to restore their group's traditions and reputations.

The Sun Guard transitioned from being a special-forces unit in the Thyrsus military to a renowned mercenary group.
This piece delves into their transformation, principles, and unique organizational structure.

# Origins and Early Philosophy

The Sun Guard finds its roots as a special-forces unit within the Thyrsus military, incorporated into its rank structure.
In contrast to their Echani forebears, the Thyrsians upheld a male-dominated system, emphasizing armor and bladed combat.
During its inception, the Sun Guard drew spiritual significance from the sun.
As they expanded beyond Thyrsus, the unit capitalized on its unparalleled combat skills, evolving into a mercenary group akin to the Mandalorians, shifting away from religion as its primary motivation.
However, religious influence resurfaced when the Sun Guard fell under the sway of the Sith, yet this allegiance did not deter them from pursuing mercenary work and demanding payment for their services.

Fierce and devoted, the Sun Guard gained a fearsome reputation, with their uniforms alone inspiring dread.
Their services encompassed sabotage, kidnapping, rescue, warfare, and various other tasks, all sharing a common thread - previous failures by others attempting them.

Organized into regiments, legions, and hierarchies, the Sun Guard operated effectively in teams of four.
Initiates held the rank of Stellar Legionnaire, enduring a provisional year during which any breach of Sun Guard etiquette, like cowardice or undisciplined behavior, could lead to expulsion.
Successful initiates were promoted to Stellar Tribune, entrusted with leading a legion of 20 to 40 soldiers.

The Sun Guard's officer ranks were exclusive, granted only to heroic Tribunes.
Titles such as Twisuns Legate, Twisuns Praetor, Thychani Commander, Thychani Dictator, and Supreme Sun Guardian represented the esteemed positions within the officer corps.
Advancement relied solely on military heroism, while cowardice led to immediate expulsion at any rank.

In its early philosophy, the Sun Guard epitomized unwavering dedication to valor and military prowess.
While they distanced themselves from religious fervor during their mercenary phase, the allure of Sith influence brought a mystic dimension to their identity.

# Becoming Mercenaries

As they expanded beyond Thyrsus, the Sun Guard capitalized on its unparalleled combat skills and restructured itself into a mercenary group similar to the Mandalorians, relinquishing religion as its primary motivation.
They offered their services for a price and undertook missions that had defeated others before them.

The allure of financial gains and professional reputation drove the Sun Guard's mercenary pursuits.
Nevertheless, their fearsome reputation and unwavering dedication to their cause remained intact.
Their services spanned sabotage, kidnapping, rescue, warfare, and various other tasks, earning them a formidable reputation across the galaxy.

The Sun Guard's organization revolved around regiments, legions, and various hierarchical levels, ensuring efficiency and coordination in their operations.
Their small teams of four operated in harmony, executing missions with precision and unity.

Initiates embarked on their journey by assuming the rank of Stellar Legionnaire, enduring a one-year provisional term to prove their mettle.
During this period, adherence to the Sun Guard's code of conduct was paramount, and any display of cowardice or undisciplined behavior could lead to swift expulsion.
Those who demonstrated valor and dedication advanced to the esteemed rank of Stellar Tribune, commanding a legion consisting of 20 to 40 skilled soldiers.

The Sun Guard's officer ranks were exclusive, granted only to heroic Tribunes.
Titles such as Twisuns Legate, Twisuns Praetor, Thychani Commander, Thychani Dictator, and Supreme Sun Guardian represented the esteemed positions within the officer corps.
Advancement relied solely on military heroism, while cowardice led to immediate expulsion at any rank.

The Sun Guard's journey from their origins in the Thyrsus military to becoming feared mercenaries exemplified their adaptability, resilience, and unwavering dedication to their philosophy of valor and military prowess.

# Formation and early history

Early History of the Sun Guard:

Thyrsus, a planet inhabited by the near-Human Echani species, was one of the Six Sisters within the Echani Command, governed by a female council.
However, Thyrsian culture differed from typical Echani traditions in several ways.
The society on Thyrsus was male-dominated, and its people had dark hair and skin, distinguishing them from their Echani counterparts.
Instead of the Echani's focus on hand-to-hand combat, Thyrsians favored bladed weapons and heavy armor.
Their spiritual beliefs diverged as well, with a profound reverence for the sun, in contrast to the moon-focused spirituality of the Echani.

Thyrsus seceded from the Echani Command during the Begali Uprising of 1154 BBY, while Begali eventually renewed its allegiance to the planet Eshan.
Despite this, Thyrsus remained fiercely independent, and its military units took on a sigil depicting Thyrsus' red suns.
Over time, the special forces of Thyrsus evolved into what became known as the Sun Guard.
Engaging in numerous battles with the Echani, they secured their independence when the Pact of Almera was confirmed in 899 BBY.

The Evolution into Mercenaries and Rivalry with Mandalorians:

Following centuries of peace among the Six Sisters, the Sun Guard embraced a more independent and semi-nomadic lifestyle, gradually adopting the role of a renowned mercenary unit.
Many Sun Guards became esteemed bounty hunters and gladiators, venturing into various conflicts throughout the galaxy.

Their unparalleled skills and fearless reputation led to a fierce rivalry with the Mandalorian warrior culture.
Engaging in small duels to the death instead of full-scale military engagements, the Sun Guard devised tactical countermeasures to challenge the Mandalorians' reliance on jetpacks in air combat, an aspect they held in contempt.

The rivalry between the Sun Guard and the Mandalorians reached its peak during the Battle of Sintheti in 402 BBY.
Both groups were hired by rival claimants to the Horned Throne, leading to a protracted and brutal three-year conflict amid the planet's crags and catacombs.

Transformation into a Sith Cult:

Though the Sun Guard initially held a strong focus on religion, over time, they shifted their outlook, realizing the futility of endless warfare leading to poverty.
Nevertheless, religion continued to hold sway over them.
About a century before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Thyrsus' culture developed a fixation on matters of the Force, particularly a prophecy about a galactic savior known as "the son of suns."

During this pivotal period, the hidden Order of the Sith Lords exploited the Thyrsian belief, encouraging Sith interpretations of Jedi beliefs and propagating the notion that the Sun Guard might fulfill the prophecy.
Succumbing to the allure of Sith influence, the Sun Guard transformed into a Sith cult, drawn towards the enigmatic ways of the dark side of the Force.

# In the service of Darth Plagueis

During the last century of the Republic, the Muun Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Plagueis, enlisted a company of silver-armored Echani Sun Guards to provide security at his residence on the moon Sojourn.
These Sun Guards replaced the Iotran Brandsmen who previously defended the world.
Additionally, a contingent of Echani Sun Guards protected members of Damask Holdings, a company led by Plagueis in his public persona as "Hego Damask," a powerful financier.
The company brokered a deal with Foreman Wat Tambor of the Techno Union to establish the planet Hypori as a training ground for the Sun Guard.

In 67 BBY, the Sun Guards accompanied Damask's deputy Larsh Hill and other Damask Holdings members to High Port Space Center on Muunilinst, where they rendezvoused with Damask.
During an annual meeting of influential beings on Sojourn, known as the Gathering, Plagueis ordered the Sun Guards to carry out various tasks.
These included stranding Gossam senior managers of the firm Subtext Mining on a remote world in the Tingel Arm, as well as providing protection during a confrontation with a rival Sith Lord, Darth Venamis.

In 65 BBY, Plagueis dispatched his Sun Guards to recover the stranded Gossams and execute them, leaving their bodies outside Subtext Mining's headquarters on Corellia as a warning.
Later that year, the Human Palpatine, an associate of Damask, committed a heinous crime.
Plagueis sent some Sun Guards and the droid 11-4D to take control of Palpatine's ship and cover up the incident.
After this event, Palpatine became Plagueis' Sith apprentice, adopting the name "Darth Sidious."

Around the same time, the Sith elevated a Sun Guard named Thull Wulain to the position of Supreme Sun Guardian, and Wulain pledged loyalty to Darth Sidious.
The Sun Guard continued to provide security at other Gatherings held by Damask on Sojourn and performed rescue missions for Plagueis, such as the retrieval of Palpatine from the clutches of Santhe Security on Coruscant.

In 33 BBY, King Ars Veruna of Naboo attacked Sojourn, resulting in the demise of the Sun Guards stationed on the moon.
Plagueis hired replacements from Thyrsus and stationed some Sun Guards to protect Damask at his Coruscant penthouse.
Over the years, Damask became increasingly reclusive, and the Sun Guards' duties were limited to escorting visitors and maintaining ground-based turbolasers.
Plagueis left Palpatine to his own devices, and the Sun Guards informed Palpatine of his master's erratic behavior.

# Agents of Lord Sidious

At some point before 32 BBY, Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord, utilized his influence to consolidate the Sun Guard in the Thyrsus system under his command.
These elite guards were assigned to protect his stronghold on Coruscant, eliminating any underdweller who approached too closely.

The Sun Guard played a crucial role in Sidious' intricate plans surrounding the Battle of Naboo.
He utilized them to assassinate reluctant businessmen and pivotal senators, ensuring his planned election as Supreme Chancellor under his public persona, Palpatine of Naboo.
Sidious' apprentice, Darth Maul, used the Sun Guard as opponents in his practice duels to hone his combat skills.

During the Clone Wars, the Sun Guard actively participated in the conflict, with their 2nd Regiment suffering a crushing defeat at the hands of Republic General Solomahal.
Some Sun Guards were also deployed during a Trandoshan-led attack on the Republic-held world of Kashyyyk, where they encountered Jedi Padawans and were ultimately defeated.

Amidst the turmoil of the Clone Wars, rogue factions of the Sun Guard led a mercenary army in a campaign against the Mistryl Shadow Guard, resulting in an orbital bombardment of the Shadow Guard's homeworld, Emberlene.

As Sidious' long-awaited plans for the Sun Guard unfolded, his apprentice Count Dooku ordered a significant portion of the organization to be executed, with the most devoted Sun Guards integrated into Palpatine's Red Guard, later becoming the Royal Guard.
Some Force-sensitive Sun Guards were selected as candidates for the Emperor's Shadow Guard, while others, like Kenix Jir, became cloning templates.

The rise of Emperor Palpatine and his manipulations of the Sun Guard caused divisions in Thyrsian society.
Many Thyrsians supported the Emperor and saw the Royal Guard as the rightful successors to the Sun Guard, leading them to enlist in the Imperial Army and Stormtrooper Corps.
However, some Sun Guards viewed Palpatine's actions as detrimental to their traditions and sought to restore their organization's reputation and honor.

After Palpatine's death in 4 ABY, Thyrsus became an isolationist world.
Yet, during the Yuuzhan Vong War of 25–29 ABY, a new generation of Sun Guards emerged, defending Thyrsus against the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong and striving to uphold their organization's ancient traditions and honor.

# Equipment and Techniques

Members of the Sun Guard wore distinctive helmets, resembling those of the Republic's Senate Guard, which likely served as inspiration for the latter.
The advanced visor of the Sun Guard helmet allowed them to image thermal data, infrared, and ultraviolet wavelengths, enhancing their surveillance and sniping capabilities.
The Sun Guard armor, characteristically black, was renowned for its resistance to damage without impeding their mobility.
Belt-spats worn around their waists inspired the design of the kama later used by the Grand Army of the Republic.

The Sun Guard uniform was instantly recognizable and feared throughout history.
It inspired the design of the Galactic Empire's Imperial Royal Guard, and even one of the Sun Guards' own, Carnor Jax, later became a Royal Guard, donning a black uniform reminiscent of his father's Sun Guard armor.
The Sun Guard's reputation extended to bounty hunters like Moxin Tark, who obtained and replicated their armor.
Dr.
Nashiak Llalik, an Imperial armor designer, drew inspiration from the Sun Guard's armor, influencing the design of specialized stormtrooper units in the Empire.

Although a Sith cultist group, the Sun Guard were generally not Force-sensitive, but exceptions existed.
They excelled in stealth and melee combat, preferring close-range confrontations.
Their combat style, believed to be the origin of the echani martial art, was modified to be more brutal and deadly under Palpatine's guidance.
Sun Guard armor was designed for close combat, with vibroblades in gauntlets, spikes in boots and knee pads, forearm gauntlets, and fist plates that could be heated to burn flesh.
Flamethrowers and dart launchers were common offensive augmentations.

The pike was the Sun Guard's common weapon, which they held in near-sacred reverence.
These pikes, about a meter in length, featured double-edged vibroblades, some made with cortosis ore to resist lightsabers.
Ritual pikes, known as solar pikes, could be activated to heat their tips to red-hot temperatures.
Force pikes were equipped with stun modules to paralyze enemies.
The Sun Guard developed innovative ways to use pikes as anti-air weapons against Mandalorians, neutralizing their jetpacks.

The Sun Guard's combat skills were nearly unmatched, with only Mandalorians able to stand against them.
Like the Echani, they possessed the ability to read body language to predict opponents' moves.
Highly skilled in personal combat and gladiatorial fighting, they excelled in urban warfare tactics, sweeping buildings and eliminating enemies block by block.
Some Sun Guards were also proficient in space combat, piloting sleek ships during their missions.
