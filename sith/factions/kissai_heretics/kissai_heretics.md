# Overview
Kissai heretics were members of the priest caste of the Sith species exiled from the planet Korriban.
Typical of their race, they appeared as red humanoids with bright yellow eyes with tentacle beards in crimson red robes.
From a hundred millennia before the Battle of Yavin, the Sith species had differentiated within their society; the Kissai became priests and knowledgeable in Sith philosophy.
The many clans were in constant dispute for territory until the Sith Adas rose to power at around 28,000 BBY, unifying the warring factions under his reign as Sith King of Korriban.
His rule would otherwise be known as the Reign of the Ax.
From the perspective of vast galactic history, this period was short-lived, as three hundred years later, Adas was killed in the Invasion of Korriban by the Rakata’s Infinite Empire.
For viewing the king’s death as a sign of illegitimacy, some Kissai were banished from their world as heretics and fled to the Force Nexus on planet Tund after taking over a ship belonging to their invaders.

# History
Following the advent of the Old Sith Empire in 6900 BBY, the descendants of the Kissai heretics were joined by immigrated Sith-Humans from the Sith Worlds within the Stygian Caldera nebula.
Other Sith-blooded species fled the Sith Worlds and increased the population on Tund further when the Great Hyperspace War broke out.
After 5000 BBY, the collection of Sith, including the Kissai heretics, upon the hidden planet formed an illusive order of Dark Side devotees, the Sorcerers of Tund.
