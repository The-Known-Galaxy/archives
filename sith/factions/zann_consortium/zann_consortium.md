# Overview
Throughout the duration of the Galactic Civil War, the underworld consortium and criminal syndicate of Tyber Zann undermined Rebel and Imperial operations.
It grew in strength and wealth during the conflict, becoming a significant nuisance and threat to both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance.

When Tyber Zann discovered Palpatine's vaults and defeated Jabba the Hutt and Prince Xizor, the Consortium's influence grew after the Battle of Endor.
Much of the Zann Consortium's technology was acquired from the black market and its Defilers, who traveled to hostile systems and established unlawful outposts for piracy and sabotage.

# Formation & Dissolution of the Pre-reformed Zann Consortium
Before 0 ABY, the Zann Consortium had been established.
Under the leadership of the criminal kingpin Tyber Zann, the movement spread wickedness and corruption throughout the galaxy and allied with the Black Hole Pirates.
Jabba the Hutt, his partner, taught Zann a great deal.
Zann seized a valuable Sith holocron from Jabba, but Imperial troops on Felucia apprehended him and transported him to Kessel.
Moments prior to his apprehension, Zann gave his companion Urai Fen the holocron.
Fen fled the planet undetected with the artifact.

Urai Fen reached out to allies of the Consortium on Kamino to save the Consortium itself.
Kamino served as headquarters for a brief time, but the Kaminoans had few resources and were unable to provide much assistance.
As soon as the Consortium decided to act, Fen dispatched soldiers from Kamino to Ryloth.
He led the Consortium to victory over the Imperial forces on Ryloth, the only obstacle to utilizing the planet, and then hid until Tyber Zann was ready.



# Post-reformed Zann Consortium: Accumulation of Power
The Consortium's only asset was the Palace on Ryloth and a few mercenary soldiers.
Zann had Fen kill the Imperial Governor on Honoghr to proclaim the Zann Consortium's return to the galaxy.
Shola was targeted for racketeering, followed by Mandal Hypernautics raids.
This offered the Consortium some money and ships while power was covertly developed.
Zann was obsessed with avenging the Empire and heard the Emperor kept his money in vaults.
The Consortium scouted the Yavin system after the Death Star's destruction, thinking it was common protocol for Imperial stations to evacuate data pods before they were destroyed to loot them.
Tyber led a small force through the first Death Star's remnants orbiting Yavin Prime.
He recovered a data pod with designs for the Eclipse-class dreadnought, which was being built in the Kuat Drive Yards, and the Aggressor-class destroyer after engaging Rebel Alliance forces in the region controlled by Wedge Antilles.
Zann planned to steal the Eclipse, which would be the Emperor's flagship like the Executor was for Darth Vader.

Jabba the Hutt destroyed the Consortium barracks on Ryloth and certain Consortium assets around the galaxy as Zann fought the Rebels and Imperials in the Yavin system.
This forced Zann to end the Hutt threat.
Consortium spies found a relay station on Saleucami where Jabba the Hutt was organizing his forces, which Urai Fen quickly took.
The Consortium then headed to Hypori, where Zann ended his fight with Jabba in a former Confederacy of Independent Systems battle-droid factory.
After shutting down the automated production lines and bribing Bossk, Zann had Jabba by the throat, demanded the bounty on his head be removed, the attacks on Consortium personnel and property stop, and Saleucami and Hypori be permanently ceded to the Consortium in exchange for his release.
Jabba agreed on the provision that Hutt Space was to be left alone.
Hypori factories now produced second-generation Droidekas.

The Zann Consortium secretly established themselves on many planetary systems around the cosmos.
Sullust, Kashyyyk, Dac, and Naboo were its main slave markets, and some were used as cannon fodder during Consortium ground operations.
The Consortium kidnapped Imperial and Rebel officials, including Kuat's Bevel Lemelisk, the most renowned "victim".
Even when Imperial soldiers, including Darth Vader, arrived, Zann blamed Prince Xizor for taking tibanna gas from Bespin, bringing him down.

In the aftermath of the Battle of Endor, Tyber commandeered the Eclipse and annihilated a second Super Star Destroyer.
The Consortium seized billions of dollars, decades-old technological information, and valuable art from Emperor Palpatine's vault network, thereby ensuring the Consortium's galactic expansion.
Tyber abandoned Eclipse following his robbery because it was a "target that even the Rebels could not ignore." The Eclipse was reclaimed and reconstructed by affiliates of the Imperial Remnants.
Zann also permitted the Rebel Alliance to establish the New Republic's "ownership of a senator."

The Consortium also sought to comprehend the Sith holocron, which had been confiscated from Jabba during his negotiations with the Galactic Empire on Felucia.
During the robbery on Coruscant, Consortium's Nightsister Silri seized the holocron before they could interpret it and disclose its secrets.
The item led her to a Sith mausoleum containing thousands of carbonite-frozen soldiers.

Admiral Natasi Daala's fleet emerged from the Maw Installation and launched a succession of attacks against the New Republic in 11 ABY, many years after the Zann Consortium fleet had been defeated.
