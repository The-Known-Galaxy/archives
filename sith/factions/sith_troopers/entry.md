# Overview

Sith Troopers were an infantry division of the Sith Imperial Military.
Serving during the time of the Jedi Civil War, the majority of Sith Troopers were actually traitorous Republic soldiers while others were volunteers from worlds conquered by the Sith.
To ensure weakness was eliminated from all troopers, enlistees were subject to merciless Sith training schemes, turning them into formidable and fearsome soldiers.
These training methods also instilled fear into the troopers, ensuring they would not falter in combat or think to betray the Sith.

Some Sith Troopers took advantage of the fear they instilled in others for personal gain, threatening and intimidating people to get what they wanted.
Others were legitimately loyal soldiers who simply believed the Sith were more suited than the Republic to control the galaxy.
Sith Troopers were often seen as expendable by their superiors, such as when Darth Malak ordered the destruction of Taris to kill Bastilla Shan, showing no regard for the thousands of Sith Troopers stationed on the planet.
Following the Jedi Civil War, most Sith Troopers fell under the command of the Sith Triumvirate, later participating in the battles of Onderon and Telos IV.

# Equipment

Sith troopers were outfitted with unique reflective armour, coloured either black, red, or white with padding underneath and a visor to conceal their faces.
This armour did not have any distinct indication of rank, so higher-ranked soldiers often wore red or copper armour to show their rank.

Weapons carried by Sith Troopers varied depending on their specialization, though standard Troopers were equipped with a Sith assault gun, Sith sniper rifle, stun baton, and vibroblades; some were additionally equipped with Sith energy shields.
By the time of the Great Galactic War, Sith Troopers were equipped with TH-17 blaster rifles.
