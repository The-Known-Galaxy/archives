# Overview

The Imperial Navy of the newly reformed Sith Empire was the main naval fighting force of the Sith Empire against the Galactic Republic that was built around 4980 BBY and fought 3 centuries later in The Great Galactic War.

# History

The fleet itself was massive and took several centuries to build in secret within the unknown regions on the planet of Dromund Kaas under the supervision of Grand Moff Odile Vaiken(who died in the early stages of construction).
By the end of the construction(three centuries later), nearly the entire planet was filled with naval ships.
The Grand Moff was aware that he would die by the time the fleet was constructed.
So he ordered that when it was finished the force sensitive natives of Dromund Kaas were to either John the Navy or Imperial Army.

Using Harrower Class Dreadnoughts and Terminus Destroyers in bulk the Navy proved useful for transport, siege, and massive battles.
The fleet was so powerful it even managed to “sack” Coruscant in the final act of the War.
Which led to the Treaty of Coruscant which also led to the Sith taking over half the galaxy during the war.

# Additional information

The Navy also used Mark VI Supremacy-Class Star Fighters as the main standard fighter during the war.
They also used B28 Extinction Class Bombers as the Navy’s Standard Bomber Fighters as well.
The Navy also used a range of models when it came to support, transport, gunships, cruisers, shuttles, and carriers as well.
