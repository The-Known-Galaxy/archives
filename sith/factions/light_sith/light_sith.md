# Overview

The Light Sith were a group of people who rejected the use of the dark side of the force.
These individuals were still faithful to the Sith as an organization, so they went by the name of Light sith or lightâ€“sided Sith.
The history of the Light Sith began during the Cold War when a group of light-learning Sith formed into the ranks of the Sith Empire.
The Dark Council then chose the Sith Lord Cendence to hunt down Sith that were not deemed pure.

```
During The cold war, the renegade sith were tracked down by the Sith apprentice Jaesa Willsaam and were all slaughtered successfully.
```

Jaesa then found an injured Light Sith who told her about Cendence.
She then killed Cendence because she found out he killed any Sith he pleased, and then was given his position by Caliqu, another Sith Lord.

```
Years later, Darth Gravid, a Sith Lord, concluded that pure devotion to the dark side would curse the Sith of his era, Just like his predecessors.
```

He wanted a new way the Sith would follow the light side of the Force.
The legacy of Darth Gravid was then later discovered by Darth Plagueis in regards to seeking the lost method of immortality.
In light of the discovery, Plagueis would do well in Gravids honor, ending the Rule of Two, to then be murdered by his apprentice, Darth Sidious.
