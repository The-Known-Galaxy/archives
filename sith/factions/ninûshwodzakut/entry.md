# Overview

The Ninûshwodzakut, translated to ‘Knotters of Entrails’, were a group of Kissai who specialized in the creation of Sithspawn war beasts via alchemy and manipulated breeding.
Sorzus Syn visited the breeding pens of the Ninûshwodzakut on Ziost after acquiring the Holocron of King Nakgru in 6899 BBY, where he studied their warbeasts and their creation, these included: war behemoths, tuk’ata, war wyrms, warbirds and many more Sithspawn.
These Sithspawn were used by the Sith to fight in combat, or for the guarding of ancient tombs of the Sith.
