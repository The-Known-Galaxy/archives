# Overview

Darkseekers were a sect of the Sith Order.
Their primary objective was to eliminate any threats towards the Sith.
Very little is known about them, but they appeared in blood-red robes.
An unidentified member was of the Sith species, but it is assumed that the group included other species attuned to the Dark Side of the Force.

# History

Centuries before 4 ABY, the Darkseekers sought to locate and destroy the Ascendant.
This organisation wished to manipulate the Force with technology to eliminate the Sith, even theorised as more sinister than the Sith by Dr Chelli Lona Aphra.
After learning of the Spark Eternal, an artificial intelligence rumoured to give immortality, the Darkseekers massacred the offshoot faction of the Ascendant in their temple on the planet Pyrr IX, led by Ilith, who was responsible for its creation.

However, this attempt was ultimately in vain.
Another prototype of the Spark Eternal was uncovered on the planet Barâ€™leth during the Imperial Era, left there by Miril, the leader of the main Ascendant faction.
The sentience crossed paths with the Sith again in the battle at the Amaxine Station, where it had possessed Aphra and armed itself with a weapon that could neutralise a lightsaber, the Null Blade, to duel Darth Vader.
