# Overview

The Order of the Silver Jedi was a group of force-sensitive Jedi that were devoted to eradicating the dark side of the force as well as protecting and serving the Galactic Republic.
This order was known to be a heavily combat oriented military organization however the order did include a few Jedi theorists and philosophers within their ranks.
The order’s insignia contained a pair of lightsabers crossing at the handles beneath a silver crescent which had tips pointing downward.
While the order was known for its hostility against the dark side and its users, soon enough they would discover after many experimentations that opening themselves to the force fully allowed them to reach a greater level of strength, which would aid them in their objective to eradicate the dark side for good.

# Section I

Tel Angor who was the order’s greatest Jedi Knight at the time had volunteered in this experiment however the preparation would take days of meditating, fasting, and strengthening his connection with the force in hopes of completely merging with it.
With a positive mindset from both the Silver Jedi Order and Tel Angor the experiment would begin but unfortunately for Angor the experiment had taken a bad turn and instead of strengthening him within the light side of the Force he had unfortunately been corrupted by the dark side leading him to become a Force Vampire.
Angor would now be filled with a complete desire to feed on the Force attacking and feeding on his first victim who was a Silver Jedi that had aided him in the experiment.
This was a significant point in the orders history as it would turn one of its most well known and greatest Jedi Knights into a Power Hungry vampire completely corrupted by the darkside.

# Section II

Upon finding out about these tragic events, The order would proceed to hunt down the vampire as it would become a big threat to all of the Silver Jedi.
This process would take a long time and just before the beginning of the Clone Wars a small group of seven Silver Jedi would come into contact with the fallen Knight capturing him after a long, deadly battle.
Not much was known about the order however it is believed to have been completely abolished after the events of order 66 with their main stronghold on Coruscul being abandoned.
