# Overview
The Black Sun was a well-known criminal syndicate that was founded during the Clone Wars of 22 - 19 BBY that majored in Sentient trafficking.
With the Jedi Order’s purpose at the time being shifted to military affairs as opposed to law enforcement, it allowed for the rise of crime in areas that were less heavily guarded, specifically the Outer-Rim.
The Black Sun was founded on Mustafar by Xomit Grunseit and maintained bases on planets such as Ord Mantell throughout the galaxy, stretching their reach far and wide.


During the Clone Wars, the syndicate instantaneously became very influential, and was run by a group of Falleen noblemen on Mustafar.
During the war, the Black Sun was coerced by Maul into joining his Shadow Collective after his brother, Savage Opress, killed their leader, Xomit Grunseit.
Under the Shadow Collective, the faction banded with the Pyke Syndicate and participated in the Battle of Ord Mantell, defending against the Confederate Trade System’s Separatist army.


Towards the end of the Clone Wars, Ziton Moj, the newly appointed leader of the Black Sun, proposed merging with the Pyke Syndicate.
However, in a turn of events, Marg Krim, the leader of the Pyke Syndicate, rejected his proposal.
He retaliated by kidnapping his family in order to force Krim to change his mind.
This led to Krim hiring two bounty hunters to rescue his family.
The two bounty hunters raided the Blade Sun fortress on Mustafar and succeeded in rescuing Krim’s family.
The Black Sun retaliated by sending a fleet to attack the Pyke stronghold of Oba Diah.


In the aftermath of the fall of the Galactic Republic, and the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Black Sun maintained a durable relationship with the autocratic government, and kept watch over the Outer-Rim.
Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, the notorious crime syndicate Crimson Dawn returned after a long absence and sent out a message to various criminal factions by the leader Lady Qi’ra, inviting the syndicates to bid for the carbonite encased Han Solo.
Black Sun answered the call and arrived at the planet Jekara, where one of their ships was hit by the Milennium Falcon.


The leader of Black Sun, Gyuti, then entered the Vermillion along with Xet and a few other Falleen.
Black Sun bid for Solo during the auction, but were ultimately outbid by Jabba Tiure, also known as Jabba the Hut.
His victory, however, was short lived, as it was interrupted by the arrival of Darth Vader, declaring Solo belonged to him.
Vader attacked several of the syndicates and forced Black Sun to retreat from Jekara.
