# Overview

The Eternal Empire was a galactic faction that was formed out of the planet of Zakuul, which served as its capital.
Its territories were vast, accompassing systems from the Outer Rim and Wild Space.
It was governed like a dictatorship under the behest of the Emperor, supported by its robust military and the Scions of Zakuul, a nascent religious body that supports the backbone of the Empire with their ability to see the future with the use of the Force.
Its official language is the Galactic Basic Standard, the adopted galactic commonality.

# Origins and Conflicts

The discovery of Zakuul was spearheaded by then Sith Emperor, Vitiate, who would travel into deep Wild Space in search of the Eternal Fleet, a near-mythical colossal fleet of warships commanded and operated by droids.
In his discovery would be the planet of Zakuul where primitive superstitious humans who up till this point would be isolated had worshiped the Old Gods.
Vitiate would take up the name Emperor Valkorion, uniting the system and nomadic tribes of Zakuul into one hegemonic civilization solely devoted and obedient to him alone.
His new Eternal Empire would be expansive, however, isolated in the Outer Rim and Wild Space territories away from the eyes of the Republic and the Sith Empire.

He would form the Knights of Zakuul, a force-user order whose loyalty is bound to him.
The Scions would emerge as a sub-group of the Knights, whose expertise in the Force and visions would be used to locate the Eternal Fleet and enslave the droids to Valkorion.
The Eternal Empire would adopt this form of isolationism until the Galactic War, where Valkorion’s twin sons Thexan and Arcann would push for a strike on both sides of the conflict, the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.
Valkorion would sanction this, eventually leading to the Eternal Empire’s intervention in the conflict and the near-devastation of both sides as the Eternal Empire’s forces would curb the already weakened and strained Sith Empire & Republic.
The twin princes’ intervention would culminate in the Battle of Korriban, where one of the twins Arcann would be severely wounded.
Thexan would be killed by Arcann subsequently as he embraced the Dark Side, his death would be labeled as a casualty in the Core Worlds campaign by the Eternal Empire.

# Betrayal and Downfall

Soon after, Darth Marr would be captured by Arcann after a subsequent battle that left Darth Marr’s ships ravaged by the Eternal forces.
The Emperor would demand Darth Marr to kneel and he would refuse this, leading to his death at the hands of Valkorion with a saberstaff.
In that, Arcann would betray his father, killing Valkorion and proclaiming himself to be the new Emperor of the Eternal Empire as he would set out to put the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic to their knees, an endeavor he would accomplish by enforcing a limitation on ships and military arms as well as a tribute from both sides, making the Eternal Empire a sole hegemonic power in the galaxy at that point of time.
Arcann would also be very cruel to his younger sister, Vaylin, who would be tormented and as a result, grow strong in the Dark Side of the Force.

They would act as joint rulers despite Arcann being the more prominent figure of the two as Vaylin would serve as High Justice and Empress.
The growing internal conflict within the Eternal Empire would boil to a limit, eventually resulting in the War with the Eternal Alliance, a long struggle with its conclusion leaving Emperor Arcann dethroned and deposed, Empress Vaylin killed and Valkorion killed with the use of a powerful holocron.
The Eternal Empire would soon after be dissolved with Vaylin’s death, resulting in the formation of the Eternal Alliance and an elected body of legislature based in Zakuul doing away with the totalitarian and absolute governance of old.
