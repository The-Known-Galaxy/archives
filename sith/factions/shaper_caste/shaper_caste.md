# Overview
The Shaper Caste were the masterminds behind the all biological weapons used by the Yuuzhan Vong in their attempted invasion of the Known Galaxy.
This class, in Yuuzhan Vong society, was considered the equivalent of the Known Galaxy’s engineers and scientists.
The weaponry created differed from Koros-Strohna to simple clothing, the Shaper Caste were responsible for the creation of everything.
The techniques that the shapers used to fabricate weapons and clothing were locked in cortexes, of which there were only eight in the entire army.
Adepts were only allowed access to information up to the fifth cortex, with Masters being the only individuals capable of accessing up the the eighth cortex, due to being classes as a high-ranking individual.

The shapes were guided by the strictest of protocol.
Deviance from these protocols was grounds for demotion to another caste, or in worst cases, execution.
This was primarily accredited to the Yuuzhan Vong’s religious beliefs which stated that knowledge was incapable of being created as it was given to them from the mind of Yun-Yuuzhan through Yun-Harla’s handmaiden Yun-Ne’Shel, three significant individuals in the Yuuzhan Vong religion.
Due to this, it had caused a serious lack of inventiveness on the part of the shapers, as none of their ideas were original.

Amongst the several deities of the Yuuzhan Vong society, the shapers worshipped a particular deity amongst the pantheon of the Yun’o, who was Yun-Ne’Shel, the Modeler.
The Shapers had attempted to model themselves after their self-proclaimed goddess, just as the other castes did.
They did not have an excessive level of outward scarring, but instead made use of necessary ones as such, to symbolize Yun-Ne’Shel.
Shaper Caste faction members were typically fully tattooed, wore form fitting oozhiths, and had special headdresses that displayed their emotional state.
However, at times they were also capable of controlling the display of the headdress’s tentacles.

When the Shaper Caste Initiates entered the rank of Adept, they were required to make their sacrifice to their god, Yun-Ne’Shel.
This involved the individuals being in the Grooto of Yun-Ne’Shel where they sacrificed a hand to the organic creature which was replaced with the hand of a Shaper, which would aid them in shaping new creatures.
Moreover, the implantation of a Vaa-tumor which was painful over the years but remodeled their brain to accept the new knowledge they learned over their training was also used to show faith to their goddess.
It was believed that the tumour sculpted their brains to match the divine form of their goddess.
Upon becoming a Master Shaper, this tumor was to be removed.
