# Overview

Clan Kelborn was a well respected Mandalorian Clan during and after the Mandalorian Wars.
Though very little is known about this Clan, we do know that it took part in the Mandalorian Wars, the Dark Wars and later fought on the side of Mand’alor the Vindicated and the Sith during the Cold Wars and subsequent conflicts.

Clan Kelborn had originally rebelled against Mand’alor the Vindicated alongside Clan Cadera and several other Mandalorian Clans because of his decision to ally with the Sith Empire, though this rebellion was swiftly defeated.
After their defeat, Clan Kelborn was welcomed back into the ranks of Mand’alor the Vindicated’s army and once again took their seat as a well respected Mandalorian Clan.
