# Introduction
Imperial Intelligence served as the primary intelligence gathering and internal security branch of the Sith Empire from the earliest days of the Empire’s founding on Dromund Kaas.
The organisation was designed to safeguard the security of the Sith Empire internally and to further the interests of the Empire abroad.


To do this, Imperial Intelligence would utilize ruthless agents, undercover operatives and the brightest minds the Empire had to offer.
Over the course of their lengthy existence they would become feared by all, including the Sith, and for good reason.

# Part I: Founding and History
Imperial Intelligence was established in the earliest days of the resettlement effort on Dromund Kaas by the Reconstituted Sith Empire.
It is rumoured within Imperial society that Imperial Intelligence was founded by Grand Moff Vaiken, however, the more common belief is that the Emperor’s powerbase was responsible.


Over the course of its existence Imperial Intelligence would conduct many operations crucial to the success of the Sith Empire that would have a large effect on the galaxy for thousands of years.
Their largest operation had been the setup of the Mandalorian Wars in which Imperial Intelligence dispatched operatives into Republic space to encourage the Mandalorians to wage war against the Republic, which turned out to be an orchestrated plot by the Emperor himself to test the military capabilities of the Galactic Republic.


Another major operation would have been when an Imperial Intelligence Operative by the Codename ‘’Cipher 9’’ would be dispatched to investigate and destroy a terrorist cell responsible for the destruction of Darth Jadus’ Star Destroyer, only to uncover that it was in fact Darth Jadus who had been plotting a coup against the Emperor.
Cipher 9 would then kill Darth Jadus, a Dark Lord of the Sith and Dark Councillor.


Imperial Intelligence would eventually be dissolved in 3640 BBY and turned into Sith Intelligence as a result of their near-destruction and failures during the operation against the Star Cabal; the organisation responsible for crippling Imperial Intelligence in their effort to eradicate the galaxy of the Sith and Jedi.



# Part II: Structure
Imperial Intelligence would fall under the oversight of the Sphere of Imperial Intelligence, which would be the Dark Councilor responsible for ensuring the successful operations of Imperial Intelligence.
Other than this Dark Councilor, Imperial Intelligence would be entirely made up of Imperials and non-force sensitives who would fall under the umbrella of the Ministry of Intelligence and report directly to the Minister of Intelligence, the Imperial Minister responsible for the running of Imperial Intelligence.


Imperial Intelligence would have seven official ranks, not including individuals who are attached to assist on Imperial Intelligence operations.
These ranks would be; 

Minister of Imperial Intelligence - The Imperial Minister responsible for overseeing Imperial Intelligence, reports directly to the Sphere of Imperial Intelligence.


Keeper - The Keeper is the day-to-day manager of Imperial Intelligence operations.
Taking a direct role in many of its missions and relaying the Minister of Intelligence’s orders to the Intelligence department.


Watcher - Watchers are responsible for processing the incoming and outgoing data of Imperial Intelligence and then relaying this information to Keeper.
They are also responsible for handling field agents while they are on operations by keeping them briefed and relaying orders from Keeper.

Fixer - Fixers are the engineers and slicers of Imperial Intelligence.
They will process any hardware that Imperial Intelligence confiscates and ensure that Imperial Intelligence hardware is always the best.


Minder - Minders are responsible for processing missions data and reports from military and intelligence assets to predict the strategies and tactics of the various enemies of the Empire.

Cipher - Ciphers are the most capable field agents that Imperial Intelligence produces.
They utilize a variety of espionage tactics to further the interests of the Empire both internally and externally.


Agent - Agents are the most common field agents within Imperial Intelligence.
They operate alone or in small teams to conduct a wide variety of operations across the Empire and against its enemies.


Informer - Informers are the backbone of Imperial Intelligence’s spy network.
Informers can range from patriotic civilians, Imperial nobles, blackmailed criminals and even Sith, but all exist to provide information to their masters in Imperial Intelligence.



# Part III: Strategies and reputation
Imperial Intelligence grew to become capable enough to rival the schemes and internal politics of the Sith Order.
This was done through shrewd and ruthless tactics to ensure that nothing prevented them from keeping the security of the Empire intact.


Imperial Intelligence agents would often utilize seduction, torture, kidnapping, assassination and blackmail tactics against its enemies.
One Imperial Intelligence agent could be assigned to assassinate a gang leader, another could be assigned to infiltrate Republic political society, as a result, their agents had to be extremely adaptable and capable of performing a wide array of roles depending on the demands of the situation.


Very few within Imperial society and the Sith were unaware of Imperial Intelligence’s existence.
Through fear they would ensure that Imperials and Sith alike had no desire to overthrow the Emperor or sabotage Imperial efforts.
This would often result in many Imperials and Sith going missing, never to be heard from again, or dying in some unfortunate random accident.

Imperial Intelligence support employees were the most educated and well trained minds in the galaxy, many individuals employed by Imperial Intelligence would have literally been bred for the role.
This ensured that the organisation was always supported with the best strategies, technology and agents.
