# Introduction

The Confederacy of Independent Systems, also known as the Confederacy, New Order, but more often referred to simply as the Separatists, was a state officially led by Count Dooku and in reality Darth Sidious and formed from various planetary and sectoral governments, which, like some megacorporations that decided to secede from the Galactic Republic due to displeasure with the corrupt Senate during the Separatist Crisis.
Eventually, tensions between the CIS and the Republic resulted in an armed conflict known as the Clone Wars.
The first battle took place on the planet Geonosis, where the CIS droid army clashed with the newly formed Grand Army of the Republic, during the battle the droid army was defeated, and the Separatists were forced to retreat.
During the War, the scales tipped first to one side, then to the other, until Darth Sidious decided that the CIS had done its job, and he didn’t need anymore, he sent his new student, Darth Vader, to Mustafar, who destroyed the entire Separatist Council, putting an end to the puppet government.

# Section 1

In the years leading up to the Clone Wars, the Galactic Republic saw numerous governments, each plagued by the corruption and bureaucracy of the Galactic Senate.
After the crisis on Naboo, the trade guilds were outraged by the tax on trade with outlying worlds.
In this critical situation, Count Dooku appeared as a former Jedi Master who left the Order to fight the corruption that reigned in the Republic, and with the most radical methods.
He was able to win over many worlds that were dissatisfied with the Republic.
He became the head of a movement called the Confederation of Independent Systems.
Although the Republic understood that many worlds had joined in this rebellion, the Senate refused to acknowledge the existence of the CIS, as well as their governments.

# Section 2

The Confederation began preparing its armed forces for an invasion of Republic space to crush the hated state and capture its capital, Coruscant.
After the events on Naboo, the Republic ordered the Trade Federation to destroy its army of droids, which, of course, agreed, but did not destroy all of them, some of the droids were safely hidden, and the droid production factories were moved to distant planets such as Hypori.
The Techno Union also provided its droids for the CIS, so while Dooku, with his oratorical abilities, won over more and more planets to the side of the CIS, in the depths of the secret Separatist bases, millions of battle droids were created, which were just waiting for the moment to join the battle.
However, the element of surprise was lost when Obi-Wan Kenobi, pursuing Jango Fett, flew to Geonosis and revealed the plans of the Separatists, transmitting these plans to the Jedi Council, but after transmitting the information he was captured by the Geonosians.
Anakin and Padme followed him but were also captured at the droid factories.
Dooku sentenced Kenobi, Padmé, and Anakin to death in the Arena of Geonosis.
During the execution, a detachment of Jedi, led by Mace Windu, landed on the planet and rushed to help their friends.
An unequal battle ensued in the Arena, during which the Jedi suffered heavy losses and were surrounded by droids.
They could have died, but Yoda, who arrived in time at the head of an army of clones, saved them, and then the famous battle on Geonosis began.
The Republic troops were able to defeat and drive the CIS off the planet, but they only won the battle; the War was still ahead.
