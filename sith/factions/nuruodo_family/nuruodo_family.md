The Nuruodo Family were one of the original four Ruling Families within the old Oligarchy of the Chiss Ascendancy and have always remained part of the Ruling Families, they are the second most powerful and influential family within the Chiss Ascendancy; They are however the most influential and well known family outside of Chiss space.
The Nuruodo Family was responsible for the military affairs and foreign policies of the Chiss ascendancy, thus they were ultimately in command of the Expansionary Defense Force and many of the colonial and household phalanxes.
Some notable members of the Nuruodo family are: Kung’urama’nuruodo, Sev’eere’nuruodo and Gimald Nuruodo

Most contact from outsiders with the Chiss Ascendancy was done through agents, diplomats and representatives of the Nuruodo family due to the family’s nature and experience of dealing with foreign issues.
Although rare, it did happen that the Chiss were sent out on diplomatic missions outside of Chiss space, these Chiss were usually agents and diplomats from the Nuruodo family.
A small number of Nuruodo agents were tasked with the finding of other Chiss that had been either lost or taken up into other civilizations to gain further knowledge.

Although the Nuruodo family are responsible for the military affairs and operations of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force, do note that ultimately the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force is not aligned to any family and their only official allegiance is to the Chiss Ascendancy itself.
A Chiss who was part of the Expansionary Defence Force held no family ties.
However, all other military structures and organizations such as the Household phalanxes and Colonial phalanxes are allowed to remain within a family; Most are part of or aligned to the Nuruodo family.
