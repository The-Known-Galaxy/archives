# Introduction

The Knights of Zakuul, also recognized as the Zakuul Knights, were a distinct order of Force-sensitive warriors who pledged allegiance to the Emperor of the Eternal Empire.
Setting themselves apart from the prevailing philosophies of the Jedi and Sith, they held the view that the Force was a tool to enforce justice.
Moreover, they maintained that their links to the Force stemmed directly from Emperor Valkorion, distinguishing their approach from that of other Force traditions.

# Section 1

The Knights of Zakuul fulfilled their duty by safeguarding the Emperor of the Eternal Empire and ensuring justice throughout its domain.
In contrast to the Jedi or Sith, they embraced the acquisition of power through the Force.
Yet unlike the Sith of their time, they promoted the sharing of knowledge among their ranks.
They emphasized the significance of each Knight exploring their unique connection to the Force, rejecting the strict doctrines of the Jedi and Sith.
No aspect of the Force was considered too insignificant for exploration, nor were there any forbidden areas of studies.
While the pursuit of power inevitably drew parallels with the Sith, the Knights prioritized collective learning, encouraging the spreading of discoveries within the order rather than individual collecting.
The Knights of Zakuul distinguished themselves through their choice of weaponry, often wielding distinctive lightsaber pikes in conjunction with shields for deflecting blaster fire.
However, they were also proficient in using standard lightsabers and double-bladed variants in combat.
Preference was given to blue color crystals in crafting their lightsabers, although cybernetically-enhanced Knights tasked with guarding the Eternal Empire's Star Fortresses wielded orange-bladed ones.
Uniformity was maintained through the adoption of gold-colored armor as the standard attire for Knights, each being instructed in the art of forging their own armor from a young age.

# Section 2

The lineage of the Knights of Zakuul can be traced back to the Force-sensitive tribal leaders of the early settlers of Zakuul, including Matriarchs, Champions and High Shamans.
Following Valkorion's unification of the disparate tribes, centuries before 3636 BBY, these roles were restructured and institutionalized, giving rise to the formal order known as the Knights of Zakuul.
The Knights remained steadfast in their service even after the assassination of Valkorion, pledging allegiance to his successors, Arcann and Vaylin.
Under Arcann's rule, the elite Knights were handpicked for the experimental Project Exarch, receiving cutting-edge technologies.
Throughout Vaylin's reign, the Knights remained in service until the Assault on Odessen, after which they were disbanded and their members scattered.
After the disbandment of the Zakuul Knights following the Assault on Odessen, their fate varied among individuals.
Some former Knights may have sought refuge in the remnants of the Eternal Empire, attempting to regroup or find a new purpose within the galaxy.
Others may have chosen to integrate into other organizations or societies, seeking to establish new lives beyond their former allegiance.
Additionally, some may have become mercenaries, hired guns, or independent agents, utilizing their skills and training for personal gain or to serve new causes.
Overall, the dissolution of the Zakuul Knights left its members scattered across the galaxy, each forging their own path in the aftermath of the fall of the Eternal Empire.

# Section 3

In the Knights of Zakuul, the High Justice occupies the apex of authority, wielding supreme power over matters of justice, governance, and the enforcement of the Emperor's will.
Charged with upholding the order's principles and traditions, the High Justice ensures adherence to the code of conduct among Knights and maintains the values of the Eternal Empire.
They are the ultimate arbiter of justice, overseeing all aspects of the order's operations and ensuring that every Knight operates in alignment with the Empire's ideals.
Among the Emperor's elite guards, the Honor Guards stand as the chosen protectors of the Eternal Throne, tasked with safeguarding the Emperor personally.
Meanwhile, the Exarchs represent a specialized cadre within the Knights, having undergone the perilous Project Exarch to receive cybernetic enhancements.
These enhancements, though often fatal, grant Exarchs augmented abilities, including a diverse range of powers facilitated by various crystals for their lightsabers.
Equipped with advanced iterations of Knight armor, Exarchs exhibit heightened combat prowess and resilience, making them formidable adversaries on the battlefield.
