# Description
The Mandalorian Protectors, or Mandalore's Royal Guard, were a known organization of Honour and true Duty, they believed in a bigger cause than their own as well as protecting the Mand'alor.

Protectors were recognized through their banners, sigils and their blue overall coloring.
Most of these fine warriors were known as Elite Mandalorians taken from clans all around the planet of Mandalore.


As well as being known Elites in combat, the Protectors were effective as pilots, flying the fang fighter.
Although they are seen wearing blue Mandalorian Beskar'gam, they also possess ceremonial armor for ceremonies.

The Protectors are a group of tradition, however at the time of the Empire, the Protectors were mostly wiped by an Imperial Loyalist named Gar Saxon, with Fen Rau, the Protector leader being the only survivor, most likely rebuilding whatever is left of the Protectors.
