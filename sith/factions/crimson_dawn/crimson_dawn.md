# Overview

Crimson Dawn was a criminal cartel formed from the Shadow Collective who was known for being ruthless and led by former Sith Lord Maul, who hired Dryden Vos as the image of the cartel during the Siege of Mandalore.
The criminal cartel had a Nau’ur-class yacht named First Light which was used for their base-of-operations.

Vos was eventually killed by his top lieutenant, Qi’ra.
After those events, Qi’ra decided to work with Maul.
After Maul’s death, she became the new leader of the cartel and was given the title “Lady.”

# History

A tale was told by multiple individuals.
Before they were a popular criminal syndicate, Crimson Dawn used to be a band of ruthless mercenaries who traveled from place to place to seize the resources they needed while tormenting the natives.
One example of this happening was on the desert planet Savareen.
After several raids on their world to obtain what they wanted, the natives stood up against them.
As a result of their disobedience, the mercenaries cut out the tongues of every single native they would find.

# Legacy

After Maul’s death, the impact left by Crimson Dawn was still out there.
Other criminal cartels that evolved from Crimson Dawn were far more advanced than before.
Although the new republic took measures, it was a mere fraction of the size the Galactic Empire had.
It was active for a short while after the events of the Empire's fall and eventually, the cartel syndicate died out, now viewed as a relic of the past.
