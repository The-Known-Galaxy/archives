# Introduction

The Nightsisters are a relatively small clan that reside on the planet known as Dathomir and have extremely powerful knowledge in the arts of the Force.
The clan is well known for their sorcery and mystical power that is used to defend their home at all costs.
They have even gained other titles such as “The Witches of Dathomir.” These practitioners of the Darkside would have a hatred that could even match a Sith’s when it comes to the Jedi Order.

# Section 1

The Nightsisters were well advanced with the dark side of the Force, using it in ways that not even Sith could replicate, at least not without proper training.
They’re mastery over the arcane power that can be felt throughout Dathomir came from their mystical bond to the magical ichor deep inside the planet.
The leader of the clan, Mother Talzin, was known to be a great shaman with astonishing powers and control over the ichor, going so far as to even produce a blade out of the ichor to use in a duel against Jedi Master Mace Windu.
The magical feats of the ichor and the sisters know very little bounds, going so far as to even surpass death as the clan have brought back many fallen warriors, Nightbrothers included.
An example of their resurrection abilities can be seen as they bring back the fallen former Apprentice of Count Dooku, Savage Opress.

# Section 2

Not every Nightsister was as attuned to sorcery as their leader, some did well with direct combat.
There would be clan members who would use an energy bow to defend their planet and their fellow sisters.
The archers would be highly skilled with their weapons and would not be taken down easily.
There are also instances when the Nightsisters would even use lightsabers, alongside their own blades with Kyber Crystals that were soaked within the magical ichor.
The ichor would disrupt the connection the crystal had to the Force.
While not every member of the clan was highly advanced in sorcery, those who did would become an asset to Mother Talzin.
One notable Nightsister was known as Old Daka, an elderly Nightsister whose powers didn’t weaken even with her age.
Old Daka would have a strong connection to the magicks of the Nightsisters and would be somebody that even Mother Talzin would ask for help if needed.

# Section 3

During the Clone Wars, Talzin would sell her sister’s services as mercenaries to the wealthy of the galaxy.
Some Nightsisters would even become bounty hunters.
Later on, the Nightsisters were forced to give a young Asajj Ventress to a notorious criminal known as Hal’Sted for protective insurance.
After many years, Ventress would return to the planet and seek out her former sisters.
The Nightsisters would rush to her aid and Mother Talzin would even select one of the Nightbrothers to be sent out to help Ventress get her revenge against her former master, Count Dooku.
Mother Talzin would enchant the Nightbrother and give him the power of physical strength, a power that allowed him to single-handedly take down multiple Jedi.
Eventually, after attempts of assassination led by the Nightsisters, Dooku would call upon General Grievous and his forces within the Confederacy of Independent systems to raid Dathomir and the Nightsisters.
The clan would hold back as much as they could, and even Old Daka would assist in the defense of their clan, but the battlefield left little to no survivors, being the last time the Nightsisters would ever rise to defend their home.
The battle would be known as “The Massacre of the Nightsisters.”
