# Introduction

Clan Cadera was a Mandalorian clan that reigned during the Great Galactic War and the Cold War.
Anew Mand’alor by the name of Mandalore the Vindicated, rose to power and the clan made an alliance with the Sith.
Jicoln Cadera, a known member of the clan, argued against the very thought of an alliance.
He strongly believed in the ways of their former leader, Mandalore the Preserver, who had encouraged them to side with the Republic in the past.

# Section One

Conflict of interest arose, pushing Jicoln to create an army called the Crusader’s Schism.
Their attempts were futile and Jicoln was supposedly killed during battle.
The remainder of Clan Cadera was made up of women and young children and they were welcomed back into the Mandalorian community.
Jicoln’s revolt left the clan with a darkness that lingered overhead.
His son, Torian Cadera, was called a slew of derogatory terms such as arue’tal, which meant traitor’s blood.
When Torian heard the news of his father’s survival, he joined forces with the Grand Champion of the Great Hunt.
They entered a galaxy-wide bounty hunting competition that was organized by the Mandalorian clans to locate and kill Jicoln.

Torian and the champion reached Taris, the last known whereabouts of Jicoln.
They later confronted him and partook in the death game called Geroya be Haran.
After the continued battle, they came out victorious, but before they could finish the job Jicoln recognized his son.
Jicoln asked to talk to Torian before he was handed his fate.
They talked for a brief moment and once the conversation was over Jicoln met his fate.
Jicoln was turned over to a group of Mandalorian soldiers that would take him to Mandalore the Vindicated.
Some time passed, and Torian chose to join the champion’s bounty hunter crew in search of new challenges.
By the time the war against Zakuul took place, very few members of Clan Cadera remained.
Mandalore the Avenger made a call for Torian Cadera to go to Darvannis, and Torian obliged.
He became her top scout and later became the new chief                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 of Clan Cadera.
