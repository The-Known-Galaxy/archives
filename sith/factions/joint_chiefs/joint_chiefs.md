# Overview
The Joint Chiefs were members of a council that guided the Galactic Emperor, Palpatine.
They served as a council of important figures, who dedicated themselves to serving the Galactic Empire.
The Joint Chiefs were made up of the highest ranking Officers of the Empire, both Naval and Military Officers.
The Joint Chiefs worked closely with all the Intelligence units and the Imperial Ruling Council.
The organisation was made up of these members: Major General Cassio Tagge, Rear Admirals Kendal Ozzel, and Tiaan Jerjerrod.
They were later accompanied by Imperial Intelligent Officers and Admirals Nils Tenant and Antonio.
Before the battle of Scarif and the destruction of the first Death Star, the Joint Chiefs had one last meeting in the Death Star conference room.
This meeting was led by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and shortly after, Director Orson Krennic died on Scarif.
The destruction of the first Death Star killed all the members of the Joint Chiefs, except Tagge.
Later on, Tagge was promoted to Grand General, which gave him command of the military.
Tagge was later killed by Vader because of his alliance with Cylo.
