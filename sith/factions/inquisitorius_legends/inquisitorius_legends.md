# Overview
The Imperial Inquisition was a division under Imperial Intelligence with only Force-sensitive members called Inquisitors, meaning "truth officers".
Ruling under the Emperor, the Inquisitors acted as the highest ranking Adepts, meaning they were higher than ranks such as the Prophets of the Dark Side and the lesser Dark Jedi.
Reporting ONLY to the Emperor, they were only outranked by a portion of the Empire's ranks.

# Section I
Established sometime around 19 BBY, the Inquisitorius was composed of Inquisitors hunting Jedi who survived Order 66.
Those who were deemed worthy of Inquisitor were put under numerous grueling tasks.
The first task was a test and examination done to evaluate the intelligence of the candidate, then the second being a personal test by the Grand Inquisitor.
Many Jedi who survived the Jedi Purge left the Light and joined the Inquisitors.
After capturing a Jedi, they were tasked with turning said Jedi to the Dark side.
If this failed, the Jedi was to be killed.

The first torture tactics used after capturing a Jedi were injections and beatings.
When these means failed, an Inquisitor would be called to take care of the Jedi themselves, be it a Force Mind trick or even more torture using force moves.
Despite common belief, the Imperial Intelligence was quite good at their job, meaning Inquisitors were rarely called on to handle these situations.
Instead, Inquisitors mainly focused on killing or capturing remaining Jedi.
