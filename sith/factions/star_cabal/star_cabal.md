# Organization and Philosophy

The Star Cabal had envisioned a purpose for themselves, the purpose In their eyes being a noble one.
The objective was the preservation of a civilization nearly destroyed by Jedi and Sith.
Therefore, the beliefs that both orders had held responsibility for the devastation of this civilization by the conflicts of both orders at war became rather popular.
The Cabal sought to maintain and control these actions upon them from a distance.
They had sworn to keep both the Empire and the Republic away from each other due to the conflict it would bring.

They future successors of the Star Cabal believe that if the Jedi and the Sith were still roaming around the Galaxy, there will always be these outcomes.
They had also believed whoever served on either side would be in their supervision for the Sith or Jedi.
Other ways to not make these wars happen were brought up, one of these being the destruction of the force-sensitive order.
The goal of this plan was to become victorious and put an end to the Sith and Jedi within the galaxy for good, starting at their core roots.
If it was successful, the reward of it would be peace, unity, and civilians no longer needing to beg inside sacred temples.

# History

The aftermath of these wars had been traced to the Great Hyperspace War where the Galactic Republic was victorious against the Sith Empire.
The Sith had fled after the war and what had remained was a ruined galaxy due to the numerous battles they had fought over time.
During this time, numerous spies, nobility, scientists, and crime lords had come together to look for an answer on why no force had managed to stop the Sith and Jedi during these times.

The creators as some would call them, had served in complete secrecy.
This group of people were responsible for making sure both sides within the force  could use it within their religious beliefs alongside hereditary gifts of the force.
Both Jedi and Sith were surprisingly content they had to accept it.

# The Conspiracy Stirs

Before the Cold War had taken place, Cabal had been taking on far less noble purposes.
Many people had started subverting the goals of the organizations.
One had tried to take advantage of the resources the Cabal had owned in an attempt to scavenge a profit from the Cabal.
Cabal had later stepped away from these goals as the wars began to break out.
It soon became a dedicated secret society that had obtained its own protection and would continue the organizationâ€™s prosperity.

The Cabal Star had a knack for restoring marvelous technology, most notably microdroids, genetic maps, scorpio, and an artificial intelligence droid.
