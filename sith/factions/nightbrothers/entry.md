# Introduction

The Nightbrothers, a tribe of Dathomirian male Zabrak that were loyal servants of the Nightsisters.
They lived in a village on the outskirts of Dathomir and spent most of their lives training.
All Nightbrothers were trained to fight with axes, daggers, spears, and their bare fists.
Their members were separated into smaller tribes that were overseen by Brother Viscus around 21 BBY.
They also adorned full body tattoos that were considered tradition as they were seen as the markings of a warrior.
Their facial markings were seen as the equivalent to the blemishes from bursting blood vessels that streaked the faces of the Nightsisters.

# Section One

Those who proved themselves worthy after fighting in the arena of the Crucible were granted the ability to wield weapons infused with powerful Nightsister magic.
They also received cuffs and shoulder armor.
In rare cases the Shaman of the Nightsisters would select a chosen one and grant him powerful energy.
A coven of crafters helped the shaman inject the energy of spirits into the chosen, turning him into a warrior behemoth.
When transformed, Zabrak were a head taller with a broad chest, strong arms, and a crown of horns.
Clan Mother Talzin said that they were powerful warriors, but lacked the ability to balance conflicting energies that came from the Twin Gods.
She also thought that males were simpler and more beastlike than females.

# Section Two

Decades before the Clone Wars, a small group of male Zabrak were brought over from Rattatak during a pirate raid.
The Nightsisters realized that they could interbreed with the Zabraks, which led to the creation of the Dathomirians.
The Nightsisters isolated the Zabraks to a small section of the planet where they could be summoned when needed.
The Shaman of the Nightsisters, Talzin, restricted the use of males once she became the leader of all Nightsister covens.
She later decided to keep the sisters and brothers separated.
The Sith Lord, Darth Maul, was formerly a Nightbrother before being taken by Darth Sidious to be his apprentice.
During the Clone Wars, the Nightsisters trained Savage Opress, Maul’s blood brother.
Opress was also next in line to replace Asajj Ventress as Count Dooku’s apprentice.
Ventress recognized the Nightbrothers as adequate fighters, but felt that they were not represented very well in isolation.
Her opinion was contrary to Mother Talzin’s view, that they could learn and achieve a lot under the direct tutelage of a Nightsister.
