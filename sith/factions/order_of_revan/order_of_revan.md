Revan was indeed one for the history books.
A powerful Jedi Knight who became one of the most powerful Sith Lords of all time, only to turn on the Sith once more and strike down his former apprentice and fellow Sith, Darth Malak.
After Malak’s death, Revan seemed to disappear from the galaxy, seemingly out of nowhere.
However, little did the people know, Revan was being held in captivity by the Sith Emperor, Vitiate, hidden away from the galaxy that he once protected and terrorised.

Vitiate’s Sith Empire attempted to eliminate all traces of Revan from their history.
They desired the name to be forgotten.
And it very well could have been, if not for a small, secretive group operating within the Sith Order and Empire itself.
The Revanites.

The Revanites were bound by one code and one philosophy; the teachings of Revan.
They resisted the attempts made by the Sith to censor any previous history of Revan, and began to follow his teachings.
The Revanites sought to balance both the light and dark sides of the Force, believing it to be the ultimate path to power.
They came to believe that the Sith Emperor Vitiate was no more, and that he had been slain by Revan himself, now apparently free of imprisonment.
They claimed that this information was being withheld by the Dark Council, who were supposedly fearful of the repercussions such a revelation could have on the Sith Empire.

The Order of Revan was founded by Tari Darkspanner, a Sith training in the academy on Korriban.
She happened to stumble across records of Revan that the Order had failed to remove.
After much reading, she came to learn that Revan and a party of supporters had previously confronted the Sith Emperor on Dromund Kaas.
History would tell you that Revan was unsuccessful, and he was imprisoned by the Emperor while his friends were all slain.
However, Darkspanner believed differently.
She came to believe that Revan had actually slain Vitiate and claimed the Empire for himself.

After these supposed revelations, she came to found the Order of Revan.
Unlike the Empire it was birthed from, the Order welcomed alien species as equals, and accepted individuals from across the Empire’s many service branches and organisations.
The Order grew to several hundred members strong, and began to publicly voice their beliefs across the Empire.
However, this caught negative attention from the Dark Council, who branded the Revanites as heretics and forced them into hiding.
From the jungles of Dromund Kaas, the Revanites conducted their operations in secret, with varying levels of devotion in its members.
Some forgot their Sith teachings entirely and devoted their entire lives to the Order.
Others were more closeted in their beliefs, going about their daily lives while secretly hailing Revan as their true master.
The Dark Council attempted to stamp out the organisation on frequent occasions, viewing their attempts to combine the teachings of both the Jedi and the Sith as heresy.

Tari Darkspanner may have been the founder of the Order.
However, Revan himself later emerged as their leader.
Revan had prieviously been split into two halves; his light and dark side, due to the torture he endured at the hands of Vitiate and his Dreadmasters.
His light side was cast out in the form of an apparition, with his dark side maintaining Revan’s physical form.
Under Revan’s leadership, the Revanites grew in strength exponentially.
Placing agents into all corners of both Empire and Republic, Sith and Jedi.
Some of these agents included Darth Arkous of the Dark Council, and Colonel Rian Darok of the Republic Special Forces branch.

The Revanites waged war on both the Republic and the Empire, enlisting the help of many groups such as the Nova Blades pirate gang.
Both the Empire and Republic also began to root out and detain sleeper agents embedded in both factions.
Theron Shan of the Republic was able to broadcast the identities of every sleeper agent and their location, which promptly led to their detainment.

After this defeat, Revan rallied his forces on Yavin IV for his ultimate objective.
Revan planned to destroy all life on the moon in order to wake the slumbering Emperor Vitiate.
Once awoken, Revan sought to destroy him once and for all.
Realising the sheer amount of death and destruction this act would cause, both the Republic and Empire formed a temporary truce to combat the Revanites.
Coalition forces would confront Revan and defeat him in battle.
Despite this victory, the Emperor awoke, fueled by the death brought on by the war between the Revanties and the Coalition forces.

After Revan’s defeat, the Order of Revan disbanded.
However, both the Republic and the Empire remained vigilant.
The Revanites could return at any moment, and it remained unknown if any of their supporters still lurked among them.
