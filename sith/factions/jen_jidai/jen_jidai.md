# History

Following the Hundred-Year Darkness in 6900, twelve Dark Jedi were exiled from the Jedi Order.
Between these twelve, we could find Dark Jedi like Ajunta Pall, Sorzus Syn, and Karness Muur.
The exiles were banished into the Unknown Regions of the galaxy, although they eventually managed to get into the Sith Space.
The Jen’jidai group arrived on the desert planet Korriban and noticed the legendary Kingdom of the Sith was still established on Korriban.
The exiles tried to subjugate the native Sith species along with their King, but as expected, they resisted.
In order to dominate Korriban’s Sith Empire, Ajunta Pall allied with the Sith King’s Shadow Hand.
After obtaining all the control over the native Sith species, Ajunta Pall executed the former Sith King, Hakagram Graush, and proclaimed himself as the Jen’ari, or Dark Lord of the Sith, of the Sith Empire.
