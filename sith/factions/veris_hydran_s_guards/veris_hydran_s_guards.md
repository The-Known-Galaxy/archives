# Overview
Minister Veris Hydran of the planet Lothal was handed a Death Trooper bodyguard squad, because of his relationship with Emperor Palpatine.
Veris was one of Palpatine’s closest advisors and when he was on Lothal he was his very own Death Trooper squad.
Just like other less important officials, Hydran’s bodyguard numbers were only a few, but nonetheless, they were skilled in combat.
Veris was a scholar in Jedi and Sith history, therefore he was given the task to advise Palpatine with any Force-related matters.
His guards were sent to protect him from any possible assassins due to his knowledge of the Force and his significance to the Empire.
It was an important job for the Death Troopers and they served him well.
