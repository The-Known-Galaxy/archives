# Overview
Sly Moore was a female Force sensitive Umbaran who owned her own personal Death Trooper guards.
She served as the Galactic Empire’s Administrator and had a fully skilled squad of Death Troopers.
There were only a few Death Troopers within her squad but each and every one of them were equipped for battle.
Sly Moore didn’t always have her Death Trooper bodyguards with her.
When she spoke to a Sith assassin on behalf of the Emperor on Mustafar she was given Imperial Dignity Guards.
These Death Troopers, like all others, had to go through difficult training camps to become the brilliant soldiers they were when they served under Sly Moore up until her death.
