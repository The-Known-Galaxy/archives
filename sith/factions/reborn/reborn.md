# Overview

The Reborn was a military faction that arose from a need to combat Luke Skywalker’s Jedi academy in order to secure the rise of the Empire Reborn.
This military organization consisted of a group of individuals who were granted an artificial connection to the force by the cosmic being known as Waru.
These individuals utilized their own force abilities and sabers.
However, despite being granted a perversion of the force they lacked any real individual power, only being able to manage the usage of techniques such as Force speed and push.
In order to counteract this warped power, they were trained to a high quality in saber techniques, specializing in fast and medium saber styles they were notably able to keep up with pure Jedi in open combat.

# History

The Reborn was formed by the Dark Jedi Desann after being donated a sizable amount of Imperial loyalist Youths who had been ‘purified’ by the Waru.
In the formational period for the Reborn, Desann utilized the Force Nexus in the Valley of the Jedi to substantially enhance the potential of his Reborn and from there formally commenced the Reborn’s military operations.
From this moment the Reborn embarked on numerous military operations alongside the Reborn Empire’s standard forces.
Notable expeditions include the Siege of Bespin and the Assault on Yavin 4 which resulted in significant defeats for the Reborn and in the latter siege the death of its founder.

Despite the catastrophic loss on Yavin 4 some of the Reborn survived, these survivors banded together under Tavion Axmis, Desann’s apprentice.
From here the Reborn went under an evolution alongside the Reborn Empire into the Disciples of Ragnos and the New Reborn.
These New Reborn acted alongside the Cultists of Ragnos as an elite fighting force for military excursions, however, this was for naught as both factions met their end by a Jedi siege on the planet of Korriban concluding in the Valley of the Dark Lords.

# Armanents

The equipment of the Reborn was basic in nature yet still effective.
For one, all members wore light hooded robes which complemented their swift style of fighting.
In terms of weaponry, all specializations had their own personal red sabers which were composed of a standard saber design.
The robes however were not fully standardized, different colors existed for the classifications of the Reborn for example:
Acrobats - these had a focus on utilizing force speed and enhanced movement to serve as scouts, they were denoted by blue hoods.
Force Adepts/Users - these had a stronger connection to the force and preferred the usage of Force pulls and pushes over saber combat, they were equipped with cream robes and red hoods.
Fencers - these were skilled in traditional saber arts and were expressed by their green robes and corresponding colored hoods.

The equipment of the New Reborn was strikingly different, for one the equipment was standardized more, with all ranks and specializations wearing battle suits instead of robes with the only clear distinguisher being blue or red paint signifying seniority.
The only breach in this came from the Reborn Masters who wore heavy armor and wielded complex saber designs akin to that of the founder.
