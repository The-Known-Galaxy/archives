# Overview

Established in 3640 BBY by Sith Lord Darth Malgus, the New Empire was created to remedy the flaws that Darth Malgus saw in the Reconstituted Sith Empire following the alleged death of the Sith Emperor.
Following its establishment, the New Empire captured parts of the Unknown region and grew extensively as it was joined by Darth Severin, rouge imperials, and the Schism Collective among others.
The Empire also secured the Sith Emperor’s fortress and deposited it above the planet Illum.
From this station, Darth Malgus declared himself Emperor and war on the Republic and Sith Empire.

# Fall of the New Empire

The declaration by Malgus shocked both the Republic and Sith Empire who now scrambled to face this new opponent.
When the New Empires forces invaded Illum, the Sith Empire and the Republic set aside their differences on Illum and worked together to defeat the New Empire.
Now facing both of the galaxy's major powers, the New Empire found itself struggling for survival.
During the Battle of Illum, Darth Severin, Malgus’s closest ally, was slain by allied forces at Fort Barrow, who subsequently captured his stealth fighter, marking the beginning of the end for the New Empire.
Allied forces then used the stealth fighter to land troops aboard the Emperor's fortress, who then slowly crushed the New Empires forces and made their way to Malgus’s throne room.
It was there in his throne room that Malgus realized his brief rebellion had come to an end.
He activated the station's self-destruct sequence and then fought his attackers in a losing battle.
When he was finally defeated and presumably killed, his New Empire fell along with him.

# New Empire military

Darth Malgus invited all people of the Sith Empire to join his New Empire in its goal to purify the galaxy and, differing drastically from the Sith Empire, the New Empire also accepted alien species into its ranks and forged powerful alliances with alien groups such as the Schism Collective.
Its army was made up of rogue elements of the sith empire and many others, including Trandoshians, Mandalorians, and droids, making it a formidable force.

The New Empires Navy, while much smaller than its Republic and Sith Empire counterparts, was extremely powerful and made up of the Crystal fleet that the Sith Empire had been using to seize crystals on Illum.
With the help of their alien allies, the final construction of the fleet was completed and proved to be invaluable during the Battle of Illum.
