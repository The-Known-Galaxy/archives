The Blackguard were a group of force-sensitives led by San’sii the Kusk and Vansk, like the Sith and Jedi they made use of lightsabers and specialized lightsabers, such as the saberstaff and crossguard lightsaber.
The Blackguard were located on the planet of Mustafar, founded by Vulta Danaat, a former member of the Brotherhood of Darkness and apprentice to the Sith Lord Skere Kaan.
The Blackguard's base was located in the Southern Jedi Ruins near the Smoking Forest; they often engaged in skirmishes against the Phantom Bandits.

The Blackguard believed that knowledge was the key to power; they believed that to understand the Force you would have to understand the philosophies and abilities of other Force traditions and societies.
They didn’t believe in the dark or light side; instead, they believed that light and dark dwelled within the user.
They wished to bring a balance to the dark side and light side within themselves, thus bringing balance to the Force itself.

The Blackguard were taught in Force abilities via the teachings of Vulta Danaat, Vulta was trained by Skere Kaan, thus most of the abilities were passed down from Skere Kaan.
The Blackguard possessed a Sith holocron, because of this it is believed that they knew how to construct holocrons themselves.

The Blackguard’s headquarters would eventually be destroyed by bounty hunters due to the archaeologist Mi Fon Lu wanting to research the Jedi ruins; it became known as the Blackguard purge.
However, due to many Blackguards scattered around the universe, they later returned by taking back the ruins and seeking revenge on the archaeologist.

The Blackguard has a small and simple array of ranks that were similar to that of the Jedi and Sith, holding ranks that reflected the ideas of Apprentices, Knights and Masters or Lords.
They did have three specialized ranks- The marauder whose purpose was to explore the galaxy to seek and study various Force traditions; the trinity assassin who served to eliminate enemies and protect relics; the ravager whose purpose it was to defend the headquarters of the Blackguard.
