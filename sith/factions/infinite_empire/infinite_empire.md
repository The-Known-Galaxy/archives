# The Start of The Infinite Empire
The Infinite Empire is considered the first “galactic power”, that means, an Empire so threatening, it has possibilities of taking on the entire galaxy, and they almost did.
It was created by the Rakata, a species so advanced, their knowledge surpassed even the highest genetically modified humanoid.
They used this level of advanced knowledge and technology to not only conquer, but enslave everyone they conquered.
The Rakata had gained this level of knowledge and technology by a species named, the Kwa, a force sensitive species.
The Kwa had a piece of technology called the “Infinity Gate”, they used this Gate to instantly travel to the Rakata homeworld of Lehon.
The Kwa gave them knowledge of the Force, and even gave them highly advanced technology.
However, the Kwa soon realized that a lot of the Rakata species was ignoring the Kwa’s interpretation of the Force, and instead, diving into the Dark Side of the Force.
This gave them the jump start that they needed to begin conquering worlds other than their own, but not any normal planet, rather planets that were attuned with the Force.
The Infinite Empire was now created, and they would go on to conquer and enslave.
Before doing that, they decided they wanted the Kwa’s Infinity Gate’s technology.
This desire led to the battle known as the Resultant Battle on Lehon.
The Infinite Empire successfully destroyed the Infinity Gate, and many Kwa were killed and many survivors were enslaved.
The Infinite Empire would now go on and become a major threat to the galaxy, and conquer many worlds.

# The Great Fall of The Infinite Empire
By 30,000 BBY, the Infinite Empire controlled over 500 force attuned planets, struck fear into trillions of people, and even more, enslaved millions.
That was the Infinite Empire at their peak times, even after dealing with an uprising on Coruscant, an Esh-kha uprising, even after being driven off Korriban, they were still the most powerful Empire in the galaxy in their time.
However, not everything this good will last forever.
A major factor of their downfall was their technology.
Every piece of technology in the Infinite Empire was Force based.
This led to many different issues that would begin the actions to cause them to fall.
The Star Forge, a space station built by the Rakatas, “feeds” off the creators feelings, with many things going wrong, the creator becomes more and more angry.
Causing the Star Forge to begin corrupting many species.
This led to slave uprisings left and right, civil wars, and much more.
Then, when all things have gone wrong, the Rakata get hit by an extremely deadly plague.
This plague would finalize the downfall of the Infinite Empire, causing the Rakata species to return to using low grade technology, and returning to their homeworld they left long ago, left with little to nothing.
On the Lehon, many factions were created and more civil wars happened to determine who would rule Lehon, and the Rakata species.
