# Overview
The Sith Triumvirate was founded in 3954 BBY by Darth Traya, Darth Nihilus, and Darth Sion.
It was a loose alliance that was made after the fall of Darth Revan’s Empire.
The Sith Triumvirate was a powerful force to be reckoned with even against the Jedi Order.
One particular Jedi Council member: Master Atris rallied a force of Jedi to go to Katarr.
However, Master Atris had leaked their location to be able to find out about the Sith Triumvirate.

Darth Traya, the Lord of Betrayal, was the leader of the Sith Triumvirate.
Her apprentices Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion were the joint leaders of the Sith Triumvirate.
Darth Traya, originally named Kreia, was a Jedi Master before turning to the Dark Side.
Kreia wanted to gain full knowledge of the Force, but her unconventional approaches caused the Jedi Council to exile her from the Jedi Order.

Darth Nihilus, the Lord of Hunger, was the apprentice of Darth Traya.
There is not a lot known about Darth Nihilus, but it is suspected he was once a Jedi in the Mandalorian Wars.
During his time as Darth Traya’s apprentice, Darth Nihilus learnt how to drain the Force.
Through his continuous training, he eventually became a shell of his former self.
Darth Nihilus' only purpose was to destroy all life to satisfy his hunger.

Darth Sion, the Lord of Pain, was also the apprentice of Darth Traya.
Sion trained along with Nihilus together at Malachor V.
Darth Sion’s body had been destroyed so many times that his own body was just fragments of his original self.
His body was cracked and only held together by his sheer will-power and his Force.
Traya and Sion eventually hated each other because of Sion’s lack of caring and understanding about Traya’s strength.



# Fall of the Triumvirate
Most of Revan’s and Malak’s forces had joined the Sith Triumvirate, and Darth Traya had multiple visions and echoes in the Force to corrupt Jedi to join the Dark Side.
Nihilus and Sion got impatient and decided to conspire against their master because they believed together they could overwhelm her, and this would lead to her death.
Nihilus and Sion used “Sever Force” to cut Darth Traya off from the Force and was exiled from the Sith Triumvirate.
Meetra Surik formed the Lost Jedi but was confronted by surviving Jedi Council members who tried to cut Surik from the Force as well.
Darth Traya stopped them and saved Surik.
Surik would eventually regain her strength and kill Darth Nihilus on his ship, and Darth Traya along with Darth Sion were killed on Malachor V.
