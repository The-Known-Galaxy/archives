# Overview

The Cosmic Balance was a heavily followed religion on the planet of Bakura.
This religion was based on the idea that every motive placed in the universe would affect something else in the universe, almost mirroring a butterfly effect.
For example, if someone that day was having extremely good luck, someone else was having poor luck as well.
If one person ate an apple, another apple would rot.
This religion was started by a person with the name of Dif Istuvi, who wrote the sacred text of the religion, Fulcrum.
The symbol that represents Cosmic Balance is a black and white ring.
Anyone who practiced the religion to any extent was expected to wear this symbol somewhere on their body, usually in a pendant.
The followers of this religion did not like the Jedi.
This was due to the fact that they believed whenever a Jedi used the Force, it broke balance in the universe.
This led to followers of the religion blaming next to everything on the Jedi, including the fall of the Old Republic.

This hatred led to followers of the religion celebrating the great Jedi Purge.
Families who considered themselves followers of the religion were forced to put pairs of their children in a set of tests.
Those who passed with the highest scores received feathers, while those who received lower scores were given a small golden bowl and forced into a home that assisted the priests of the religion.
The child with the feather was also given extra funds by the priests to aid in their education.
