# Section 1

The Alliance to Restore the Republic or mostly known as the Rebel Alliance was a resistance movement tasked with defeating the Galactic Empire and restoring the Republic.
The Alliance would be formed by Mon Mothma during the early days of the Empire, but really the Alliance movement would start during the end of the Clone Wars.

# Section 2

During a mission to free Onderon from the Confederacy grips; Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Padawan Ahsoka Tano, Jedi Master Obi-wan Kenobi and  Clone Captain Rexs would train up a small resistance group to free Onderon from the Confederacy.
The Onderon resistance group would be successful in freeing the Onderon, with this the first Rebel Cell was formed.
Close to the end of the war another resistance would grow but within the Senate.
When Supreme Chancellor Palpatine obtained a huge amount of emergency power, senators like Padme Amidala, Bail Organa and Mon Mothma would start to oppose the Chancellor and wanted him to get rid of his huge amount of power quickly.
This attempt to dispose of the Chancellor’s power would fail and in the end Palpatine would call himself the Emperor and convert the Republic into the Galactic Empire.

# Section 3

With the Rise of the Galactic Empire numerous Rebels cells would form across the galaxy.
At first they would operate independently but a secret communication between Rebel Cells would be formed.
The Rebels Cells would start being more organized in attacks, making them more successful.
With the Rebels proving that the Empire wasn’t invincible, more people across the galaxy started taking up arms.
With the sudden resignation of Mon Mothma the plan to form the Rebel Cells into one faction was initiated.
Mon Mothma would be transported to Dantooine where she would make a speech to the galaxy, telling them to join the Rebel movement.
This would infuriate the Empire and make them set their full attention to this new opposition to their rule.
The Rebels Cell Phoenix Squadron and the Massassi group would make a temporary base on the planet of Atollon.
The Empire discovers the base and a fleet led by Grand Admiral Thrawn was sent to blockade it.
The Empire nearly decimated the Rebels there but thanks to the help of a Mysterious Force Wielding Being and Clan Wrennthe Rebel broke the blockade and escaped.

# Section 4

The Rebels would make their primary base on the moon known as Yavin-4 where they would reside inside the old temples made by the Naga-Sadow and his followers.
The Rebels would be forced to move off Yavin-4 after the Death Star plans were brought to Yavin 4 with the Death Star in tow.
The Rebels would quickly assemble a small team of Bombers and Starfighters to destroy the Death Star.
They would successfully destroy the Death Star in the final second it was going to end the Rebellion.
Even though the Death Star was destroyed, Mon Mothma ordered the Rebels to split up while keeping in contact knowing that the Empire would retalitate.

# Section 5

With the Rebels more split-up the Empire started delivering massive blows.
One after another the Rebels saw no victory, but a new plan was enacted.
The Rebels had caught wind of the second Death Star creation over the moon of Endor.
Things got even better when news reached the Rebels ears that the Emperor himself was going to oversee the finishing touches.
Mon Mothma ordered the Rebels to set all sights on destroying the second Death Star.
Through determined preparation the Rebels laid siege to the second Death Star.
Little did they know until the last minute that the Emperor had let the Rebels know the second Death Star location to end them once and for all.
The Rebels would be surprised to learnthat the Death Star was operational but through the leadership of Admiral Ackbar they would be able to surpass that challenge.
The Emperor severely underestimated the Rebels and as the shields went down a team of small Star-Fighters broke the Imperial Star-Destroyers blockade and flew all haste to the Death Star.
The Imperials tried to stop them but it was too late and seconds later the second Death-Star was no more.
The Emperor and Darth Vader were killed as well leaving no successor to the Empire.

# Section 6

Celebrations and riots ripped across the galaxy as the Empire lost control and the Rebel Alliance was reformed into the New Republic.
1 year after the destruction of the second Death Star the Empire and the Republic would do their final showdown on the desert world of Jakku.
The Republic saw victory and the Empire would be no-more.
