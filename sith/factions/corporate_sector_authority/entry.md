During the reign of the Galactic Empire, or the Imperial Period, the Corporate-Sector Authority was relatively untouched by Imperial forces and were permitted to continue with their duties as they had done during the Clone Wars.
This was primarily due to the Empire’s policies and tolerances for corporate competition and companies as long as they did not impeach the Galactic Empire’s rule.
It was through this that the CSA and the Galactic Empire maintained formal diplomatic relations.

However, during 40 ABY the CSA allied itself with a rebellion consisting of a few planets such as Corellia and Fondor during the Second Galactic Civil War.
Having breached legalities, the Empire did not take lightly to this, and attempted to destroy the CSA.
During 44 ABY.
The CSA had been dissolved due to a suffrage of a slave riot after these events rendering their workforce near nil, causing the CSA to go bankrupt as a result.
