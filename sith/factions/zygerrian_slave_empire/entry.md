# Description

The Zygerrian Slave Empire was an organization built from Zygerrian species.
Its headquarters was located on Zygerria in the Outer Rim.
The Slave empire enslaved many creatures in the galaxy, causing pain and suffering.
A large enemy of the Zygerrian Slave Empire was the Jedi Order.
But as many say, the enemy of your enemy is your friend; a major ally of the Slave Empire was Count Dooku, also known as Darth Tyranus, and his Separatist Movement.

# History

For many years, the Zygerrian Slave Empire managed to hold up their slave industry, supplying wealthy citizens of the galaxy with slaves.
With the profit coming from the slave industry, Zygerrians managed to build their headquarters and fortified cities on their home planet, Zygerria.
Later on, the Old Republic declared slave trafficking as an illegal act, decreasing the amount of earned money, which pushed the business into the criminal underworld.
With time, in the era of the High Republic, the Republic has attacked Zygerria’s slave camps, liberating the lives of creatures, including Lourna Dee.
After the Republic launched that attack, the Empire built by Zygerrians was destroyed.

After the destruction of the Zygerrian Slave Empire, during the Clone Wars era, Queen Miraj Scintel of Zygerria wanted to rebuild the ancient slave-trafficking authority.
She saw an opportunity of alliance with Count Dooku’s Separatist movement.
Alongside the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the forces of Zygerria deployed upon a colony of the Togruta species on the planet Kiros.
The Galactic Republic struck the Zygerrian forces and Dooku’s army with a battle.
Eventually, the operation was won by the slave-traffickers, enslaving a large part of the population of Togruta.
After the capturing, Zygerrians returned to their planet, capturing Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano and Obi-Wan Kenobi too.
Anakin was almost executed, same as the rest of the team, but before he managed to convince the Queen of Zygerria to end what she started, informing her that she was just an irrelevant pawn to the Separatists and Darth Tyranus.
This was all in vain as she died in Anakin’s hands, killed by Dooku, and was overthrown by Atai Molec.
Atai became the new ruler of Zygerria.

After the overthrow, the Galactic Republic deployed into Zygerria, using their newest technology and reinforcements.
The Galactic Republic managed to free Skywalker and his friends, liberating Togrutas by destroying the slaving facility.
Due to the rescue mission, the Republic gained an alliance and massive respect from the Togruta.

During the age of the Galactic Empire, a Zygerrian named Raney started to command a remnant of the Slave Empire.
The reborn Slave Empire had better conditions to thrive in, as the Galactic Republic after Order 66 has turned into the Galactic Empire.
He began rebuilding the Empire started by his ancestors, taking more prisoners, including a rancor named Muchi.
Muchi later on was demanded by Jabba the Hutt to be liberated.
To rescue the rancor, Jabba hired a squad of well-trained clones, the Bad Batch, also known as Clone Force 99.
The Bad Batch with the help of the rancor, who was freed, managed to liberate other slaves.
After the fall of the Raney’s Slave Empire, a Zygerrian named MaDall started her own one.
She was stopped by Sabine Wren.
