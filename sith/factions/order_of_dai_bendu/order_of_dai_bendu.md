# Introduction
The Order of Dai Bendu, otherwise known as the Bendu, was an ancient sect of Force users that existed in the Early Hyperspace age, roughly before 37,453 BBY.
This group of curious and enlightened monks was among the first to study and uncover the philosophies, principles, and abilities surrounding the Force as well as midi-chlorians.
It was very much speculated that the Order of Dai Bendu played a large role in the foundation of the Je’daii Order, the beginning organization of the Jedi.
Some even say that the Dai Bendu directly established the Je’daii Order themselves, but there has never been any solid evidence to prove such.

# Organization/Philosophy
The Dai Bendu monks lived in isolation on Ando Prime, away from all the larger cities and other communities.
Each monk praised and dedicated their learning to the most sharp-witted of their group, the “High Priest.” They had constructed tents in the mountains of the snowy planet and gathered their pure water from the mountains through pipelines which the monks had considered a vital aspect of their tradition.
Many of the monks kept their principles prevalent by building an abundance of temples and other structures in the name of their tradition on the other worlds they migrated to in the Tython system.

Dai Bendu's attire consisted of a basic long robe with the addition of a pointed hood and orange/red robes for the High Priest in the later years.
Numerology was also a big part of their initial beliefs before the discovery of the Force.
The Dai Bendu adopted the belief that the number nine expressed the Force’s beneficial presence in a galaxy unified by many aspects.
Because of their ideologies surrounding numerology, they developed a sigil to represent their Order, the radius being nearly identical to the ones carved onto the Tho Yorr.



# Early History
This ancient order originated from a planetary object found in the Mid Rim region of the galaxy known as Thape in the era of the Early Hyperspace age, an era that saw the beginning of technology for space travel purposes across the galaxy.
Monks from this age first studied numerology but became further enlightened upon the discovery of midi-chlorians, microorganisms that reside in the cell of all living beings, allowing the Force to establish a connection with each one.
This allowed for leeway for much more convenient studies of the Force, which is the reason for their journey across the galaxy.
Following their instincts, the Dai Bendu was led to the planet known as Ando Prime, a world located within the Mid Rim territories housing a Force nexus.
As a result of their migration to this snowy world, the newer arrivals to the Order of Dai Bendu consisted of monks of Talid descent, the primordial sentient species to the snowy world of Ando Prime.



# First Migration
Sometime during 37,453 BBY, the Order of Dai Bendu recovered a mysterious pyramid-like structure buried in the snow.
Feeling a great power within, the monks dug up the strange construction.
Providing the ancient structure with the name of ‘Tho Yorr” in the Dai Bendu language, the monks would congregate before this pyramid to meditate even in the harshest of cold.
Claiming that one day with enough patience through meditation, they would hear the voice of the Tho Yorr.
It was precisely a thousand years for the Dai Bendu to finally witness the prophecy they had formulated come true when the Tho Yorr released a call to a group of monks, opening the object simultaneously.
Naturally out of curiosity to uncover what their great years of patience brought to them, the monks entered the mysterious object to discover that it was indeed a starship.



The Tho Yorr transferred this group of monks to another world, a world in the Deep Core of the galaxy that has seen many impactful events throughout its time: Tython.
Upon arriving on Tython, the group of monks was surprised to see that seven other Tho Yorr were present to repeat the same process of transferring sentient beings to Tython that happened to hear their voice.
As a result, the monks along with a few other select species became known as the first sentient organisms to inhabit the world of Tython, otherwise known as Tythans.
With the assistance and unification of other force-sensitive species, the Dai Bendu contributed to the foundation of the Je’daii Order, a sect of force-sensitive individuals seeking to maintain peace throughout the galaxy by adopting principles of balance.
One of the monks of the Dai Bendu known by Lha-Mi, a Talid monk, went on to become one of many Je’daii Temple Masters.
The term “Je’daii” would be derived from two Dai Bendu words: “Je” being mystic and “dai” being center.
With all of the desires for balance, it did not come easy as the planet eventually grew to pose too much of a threat to non-force sensitive beings, a root cause for the second migration.



# Second Migration
Sometime after the year 35,453 BBY, the city of Aurum built by the Tythans was destroyed by a Force Storm, a type of Force occurrence on Tython in particular.
This event led to the death of many non-force-sensitive Tythans and was the reason behind their migration to other worlds in the Tython system.
The non-force-sensitive Tythans traveled in search of a newer, much safer place to settle.
Their expeditions produced wonderful results as they were able to find Kalimahr, a green surfaced planet, the very first new settlement as a reward for their search.
Due to their travels, planets such as Kalimahr would be a center for religious practices and philosophy.
Some of the Dai Bendu monks that chose to travel with the Tythans built additional temples and monuments on Kalimahr, further establishing their beliefs and reputation.
One of their structures was built within the eastern quarter of the Khar Peninsula but was later abandoned and became a place for the Stargazer cult to seek shelter in.
Many inhabitants and residents of Kalimahr were enlightened by the knowledge that the Dai Bendu possessed, sometimes even stopping by to listen to the monk’s chants by the spaceport.



# A New Order Arises
It took thousands upon thousands of years before the Je’daii Order and the Order of Dai Bendu’s principles had been forgotten, leading to the foundation of a newer group known as the Jedi Order.
The Jedi Order formed after the Force Wars that transpired in 25,793.
These conflicts between the Dark (Bogan) and Ashla (Light) resulted in the Dark follower's defeat.
Principles of the Je’daii Order demanded that there be balance, otherwise known as “Bendu.” Due to the conflicts that presented themselves during the Force Wars, the philosophy behind Bendu was abandoned and the followers of Ashla later succeeded the Order of Dai Bendu as well as the Je’daii Order to become the Jedi Order.
