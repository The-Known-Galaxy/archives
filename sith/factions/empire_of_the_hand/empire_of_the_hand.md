# Empire of the Hand
The Empire of the Hand was an autocratic confederation located in the Unknown Regions; the Empire was founded between 19 and 10 BBY by Mitth’raw’nuruodo (Thrawn) to defend the galaxy and especially the Chiss, from threats within the Unknown Regions.
The first de facto leader was Thrawn, the capital was Nirauan, and it was affiliated to the Galactic Empire, later the Imperial Remnants.

The Empire of the Hand combined the Imperial and Chiss ideologies due to Thrawn's beliefs; most of it was formed from members of the Galactic Empire, Chiss Ascendancy and United Tribes of Kariek, thus allowing different species.
After the defeat of the Galactic Empire, the Empire of the Hand became one of the more influential powers within the galaxy.

The Empire of the Hand formed with the interest of both the Chiss and Empire in mind; Palpatine agreed with Thrawn on the rising threats in the Unknown Regions and sent him on a fake exile to the Unknown Regions whilst in reality giving him plenty of ships and manpower.
Because of this and the reestablishing of connections with the Chiss, many Chiss and loyal Imperial officers united under his banner, thus the Empire of the hand was formed.

The Chiss Ascendancy would, however, hold a sceptical look on the newly formed Empire, some Chiss families would unofficially support Thrawn’s objective.
During the formation and early years of the Empire Thrawn created The Hand of Thrawn, a complex and fortress that held a vast amount of information.
The Hand of Thrawn would become his base of operations, further in the early years were mostly the Empire fighting off hostile groups such as the Ebruchi pirates.

After the defeat of the Galactic Empire and the Empire of the Hand increasing in size, they engaged in skirmishes against the Ssi-ruuvi in 4 BBY along with the Chiss Expansionary Defence force, weakening them enough to be easily destroyed by the Alliance.
Shortly after it they would return to the known galaxy and launch a massive campaign against the newly formed Republic.


The campaign was going brilliantly and well, yet it would end in the betrayal of Thawn with him killed in 9 ABY and the Empire of the Hand losing the Battle of Bilbringi.
Thrawn had entrusted his leadership in the hands of Admiral Voss Parck after his death; Thrawn had told them the idea that it was another of his plans and that he would return later.
The Empire of the Hand was discovered by Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade when searching for clues on the appearance of clones and prototype starfighters.

Luke and Mara would inform Thrawn’s power base of his death; they refused to join the newly found Empire but promised not to reveal the Empire's location.
They had found an almost mature clone of Thrawn within the Hand of Thrawn fortress, which they destroyed in order to escape from security droids attacking them.
The Hand of Thrawn would later be destroyed due to Cavrilhu pirates tracking Luke and Mara; it would later be repaired in 22 ABY.


The Empire would keep on defending its Empire and dispatch Warlords along with other factions who attempted to invade.
In 22 ABY the Empire of the Hand would assist the Chiss Ascendancy and Jedi in the Third Vagaari War, the Vagaari were defeated by the Chiss and Empire.
Many of the surviving colonists would join the Empire of the Hand after losing their old belongings and colonies in the Vagaari Wars.

After these events, the Empire of the Hand was believed to be gone after engaging in the Yuuzhan Vong War, however many years later they would return to defeat Natasi Daala who wished to become Empress of the Imperial Remnants, Fel rallied and requested the support of the Empire of the Hand who would send Chiss Star Destroyers to support the Remnants.
Further, they would remain a shadow empire within the Unknown regions to fight off the threats against the galaxy.

# Technology
An interesting part of the Empire of the Hand was their technology, it was a mix of Imperial and Chiss technology in order to create powerful, efficient ships and weaponry, such as the Nssis-Class Clawcraft and Chiss-Imperial combined scout vessels.

All other weapons used by The Empire of the Hand was technology from the Galactic Empire or Chiss Ascendancy technology, usually depending on the background of the legion or unit that were using them.
These were often upgraded or changed slightly due to the collaboration of Imperial and Chiss engineers.
