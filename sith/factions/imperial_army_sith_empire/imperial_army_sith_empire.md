# Overview
The Sith Imperial Army was a military group founded in 4980 BBY by the True Sith.
This army participated in important events such as the Cold War, the Galactic War, and the Great Galactic War.

# Information
Like any other military group, the Sith Imperial Army possessed a rank structure.
At the bottom of it, we could find the Private rank, a position given to people who recently joined the army.
Following this rank, we find the Specialist position, a rank given to senior soldiers.
After these two initial ranks, we enter the command list.

People who held the rank of a Corporal within the army acted as second-in-command of a nine-man squad.
Sergeants are the next rank following the list.
They were able to command a squad and act as assistants to officers.
An Ensign in the army was the lowest officer rank and held the position of a midshipman.
The next rank following was the Lieutenant one, and only those who proved themselves as senior officers could earn it.
The rank of Captain could lead battalions and command platoons.
People who held the rank of Major could act as battalion commanders.
Colonels could lead a regiment of almost 4000 soldiers and were a rank positioned before the General one.
Generals were the highest rank in the army and were the commanders of the military.
Soldiers within the Imperial Army of the Sith possessed different classes; the Imperial Heavy Troopers and the Imperial Troopers.
While Imperial Heavy Troopers wore weighty armor of around one hundred pounds, the Imperial Troopers used normal ones.
