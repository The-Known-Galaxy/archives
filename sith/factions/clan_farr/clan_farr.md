# Overview
Clan Farr was a relatively unremarkable Clan that rose to prominence during the Mandalorian Wars.
After the Mandalorian Wars, Clan Farr would be scattered across the galaxy until the rise of the Reconstituted Sith Empire.
During this period, Clan Farr would relocate to the Imperial capital world of Dromund Kaas where they would use the jungles and wildlife to train their newest members.
Clan Farr would ally themselves with the Order of Revan on Dromund Kaas and participate in the war against the Galactic Republic on the side of the Sith Empire.


Some of Clan Farr’s members would serve Revan during his brief reappearance and attempt to kill the Sith Emperor, Darth Vitiate.
Though the majority of the Clan would remain loyal to their Mand’alor, later following Mand’alor the Avenger during her war against the Eternal Empire.
