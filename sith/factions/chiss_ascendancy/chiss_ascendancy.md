# Overview
The Chiss Ascendancy was a faction that operated within the unknown regions, and its main inhabitants consisted of a near-human species with blue skin and red eyes called the Chiss.
It was a deeply isolationist faction, and had strict guidelines relating to preemptive strikes on other factions.
It hardly ever showed itself to other factions, so much so that hardly anyone even knew of their existence.

# Section 1
The actual history of the Chiss Ascendancy dates as far back as the Sith Wars between the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire.
The first Chiss “Ruling Family” were known as the Stybla family.
There were numerous Chiss families who actually came to hold the title of Ruling Family, however they were a small bunch compared to the actual size of the faction.
In their early years, they expanded rapidly throughout the unknown regions, so much so that they became a sort of legend to other species living there.



# Section 2
The politics of the Chiss Ascendancy revolved around the Nine Ruling Families, and consisted of several sovereignties that were connected under one government.
These sovereignties were each governed by a noble house, and these noble houses made up the aristocra, which was the primary governing body of the Chiss Ascendancy.
They had the power to pass legislation, and were the representatives of the Chiss people.
The Chiss Syndicure, which was constituted by the Nine Ruling Families, and essentially was the collective Head of State, gathered periodically in the capital, which was known as Csaplar.
