# Introduction
The  Galactic Empire is a an authoritarian regime led by Emperor Palpatine, also known as Darth Sidious.
The Empire controlled most of the galaxy and was known for its military might, using massive machinery projects such as the infamous Star Destroyers and the Death Star as symbols of its power.
The Empire’s oppressive sovereign led to the formation of the Rebel Alliance, which sought to overthrow the Empire and restore freedom to the galaxy.
The Galactic Empire was relatively recent on a galactic scale and largely undocumented.
As the fortunes of individuals and groups have changed in the Empire, and Emperors have risen and fallen, historical documents have been altered, misplaced, or outright destroyed.
Much of what remains is lacking and has been pieced together with what remnants.
It was poorly sourced and often blatantly propagandistic remaining from those years.

# Section 1
The Empire put up little resistance until numerous rebel cells banded together to start the Galactic Civil War, with the growing rebellion achieving its first major victory against the empire in Mustafar in 4 BBY.
These rebel cells formed the Alliance to restore the Republic in 2 BBY, and the Rebel Alliance itself achieved its first major victory by stealing the plans for the Death Star on Scarif, which in turn led to the destruction of the Death Star at the Battle—Yavin in 0 BBY.
The Alliance achieved early successes in the following years until the Empire's major victory on Hoth in 3 ABY.
Still, a year later the Empire suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Endor.
During the battle, Emperor Palpatine was killed by his Sith apprentice Darth Vader, who died shortly after turning against his Sith mentor.
