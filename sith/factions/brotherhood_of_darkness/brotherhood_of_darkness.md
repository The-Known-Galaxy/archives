# Overview
The Brotherhood of Darkness, or also known as Sith Army, Sith Brotherhood and Sith Empire, was an army created by Dark Lord Skere Kaan during the dark age of the old republic.

# The creation & organisation of the Sith Army
The Sith Army was created by the Dark Lord Skere Kaan.
This empire was created because its creator saw a fundamental flaw in the Sith teachings, because they focused on individual power, which created an endless cycle of betrayals.
In order to stop this failure, he made the Brotherhood of Darkness.
The high ranks of this Army had the same rank, which was Dark Lord due to equity reasons.
As well, they held specialised Sith Academies for all the Force-Sensitives from their worlds, for non-force users, they were sent to the military to be used as soldiers.



# The Brotherhood of Darkness against the Army of Light
This war was taking place in Ruusan, it started in 1010 BBY and ended in 1000 BBY.
The first and second battles of Ruusan were won by the Sith Army, but in the third battle of Ruusan everything changed for the Brotherhood of Darkness, since they were devastated by the Light army.
After the third battle, Skere Kaan brought all his Sith Forces and academy students to Ruusan.
The Light Side also won the fourth, fifth and sixth battles of Ruusan.
In the seventh battle of Ruusan, Darth Bane convinced Kaan to use the ancient technique called “Thought bomb” to finish the war, telling him that his brotherhood was going to survive.
After executing the Thought Bomb, he eradicated almost everyone in the Sith and Jedi side.
Those Sith that survived this mortal technique, were defeated later by the remaining Jedis.
