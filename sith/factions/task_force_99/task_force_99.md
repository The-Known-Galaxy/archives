# Overview
Task Force 99, otherwise known as SCAR Squadron, was an elite squadron of stormtroopers in the Galactic Empire’s 501st Legion, the legion under the control of Darth Vader, and was commanded by Sergeant Kreel.
Inspired by the Clone Commando Special Forces unit known as Clone Force 99, the squad’s members were six stormtroopers who each excelled in a particular field of operations - Aero, who was the squad’s engineer and vehicles expert, Cav, who specialised in close quarter and melee combat, Mic, who broke into and decrypted the necessary computers and technologies, Shrap, the squad’s heavy weapons expert, Zuke, the squad’s muscle, and Misty, the squad’s sniper.
The squad’s leader was handpicked by Darth Vader himself and was an officer with the rank of sergeant.
Task Force 99 would either receive its missions from admirals or from Darth Vader, acting unique from other stormtrooper squads.
Each squad member’s armour and weapons were unique and customised to fit their needs.
They were tasked to track, capture, or kill targets through any means necessary, including torturing for information.
