# Overview
The Hapes Consortium was an organization also referred to as the consortium.
It was a matriarchal monarchy - the woman’s role and power in this society and as a monarch to lead the organization.
Members of the organization were near-Human Hapans situated with the consortium in the Hapes Cluster, a closely packed star cluster in the inner rim of the galaxy.
Besides politically being a matriarchal monarchy, the organization was a consortium due to its social structure.
Multiple smaller organizations and civilizations were working to constitute the Hapes Consortium to achieve a common objective.
The Consortium consisted of sixty-three different planets.

The organization’s archaeological structures were on the Hapans' homeworld, Hapes.
The organization was known to have conquered a hundred and thirty more star systems with at least one habited planet each.
The star systems existed before three thousand BBY after the Lorell Raiders got eradicated by the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order.


The Hapes Consortium was one of few insular civilizations in the galaxy that preferred to stay isolated from other cultures and societies to invest in their own.
After this long period of isolation, a few select Hapans tried to break free from the authorities in Hapes but were ultimately defeated.


The Hapans encountered the Galactic Empire once and claimed that the pacifists and diplomats in their society were degrading the organization.
With no assistance, they got to their burdens.
The organization was known to be an individualistic companion of the empire.
Despite this, they found themselves in a border skirmish in the Adnaila system amid the Galactic Civil War.
They left their isolative past and contacted the New Republic and the Singing Mountain of Dathomir to open up to the rest of the galaxy.

# The Queen Mother
The Hapes Consortium, ruled by the Queen Mother who held court at the Fountain Palace on the homeworld of Hapes or aboard the Royal Transport ship called Star Home when she was traveling.
The Queen Mother’s title was hereditary - only her daughter after her had the authority to take her place as the Queen Mother.
If the current Queen Mother failed to have a daughter of her own, the partner of her firstborn son should accumulate the title.
Occasionally, relatives of the Queen Mother competed to execute the downfall of the Queen Mother out of pure jealousy to get the title.
Individuals who were threatening the queen for this reason were convicted of treason and executed right away.

During court, multiple representatives from the respective planets in the Hapes Consortium voted on political matters and updated the status regarding the economy and social structures in their homeworlds.
Usually, it was matters that the queen was concerned or bothered by.
The Queen Mother had the final verdict on every topic and decided the outcome of the vote.



# History
After the Lorell Raiders were eradicated and wiped out by the Jedi Order 4030 BBY, the remaining survivors of the series of incidents, the majority females, came together to institute a new government and political form where one woman ruled the civilization and was the Queen Mother.
This chosen woman united all planets with respective civilizations in the Hapes cluster under the newly found organization - the Hapes Consortium.
This Queen Mother instituted the rudimentary foundation of the organization with this decision.
She began the archaeological construction of Star Home.
After this crucial project, the Queen Mother decided to close the borders of the Hapes Consortium to any outsiders and conquer more worlds in the cluster to colonize and rule over.
This society was isolated for three thousand years until it opened its borders again to outsiders 8 ABY.
Alliance agreed upon between the Queen Mother of the time, Ta’a Chume, and the other representatives of the New Republic.

During 27 ABY, the current Queen Mother was a woman called Tenel Ka Chume Ta’ Djo.
36 ABY Queen Mother’s daughter Allana was born.
The Corellian leadership during the Second Galactic Civil War wanted the Hapes Consortium to fight on their side by attempting to assassinate the Queen Mother and her daughter but failed.

Roan Fel, a member of the New Empire, got together with a woman named Elliah.
Killed by the unloyal servant Imperial Knight Eshkar Niin, the Hapaan people accused Roan Fel of her case since the Knight was his servant.
It led to friction developing between the New Empire and the Hapes Consortium.

The Hapes Consortium had its borders still neutral and open for the outsiders in the events of the Sith-Imperial War and the Imperial Civil War that followed.



# Culture
Assassination attempts and competition for power were frequent among the upper classes and noble houses.
 It was widespread among the noble houses to plot death on someone they were jealous of, even if it was a family member, to get power in society.

The Queen Mother was portrayed as an idol and viewed as a goddess by the hapans.
Her selecting a partner to stand by her side was crucial to all citizens.
To be her partner and consort, one had to be included as nobility to keep the gene pool going.
There was a feud between noble houses about whose son would be the Queen Mother’s consort’s son.
The noble houses always attempted to assassinate the consort and the next woman up after the Queen Mother’s reign for their benefit.
Due to this, the Queen Mother’s heir, Allana, had her father’s identity sealed to prevent jealous hands from touching her.

Men were given the role of second-class citizens due to the matriarchal society.
They solely increased the population, but some held power.
This power was limited, leading to some men leaving the matriarchal society and becoming pirates, living in the Transitory Mists and preying on vessels that did not know of their background and identities.
They resumed this lifestyle until Nova-class battle cruisers caught them and sent them to trial.
They faced execution depending on the crimes they committed.

Anti-Jediism was a popular political ideology.
The Hapans praised it due to the fall of the Lorell Raiders in the series of battles against the Jedi Order.
The ideology broke out among the Hapans during the reign of Queen Mother Ni’Korish.
She despised the Jedi due to the damage they caused.
She attempted to wipe out all Jedi who dared to fly in the Hapes Consortium.
Anti-Jediists established a faction afterward in the Yuuzhan Vong War.
Members named it after her.



# Military
When the Hapes Consortium was founded by the first governing Queen Mother, a vital and vigorous military operated on the side.
Individuals who held the title of Hapan Royal Guard were considered of higher authority by the public.
They were seen in crimson clothing by the citizens that resembled the role and power they held.
For instance, a prince called Isolder had a Hapan Guard guarding him on orders from Captain Astarta.


The Hapan Royal Guard’s uniforms were one-piece and compared to a flight suit.
The uniforms were tight and adjusted to body types.
Members painted the uniforms in a deep red color.

Another role with an authority even higher was the Elite Commando present in the so-called Her Majesty’s Select Commandos that served her and performed crucial and secretive missions.

The Hapan Security was the most important agency for the preservation and upkeep of law enforcement.
The Hapan Royal Navy guarded the planet Hapes of the Hapes Consortium space administration.



# Commerce
The galaxy knew the Hapes Consortium due to its possession of great wealth.
Trading groups with power could trade with their traders excellently due to their fame and wealth.
After leaving the age of isolation, the Hapes Consortium, goods were the base in trading, and the Hapans continued to utilize their currency.
Their currency was more valuable than Imperial, Republic, and New Republic.
The Hapan currency swung in their favor, uplifting them as great traders.


The items they had access to ranged from rainbow gems to guns of command.
Illegal and legal markets sold these items for high prices.
Even though a business could function on all planets in the Hapes Consortium, the government, and Hapan law made an institution that said that Hapes is where all vital business and financial transactions go.
