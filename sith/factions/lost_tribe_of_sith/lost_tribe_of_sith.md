# Overview
The Lost Tribe of Sith was an old Sith order which was founded on the planet Kesh in 5000 BBY.
It was created when the warship omen crash-landed on the planet of Kesh.
The Sith decided to then take over the natives of the planet who believed the Sith were gods.
A Sith Captain by the name of Yaru Korsin then became “Grand Lord” of both the Sith And the natives, and his title was then passed down to his daughter Nida.
While being apart from the world for many years the Sith then decided to improve their living space and build a temple at the crash site of the Warship Omen and make their HQ the capital Tahv.
Even though the Tribe consisted of Humans and Sith, Korsin ordered the termination of the latter to further concrete his rule.
Over the years the Sith progressed and eventually formed their rulers, Circe of Lords which was primarily created with Lords and High Lords, which fell under the rule of the Grand Lord.
