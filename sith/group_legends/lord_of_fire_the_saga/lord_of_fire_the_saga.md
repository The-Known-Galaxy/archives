# First Flame
The Sith had academies all over the universe, but there was one academy that produced the best of the Order, the Temple on Dathomir.
Ignis was a human male Sith who was on his way to the Temple on Dathomir to learn the ways of the Dark Side.
Jinqxd (later known as Ignis) first learned of his abilities a year before, when he went hunting in the dark forests of his home planet, Alderaan.
He lost his temper and accidentally unleashed a powerful and unexpected blast of fiery energy that erupted from his palm.
All the life near the explosion was engulfed by the powerful blue energy, killing all life forms that it struck.
Shocked, Jinqxd had no choice but to run home and avoid being seen in the forest.
He returned home safely and unseen, or so he thought.
A Sith Lord had witnessed Jinqxd’s power and studied him for the next few months.
This Sith Lord was known as Darth Xenion and would soon become Jinqxd’s Master.
Xenion took Jinqxd into his care and trained him in the Dark Side of the Force.
Jinqxd was then reborn as Ignis of the Sith Order,  but there was only so much Xenion could teach Ignis.
Xenion wasn’t very powerful in Sith Sorcery and Alchemy, his talents lay in other places.
This made it quite tough for Xenion to teach Ignis, so Ignis joined the Sith Academy in hopes of learning more about Sorcery.
Xenion decided to take Ignis to the newly built Sith Temple on Dathomir, a planet that wasn’t as strong in the Dark Side as Korriban, but strong enough.
They boarded Xenion’s Fury-Class Interceptor and headed to Dathomir.

Eventually, Ignis and Xenion landed on Dathomir where Ignis felt the strong sensation of Dark Side energy that flowed through him like a river, cold and powerful.
It truly made him more alive and much more eager.
He saw the magnificent structure of the new Temple on Dathomir in absolute astonishment, never had he seen a building more sophisticated and shady.
It was beautiful.
He entered the Temple and the Force was even stronger, how was this possible?
All the Sith were emanating their Dark Side abilities.
Now, Ignis was waiting in the combat pit, terrified and eager for his first Sith training, his Rite of Passage.
“Acolytes of the Dark Side.” the Teacher said.
“You have all been selected to train in the prestigious Sith Academy on Dathomir.
The first topic you will go over during your time here is combat.” the teacher stated.
“Now, I want all of you to take out your vibroblades and follow my instructions carefully.
Duel the person next to you in a fight to the death.”.
This caught Ignis completely by surprise, his first day at the Academy and they already want him to fight to the death.
The Twi’lek next to Ignis launched at him leaving Ignis barely enough time to parry the hit.
Their blades clashed in whirlwind motion, the flashing of the blades was almost as fast as light itself, deflecting, striking, and parrying.
Eventually, Ignis’ opponent made a fatal mistake that would cost him his life.
The Twi’lek attempted to change fight styles giving Ignis a perfect opportunity to cut the Twi'lek’s throat.
The Twi’lek fell to the ground, its blood illuminating the pit.
Ignis felt the rush of adrenaline die down as his opponent was finally slain.
His heart was beating rapidly and what seemed like an endless amount of sweat poured down his scarred face.
The Twi’lek got him good, leaving a giant scar on his right cheek.
“Good.” said the raspy voice of the teacher behind him.
“You’ve passed your training, take a break, your next class isn’t as… gruesome.”.
Ignis left the arena with no sympathy for the dead Twi’lek, he simply heard a voice in his voice repeating the words “Only the strong survive.”.

After the training concluded, Ignis made his way to the Sith Archives and found it empty.
Good, he thought.
‘I have the whole Archive to myself.’ He read through a few articles regarding Ancient Sith Tombs, Sith Temples, and his personal favorite, Darth Nihilus.
Ignis was extremely fascinated by Darth Nihilus, one of the single greatest Dark Lords of the Sith to ever roam the Galaxy.
Ignis read for hours and eventually fell asleep in his chair.
A few hours later he woke up from an announcement informing him that his next class was about to start.
Ignis’ head shot straight up and jumped out of his seat only to realize that he was already where he needed to be for his next training.
“Did you have a good sleep, Ignis?” a deep voice said from behind him.
A giant male Zabrak covered in orange tattoos shadowed Ignis.
“Oh, uh, sorry, Teacher, I got too caught up in my studying and I lost track of time,” Ignis replied.
“I don’t care what excuses you come up with, I only care that you listen to this class and shut up.” the Teacher said.
“Yes, Teacher.
Sorry, Teacher.” Ignis said.
“Now, your second class is about the Archives and the Sith Code.
You all have 1 minute to read the Sith Code and interpret it in your own words.
GO!” the Zabrak yelled.
Ignis wasn’t worried, he’d already read enough information about ancient Sith Philosophies and the Sith Code.
“Confused are we, Ignis?” the Zabrak asked.
“No, sir.
I already know what the Code means.” Ignis replied.
“If you’re so smart, Ignis, why don’t you mind explaining it to me?” the Zabrak said spitefully.
Ignis did so and left the Zabrak in shock.
“The Force shall free me: meaning that my talents in the Dark Side and my lust for power will eventually make me stronger in the Force and once I’ve mastered my talents I will turn the tables and make the Force my slave for me to achieve freedom.” Ignis ended.
“Well… you sure know it all don’t you?” the Zabrak said mockingly.
“You’ve passed, dismissed.
You may want to hope you don’t have me as a teacher again.” the Zabrak said.
Ignis left the Archives feeling nothing but pride, he successfully proved his teacher wrong and passed his second training, and the third won’t be much harder.
Ignis headed back to his sleeping quarters and got a good rest.
Ignis woke up and stretched.
“I better head to class,” he thought.
He made his way to the lecture rooms and took a seat.
His teacher this time was a Sith Pureblood, Ignis felt the Dark Side of the Force emanating powerfully within this being.
“Today is simple.
I will just go through the different lightsaber forms and ranking system of the Order.
Listen carefully and take notes.” the Pureblood said.
The seminar took around an hour then the Pureblood ended by saying “There is a shuttle on its way to Korriban waiting for you outside the Temple.
It leaves in 10 minutes, find it before it leaves or you are of no use to us in this Academy.”.
Ignis bolted out of the room in search of the shuttle, he zigzagged through the hallways of the Temple until he was outside, in the freezing cold.
He opened himself up to the Force and it guided him the way to the shuttle.
Ignis made it with two minutes to spare.
On the shuttle, Ignis met a young human male around his age, Daiku.
Just like Ignis, Daiku wanted to join the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and the two talked about the ancients.
“Do you know about the Blade of Fire?” Daiku asked Ignis.
“That’s odd, I've never heard about that before,” Ignis replied.
“Not many have,” said Daiku.
“It’s a powerful blade that is constantly burning.
The blade is lit with an eternal fire.
It’s said that upon touching an opponent or their weapons it will instantly melt,” Daiku said.
“Wow, how have I never heard about this?” Ignis asked.
“As I said, not many people know about it,” Daiku replied.
“Interesting,” Ignis murmured.
 The shuttle departed and made its way to Korriban where the toughest challenge lay.

# The beginning burn
The shuttle arrived out of Hyperspace and they began their descent onto the powerful, ancient Sith homeworld, Korriban.
“I hope you are all ready to face the toughest challenge you’ve ever faced in your lives.
You will be constructing your very own lightsaber, but it comes at a cost.” The Twi’lek teacher, Alask, exclaimed.
The Rodian twitched in his seat and sat up straight.
The three Zabraks glanced over at the only Rodian on the shuttle and began murmuring.
Daiku and Ignis were the only humans on board, but there were also three Zabraks: Triz, Sibalena, and Brare.
There was also a Rodian, he was Grax, and the Sith Pureblood, she was Haelusa.
But what caught Ignis’ eyes the most was the colorful group of Twi’leks, orange, pink, blue, and green.
The orange one was Chee, the green was Boc, the blue was Oola, and the pink was Nima.
They reached Korriban’s surface.
Ignis thought Dathomir was powerful in the Dark Side of the Force, compared to Korriban, Dathomir was weak.
The Dark Side was even stronger here, Ignis could stay up for hours, and his starvation passed away replaced with hunger for power.
“Follow me!” Alask said.
The class wandered through the ruined Valley of Dark Lords.
Sadly, all the tombs had been raided by ancient Sith and there was no use for them.
They entered an old, ragged temple with a table on top.
This was where we craft our lightsabers Ignis thought.
“Step forward.
I’m going to explain this once and only once.
Listen at your peril” Alask said, his voice echoing throughout the massive, ruined structure.
“You will be searching through these caves for a Kyber crystal, but be aware that you won’t be the only ones there, you might be unlucky and encounter dangerous creatures or worse, each other.
Those who make it out alive within the said time will leave this planet alive, if you don’t make the timer we’d assume you died.
There are only so few crystals, you will have to fight for them or die.” Alask said.
The Twi’lek exchanged fearful looks.
“Let the final trial begin!” Alask shouted.
All the beings ran for the caves, some followed others and some chose their paths, Ignis was one of them.

He bolted through the caves, the Dark Side soaring through him, pumping him with what felt like an endless amount of exhilaration and accelerating his speed and mind.
He opened himself up to the Force like Xenion always taught him during their training sessions and it guided him to an Amber-colored crystal.
Unfortunately, Ignis also encountered Brare and before he could pick up the crystal, the Zabrak charged toward him.
Acting swiftly, Ignis sidestepped out of the Zabrak’s way and used his left foot to trip the Zabrak.
Brare jumped back on his feet in an instant and that’s when it happened again.
With a snap of his fingers, Ignis managed to set Brare on fire.
The Zabrak stood there for a second in astonishment, then he realized what was happening.
Brare started screaming in agony, running around the cave with his hands waving in the air.
Ignis heard a sudden growl, he picked up the crystal and started running, he glanced backward and saw a massive beast grab Brare and devour him in a single gulp, it was a rancor.
The rancor lifted its head and charged toward Ignis, but Ignis was faster and focused on escaping.
He zigzagged through the caves and ran into Boc.
Boc fell to the ground but jumped right up again, sadly, he was too late.
Ignis never stopped to help Bloc and left him there as a means to distract the blood-lustful rancor.
Bloc was devoured.
Luckily, this bought Ignis enough time to find the exit and make it out alive.
He was the first one out and not long after him, Grax appeared.
They waited a while.

“This is pathetic.
Taking you guys way too long” Alask said.
“You’re lucky I didn’t leave without you all,” he said.
Then, Daiku appeared, and following him was the loud cry of Triz.
Oola and Chee emerged at the same time.
Alask bought his index figure and his thumb together and all of a sudden Oola and Chee were dangling in the air, hands clasped around their throats for their windpipes were slowly being crushed by the power of the Dark Side.
“When I said if you encountered each other it would be dangerous, I didn’t want you to help each other.
Why did you come out together?
A true Sith is independent and doesn’t require the help of each other.
What you two have done is the complete opposite of how a Sith should act and because of this you will pay.” Alask yelled.
The bodies of Oola and Chee fell to the ground, their lifeless eyes remained open wide.
Nima came running out and tripped over the dead bodies.
Once she realized who they were she screamed in horror.
“Is there a problem, Nima?” Alask asked.
“Wha-, I mean-, No, sir,” she replied, trembling at the sight of her dead friends.
Sibalena also made it out alive with Haelusa’s head in her arm.
She threw it towards Alask.
“Well done, Sibalena.
This is exactly what I wanted.” Alask said.
“Thank you, Alask,” she said.
“Now, anyone seen the others?” Alask asked.
“I killed them,” Ignis said.
“How did you manage to kill them?” Alask asked.
“I burned Brare and was chased by rancor.
I saw Boc and tripped him to distract the rancor.
It devoured him.” Ignis said in a non-sympathetic tone.
They were useless to him.
The class stared at him.
“Well done, Ignis!” Alask finally said, breaking the awkward silence.
“Now, let the Force guide you in making your lightsabers,” Alask said.
They started construction and straight after went back to the shuttle, Korriban was not safe at night and darkness was creeping overhead.
“Now, once we return, find the Overlord of the Sphere you wish to join and talk to them,” Alask said as they took off.

 They arrived back on Dathomir and Ignis ran straight to the Archives, rumours were that the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge’s Overlord, Darth Lividus, had arrived on Dathomir and was in the Archives.
Ignis approached Lividus.
“Who are you?” the Overlord asked.
“I am Adept Ignis of the Sith Order.
I wish to join the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge.” Ignis said nervously.
“Prove yourself worthy to me,” Lividus replied.
“Explain to me why you want to join us and inform me of what you already know of our lore,” Lividus demanded.
Ignis explained everything to him and finally, Lividus accepted him.
Lividus left the Archives and from the shadows, Xenion emerged.
“I see you have joined the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge,” he pointed out.
“I still wish to learn from you, Master,” Ignis said.
“Good, my apprentice.”...

“Firstly,” Xenion said.
“Due to your strong connection with Sith Alchemy and extraordinary ability of Pyrokinesis, I want you to practice every day conjuring up Fiery energy and brewing Sith Alchemy.
Luckily, Dathomir is the best place for this.” Xenion said.
“However, I can’t help you, my powers lie elsewhere and that’s why I’ve made this the last part of our training.
After this, you will become a Sith Knight of the Order.” Xenion explained.
“Yes, sir.
I better get to work then.” Ignis said.
“Indeed,” Xenion replied.
Ignis spent that afternoon in the Archives reading as much as he could find about Sith Alchemy and Pyrokinesis.
All he could find out was that Pyrokinesis was the ability used by very few Sith to conjure up and manipulate fire.
They did this by heating up and rubbing air molecules to create a ball of fire, which they’d unleash on their opponents.
Ignis read for hours and couldn’t find anything.
He decided to take things into his own hands.
He practiced heating air molecules for the next few weeks.
Eventually, he learned how to create medium-sized balls of fire and could throw them at objects or people.
After learning this, he moved on to an ability called Convection, which was pretty straightforward for Ignis.
He meditated and would light things on fire.
Firstly, he’d only be able to light smaller objects on fire with really good concentration and whilst meditating, but soon he could do it quicker and mastered the ability.
Of course, however, he’d still practice both abilities every day.
He wasn’t ready to master Sith Alchemy, that ability was complex and he’d require more time alone and in general.
He informed Xenion of his new abilities and then the Trials of Knighthood began.

Two years later:
Ignis was finally a Sith Knight, who had mastered Pyrokinesis and Convection and had joined the Sphere of Mysteries with his master, Xenion.
He’d been there for two weeks and was about to do his Advanced Sith Knight Trials/Inquisitor Trials on the planet of Dromund Kaas, this was where most of the Sphere's activities were held...
Darth Renavus hosted it for him.
He passed, but he didn’t want to stay in the Sphere for too much longer, he missed his days in the Archives with his friends, Carmesi, Long, and Gallius, from the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge.
Gallius and Carmesi ascended to Lord, which made Ignis regret his decision to leave.
After a few days, Ignis decided it was time to go back, he requested it from Darth Kaderim and said his goodbyes.
“Good luck, my dear apprentice,” Xenion told him.
“Thank you, Master,” Ignis replied and he left Dromund Kaas.
He boarded his new ship, the Flame, and set a course to Dathomir.
Lividus had left the Order and he was replaced by Darth Nodt, a young but extremely intelligent Overlord.
Lucky for Ignis, Nodt was a close ally and friend to him so he welcomed Ignis back with open arms via holo-communications.
Ignis was promoted to Sith Curator, which was good because Gallius and Carmesi were Curators too.
However, Ignis was surprised when his friend from the Sphere of Mysteries, Vederium, joined Ancient Knowledge as a Curator too.
“I would have never guessed you’d join Ancient Knowledge,” Ignis said to Vederium.
“Thought a change was necessary,” Vederium replied.
“Great to see you anyway,” Ignis said.
“Likewise,” Vederium remarked.
There were new faces, Remalior, who Ignis had already met shortly before leaving, was now a Loremaster, and Daiku, who he had joined the Sphere with, disappeared.
This shocked Ignis, but doesn’t matter now, Ignis and Daiku had grown apart over the years.
“Welcome back!” Gallius and Carmesi said as they approached the landing pad.
“Good to see you guys!” Ignis said.
“Where’s Long?” Ignis asked.
“He’s a Loremaster now and has more pressing matters, but he sent his regards,” Gallius replied.
“Great!” Ignis said.
“Let’s get to work,” Nodt said as he revealed himself.

Five years later:
Ignis was in the Archives, downhearted when he heard the news about Carmesi.
His old friend had perished and right after Gallius moved Spheres as well.
At least Long was still here, Ignis thought.
He got up as Nodt entered.
“What happened to Carmesi and the timing of it is truly a tragedy,” Nodt said.
“But we must not let it stop us from serving the Order.”.
“Yes, sir,” Ignis said.
Ignis saw Nodt accompanied by Darth Invictus and Darth Bellicus.
Bellicus used to be a part of the Dark Lord’s Powerbase and Invictus had been a part of the Sphere for quite some time now after leaving the Sphere of Sith Philosophy as a Darth and switching to Ancient Knowledge.
Remalior was also promoted to Lord and there were three new members: Daedima, Jake, and Mateo.
Ignis became allies with them too, but he spent most of his time with Long now.
Jake and Mateo were also Curators and good ones at it as well.
As Ignis was the oldest current Curator, Jake looked up to him as an idol.
Ignis helped the two new Curators and they learned fast.
“New mission I assume, sir?” Ignis said after remembering he was with Nodt and the Inner Circle.
“You could say that,” Nodt said.
“What do you mean?” Ignis asked.
“I mean I’ve talked to my Inner Circle and the Dark Council about you,” Nodt said.
“Sir, I can do better, I’ve been trying my best-” Ignis was interrupted by Nodt.
“Relax, Ignis.
It’s nothing bad, kneel before me.”.
Ignis did so.
“With the support of the Dark Council and the Inner Circle, I announce Inquisitor Ignis, a Sith Lord.
Rise Lord Ignis,” Nodt said.
Ignis rose but his legs could barely hold his weight.
Was he hearing this right?
Sith Lord?
Him?
“I-, I-, I’m honored, sir.” Ignis stuttered.
“You should be, it’s a big responsibility and I know you will please me,” Nodt said.
“Absolutely,” Ignis replied.
“Now onto the more pressing matter,” Nodt said.
“You and Jake have an important mission.
I want you guys to venture to Korriban and spend a few weeks there searching for anything that could be useful for our cause.
“Yes, sir.” Ignis said.
“Jake has already made his way to your ship, it’s time you went as well.” Invictus said.
“Oh, and Ignis.” Nodt said.
“Gallius is waiting for you guys there,” he said.
“Wait what?” Ignis asked.
To think his day couldn’t get any better, Gallius finally returned to the Sphere.
“Yes, he has decided to rejoin us and I immediately sent him to Korriban.” Nodt said.
“I’ll leave right away,” Ignis said.



# The Tomb of Darth Blaze
Jake and Ignis landed on Korriban.
The planet got Ignis excited and as usual, alive.
“Where is Gallius meeting us?” Jake asked.
“I have no idea,” Ignis admitted.
“I’m sure he’ll know where to look,” Ignis said.
Something was off about the planet this time, a growing sense of power lingered in Ignis, boiling inside.
He thought he heard a voice calling out to him, it was probably just the Dark Side, Ignis thought.
This planet has been deserted for years, the only people who ever set foot here are the Acolytes constructing their lightsabers, which rarely happens.
The two Sith walked for hours in silence, Ignis was calling on the Force to find Gallius.
Eventually, they came across a Temple where Gallius lay meditating at the entrance.
He looked up to see Jake and Ignis.
“Took you long enough,” he said.
“We only realized of the mission not long ago,” Jake said.
“I heard of your promotion, Ignis.
Congratulations!” Gallius said.
“Thank you,” Ignis replied.
“Now, let’s stop wasting time and get to work,” Ignis said.

The three of them split up and started walking through the Temple.
They kept their comms on just in case.
Ignis found a small beam of light coming from the tunnel on the left.
He followed the light and found himself in a small cave with a giant red tomb with a four-sided pyramid on top, a Sith Holocron.
Ignis read about Sith Holocrons, they contained teachings from one of the greatest Sith Lords and Dark Lords of the Sith.
Dathomir had a Holocron, the Holoron of Darth Nox, and only the Overlord was allowed to see it because of the power it contained inside.
Ignis had never seen the Holocron nor any Holocrons in general, he merely heard it from rumors.
Now, however, he was face to face with a real one, the question was whether he should take it for himself or bring it to the Inner Circle.
Ignis approached the Holocron and clasped it in both hands, the floor started to rumble, the tomb was opened, and out came a giant blue spirit.
Ignis attempted to run but the cave entrance collapsed right before he could leave.
“Who are you?” the deep voice asked.
The Spirit’s voice caused a fiery feeling inside Ignis.
“I am Lord Ignis of the Sphere of Ancient knowledge.
Who are you?” Ignis replied.
“I am the great Lord of Fire, I am Darth Blaze.” the Spirit said.
“Darth Blaze?” Ignis asked.
“Never heard of you,” he said.
“That’s because all records of my existence have been destroyed, I have been erased from history, like many of my fellow Sith Lords before you,” Blaze said.
“I was once part of a prophecy, I was said to lead the Sith in annihilating the Jedi and control the Army of Fire.
They called me the Lord of Fire, sadly, I was exiled and assassinated by my apprentice.
I have waited a long time for someone to find my tomb and my Holocron.” Blaze said.
“Finally, you come before me.
The question is, are you worthy of becoming my successor and has the Army of Fire chosen you to lead them?” Blaze asked.
“I have no idea what kind of trick this is, but I don’t want to be a part of it,” Ignis replied.
“This is no trick.
If it was, my power in the art of deception would’ve fooled you by now.” Blaze said.
“I’ll prove it to you,” Blaze said.
He lit up the candles in the room and started meditating.
All of a sudden, a giant sword emerged from the ground.
The sword was lit on Fire.
Ignis remembered.
A few years ago when he was an Acolyte, Daiku had spoken of a Sword of Fire.
Was this it?
“Is this the Sword of Fire?” Ignis asked.
“Heard of it?” Blaze asked.
“My friend found a text in the Archives that only mentioned the sword and its ability to constantly be lit on fire,” Ignis replied.
“Perhaps you are the one who has been chosen to inherit my legacy,” Blaze said.
“What legacy is that?” Ignis asked.
“To wield the power sword, control the Army of Fire, and wipe out every Jedi from the Galaxy,” Blaze said cackling.
“Prove yourself worthy to me, complete the Four Fiery tasks, and then I shall give you the power of the Sword of Fire,” Blaze said.
“It will be done, Darth Blaze.
Where do I begin?” Ignois asked.
“Take my Holocron, learn everything I have to teach you, and then the Holocron will guide you with your tasks.
Show this to not a soul.” Blaze replied.
He opened the cave entrance.
“Leave,” he said.
Ignis ran out of the tomb with the Holocron secured in his satchel and ran into Jake.
“Where were you, my Lord?” Jake asked.
“What do you mean?”.
“We were trying to contact you, but your comms must’ve lost signal,” Jake said.
“Oh, right.
Sorry, I was searching the caves,” Ignis replied.
“Find anything interesting?” Jake asked.
“No, nothing that could be of any use to the Inner Circle,” Ignis said.
“Very well,” Jake said.
They left the Temple, and once again when darkness poured over Korriban the three Sith needed a place to camp, so they headed to the ruins of the ancient Sith Academy and slept.

Three months later:
There was much to do today and Ignis got up at the crack of dawn.
He watched as the sun rose from the east and woke up the other two.
They sprang up and got to work, today they were to look for the Valley of the Dark Lords and it was their last day on the deserted planet.
Ignis, however, had kept learning from Blaze and finished his training; he was now waiting to leave the planet so he could go off in secret to complete the fiery tasks.
They navigated their way to the Valley of the Dark Lords and each went their separate ways in different tombs.
Ignis’ tomb was completely dark, his only source of light was the fireball he had made using pyrokinesis.
He walked through the tombs and just as he expected, found the tomb was already open and there were no artifacts scattered around.
He departed the tomb and went to the next, only to find the same results.
After searching 5 tombs, Ignis realized it was pointless.
Jake and Gallius came to a similar conclusion and they headed back to the ship to contact Darth Nodt.
In the course of the three months, Gallius had ascended to Darth due to the retirements of Invictus and Bellicus.
They spent that week on Dathomir attending the service and went straight back to Korriban.
Finally, they were returning to Dathomir for good.
All except Ignis, who would complete Blaze’s training in secret.
They contacted Nodt.
“Anything new?” he asked.
“No, sir,” Gallius replied.
“That’s a shame,” Nodt said.
“You all did your best and that I am thankful for.
You may return to Dathomir and we will speak of this in the next Sphere meeting.” Nodt said.
“Yes, sir.” the three said in unison.
They turned off the comms and made a course for Dathomir.
Home sweet home, but for how much longer?

Upon their arrival home, they caught up with Nodt and made their way to the Chamber of Ancient Knowledge where their meeting would be held.
“It is with a heavy heart that I must announce my retirement from the Order and the Sphere,” Nodt said all of a sudden.
“What?” asked Jake.
“Retirement?
There’s still so much to be achieved, we are on the verge of greatness” Ignis replied.
“I am aware, but fear not my replacement will be just as good as leading the Sphere as I was.
It is none other than the legendary Darth Zinwrath himself.” Nodt said.
Zinwrath?
The Overlord of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy?
He had been the second oldest current member of the Dark Council and had always been in the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.
He was an extremely close ally with the Dark Lord of the Sith.
“Who’s looking after the Sphere of Philosophy now?” asked Gallius.
“I am not sure, all I know is Zinwrath is your new Overlord.
Oh, look, here he comes!” Nodt exclaimed.
“Hello, everyone,” Zinwrath said in what seemed like a friendly tone but judging by the look on his face it was hard to tell if he was genuine.
“I am your new Overlord, I am open to any ideas you all may have,” he said.
“Very well, I must be on my way.
My shuttle departs in a few hours and I must get ready.” Nodt said.
They all embraced him and said their farewells.
He left the Chambers.
“Now, let’s see, what should we start with?” Zinwrath asked.
“Hm, for now, I think I’ll get you all to start training the newbies until I make any further adjustments to the Sphere.
We have no time to lose, everyone but Gallius and Ignis may leave.” Zinwrath said.
The crowd left the Chambers, it was silent.
Not the good kind of silence, a cold silence.
Zinwrath’s eyes darted back and forth between Gallius and Ignis.
“You two know how the Inner Circle system works within the Sphere I presume,” Zinwrath stated.
“Of course!” they both said.
“Good, I am yet to decide what adjustments to make but I’d love both of you to help me out.
As you know I was a part of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy and changing Spheres is a lot to wrap my head around,” he said.
“We’ll be here for you, sir,” Gallius said.
“I am thankful for that.
I am also looking to fill up the Inner Circle positions, I understand this Sphere has never had a full Inner Circle, correct?” Zinwrath asked.
“Indeed,” Ignis said.
“Good, my first act as an Overlord is to ascend you, Ignis, to Darth at the next Sith Rally in a few days,” Zinwrath said casually.
“Wait, what?
Me?” Ignis asked.
“Who else would I be talking about?” Zinwrath asked.
“Oh- this is unexpected.” Ignis replied.
‘Thank you.” he blurted out.
“Let’s get to work,” Zinwrath demanded.


It was a busy week for Ignis and Ancient Knowledge.
The Rally had finally come and Ignis was going to become a Darth.
Wow!
This was perfect timing as well.
As a Darth, Ignis could be excused from traveling off-world and could assign himself his tasks.
“Join me in congratulating the newest Darth of the Order, Ignis, who has been a Lord for quite some time now and has served the Sphere for a very long time.
He has shown his worthiness throughout the artifacts he’s collected, tombs, and temples he’s found, but most of all, Ignis has written more articles for the Sphere than anyone in its history.
He has earned this title.” Zinwrath said.
Ignis walked up to Zinwrath and bowed.
“Thank you!” he whispered.
“Anytime,” Zinwrath said.
Ignis walked back.
The Rally was over and Ignis was approached by various Sith all congratulating him on his recent success.
Ignis thanked them all but needed to complete his tasks.
He remembered what Darth Blaze said to him about finding a student, someone he could mentor, and trust to hold the legacy if he were to be killed.
Jake approached Ignis and embraced him.
“Congratulations, my Lord,” he said.
“Thank you, Jake,” Ignis replied.
Then it hit him.
Jake had been his friend for years, he was much younger than Ignis and was powerful in the art of Sith Alchemy.
Ignis pulled Jake aside.
“Something wrong, my Lord?” Jake asked.
“No, remember our first day in Korriban and you asked me if I had found anything in the Temple?” Ignis asked.
“Why, of course!” Jake replied.
“Good, follow me,” Ignis said.
He told Jake about the prophecy, Blaze’s tomb, the Holocron, the Sword of Fire, and the Army of Fire.
It took a while for Jake to wrap his head around everything but then he realized.
“I want you to become my student.
I would ask Gallius but he is slightly older than me and it wouldn’t work, that’s why I have come to you.
I can feel that Sith Alchemy is a great talent of yours.
I may not have mastered it yet, but you certainly have.” Ignis remarked.
“I would be honored, my Lord,” Jake said.
“Kneel before me and rise as my successor,” Ignis demanded.
“Where to now, Master?” Jake asked.
“We must complete the three fiery tasks, I must seek out ancient Sith Sorcerer’s tombs and I must claim the Sword of Fire,” Ignis replied.
“So-” Jake was interrupted by Ignis.
“We are headed to Mustafar,” Ignis said.



# Scorch of the Republic
The two Sith arrived on Mustafar.
Ignis was recently promoted to Darth and told the Inner Circle that he and Jake were looking for anything that might come in handy to them on the volcanic planet.
Zinwrath insisted he sent more members with them, the current generation of Ancient Knowledge never set foot on the planet and Ignis was eager to complete his training with Blaze.
Firstly, Ignis was to find the Temple of Darth Blaze, then he’d have to make it to the core of the Temple without being killed, and lastly, Ignis was to steal the Sword of Fire successfully.
The one Blaze showed Ignis was merely an illusion just like the tomb, Ignis was to find and steal the natural thing to become the Lord of Fire.
“Stay with the ship,” he said to Jake.
“If I am not back in five standard days tell the Inner Circle I perished,” Ignis said.
“Yes, Master,” Jake replied.
Ignis started his journey, the Holocron held a secret map of the Temple inside and so all Ignis had to worry about was any traps within.
Ignis traveled for a few hours and eventually found himself at the Temple of Darth Blaze.
The Temple was surrounded by lava and was fiery red.
Ignis flipped over the lava and reached the Temple.
He landed on the island and all of a sudden, a giant long came crashing down to knock Ignis into the lava, he barely avoided it.
He jumped up and sliced both ropes that held the log in a single slash.
The log collapsed in the lava and Ignis entered the Temple.
He realized that one of the tiles was higher than the other, so he avoided the tile.


He found himself in a large room with a giant throne that was lit on fire.
This must be the core, Ignis thought.
He walked up to the throne and was completely oblivious to the cage to the left.
He took a seat on the throne and the cage opened.
Ignis heard loud growls.
He looked to his left to see four hounds.
The hounds were bright red with fiery eyes.
They charged at Ignis and left a trail of fire where they moved.
Ignis ignited his lightsaber, and the bright amber of his blade flashed all over the room.
He tried to strike down the hounds but they were quick.
One of them bit his left leg, and Ignis screamed in agony.
He snapped his fingers and the hound was lit on fire.
Nothing happened.
Ignis’ fire abilities did not affect the hounds.
The throne that Ignis was sitting on dissolved and in the exact spot where the throne had disappeared from a bright sword appeared, the Sword of Fire.
Ignis ran to the Sword and took it, it burned but with power.
Ignis could feel it now, the power of the sword was flowing through him.
The hounds stopped in their tracks and immediately bowed before Ignis.
He left the Temple and went back to the ship.
It was time.
He would destroy the Jedi and the Republic with this sword.
“Is that the Sword of Fire?” Jake asked as Ignis boarded the ship.
“Indeed,” Ignis replied.
“Set a course for Dathomir, I must speak with the Dark Council,” Ignis demanded.
“Right away, my Lord,” Jake responded.


They arrived on Dathomir and Ignis bolted to the Council Chambers.
“What is the meaning of this?” Zinwrath demanded.
“I’ve found a powerful tool that can help our cause,” Ignis said.
The Overlord of the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy, Darth Surge, who was also the oldest Dark Councillor, saw the weapon.
“How did you get that?” he asked.
“It’s the Sword of Fire,” Ignis said.
“I know what it is, I asked you how you obtained it,” Surge said quickly.
“I spoke with Darth Blaze a while back and he guided me.
I’ve been training with him for a while.” Ignis replied.
“What is this Sword of Fire?” Darth Ugwae, Overlord of the Sphere of Philosophy asked.
“It’s the most powerful sword ever forged,” Surge said.
“It was created by Sith Sorcery and the Eternal Flame.”.
“Why have I not heard of this?” Darth Tythen, the Overlord of Sphere of Mysteries, asked.
“It’s been erased from all documents, except one,” Surge said.
“So what should we do with this sword?
How can we destroy the Jedi?” Darth Kelemvor, the Overlord of the Sphere of Law & Justice, asked.
“I control the Army of Fire, I will lead them to battle with the Jedi,” Ignis replied.
“Then it’s settled,” Zinwrath said.
“You will lead a team of Sith and destroy the Jedi,” Zinwrath said.
“I will accompany you, and so will the Sphere of Expansion & Diplomacy,” Surge said.
The Council all agreed and so Surge and Ignis left.
Zinwrath caught up with ignis.
“Take a few people from Ancient Knowledge with you,” he said.
“I’ll bring Gallius and Jake.” ignis replied.
“Good, you have done the Order well,” Zinwrath said.
“Thanks, sir,” Ignis said and hurried to inform Jake and Gallius.

Surge was waiting for Ignis outside the Temple.
“As commander of this mission, you will need your command ship.
This was your Master’s, Darth Xenion, Harrower-class dreadnought.
It belongs to you now.” Surge said.
“Thanks, sir,” Ignis replied.
He boarded the ship.
On his new ship was a naval crew.
“At ease!” the Captain said.
Ignis smiled, all of this was for him.
“What is your name?” Ignis asked.
“I am Captain Pelgrim.
I am in charge of the crew and the second in command of the vessel.” Pelgrim stated.
“Good.
I hope you are all ready, we are about to embark.” Ignis said and they began their ascent into space.
Ignis watched out the viewport and saw a speck, the Temple.
He was leaving Dathomir and possibly for good.
“Set a course for Ossus.
It’s time to destroy the Republic.” Ignis commanded.
The bridge burst into cheers as they prepared for the biggest battle of their lives.

The ship, which Ignis had named “Combustion”, had exited hyperspace and they waited for the rest of the fleet.
“Incoming transmission.” Ensign Renk shouted.
“Put them through,” Ignis demanded.
“This is Darth Surge, can you hear me Ignis?” Surge’s voice came from the comms.
“Yes, Ignis here,” he said.
“All twelve ships have come out of hyperspace.
Each of them contains a hundred Sith.
Warriors, Inquisitors, Raiders, and some of my Inner Circle are here.
They are all at your command.” Surge said.
“I’m ready.
How about everyone else?” Ignis asked.”I’ve heard from Darths Vican, Apteryx, and Tremulus that they have their soldiers ready.
Darth Gallius’ ship is ready and so are the others.
Are the other two Ancient Knowledge ships ready?” Surge asked.
“Yes,” Ignis replied.
“Deploy all your ships and round them all up,” Ignis said.
“We’re going to strike at the dead of night, we will burn their Temple.”.

The ships all landed a few thousand kilometers from the Temple, so they wouldn’t be seen.
Ignis and Surge stood on top of a rock and in front of them were rows of Sith Warriors, Inquisitors, Raiders, Sorcerers, and even Knights.
There were also thousands of Sith Empire Troopers gathered.
It was the entire Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy along with several members of each Sphere.
There were thousands of them, all at the command of Ignis and Surge.
“My fellow Sith,” Ignis started.
“Today, we gather on Ossus to destroy the Republic and the Jedi Temple.
They will suffer heavy casualties and so will we, but this battle will result in a fatal blow to our enemies.
Those who die will die for freedom and the Empire.
We will not and cannot lose this fight.
We attack in the dead of night, so prepare your soldiers.” Ignis shouted.
Jake, Gallius, Vican, Tremulus, and Aptetryx were all in a line in front of the soldiers and Sith.
The crowd all split and hundreds of Sith and soldiers entered the ships and grabbed anything they could find that would help the cause.


A few hours later, the entire army was standing in rows again.
They waited for Ignis’ command.
“Deploy!” Ignis said.
The army all charged in different directions.
Some ignited their lightsabers, others cocked their guns.
In a matter of seconds, the camp was completely desolated, except for Surge and Ignis.
“If you excuse me, sir, I have to meet with a few of the Jedi High Councillors,” Ignis said in a joyful tone.
“I wish you the best of luck, Ignis,” Surge replied.
“Thank you, my lord,” Ignis said as he bolted to the Temple.
He ran for ages, the Force boosted his energy and the Dark Side flowed through him so strongly, his will was too powerful.
He felt invincible, nothing would stop him from destroying the Council.
Ignis had found a secret entrance during his time with Blaze.
He’d have to go to the waterfall and there was an unexpected cave right next to it.
However, the occasional Temple Guards were patrolling this area, but Ignis could take care of them.
He reached the cave entrance, there were only two present guards.
Ignis showed himself from the darkness.
The guards were mute, however, then ignited their lightsabers.
They were too late, Ignis had already conjured up a giant ball of fire and had shot it toward the guards.
Their hands waved in the air, and the heat of the blood-orange fire consumed their bodies, burning their flesh.
Ignis strode to the secret chambers of the Council.
He could hear the shouts of Jedi, Sith, and soldiers.
His army had reached the inside.
However, he hadn’t conjured the Army of Fire yet.
Now was the time.
Ignis held the sword high in the air and chanted an ancient Sith ritual in the Sith language.
Arms began to poke out from the floor, the rugs burned and the deadly servants rose from the floor, not just in the chambers, but all over the Temple.
Ignis had made sure that they spread out so that they could help the Sith Empire.
Only ten of them stood with him.
“Help the others.
I’ll take care of the Councillors myself.” Ignis said to the creatures.
They scattered out of sight and he entered the Chambers.
The entire Council wasn’t there.
The Grandmaster, Quartermasters, and a few other Councillors.
They were away at Coruscant.
He saw mostly humans, they were Va; Senko, Dylan Malvern, Vanestic, Excubiarum Tenebris Net but also a Kel Dor, Master Cha-Koon, and a red Togruta, Master Audila Zavros.
“What is the meaning of this?” Master Val Senko demanded.
“Your time is up Jedi.
The Jedi Order is about to experience a fatal blow.
Right now, thousands of Sith and soldiers are attacking your surprised Order on Ossus.
The Temple will burn down in a matter of hours or minutes even.
You can either join us or die.” Ignis exclaimed.
“This is outrageous!” Master Dylan shouted.
“You have no right to barge into the Temple like this.” Master Audila Zavros said.
Ignis looked at her.
He lifted his right hand and made a choking gesture.
The Master was afloat in the air choking.
The other Masters rose from their seats and prepared to attack.
“Now now.
There’s no need for that.
Put your weapons away and I’ll let her go.” Ignis said.
They all looked at each other reluctantly and put away their lightsabers.
“Good,” Ignis said.
He threw Master Audila at the other Councillors and lit Master Cha-Koon on fire.
The Kel Dor’s flesh melted away.
The other Masters got into their fighting positions.
Ignis chose Form IV, the aggressive form Ataru.
He wasn’t good at lightsaber combat but his will was strong.
The room erupted into bright colors and the sound of lightsabers clanking was deafening.
Ignis opened the Chamber door and led the Masters outside.
Master Dylan attempted to slash Ignis’ legs, but Ignis was too fast and parried his blow.
Ignis flipped back and unleashed a powerful Force push on the Jedi.
Everyone but Master Val Senko fell.
Val charged at Ignis and tried breaking through Ignis’ defense.
Ignis kicked the Master’s ribs and the others all jumped back up.
Ignis couldn’t take on five Masters on his own.
He had no help.
He had to use Sith Alchemy, but he had no time.
Master Net disarmed Ignis and his lightsaber rolled across the floor.
“Now tell us who you are, Sith.” Net demanded.
“I am Darth Ignis of Ancient Knowledge, I lead the Curators, I am one of the most powerful Sith Alchemists, but most of all… I am the Lord of Fire.
Chosen by Darth Blaze himself.” Ignis said.
Ignis couldn’t see who it was but all of a sudden everything turned black and Ignis lay unconscious on the floor.


Meanwhile, Jake was in the Jedi Library with Darth Gallius and a few Sith Raiders.
He was stealing their knowledge and setting the place on fire.
He had learned a few tricks from Darth Ignis on how to conjure fiery energy, set things on fire, and how to make a ball of fire.
He used all his training in the Temple.
However, he wanted to prove himself.
Ignis saw a Twi’lek Jedi wearing the robe of a Jedi Master.
“Fight me, Master Jedi,” he shouted to the Twi’lek on the other side of the library.
The two locked eyes and destroyed everyone in their paths.
Jake reached the Twi’lek and began the attack.
He easily parried the Twi’lek’s blows and blocked all his strikes.
Jake kicked Twi'lek in the knee and the Twi’lek fell.
Jake lit the Twi’lek on fire and he burned to death.
Jake was completely oblivious to the fact that all the Jedi in the library lay dead on the floor.
The Sith had won this fight and they set the entire thing ablaze.
Jake looked into the fire pleased, he did it.
Ignis would be very pleased with their success.
I wonder how Ignis is going, Jake thought.
Ignis hadn’t told anyone but Surge where he’d be and Surge kept it a secret.
Wherever he was, Jake couldn’t feel the burning feeling of his presence.
He could smell the smokey body of Ignis nearby anywhere.
Where was he?
If he had failed, Jake would have to claim the sword and finish Ignis’ goal.
Jake knew he wasn’t ready for this and so he went to look for Ignis.
After setting the Library on fire, Gallius and Jake went to search for Ignis, worried about their loyal friend’s fate.


Ignis woke up.
He glanced around and saw the Councillors surrounding him, all of them were meditating.
What were they doing, he thought to himself.
“Welcome back, Jinqxd.” Master Val said.
“I am Ignis, Jinqxd is long dead.
Do not ever refer to me by that name again or I will cut your tongue.” Ignis said angrily.
“So much hatred, so much anger.” Master Net pointed out.
“Anger and hatred lead to power, that’s why the Jedi are weak and the Sith are strong,” Ignis said.
“Do you truly believe that?” Master Net asked him.
“Think back to the time you spent with Master Creation.” Master Val said.
“Yes, we know you’ve communicated with him in a non-lethal way,” Vanestic said.
“I was brainwashed, I underestimated the Dark Side.
I was lied to.” Ignis said.
“No, Master Creation was helping you.
He guided you, he saw the good in you.” Master Tenebris said.
“No!” Ignis shouted.
“You are all; lying, trying to turn me,” Ignis said.
“You’re too dangerous, Ignis.
It’s time Jinqxd returned.
It’s time you joined the Jedi.” Dylan said.
Ignis knew they were conducting mind tricks, he felt the soothing tranquillity inside of him.
These Councillors were powerful and trying to tempt him.
“I will never join you!” Ignis shouted.
The Councillors grew silent, focussed too much on turning him to the Light.
Finally, the silence broke.
“We have someone who’d like to talk with you.” Master Net said.
A strange figure with ruffled hair and a blindfold across his eyes emerged into the Chambers.
“Master Creation…” Ignis gasped.
“Yes, it is me, Jinqxd.
Do you not remember our talk?” he asked.
“No, this is all a lie.
That was a lie.
You Jedi are filled with lies.” Ignis protested.
“No, Jinqxd.
I unlocked the good in you.
I can still see it.
Please join us Ignis, and serve as my Padawan.
I can teach you to control your emotions.” Creation said trying to persuade Ignis.
“Stop calling me Jinqxd, he’s dead,” Ignis said.
“No, he’s just lost.
You’ve lost yourself.
Find the light inside of you, embrace it.” Master Creation said.
“Darth Blaze is lying to you, he plans to resurrect himself.
He is using you.” Creation said.
Ignis considered this.
Was this true?
Surely not.
“No, he can’t be resurrected.
That’s impossible.” Ignis told himself aloud.
“An army of fiery creatures should be impossible too, and a sword made of a fire that never dies.
Yet it exists.” Creation said.
Ignis refused to betray the Sith.
They were his family, the only home he’d have for a very long time.
He could smell the smokey debris of the Temple as it consumed the Chambers.
The Temple was going down.
His mission was a success.
Ignis heard the shouting of Sith Lords calling to soldiers and Sith.
“Back to the ships!” he heard.
“Time to leave these Jedi scums to burn!”.
“It would seem that your fellow Sith is leaving without you.” Master Dylan pointed out.
Surely they thought he was dead.
They wouldn’t just leave Ignis here.
He got rid of that thought.
“Follow us.” Master Creation said.


They walked for a while.
“Why aren’t you helping any fellow Jedi?” Ignis asked.
“We are, there’s just nothing us Councillors can do to help.
We have a bigger problem.” Master Val said.
They reached the shore.
“Across the island is a special cave, it goes back to the Je'daii Order.” Master Val stated.
They swam across the island and reached a giant boulder.
The master said a secret password that opened the cave entrance.
They entered.
Inside was a bright light.
But the thing that caught Ignis’ eyes was the lightsaber.
“This belonged to one of the first Jedi after the Je’daii Order was replaced.” Master Val said.
“One of the very first lightsabers made.
It stays in this cave with us so we can teach people of the ancient Jedi.”.
“Why are you showing me this?” Ignis asked.
“We are confident you will join our Order.” Master Creation said.
“Why?” Ignis asked.
“You’re not all dark, Jinqxd.
There is a powerful light emanating from inside of you.
Stop trying to ignore it.
You know it’s there, you know it’s growing.” Master Creation said.
“So what?
Do I just give up the Sith teachings and become a Jedi?” Ignis asked.
“Yes.” the Masters said.
For some reason, Ignis felt light inside of him.
It’s the cave.
The Light Side was flowing powerfully through this cave.
It was consuming Ignis.
No.
It was just the cave, it was the Masters too.
They were all trying to turn him to the light.
They are performing a ritual, Ignis thought.
Trying to remove the darkness from inside me.
It was working.
Ignis couldn’t feel barely any of it left inside him.
Just light.
The Light Side now flowed through him powerfully.
It felt like a burning fire inside of him, endless warmth.
He was completely oblivious to the fact that his eyes were closed.
He opened them.
Everything was so much different.
“Welcome, Padawan Jinqxd.” Master Creation said.
“What happened to my Dark Side powers?” he demanded.
“Ignis is dead, Jinqxd has been reborn.” Master Tenebris said.
“Am I your Padawan, Master Creation?” Jinqxd asked.
“You have been ever since you were that curious Sith Lord who approached me.” Master Creation said.
They left the cave and headed back to the Temple.
It was all burned down.
Flames engulfed the once elegant, beautiful Temple.
“You don’t seem sad.” Ignis pointed out.
“No, it is time we built a new Temple.
The Temple of Dawn.” Master Creation said.
“I will assist,” Jinqxd said.
“Thank you, Padawan.”.

Jake and Gallius eventually lost hope of finding their friend.
They boarded the ship and left the planet.
They arrived back on Dathomir and mourned the loss of their friend.
Jake had found the Sword of Fire lying down in the Jedi High Council Chambers.
Ignis must’ve died fighting the Masters, Jake thought.
“He would’ve wanted me to continue his legacy,” Jake said quietly to himself.
“I won’t let him down.”.
A few months after the attack on Ossus, the Dathomir Temple was destroyed by the Nightsister Clan.
The Sith had to move to Crucible Prime and construct a new Temple.
The Temple contained a special tomb, the tomb of Darth Nox.
They had found his burial sight on Crucible Prime and had made it a Dark Side monument.
Many had visited the millennia-year-old Dark Lord of the Sith.
His ghost patrolled the tomb.
One day, Jake and Gallius set out to Ossus.
They heard of the new Temple of Dawn constructed by the Jedi.
During their time on Ossus, they encountered something remarkable, but disgusting.
They saw Ignis, wearing the customary Jedi robes.
His lightsaber still looked the same, but was a new colour.
Silver.
They encountered him and a human wearing the Jedi Master’s robes in the forest.
They confronted the two.
“What happened to Darth Ignis?” Jake demanded.
“Ignis is dead, Jinqxd has been reborn,” he said.
“Traitor!” Gallius and Jake screamed.
Jake lunged towards the Jedi but Jinqxd was still as powerful in the Force as ever.
He hadn’t improved his lightsaber combat, but he was growing stronger in the Force and the silver blade danced in front of him.
Jake and Gallius retreated to the ship.
Jinqxd and the Master didn’t chase after them.
Jinqxd was training for his upcoming Jedi Knight Trials back in the forest with Master Creation.
He had only hours before it commenced.
Master Creation kept reassuring him that it would be alright.
Jinqxd was still young and active.
He was in his early twenties and full of life.
Also, he was powerful on the Light Side.
Later that day he met with the Jedi High Council.
He passed his trials and was deemed worthy of becoming a Jedi Knight.
“I told you it was easy.” Master Creation said.
“Thank you, Master,” Jinqxd said.
All the Jedi in the hall congratulated him.
Jinqxd was responsible for the destruction of the Dathomir Temple.
He had persuaded the Nightsister clan to attack the Sith.
Although the Masters were weary of this, some of the other Jedi viewed Jinqxd as a hero.
He didn’t care about fame.
He was focused on other matters.
Jinqxd would be headed to Tython with Master Creation to uncover ancient Jedi artifacts.
Jinqxd left the Temple only to return again in a few weeks.
He and Master Creation headed for the ship.
They entered the cockpit and took off.
They made the jump for hyperspace, and the blue flashing light still left Jinqxd in aw.
It never ceases to amaze him.
“Are you ready for an adventure, Jedi Knight Jinqxd?” Master Creation asked.
“Always,” Jinqxd said.
