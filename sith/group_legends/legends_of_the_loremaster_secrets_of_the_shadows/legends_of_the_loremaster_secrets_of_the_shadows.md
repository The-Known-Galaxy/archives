# Overview:
To serve the Dark Lord of the Sith is to be a tool.
A tool of his passion, a tool of his strength, and a tool of his will.
None understands this more than his loyal Dark Honour Guard, powerful servants clad in fashionable and sturdy red armour resembling the same colour that most sentient beings bleed.
When they kill, they kill in his name.
When they conquer, they do so in reverence of the Dark Lord and his ambitions.
Guardsmen of the Dark Honour Guard put their superiors first, their ambitions second, and their lives third.
They train their bodies to withstand strikes from even the deadliest blaster bolts and perfect their martial skills with the lightsaber pike, a weapon of range that demands mastery and precision.

Some found clarity within serving the Guard by being held to high standards and being respected by even Dark Councilors, but one cared not for the recognition nor the glory, simply grateful for his life and his given purpose.
He served as a Guardsman for some time, obeying the commands of the officers and showing no concept of mercy to people he would once think of as allies.
He was unfamiliar with the traditions and conformities of the Order he found himself sewn to by the strings of fate, and he desired to turn the unknown into known.
He spent what spare time he had studying texts found in the archives of the Enclave, finding himself immersed in the lore and philosophy of the Sith.
From ancient savages pitting war against each other to armies of considerable power that conquered for the sake of it, waging war against the rest of the galaxy.
The new ideas and old philosophies of the past were something the Guardsman realised he found more answers in rather than the mysterious, vague teachings of peacekeepers that whispered of hope.
What good was hope if it was misplaced?
What good is peace if it brings complacency?

The Guardsman had more questions than answers dwelling within his mind, he possessed the curiosity of a child regarding the history of the Sith.
It interested him, the traditions of several millennia ago remained resilient in the modern Order, the preservation of such knowledge was astounding.
More notably, the people who maintained such wisdom were mostly Sith that kept to themselves, a curious set of traits in a society based around boasting strength and putting power above all else.
The strict lifestyle of the Guard was wearing him out, as great of a meaning it gave him, learning about Spheres gave the Guardsman more insight into the Sith and how every gear intertwined with another.
Anything rusted or malfunctional was thrown out and replaced.
It made him realise there were more uses for his skills and passion other than escorting people capable of defending themselves.
It was a known fact within the Dark Honour Guard that those who wanted to discharge from it were allowed to if they had served enough time, but kidnapped former Jedi didn’t exactly have as much of a luxury to have it so simple for them.
It was still worth the try, in order to further a journey to satiate a new hunger for knowledge, to delve further into the secrets of the Sith.
A few days and a completed assignment later, the Guardsman spoke to his superior and mentor, Captain Astaroth.

“Considering your rank and how long you served, you are eligible for a discharge, but there's no telling whether you’ll defect back to the Jedi or not.”

“I don’t plan to, nor do I want to.
I have an ambition in the Sith, but it’s not with the Guard.”

“...
You will be discharged and become a Sith Knight for your service, but any notice of you defecting to the Jedi or performing acts of treason will have you executed.
Dismissed.”

If he was lying, Astaroth would have known.
The latter was excellent at sensing falsities from speech, and not one lie was detected.
The Guardsman was either a good liar, or speaking the truth, and it was known to the Captain that deception wasn’t exactly a strong suit of the Guardsman.
The unceremoniously knighted man emerged from the quarters of the Dark Honour Guard, no armour on him.
Simply the everyday attire of a Sith Knight.
Each step along the stone path of the temple made a presence known, the distant chatter of people were apparent and the presence of the dark side something the Knight was accustomed to.
He approached a certain section of the temple, where artefacts were on display and holo-texts were available.
People who chose to dress in ornate robes and wear metal visages walked around the Sith archives, where all information that was recorded was on public display.
This was what he desired.
To contribute to an eternal cause, to be a name in a never-ending scroll of benefactors.
What kind of journey he’d have along the way, that was his fate to follow.
The Knight approached a man who simply exuded wisdom, power, and leadership quality.
He briefly explained what he wanted, and what his true purposes were.

“I see… I like that.
Our Sphere is a small one, but those with ambitions like you are needed.
I welcome you into the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge.
I’m the 3rd Keeper of Records and the current protector of these archives, Darth Invictus.
You are now part of the group of people who preserve our history, our traditions, and our secrets.”
