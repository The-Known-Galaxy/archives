# Overview

Meni was a force-sensitive human male that served in Darth Validus' reformed Sith Order following the fall of Dark Lord Fedlz.
Also referred to as "The True Defender," Meni was characterized by the various accomplishments and titles he received during his time within the Sith Order where he was able to achieve the rank of Sith Lord and have a seat within the Inner Circle of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy.
It is unknown if he ever deceased or disappeared into the galaxy, but many believe him to have died with the Expansion and Diplomacy strike team he was assigned to during an Ossus invasion; however, countless Sith that served Darth Validus still claimed to see potential traces of the elegant being across the star systems.

# Early Days

With an extreme sacrifice of both a Jedi Knight and a Jedi Master known as Tykaar and Mika who abandoned the Jedi Order to pursue their relationship, Meni was able to enter the world on the planet of Ach-to where he was born with a midichlorian count of 19,000 coursing through his veins.
Despite the efforts of the former Jedi to live their lives in peace and keep their presences unknown, that all changed when the Sith Order conducted the attack on Ach-to that not only forced the Jedi Order to relocate but also deprived the planet of most of its features that made it habitable.
With great valor, the Jedi Knight and Jedi Master fought to keep themselves and Meni alive by attempting to escape via a stolen Sith shuttle; though they were left with no choice but to toss the baby Meni into an escape pod before their ship met destruction.
The escape pod set on a course to the planet Dathomir, where a Sith Enclave resided.
Upon crashing into the dismal and red terrain of Dathomir, the Sith Order's members discovered Meni and they would forcefully abduct him into the Sith Order where he would presumably spend the rest of his life.

# Sith Order

Years would go by, transforming Meni into a full-fledged and official Sith of the Order after completing his journey in the academy as well as the Trials of the Sith.
Meni made himself acquainted with the Sphere of Sith Philosophy due to his interest in wanting to promote change and betterment for the Sith Order through academics.
With his interest realized, the Sith Overlord Darth Praefectus would admit Meni into the sphere where the two shared a mutual bond and vision for the future of the Sith Order.
Despite growing into an academic teacher, Meni was able to become an elegant, powerful, and formidable Sith - one of the Order's best both through lightsaber combat and the Force.
He would maintain his status while also earning himself a reputation through his teaching method in which he enjoyed a laid-back, yet serious and straightforward style of instruction that carried for generations of Sith.
With such a reputation, Meni was able to ascend into the hierarchy of the Sith Order rather quickly moving from the Assembly of Overseers up to the rank of Sith Lord where he entered the Inner Circle of Darth Praefectus.

# A Presumed Demise

Meni's time as a Sith Lord was deemed to be his greatest era of success and glory as he led various defenses against the Jedi Order who sought justice upon the Sith that destroyed their former temple; however, this success was short-lived after the Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy conducted an invasion of the new Jedi Library on Ossus hoping to pirate and even destroy the archives so that the Jedi tradition would come to a halt.
Meni met his presumed end when he was assigned to the second strike team and vanished.
The Sith Juggernauts discovered their strike team deceased but never found the body of Meni and presumed he met his demise.
An abundance of Sith weren't happy hearing the news that Meni had seemingly died on Ossus, some even denying it themselves and spending their time to locate any potential traces.
The Dark Council was heavily displeased, especially Darth Praefectus who had hoped Meni would live out the rest of his vision.
Following decades of searches, individuals only discovered very doubtful leads to the disappearance of Meni, some even raising suspicion that Darth Zinwrath, the former Overlord of the Sphere of Sith Philosophy to be connected to the entire mystery.
