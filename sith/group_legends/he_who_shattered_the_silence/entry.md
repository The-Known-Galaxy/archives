# Preface

A prestigious, respected and loved Commandant of the Temple Guard
whose dedication is so profound that many Jedi could do nothing but dream
to one day come anywhere close to the resolve he carried within his soul.

One whose love is so great, only love itself could ever make his will waver.
One willing to sacrifice anything that he’s able to claim to be his,
just for those around him.
A victim to a cruel fate, the same fate
that so often punishes more the just than the unjust of this earth.

So witness how the Force equalizes those who believe in it blindly from the
own eyes of the Commandant O-V, “Omega-5”, as what remains of him
turns into the Will of the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Havok.

A compelling story of the man who made the Temple his home,
and its Guard, his family.
While giving a gaze into the Dark Lord’s temple guard past.
Guaranteed to reserve bloodshed, heartbreak,
grief, abandonment, suspense and much more to those who find
the guts to read it whole, from start… to finish.

# Submission:

The silence was deafening.
Omega was standing atop a sandy hill, outlooking the Sith Enclave entrance.
The air was heavy, not solely due to the hostile and tenebrous atmosphere of the planet, but from the weight of the circumstances that mission had brought upon him.
His second hand, his brother within the Force, the one he trusted the most in the Temple Guard had disappeared with no trace.
He was perfectly aware of the risks his mission carried; rarely do Temple Guards venture outside the subject of their guard itself.
Despite being an unshakable man, the thought alone of what could be happening back on Ossus while his entire force was outside was making him tightly clutch his gold-embellished lightsaber hilt in concern.
As if hundreds of voices were crying out in his own skull to turn back, each yell echoing back in his cranium, amplifying with feedback.
And yet one question in his head remained;
Where had his Captain… Vermened, disappeared to?

«Commandant…» His thoughts were interrupted by a familiar voice.
The newly nominated captain Theorem, while skilled, was the walking and breathing reminder to Omega that his own chosen was gone.
He reluctantly turned around to face him.

«Captain…» - he spoke slowly but decisively - «This is it.
Once we enter the enclave, we are not coming out if not with Vermened.» The rest of the guard was looking directly at him, rallied in two rows, with Theorem standing at the front.
The force comprised a total of twenty-six men, new Guardsmen and Veterans alike, all motivated by one objective.

Omega faced his men, observing them with almost pitiful eyes under his timeworn mask.
«I know that when I informed you that I would come here to look for your Captain, you all offered me your sabers and your lives.
I appreciate your righteousness, but this is my battle to take.
Do you all truly wish to continue?»
The Guards did not flinch an inch.

Theorem was the first to break eye contact, to suddenly turn away; To look onto his fellow guards as well.
«Has fear obstructed your ears?
Let us answer; are we going to abandon our brother on this bulwark of corruption, greed and darkness?»
A deafening “NO!” was answered in unison by all of them.

Energetically, he continued; «Are we all going to struggle until we leave victorious, or fall trying?»
The men nodded their heads.
Theorem then turned back, looking at his Commandant, before speaking with a tone of almost exasperation: «You have heard every single one of us, what more evidence do you need?» before elegantly unsheathing his lightsaber hilt, with rays shimmering on its golden details, as if the air itself around them all was leaking full of resolve.
«We will let the Guard be complete again.»
Speechless for a fleeting second, Omega then nodded back.
«In that case, may the Force be with us.»
And as soon as he completed that sentence, he slid down that brief hill overlooking the capital of Evil, the Babylon of the Jedi; Dathomir’s Sith Enclave.
They confidently marched toward the entrance, hoping their numbers would be enough to negotiate any information.

As they neared the entrance, they noticed an odd lack of Sith presence that gloomy morning.
An ongoing ritual of some sort, perhaps?
After all, the Dark Lord, known as Fedlz, had been missing for a few weeks as well.
None of the Jedi recons could gather and report enough information on the matter, as they all met their fate before the chance to return.
They all formed one long column, about four feet of distance from each other, rhythmically marching together.
They walked through the arch of the entrance, before coming to the middle intersection.
Step after step.
They found the Dark Council’s door wide open; just what was going on that day?

They stepped in, Guard after Guard after Guard.
As soon as the last one put his foot through the entrance to the room, the bright red holodoor would flash into existence, closing them in.
«BOX!» As soon as those words came out of Omega’s mouth, the men rearranged in a square, igniting their lightsabers, the amber lighting coming from their blades being the only opposition to the overwhelming darkness of that room.

None of them dared to utter a word, as it was their tradition not to

communicate with the enemy unless absolutely necessary.

That’s when a maniacal, heart-wrenching laughter came from the darkness of that cubicle.

«You never were a man of words, Commandant!»
That’s when his blade ignited, the only issue being that it had done so while already traveling through the air.
When they had realized, there it was; the head of a Guardsman fell to the ground, cut from his soldiers, as the rest of the body delayedly collapsed to the ground with a silent ompf.

And then there were twenty-five.

The lightsaber then returned in its owner’s hand, its sinister red lighting revealing the face of its user.
He seemed to be an oddly composed, yet clearly corrupted and consumed by the Dark Side individual.
His stare was maniacal, but his posture gentle.
His face appeared clever and belonging to an individual of light, yet there laid the lifeless head of a Jedi… because of him.
«Where are my manners?
That’d be… Darth Notom, to you.» The Guards were trying to hold their composure, almost forced to hear that man’s speech, as focusing on the question at hand and on the likelihood of their death could’ve been enough to cause their immediate flight.

So they simply stared back, their contempt for that murderer deeply hidden within their hearts.

«Seems like you’ve not been updated, have you?
A few things have been happening to the order… in the past few months.»
Suddenly, another red lightsaber would light up in the dark, before doing so again on its opposite end.
A double lightsaber… unusual, but not too uncommon.
The Guards looked at each other confused.

Then, another, slightly around the first.
and another.
and another.
They were now encircled by a circumference of Sith Honor Guardsmen, all seamlessly moving in an unnervingly perfect symphony of death.
The Guards had not seen those individuals before; their blades were similar, but their entire appearance was different.
Their masks were pointed and of a lucid - almost feeling unreal - bright red armor.
Their eyes had a black opening, but unlike the Temple Guard’s masks, theirs were… lifeless.
Completely obedient.
Flawless.
Breaking from the pressure, one of the Temple’s Guardsmen thrust his blade forward against one of his encirclers.
The blade’s point would easily pierce

right through the soldier’s torso, as the red guard fell dead in utter silence.
The others did nothing but stare.

Then, like a flash, it happened.
The closest one dashed forward, holding up his blade, cutting off the Temple Guard’s arm in a single swift movement, as he briefly held his cauterized stump in disbelief.
Two others charged towards him like rabid animals, before beginning to sink their lightsabers into the Temple Guardsman’s back, over and over again, until his torso had enough holes it could barely be called one.
A gruesome and agonizing death.

And then there were twenty-four.

«Like them?
Let’s say they’re a bit of a new addition, the new Dark Lord wanted to have them this way.» Notom continued.

Was that their fate?
Were the prestigious Temple Guard simply going to be slain like cattle, harvested like grain in summer?
No, they had not come there to die.

«Leader of the Sith.» interrupted Theorem, much to Notom’s disdain who looked at him with a grimace.
«We have come here to be returned Captain Vermened.
Do so and you won’t be annihilated.» Notom then stepped forward, holding his single hilt in front of him in an elegant opening of the Second Form, before flourishing it.
«Make my day.» And then all hell broke loose.
The Temple Guard focused on fighting their

mindless counterparts, while trying to resist Notom’s vigorous throws and attacks.

Omega lunged forward, delivering a seamless fatal hit to a nearby Sith Guard.
Sparks from every direction caused from the clashing blades lit up that theater of war.
Guardsmen killed and fell, in a clashing of gold and ruby within that bloody amphitheater.

And then there were fifteen.
The Templar’s movements were swift and agile, the Honormen’s were calculated and lethal.
Men fell left and right, when suddenly Omega freed himself to flip into a hit towards Darth Notom…
But he was ready; and quickly pushed him away through his Force, with his hilt flying out of his hand and falling onto the ground, the chromium falling and making noise.
«Nice try, but I believe it’s time to retire you.
I’d like to make someone spectate your demise!»
And in a corner, there he was.
Vermened himself was sitting, bound to one of the thrones.
Had he always been there and they never noticed?
The sight of his own captain shot millions of thoughts rushing through his head, to the point he almost forgot that Notom was approaching to strike him down.
The noise of fighting nearby him

suddenly felt so distant, as his surroundings felt more and more fuzzy.
Guardsmen of both sides fell left and right.
Notom raised his blade above his head, as Omega’s last thoughts were confused and fearful…
«NO!» Theorem emerged from the crowd, holding his blade lowly.
And like a flash, Notom’s upper half was separated from his lower, as they both fell lifeless to the ground.
Hearing him not speak anymore was almost eerie, as if he would start talking with that same maniacal tone at any second.

The fighting slowly died down, as the last of the red guardsmen fell.
Unfortunately, the victory came at its cost.
Omega counted the Temple Guards that remained.
Seven, eight…
Nine.
And then there were only nine.
His other seven guardsmen gathered around Vermened, many barely believing it was himself, still alive.
He appeared to be bound to an ancient sith mechanism, with some odd inscriptions.
As one of the guardsmen approached to free him, the contraptions opened up themselves.
Vermened was now free, as he slowly began to open his eyes.
He… accomplished his objective.
So why did something within Omega’s heart tell

him something was very wrong?
But Theorem didn’t feel that.
«CAPTAIN!
We must leave immediately!» As he clutched his hand and tried to pull him away.
That is when Vermened stared back at him; yellow-contourned piercing eyes, within a consumed and pale face.
And as soon as he understood, Vermened’s blade ignited and pierced through his midsection.
«Brother…» he panted out frantically, as he, too, fell.

And then there were eight.

Vermened then quietly stood up, and looked at the Guardsmen, before stopping his gaze at Omega.
Without a word, he immediately began to choke through his newfound powers all seven remaining guardsmen of Omega, as he was powerlessly on the ground.
His hilt was on the other side of the room, and all he could do was watch.
Vermened stared back at him, before holding back his blade, and sinking it into the first guardsman.

Seven.
The second…
Six.
Five.
«Vermened… Please…»
He decapitated another, and disemboweled another with his blade.

Four.
«Stop…»
Three.

«CAPTAIN!» A cold, hopeless scream breaking that silence.
Two.

And so the last temple guard fell, his body limping on the floor of that room.

And then there was One.

Omega could do nothing more than stare back at what once was his trusted man.
In a fit of rage, he called back upon his lightsaber.

«YOU!»
He held it up, and prepared to strike…
Before his hit stopped midair.

There was no magic, no force.
He just couldn’t.
He truly just couldn’t.

Omega desperately fell to his knees, his mask tainted with the blood of those who fell trying to follow him.

«Commandant.»
Omega looked up to Vermened… clearly, the new Dark Lord.
«It seems you have unfortunately caused the death of one of the men empowering me.»

What was he even talking about?
Omega had no idea, but he couldn’t even bring himself to question what was happening.

«And yet, you are strong.
Could be so much stronger, if only you understood the potential of your inner darkness.»
Omega had no words left to say.

Vermened just looked around him, observing the bloody disaster created by his past Powerbase and the Guardsmen he was guiding with his mind.
The absolute havoc caused pleased him greatly.
He then rested his hand upon Omega’s shoulder, before almost imperceptibly moving it up to remove his blood-tinted temple guard mask.
«From now on, you shall be known… As Darth Havok.»

«The Will of the Dark Lord.»

And then there were none.
