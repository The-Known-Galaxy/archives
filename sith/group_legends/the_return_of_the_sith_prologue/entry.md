# Overview:

Long have we waited.
Lurking behind the veil of shadows awaiting our time to reveal ourselves once more, preparing to enact a swift retribution across the galaxy.
All shall know fear, all shall know that the Sith can never be extinguished.
For as long as there is order, there must be chaos to rival it.
Our time is now.

The sword fell with a swift stroke.
Countless planets going dark, one by one, each filled with the echo of screams.
It was like a symphony of terror, every scream an instrument in an orchestra of fear.
By the time the “peacekeepers” caught wind, it was already too late.

The Jedi awoke to the sound of screaming and flames, the very walls around them collapsing one by one.
Some tried and failed to retaliate.
They fell briskly to our crimson sabers.
Hall by hall, room by room, all were mercilessly butchered as the cattle they are.
To see them as equals would be an insult to our order.
They are little more than pests to be swatted.

Youngling, knight, master, it made no difference.
In the end, they would all cover the halls, side by side, equal in their failure.
They took from us what we were rightly owed, and for that, they paid with blood.
No longer must we linger silently in the darkness, for now, the darkness snuffs out the light and blankets them all with their darkest fears.

The planet Ossus, their sanctuary, would burn as we did.
They would not see us as we are; all they would see is the many crimson beams that were fuelled with every inch of rage and hatred in our beings.
It would be the last thing they saw.

We would not completely destroy their temple.
Rather, we would butcher them and leave little breathing.
Those few who were spared were saved not by mercy.
We wanted them to tell the rest what happened.
To spread the tale across their fledgling order.

To tell them that the Sith have returned.
