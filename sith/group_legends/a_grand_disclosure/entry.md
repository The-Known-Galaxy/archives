A mysterious force plane, one that many advised against entering due to its dangerous complications; detachment of one’s mind from their physical body.
The Sith Lord felt that time was absent, as if every moment lasted for eternity.
There was no future, no past, and each action was characterized by its lack of history.
Moving forward, the Lord traverses the thick fog, eventually hearing footsteps that didn’t come from himself.

Beyond the fog, his sight meets a dark figure.
The individual represents a humanoid but his entire body head-to-toe, is still shadowed; nothing but darkness.

The figure speaks,

“I’ve been here for longer than I can remember.
You came for the same reason I did generations ago, you seek to abolish the new generation of the Sith and return to the traditional methods used by ancient Sith.”

The entity takes a few steps, practically circling the Sith Lord as he continues to speak,

“I can show you the landscape you may be attempting to discover–it’s a….
Series of tombs shrouded by the Dark Side, fueled by its force vergences and whatnot.”

The Sith Lord responds as his eyes follow the figure,

“If you know of this place, why didn’t you go there yourself?”

The figure halts his movement swiftly,

“I’m sure you’re aware of the dangers that come with being in this realm, you see, I’ve been trapped here for generations.
My original body has been long-deceased.
For eons, I laid dormant, a new set of tombs awaiting discovery for the benefit of the Sith just outside my reach.”

He continues speaking with a passive-aggressive tone, indicating his frustrations at being within Beyond Shadows for what seemed like an eternity until now,
“I’ll reveal the path to get there, but I can’t do it alone as we both must use the full extent of our midichlorians to sense the vergence and determine where it resides within the galaxy, that will lead us to the planet.”

The Sith Lord gives a nod,

“Very well, I believe I can make a Holocron out of this so let’s speed up this process.
I’m not looking to stay here for as long as you have.”

The Lord turns to face the entity, the entity turns to the Lord, and both individuals enter a meditation.
By merely placing their hands on their temples, both begin to enter an intense focus as the fog grows thicker as their powers merge, and with that, the eyes close.
Their minds become connected, detached from their respective bodies to form an essence of the Force that floats above them.

A series of visions of various locations in the galaxy are observed, they come and go–Dathomir, Ossus, the Sanctum, Ilum, Korriban.
The final vision becomes a blur as all that can be seen is–

“Valleys and mountains, a barren frozen landscape.”

Both bodies chant at the same time.

“Barrens, given light by a green spectacle.”

“A Sith World, forgotten after the control of pureblood Sith.”

“A Sith world, corrupted by the Dark Side.”

Only one voice can be heard now as the chant continues,

“It can only be found in the Esstran Sector–it resides within the Sith Worlds.”

The essence leaves its position, it is slowly coaxed to the body of the entity.

From there, only one long, horrific, and chilling scream can be heard.

He opens his eyes, and the first thing that meets his gaze is a Holocron.
With a glance, it is revealed that he is in a private meditation chamber.
Upon observing his appearance, the Dark Side begins to corrupt his body.
In a matter of seconds, the strands have left the body–the human characterizations removed entirely.
Moving to enter the outside, he steps onto a ship

```
The ship landed atop the valley, some mountains surrounded and filled the planet, some snowy, some frozen, some completely lacking any flora or signs of life entirely.
```

The entity departs from his ship to take in the spectacle of this new land.
He steps forward at the edge of the cliff.
With all of his might, he harbors the power of the force vergences that the planet bathed in and releases it once more with the assistance of his own Dark Side power.

No longer was everything dark, the secrets of the planet reveal themselves with a multitude of green lights, even a beam emerges from one of the many large tomb-like structures and shoots into the sky, providing light to the rest of the landscape.
