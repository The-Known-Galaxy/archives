# Overview:
Three hours and still no indication of any actual people, the hopes of finding the origin of the distress call for help were diminishing.
The Jedi Knight was the closest to the Yavin system which was why he had received the emergency signal coming from Yavin 4, which he promptly confirmed and set for the general coordinates.
He was a human with black, wavy hair and a curiosity about his place in the galaxy, particularly on how important he was in the big picture.
He was taught to be compassionate and to never turn down an opportunity to help.
The Knight exhaled a heavy sigh, his faith was draining by the minute; with every place, he ended up being filled with the purple-barked trees that the moon’s dense forests were known for.
The whole moon was chock full of flourishing life and swamps.
He carefully clutched onto his lightsaber and tread his path, his consciousness reminding him constantly to trust in the Force.
It would guide him, it would reveal the path, no matter how much he struggled.
He forced the mantra to repeat itself in his mind as he continued his increasingly futile search.

The Knight heard a flock of yelping reptile-birds fly from a direction that could only mean danger, but it was the only hint he had been given since he wandered across the planet.
He still clung onto what little hope he had, and it would turn out to be a mistake that drove him in another direction.
In the belief that he would fulfil his obligation to help those that needed it, the Knight made a life-altering decision.
He approached the noise of two plasma-based weapons clashing against one another; the familiar sounds of a lightsaber, yet a distinct roar that a tool of peace could never make.
It was in an instant that the Knight’s instinct to escape had alerted him, but he was too late.
The last thing the Knight had seen before he was rendered unconscious was an armoured figure of renown and elite training, a Dark Honour Guardsman.

The smell of the room was dank and wet, the faint sounds of rodent-like creatures squeaked and scurried around.
The Knight was no longer in the wild terrain of Yavin 4, this was a space in an unfamiliar building.
His memory was recollecting, but it was slow, and he was even slower to notice that he was bound with chains to the ground of a small cell of stone and moss with a force field barrier that ensured him captured.
His lightsaber was nowhere to be seen, and the robes he proudly wore as a Jedi were replaced by simpler rags.
It wasn’t just the smell of the room that sickened him, he could feel the dark side permeating the very air, he deduced he was in the vicinity of a dark side nexus.
Simply sitting in the prison cell made him want to vomit, his mind in a state of confusion and severe unrest.
Being there was wrong.

“Jedi.
Under normal circumstances, you would have been executed.
However, we have other plans for you.”

A deep voice boomed, and the Knight’s eyes averted from staring at the ground up to the plasma wall that separated him from freedom.
A black-haired man with a middle part haircut and a beard was standing beyond the door, he was the one speaking.
He wore the armour of the Dark Honour Guard, with two other Guardsmen accompanying him.
If this didn’t scream importance, nothing did.

“I am Commander Arcanum, and you have two options.
Either die here a man devout to weak ideals or join the Dark Honour Guard and serve a higher purpose.
Live a life of meaning.”

His tone was cold, he had an aura of precise calculation and planning.
Everything he said seemed to be careful and deliberate.
The door was deactivated and the Commander approached, looking down at the Knight.
He pulled out a lightsaber, the one the Knight was found with and activated it.
The green blade illuminated the dark room, its light shining like a beacon of hope.
As much of a symbol of hope as it was, it was still a weapon that cut through flesh like nothing.
The Knight looked up at the Commander, still deciding before he opened his mouth to speak.

“I want to live.”

The Commander showed a small grin, deactivating the lightsaber and crushing it with his fist.
The components of the lightsaber, now broken and cracked, were dropped onto the floor.
The green kyber crystal dropped onto the floor, it's light fainter than before.
It was suffocating in the presence of the dark side.
The Commander dusted his gloved hands and glanced at the Dark Honour Guardsman to his right before looking back down at the Knight.

“Your training won’t be simple, there’s a good chance you’ll die.
It won’t be easy.
But, I think you have what it takes to survive.
You’ll be under the tutelage of Captain Astaroth.
Goodbye, Initiate.”

All endings lead to a beginning, a never-ending cycle of destruction to creation.
While a Jedi Knight died on Yavin 4 with doubt and fear, a new member of the Dark Honour Guard emerged from the smoke of the past.
