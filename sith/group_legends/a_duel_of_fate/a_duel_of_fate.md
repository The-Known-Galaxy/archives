# Entry 1
It was a day unlike any I had experienced prior… the air was thick, and… miasmic, as I emerged from the mighty doors of the Temple, that...
Smell, it hit me once more.
I covered my nose with the dorsal of my hand and peered through the mist.

It was Kel Routila, my long-time rival.
His aura was almost overpowering.
Routila seemed almost pleased with himself, his ancient frame was not how you would ordinarily picture a man of his age, he was colossal.
This was the first time in a while I had truly feared for my safety.

The bodies of my fellow Sith littered the catwalk.


I glared directly into the source of this primordial being, My body was twitching and I was suddenly engulfed in fury… pure fury.
 

I signalled for the Honour Guard, although their face was covered I could feel the dread emanating from their helmets.
The ground shook, they had begun to approach… that...
Monster.
Almost as if rehearsed, Routila sliced through the Guardsman with ease.


It was as if my body was no longer my own, 
“What is it that makes you so hard to destroy, old man?” I exclaimed.
 My hand swiftly moved to the hilt of my Lightsaber.

I sauntered towards him.

“You have lived your life in that cave, surrounded by those who look to you for guidance… Are you going to die in a place where you are despised, Jedi?” 
my voice bellowed through the landscape, Routila’s expression changed.

I had never detested an individual the way I did Kel.
Countless duels ended in a stalemate, and many of our companions were murdered, despite all this, I looked forward to when we would next clash.
Although, at this point, my veneration for this ‘Master of the Jedi’ had been subdued and devoured by my wrath.


“Someone is.” 
Routila spoke with a tone of sadness

Routila ignited his Lightsaber, 
“That old thing still works, really, Kel?” I laughed to myself 
This had given Kel time to dart up the staircase and into his stance.

I wasted no time, I unleashed a flurry of attacks on him, and the noise of the clashing rumbled throughout Dathomir.
It was like Yin and Yang, perfectly mirroring each other's attacks.
I began to fill up with excitement, 
“What is this I'm feeling?”
This feeling was alien to me, I felt conflicted.
Part of me wanted to tear Routila to smithereens but part of me wanted this to never end.

I began to pick up speed, each attack heavier than the other, faster than before...
But it was met with an evenly matched block or perfectly timed parry.
As we progressed through the courtyard, the pillars would fall due to a misplaced attack by one or a perfect reflection of the other.
Growing tired of this, I used the power of the force to raise part of a pillar and drill it into Routila with zero remorse.
Routila had been knocked from the platform onto the desolate planes of Dathomir.

I didn’t want to waste this opportunity, this was a chance for me to end everything.
I flipped off of the platform, my arm positioned behind me in hopes to plunge my blade through his chest.
Kel snapped back into reality, he had recalled his Lightsaber and with pinpoint timing, he deflected my attack and kicked me over him.

“How could you miss, that was the perfect opportunity and you failed.
You call yourself a Master of the Darkside?”
The voice inside of my head was harsh, it had no remorse.
It fueled my hatred for Kel more than any person should experience.
I grew stronger, I broke my chains right there, at that moment.

Kel and I had trouble standing upright as we fought on the hillside of the lifeless pond.
Our blades clashed, each attack more ferocious than the previous.
I was the predator and Kel was my prey.
After a well-timed parry, I kicked him into the pond below.

As Kel emerged from the other side of the pond he was greeted by my Lightsaber crashing down onto him, he quickly reacted and collided with me, putting us both in a deadlock position.
I was furious, how could an old man like this be so equal to me?


Kel glared down at me, his determined gaze carried the hope of a thousand Jedi,
“I will not let any more minds be corrupted by evil!” he proclaimed.



“You call yourself righteous, Jedi!
You are vermin, and like any vermin, I will be your exterminator” 
My voice bellowed out across the barren land, waking up any fauna that has somehow survived this planet.
I stabbed and prodded at Kel’s defence, trying to find any weakness I could,
The fight grew longer, and the distance between us and the temple grew further.

Kel suddenly retaliated, he had been waiting for this moment to strike, almost as if he had adapted the technique of a mantis.
I had to think fast, the attack was coming for my throat and fast, his colossal arms bearing power I had never experienced before.
In a desperate attempt to save my own life I raised my blade once more and guided his attack into the mighty wooden beam behind me.
