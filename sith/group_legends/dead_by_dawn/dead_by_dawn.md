Jark was on a ship for a mission along with some other stormtroopers.
They were sent to the planet Atlas for a guarding mission.
For Jark this was nothing new, he has been on several guarding missions and none are eventful.
It was like guarding a manikin with a target on its back.
He had never been to Atlas before so maybe this could be an experience.
They didn't give him much, after all, it was only for a couple of days, what else could he need?
The ship landed and he grabbed his E-11 Blaster Rifle and headed down to formation.
Turns out they were only sending five stormtroopers, usually guarding missions took up to ten to fifteen stormtroopers.
This made his mood less enthusiastic; he could tell he had a long day ahead of him.
When he arrived he was met by Slag, Anon, Bova, and Krat.
They were given the coordinates needed to find the person to protect.
They were told that he lives in a vault that leads underground and that they would need the password to get in.
The password was cement.
They got their orders and set off.
It was a pretty far distance, luckily they had enough water and food to make it through the frozen tundra that Atlas was accustomed to.
While going through the trees they felt as if they were being watched, Slag being himself started to shout at the trees.
Bova told him to quit if they are being followed, making loud noises would not help.
While the two bickered further, Krat, Anon, and Jark were discussing the shifts they were gonna take and where they would be stationed.
The real question was what was the target being protected from?
They decided to have 3 guards during the day and 2 at night.
This was so that the target would be kept safe during the day and be followed and at night two would just guard the target's quarters while they slept.
They had arrived at the coordinates and saw a steel-made vault door embedded into the mountain.
The door had a slot on it.
They approached the door and proceeded to knock twice and someone opened the latch and asked for the password.
Jark went up and muttered the phrase ¨Nark¨.
 The door had opened and 3 personnel waited at the opening.
They filled them in on the schedule for the target for the next couple of days.
They went to their quarters and had begun setting their bags and supply in the storage boxes.
Jark and Krat took the night shift and stood outside the door waiting till the clock hit nine am.

As they were waiting noises began to come out of the vents,  loud bangs, rattling were constant.
Jark and Krat with concern decided to check, Jark lifted Krat to the vent.
Krat looked in the vent and suddenly he was dragged into the vent.
All Jark saw was blood, screaming, and darkness.
He yanked Krat out of the vent.
All that was left was mangled meat and legs.
Jark felt sick to his stomach.
His stomach was so heavy it felt like his stomach was made of carbon steel.
 It was turning like a windmill.
He ran before the monster tried to return and take him along with his dismembered friend.
Along running in the halls he could hear the banging of the monsters running with him above.
Fear flooded his mind.
He started to shoot the vents aimlessly until his rifle overheated.
The rattling stopped, maybe he got it.
Just then he heard screaming coming from the squad's sleeping quarters.
He rushed down the hall and into the room.
when entering the room he had seen Bova being sucked into the vent on the floor.
He was being torn into pieces being dragged down before Slag's grip gave way and Bova was sucked into the vent screaming and leaving a bloody trail within the ventilation.
Then it hit Jark, the target, he was alone.
He rushed back to the room with no time wasted.
The door was opened with blood everywhere but no sign of the target.
All that was left was some tattered clothes on the sleeping pod.
That was the most Jark could take before throwing up.
It was clear to him, they needed to leave as soon as possible.
Slag, Anon, and Jark met back up at the quarters to grab other things before they head out.
They could still hear the rambling of these monsters.
Just then the emergency sequence came in and all the doors were sealed shut, flashing red lights and smoke spewing out of the vents like a fog machine.
Anon began to freak out uncontrollably and started to shoot.
The rest ducked down telling him nothing was there and that he needed to calm down.
But he kept screaming ¨THERE IN MY HEAD I CAN HEAR THEM.¨ Just then Slag shot Anon in the heart with his blaster rifle.
He claimed that he was a threat and it was the best course of action.
Jark reluctantly agreed but he never wanted Anon dead.
On the back of the bed was a flat metal rod.
They took the rod and tried to pry the metal door open with it but it didn't work.
It was sealed and wasn't gonna move.
The only other way out was the vent.
That was the last place Jark wanted to go.
Either way, they had the same chance of dying.
They cautiously hopped into the very large ventilation system and moved slowly to the supply room.
As they were crawling they heard noise from the opposite side of the vent.
They quickly hopped into a different room as they heard another monster dragging somebody through the vents.
It was non-stop screaming.
This was a nightmare that come to life.
 They ran through the corridors and slid into the cafeteria where they found a man with no arms.
They went to assist him but the loss of blood was getting to him.
He told them the only way out is through the main exit.
They looked on their holo map and it wasn't too far.
It was time to leave this personal hell.


They headed down to the opened door when Slag was grabbed by something that was being slid into the next room.
Jark started to spray out of panic and the unseen beast and accidentally shot Slag.
The beast ran off and left Slag there dead on the cold floor.
Jark kneeled to the ground and wept, every time he thinks he's gonna be free another man dies.
He knew that even if he ran the monster would eventually catch up to him.
The only way to really escape is to kill the beast, but his blaster is fried.
He headed to the armory and grabbed a metal spear and shield that they had in case of blasters were not in work.
As he walked down the halls he made mass amounts of noises, he would hit the shield against the spear.
He reached the end of the main exit.
The door was closed.
The creature leaped out of the vents at the other end.
It looked like something out of a nightmare.
Its yellow soul-piercing eyes.
Its skinny flexible body.
The teeth were so sharp they could have been swords.
The creature had a black mist surrounding it that could just make you sick.
They stood there looking each other in the eyes.
 They both ran at each other both with the intent to kill.
The monster jumped at him.
Jark smacked him away with his shield and pierced his leg to the ground with his spear.
The demon struggled to get up.
The spear came loose then the creature jumped on Jark and bit his arm repeatedly Jark threw him off and grabbed his arm in pain.
The monster stood there and watched his prey wept in pain.
The monster jumped at him once more and in the same sequence, Jark threw his spear.
The spear missed.
The creature had him by the arm and tore it off his body.
Just then a siren played so loud it shook the base the monster freaked out grabbing its ears in pain and roaring.
JArk slowly got up and yanked the spear out of the siren wall and pierced the creature in the head to the ground.
The creature died.
The nightmare is over.
He grabbed the nub that used to be his arm and headed towards the gate slowly.
After all this, he won.
He was at the gate and collapsed.
The lack of blood was getting to him.
And there was nowhere to heal it.
He turned on his back, looked at the ceiling, and closed his eyes.
