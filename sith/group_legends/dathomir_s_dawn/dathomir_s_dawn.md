# Overview:

The original Sith enclave was constructed on Koratas, a moon of Dathomir, and named by higher ranking Sith as 'The Jewel of the Dark Lord'.
A notable achievement of the Sith Order, it was built on the sacrifice and labour of those who pushed themselves to their very being, carving into the rock and building the enclave in reverence of the Dark Lord.
Their sacrifice would not go unseen, as for each life lost in the ongoing construction, a statue would be built and put up in their honour.
With the architectural design overseen by Meka Odullu, a close advisor of Darth Validus, construction of the enclave would eventually be finished and go down in Sith history mainly labelled as 'The Great Creation'.

In the Dark Council chambers, there was a large and unique kyber crystal, corrupted by Darth Validus himself and maintained by his powerbase with a ritual in order to keep the presence of the dark side strong in Koratas and make it a Force nexus.
The power the crystal had was so great that it stopped the moon from rotating around Dathomir despite being in its gravitational orbit, effectively suspending Koratas in space.
Because it was suspended, Koratas was in a permanent state where only the area where the enclave was located had been given sunlight providing warmth and suitable living conditions, whilst the rest of the moon was suspended in intense cold and darkness.
Sith who violated the doctrine and in some cases lost a kaggath were sent here to die a slow, cold, and painful demise.
It was impossible to survive in its conditions, and the area eventually became named by the Sith as 'Qorit', or the end.

The Dark Lord's powerbase existed to empower him, with a large portion of his strength being sustained by the Hand and Will.
Because Darth Bellicus and Darth Reavion stepped down at the same time, Darth Validus was in a state of weakness, and the stability of the large kyber crystal could no longer be properly preserved and Koratas was no longer suspended.
However, all of the potential energy had been stored and the unnatural amount of such energy caused all of it to be released, making the moon move at such a speed that day and night had become a few minutes long with each full rotation moving the moon closer into Dathomir.
All the Sith on Koratas were fully aware of the catastrophe that could ensue if the impending crash wasn't stopped or contained, but with the Dark Lord vulnerable and nobody strong or smart enough to prevent the disaster, Darth Validus used a last resort.
He rallied the Sith Honor Guard, every available member.
Using a special ritual involving Sith magic provided to him by the Sphere of Mysteries and Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, he took the life force from most members of the Honor Guard and the Force itself from the rest of Koratas.

With this new overwhelming and terrifying power, Darth Validus minimised the damages of what would have killed all the members of the Sith Order in a fatal crash, instead landing the structure in a fitting location.
Some of the structure was lost, which called for a renovation and reconstruction of the entire enclave, becoming what is now known as the Sith Temple on Dathomir.
