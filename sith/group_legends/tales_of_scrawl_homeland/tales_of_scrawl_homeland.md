Scrawl's body was built exactly how a humanoid alligator would look: scales, an elongated snout, but his eyes were unlike any other Kuvok, His eyes were a bright orange while most of Kuvoks eyes were either green, blue, or even sometimes both.
 He wore a brown tattered cloak with steel armor underneath it.
   
It was raining, the cold rain dropped on Scrawl's snout as he stared into the clouds.
He had always admired rain, it reminded him that life wasn't so repetitive, it isn't so…..
Dull.
Hunting day was always his favorite day.
Kuvoks only hunted on days with rain out of tradition from when the first recorded kill on planet Antro was made on a day of rain.
Though they did not happen often they would hunt for the whole day never stopping till the rain had come to a halt.
Scrawl gathered with his hunting squad and began.
Unlike any other kuvoks Scrawl was cunning; he would lay out traps for the animals of Antro and lure them in with the animal's primary diet, unlike the others that just tracked and killed.
He also would hide out in the trees waiting for the animals to come to him so he could save energy for when he needed to chase an animal.
At the end of hunting day, Scrawl goes around everywhere and collects all the animals that were hung in traps or in spiked holes that he had dug.
Once all the harvesting was done he would take the animals back to his mud hut for harvesting.
First, he would skin the creatures and hang them up so they could be used later for any clothing repair or weaponry he would use to fix.
The meat would be stored in a preserving bin.
This meat would usually last him a couple of weeks.
He would sort the organs into vases and line them up in the preserving bin.
His favorite organ, the lungs, would be kept on top of a pedestal in a black pottery jar.

After hunting day, Scrawl would often return to his job as a constructor.
day in and day out he would collect and create mud bricks to build huts for future Kuvoks.
They did have large births after all.
One day when Scrawl was gathering mud to get bricks for a family of 12 he found a droid well what was left of one.
He looked around to see if it belonged to anybody or maybe if anybody wanted it.
Kuvoks were very old school so they weren't a fan of droids, ships, or any other technological advances.
When he brought them to their doors they were quick to say no and shut their straw doors.
With no other options he brought the droid back to his place and decided to fix it up, he thought maybe it could help me with collecting bricks.
He grabbed some tools he found while collecting mud in the past and quickly got to work.
While working through the chest cavity, he saw a red glow coming out of the seam of the chest door.
He took a rusted crowbar and tried to pry the door open but couldn't.
Whatever this droid was made of was a tough material.
Scrawl came up with a plan to heat up the droid's metal so it could make the metal more flexible.

To heat up the metal he would need a very large heat source, thankfully Antro was known for having the largest volcano in the Korvec Sector.
He grabbed a pickaxe and headed toward the volcano.
While he was there his was on his way to the volcano he met a young girl Kuvok in the deepest part of the jungle her name was Stup she was also on her way to the volcano for a tourist kind of thing as they were exchanging pleasantries they decided to head to the volcano together after all it is very dangerous in this part of the swamp.
It was home to the leviathan, a great huge creature with scales and skin more tough than the strongest of metals on Antro.
When they reached the volcano Scrawl and Stup started hacking at the middle of the volcano so they could slowly reel the droid into the lava to melt the chest cavity.
When they came through the other side the heat was intense so they wanted to get in and out ASAP.
he lowered it down into the lava with a rope Stup conveniently had tied around her waist.
After keeping the droid hung for about two minutes and bringing it back up, the steel still hadn't melted.
Scrawl was astonished this was surely a powerful material.
He thought maybe if he could find the source of this material he could use it to make weapons for his tribe it would make hunting much more efficient.
They decided to lower it further to get more heat.
That's when he felt a huge tug on the rope and started to get pulled by the powerful creature pulling on the droid.
The creature arose from the volcano with hunger in its eyes.
It was the leviathan.
The creature lunged at them with so much force that the sound rippled in the air and the roar could be heard around the entire planet.
Scrawl covered Stup and put his hand up in defense.
To Scrawl's surprise, the leviathan was… frozen in place.
Like some kind of Force was keeping it from moving.
Scrawl was intrigued, he wondered did he do this?
Was he the reason it stopped?
He forcefully shoved out his hand and it pushed the beast back for miles so far that it was out of sight.

They went back to the center of the volcano and continued to lower it further.
Even after dipping it in the smoldering magma, the metal would not bend.
Then Scrawl came up with a plan.
The beast's scales are the toughest and strongest substance on this planet.
If he could go find it and bring it back he could maybe slice into the droid's chest cavity.
He left in the direction of where he had thrown the leviathan thankfully it left a trail of broken trees and a huge trench.
On his way, his head was full of questions of how he was able to throw the leviathan such a distance.
Could he do it again?
What else could he do?
These questions clouded his mind and before he knew it he was almost at his destination.
He heard the moans of the monster he followed the noise and the leviathan was pierced by a spike from a mountain he had crashed into.
One of the scales lay on top of the blood-filled water.
He grabbed it and put it in his satchel and started to walk off but before he left he thought about giving the creature some mercy and ending its life.
He thought about it and decided to leave it to its suffering after all it had caused so much pain and agony to this planet it doesn't deserve peace.
He was following the track back to the volcano when he came across a hut he went inside out of curiosity and found an old Kuvok sitting in the middle of the mud hut.
She claimed that she was an oracle and she was expecting him.
Scrawl took this as a scam after all he didn't believe in oracles or fate.
She told him if he were to continue the path he is currently on he would suffer for it.
A life full of hatred, grief, and agony would await him.
He brushed it off and told the oracle that it was a hoax and stormed out of the mud hut.


He arrived at the volcano again and Stup was asleep next to the droid.
He woke her up for help holding the droid still just in case it rolled and he broke the object inside.
He grabbed the scale from his satchel and stabbed the droid into the chest cavity and sliced down the middle he then cut out a square.
The object inside was some sort of red crystal.
Its glow was immense.
He put it in his satchel and Stup and Scrawl split ways.
He returned home and put his satchel to the side on his makeshift desk and laid on his thatch bed and went to sleep and tomorrow he would further test his powers and study this crystal.
