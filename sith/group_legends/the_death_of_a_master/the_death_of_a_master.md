An acrid smoke filled the sky around the Sith Temple on Dathomir.
The broken bodies of Jedi and Sith decorated the landscape like a macabre confetti, each body a celebration of victory to one tormented soul who would quickly join the deceased.
Observing the scene stood the terrifying form of Darth Invictus, dominating the structure at the temple steps.

Gritting his teeth in rage, Invictus stared into the very essence of the seemingly ancient man at the base of the stairs.
It was Kel Routila.

The ground began to tremble as 3 Dark Honor Guards approached the hooded Master Routila, before several hands, lightsabers, and finally heads, slumped to the ground by Routila’s feet.

“What is it that makes you so hard to destroy, old man?” barked Invictus, his hand hovering over the hilt of his lightsaber.

Routila’s confident expression twisted into a blend of hopeful optimism and pure fear at the sight of the Dark Lord above him.

“You have lived your life in that cave, surrounded by those who look to you for guidance… Are you going to die in a place where you are despised, Jedi?”

Invictus hated Routila, as any Sith should, but the two warriors had fought on numerous occasions.
Respect was inevitable one day.

“Someone is.” replied the old Jedi, as a hopeful green flash burst from within his hilt, only to be rivalled by the sickening blood red blade of the Sith erupting like fresh magma.

Within a fraction of a second, Routila sprang upwards to the top of the staircase, and adopted a defensive stance as Invictus sent a barrage of sweeping attacks at the Jedi Master, who countered them with his own forceful flurry of blows.
Both Jedi and Sith seemed to fade from reality, leaving behind a swirling mass of green and red flashes, accompanied by roars of anger and the deafening clashing of blades.

The two warriors ferociously fought back and forth on the platform, each cut and thrust met by the other’s impenetrable parry or block.
As the two enemies moved through the courtyard, several pillars would crumble on the ground, the result of a wayward swing cutting them down.

Routila was abruptly knocked from the platform as a large chunk of rock was sent spinning through the air at him by Invictus, making contact with the Jedi’s torso.

Invictus wasted no time, diving head first to the ground where Routila had landed, his outstretched lightsaber narrowly missing Routila’s head as the Jedi deflected the attack, kicking the Sith from the ground and sending him barreling over him.

Sliding down the rocks to the bank of a stagnant pond, their blades clashed yet again, each warrior slamming them together like a blacksmith’s hammer on durasteel.
The duel progressed throughout the landscape surrounding the temple, with a well placed kick to Routila’s chest sending the Jedi into the water below.

The bitter enemies collided in a Saber lock at the other side of the water, and Invictus’ eyes of fiery orange pierced the green of Routila’s gaze, the Jedi’s superhuman size and strength bearing down on the Sith like an avalanche.

“I will not let any more minds be corrupted by evil!” proclaimed Routila, pushing the Sith into the soil, before stepping back from the soul-eating cold that emanated from Invictus.

“You call yourself righteous, Jedi!
You are vermin, and like any vermin, I will be your exterminator” screamed Invictus, who bludgeoned at Routila’s defences as the two continued to battle through the tunnels of Dathomir’s landscape.

The fight had continued on far longer than Invictus had realised, and it had now exited the tunnel and began to devastate the ridges of the hills and mountain passes that the two warriors stood on.

An exhausted Routila continued to dodge and weave between Invictus’ lightning fast Makashi strikes, drawing on both the light and dark sides of the Force to propel his Niman fighting style to unparalleled speeds.
Both men, acrobatic and strong.
Both men were beyond masters of their form.

Invictus, with youth on his side, began to spot small gaps in Routila’s defence, with the two century old Jedi Master beginning to show his age.

Both men made one last dive at each other, Invictus spinning like a whirlwind of blood, and Routila a beacon of hope, before both warriors felt a searing pain in their chests.

Routila had made contact with the Sith’s body, swinging the blade past his face, Routila and Invictus flipped backwards before both letting out a blood curdling warcry.
Kel lunged at him before plunging his lightsaber into Invictus’ guts with a defiant roar.

However, he too had suffered a direct hit, one that Invictus had planted directly into his chest, evaporating one of his hearts and rupturing every other organ in his torso.

A wincing Invictus rose over the Jedi Master, who was now on one knee, clutching at his chest wound.
Staring at the defeated Routila, Invictus raised his blade in the air, as the Jedi muttered “There is… no death… there is only… the Force”.

The Sith Lord, for the first time in his life, responded with one tiny fragment of mercy, swiftly bringing the blood red blade down at Routila’s neck, before the Jedi’s head hit the floor.

Kel Routila was dead.

“Your faith in the light was misplaced, Routila” remarked Invictus, as he pulled Routila’s hilt to his hand with the Force.
In a sentimental moment, Invictus bowed to the Jedi’s corpse, before kicking it down to the rocks below.

Slowly making his way back to the Temple, Invictus hung Routila’s lightsaber on his waist, the weapon that had defeated so many of his kind, this weapon was symbolic, the rivalry between the two had finally come to an end.
Invictus mumbled under his breath as he staggered inside the temple, “Do not fear the Jedi, but be on guard for Routila.”
